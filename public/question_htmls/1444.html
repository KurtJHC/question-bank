          <strong>Gallipoli</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On 25 April 1915, Australian soldiers landed at what is now called Anzac Cove on the Gallipoli Peninsula. For the vast majority of the 16,000 Australians and New Zealanders who landed on that first day, this was their first experience of combat. 1 ………… . The Gallipoli campaign was hence, a military failure. However, the traits that were shown there – bravery, ingenuity, endurance and mateship – have become enshrined as defining aspects of the Australian character. Official war correspondent, Charles Bean wrote that: “It lay in the mettle of the men themselves. To be the sort of man who would give way when his mates were trusting to his firmness … to live the rest of his life haunted by the knowledge that he had set his hand to a soldier’s task and had lacked the grit to carry it through – that was the prospect these men could not face. Life was very dear, but life was not worth living unless they could be true to their idea of Australian manhood.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The British had been trying to force their way through the narrow straits known as the Dardanelles to capture Istanbul in Turkey. This would relieve pressure on their Russian allies engaged with Ottoman (Turkish) forces in the Caucasus. Minefields and on-shore artillery batteries thwarted the early naval attempts to seize the strait. 2 ………… .&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>British and French forces landed at Cape Helles on the southern tip of the peninsula. The Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) included the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Australian Brigades along with the 1st New Zealand Brigade as well as artillery units from the British Indian Army. 3 ………… . However, in the early morning darkness it is possible that they were beached one kilometre or so north of their planned objective. This was an area of steep, rugged terrain.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Once on the beach, many units became separated from one another as they began moving up the tangle of complex spurs and ravines in the darkness. Turkish resistance remained strong. As a result, the Anzacs were subjected to devastating artillery bombardments. By mid-morning Turkish reinforcements had arrived under Mustapha Kemal (later Kemal Ataturk, president of Turkey). 4 ………… . In the time it takes us to die, other troops and commanders can come and take our places.” The Anzac position became progressively more precarious as the Anzacs failed to secure their high-ground objectives. The Turks then mounted a fierce counter-attack, regaining much of the ground the Anzacs had taken.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That evening, Major-General William Bridges, commander of the 1st Australian Division, and Lieutenant-General Sir William Birdwood, commander of ANZAC, both advised General Sir Ian Hamilton, Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean&nbsp;Expeditionary Force, that the Allied force be withdrawn from the peninsula. After consultation with the Royal Navy, Hamilton decided against an evacuation, and ordered the troops to dig in. Falling back on improvised and shallow entrenchments, the Anzacs held on for a crucial first night. By that first evening 16,000 men had been landed but more than 2000 had been killed or wounded. 5 ………… . The British and French forces farther south were also unable to break out of their positions.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>By November, with more Turkish reinforcements and German equipment in place, it was obvious the stalemate would continue. 6 ………… . He recommended to the British Cabinet that a general evacuation take place. In late December, the Anzacs were successfully evacuated with barely any casualties, and by 20 January 1916, all Allied troops had withdrawn from the peninsula. The battles fought by the Australian Imperial Force at Gallipoli are widely regarded as the foundation legend of Australian military history, and a potent symbol of federated Australia. The Gallipoli campaign was a military failure but the characteristics that the Anzacs displayed throughout the campaign – bravery, ingenuity, endurance and mateship – have come to be celebrated as defining characteristics of the Australian personality.</p>

          <strong>Gallipoli</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On 25 April 1915, Australian soldiers landed at what is now called Anzac Cove on the Gallipoli Peninsula. For the vast majority of the 16,000 Australians and New Zealanders who landed on that first day, this was their first experience of combat. 1 ………… . The Gallipoli campaign was hence, a military failure. However, the traits that were shown there – bravery, ingenuity, endurance and mateship – have become enshrined as defining aspects of the Australian character. Official war correspondent, Charles Bean wrote that: “It lay in the mettle of the men themselves. To be the sort of man who would give way when his mates were trusting to his firmness … to live the rest of his life haunted by the knowledge that he had set his hand to a soldier’s task and had lacked the grit to carry it through – that was the prospect these men could not face. Life was very dear, but life was not worth living unless they could be true to their idea of Australian manhood.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The British had been trying to force their way through the narrow straits known as the Dardanelles to capture Istanbul in Turkey. This would relieve pressure on their Russian allies engaged with Ottoman (Turkish) forces in the Caucasus. Minefields and on-shore artillery batteries thwarted the early naval attempts to seize the strait. 2 ………… .&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>British and French forces landed at Cape Helles on the southern tip of the peninsula. The Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) included the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Australian Brigades along with the 1st New Zealand Brigade as well as artillery units from the British Indian Army. 3 ………… . However, in the early morning darkness it is possible that they were beached one kilometre or so north of their planned objective. This was an area of steep, rugged terrain.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Once on the beach, many units became separated from one another as they began moving up the tangle of complex spurs and ravines in the darkness. Turkish resistance remained strong. As a result, the Anzacs were subjected to devastating artillery bombardments. By mid-morning Turkish reinforcements had arrived under Mustapha Kemal (later Kemal Ataturk, president of Turkey). 4 ………… . In the time it takes us to die, other troops and commanders can come and take our places.” The Anzac position became progressively more precarious as the Anzacs failed to secure their high-ground objectives. The Turks then mounted a fierce counter-attack, regaining much of the ground the Anzacs had taken.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That evening, Major-General William Bridges, commander of the 1st Australian Division, and Lieutenant-General Sir William Birdwood, commander of ANZAC, both advised General Sir Ian Hamilton, Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean&nbsp;Expeditionary Force, that the Allied force be withdrawn from the peninsula. After consultation with the Royal Navy, Hamilton decided against an evacuation, and ordered the troops to dig in. Falling back on improvised and shallow entrenchments, the Anzacs held on for a crucial first night. By that first evening 16,000 men had been landed but more than 2000 had been killed or wounded. 5 ………… . The British and French forces farther south were also unable to break out of their positions.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>By November, with more Turkish reinforcements and German equipment in place, it was obvious the stalemate would continue. 6 ………… . He recommended to the British Cabinet that a general evacuation take place. In late December, the Anzacs were successfully evacuated with barely any casualties, and by 20 January 1916, all Allied troops had withdrawn from the peninsula. The battles fought by the Australian Imperial Force at Gallipoli are widely regarded as the foundation legend of Australian military history, and a potent symbol of federated Australia. The Gallipoli campaign was a military failure but the characteristics that the Anzacs displayed throughout the campaign – bravery, ingenuity, endurance and mateship – have come to be celebrated as defining characteristics of the Australian personality.</p>

        <p><strong>Chris Barnard – </strong>the first surgeon to perform a heart transplant&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In 1967, an obscure cardiac surgeon in South Africa became an instant household name. The name Christiaan Barnard was indelibly linked to a feat once thought impossible – transplanting the human heart. Christiaan Barnard was born in 1922 in South Africa. He graduated in 1946 from the University of Cape Town Medical School. After an internship at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, he worked as a general practitioner in the rural town of Ceres. In 1951, Barnard won a scholarship for postgraduate training in cardiothoracic surgery at the University of Minnesota in the United States (US). There, he learnt to surgically correct congenital heart defects. <strong>1 ………… . </strong>There he established Groote Schuur Hospital’s first heart unit and soon headed its Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery.</p>

        <p>In 1964, Barnard began working with canine kidney transplants. He spent three months with kidney transplant surgeon David Hume at the Medical College of Virginia in the US.<strong> 2 ………… . </strong>He also began experimenting with canine heart transplants with the help of gifted laboratory technician Hamilton Naki, a South African man. Near the end of the 19th century, famed British physician, Sir James Paget was quoted as saying: “Surgery of the heart has probably reached the limits set by nature to all surgery.” Yet, less than a century later, pioneering research in heart transplant surgery had begun in earnest. South Africa raced to become the first in line.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For his first attempt at a heart transplant, Barnard selected as the recipient Louis Washkansky, a 54-year-old grocer with severe coronary artery disease. Then on 2 December 1967, opportunity came with the tragedy of 25-year-old Denise Darvall. <strong>3 ………… .</strong> Barnard’s transplant team gained permission from Darvall’s father to use her heart. The entire procedure took nine hours and involved a team of 30 professionals. The recipient patient only lived 18 days with his new heart, succumbing to pneumonia while on a hefty immunosuppressive regimen. His short survival prompted doubts about the true value of the procedure. Critics felt Barnard did not deserve the acclaim when Dr Shumway (American) had done the bulk of the background research.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Barnard became an overnight international celebrity. A New York Times article captured public sentiment with these words: “The world was startled to learn that the human heart, traditional seat of the emotions, home of the soul, symbol of love, could be transplanted from one person to another as though it were nothing more than a complicated piece of plumbing.” Barnard’s picture graced the covers of magazines such as Time, and he accepted invitations worldwide to meet dignitaries and heads of states. One of his colleagues summed up Barnard’s complex character&nbsp;in these words: “He was then, at once, rough-at-the-edges poor boy and charming sophisticate, democrat and tyrant, selfless healer and boorish egotist, lover and Don Juan, shrewd but naive acceptor of glitterati adulation. <strong>4 ………… .</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Barnard’s next transplant candidate was 59-year-old dentist, Philip Blaiberg. He modified the surgical technique and added antilymphocyte serum to the posttransplant immunosuppressive procedure. Blaiberg lived for 19 months after his transplant. <strong>5 …………</strong> . However, Blaiberg’s daughter asserted after his death, “My father’s life was hell after the transplant. He suffered terribly all the time, but the world was cheering for a medical miracle and did not know.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Barnard continued to perform transplants, but only ten were done in the following five years. His fifth patient lived for another 13 years and his sixth 23 years. He then took on heterotopic transplantation, where only the diseased portion of the recipient’s heart was removed. He performed some 49 procedures over a nine-year period, but the results were mixed. <strong>6 ………… . </strong>Heart transplant recipients today enjoy a oneyear survival rate of over 80% and five-year survival of about 70%.</p>

        <p><strong>Chris Barnard – </strong>the first surgeon to perform a heart transplant&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In 1967, an obscure cardiac surgeon in South Africa became an instant household name. The name Christiaan Barnard was indelibly linked to a feat once thought impossible – transplanting the human heart. Christiaan Barnard was born in 1922 in South Africa. He graduated in 1946 from the University of Cape Town Medical School. After an internship at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, he worked as a general practitioner in the rural town of Ceres. In 1951, Barnard won a scholarship for postgraduate training in cardiothoracic surgery at the University of Minnesota in the United States (US). There, he learnt to surgically correct congenital heart defects. <strong>1 ………… . </strong>There he established Groote Schuur Hospital’s first heart unit and soon headed its Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>Chris Barnard – </strong>the first surgeon to perform a heart transplant&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In 1967, an obscure cardiac surgeon in South Africa became an instant household name. The name Christiaan Barnard was indelibly linked to a feat once thought impossible – transplanting the human heart. Christiaan Barnard was born in 1922 in South Africa. He graduated in 1946 from the University of Cape Town Medical School. After an internship at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, he worked as a general practitioner in the rural town of Ceres. In 1951, Barnard won a scholarship for postgraduate training in cardiothoracic surgery at the University of Minnesota in the United States (US). There, he learnt to surgically correct congenital heart defects. <strong>1 ………… . </strong>There he established Groote Schuur Hospital’s first heart unit and soon headed its Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In 1964, Barnard began working with canine kidney transplants. He spent three months with kidney transplant surgeon David Hume at the Medical College of Virginia in the US.<strong> 2 ………… . </strong>He also began experimenting with canine heart transplants with the help of gifted laboratory technician Hamilton Naki, a South African man. Near the end of the 19th century, famed British physician, Sir James Paget was quoted as saying: “Surgery of the heart has probably reached the limits set by nature to all surgery.” Yet, less than a century later, pioneering research in heart transplant surgery had begun in earnest. South Africa raced to become the first in line.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For his first attempt at a heart transplant, Barnard selected as the recipient Louis Washkansky, a 54-year-old grocer with severe coronary artery disease. Then on 2 December 1967, opportunity came with the tragedy of 25-year-old Denise Darvall. <strong>3 ………… .</strong> Barnard’s transplant team gained permission from Darvall’s father to use her heart. The entire procedure took nine hours and involved a team of 30 professionals. The recipient patient only lived 18 days with his new heart, succumbing to pneumonia while on a hefty immunosuppressive regimen. His short survival prompted doubts about the true value of the procedure. Critics felt Barnard did not deserve the acclaim when Dr Shumway (American) had done the bulk of the background research.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Barnard became an overnight international celebrity. A New York Times article captured public sentiment with these words: “The world was startled to learn that the human heart, traditional seat of the emotions, home of the soul, symbol of love, could be transplanted from one person to another as though it were nothing more than a complicated piece of plumbing.” Barnard’s picture graced the covers of magazines such as Time, and he accepted invitations worldwide to meet dignitaries and heads of states. One of his colleagues summed up Barnard’s complex character&nbsp;in these words: “He was then, at once, rough-at-the-edges poor boy and charming sophisticate, democrat and tyrant, selfless healer and boorish egotist, lover and Don Juan, shrewd but naive acceptor of glitterati adulation. <strong>4 ………… .</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Barnard’s next transplant candidate was 59-year-old dentist, Philip Blaiberg. He modified the surgical technique and added antilymphocyte serum to the posttransplant immunosuppressive procedure. Blaiberg lived for 19 months after his transplant. <strong>5 …………</strong> . However, Blaiberg’s daughter asserted after his death, “My father’s life was hell after the transplant. He suffered terribly all the time, but the world was cheering for a medical miracle and did not know.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Barnard continued to perform transplants, but only ten were done in the following five years. His fifth patient lived for another 13 years and his sixth 23 years. He then took on heterotopic transplantation, where only the diseased portion of the recipient’s heart was removed. He performed some 49 procedures over a nine-year period, but the results were mixed. <strong>6 ………… . </strong>Heart transplant recipients today enjoy a oneyear survival rate of over 80% and five-year survival of about 70%.</p>

However, Blaiberg’s daughter asserted after his death, “My father’s life was hell after the transplant. He suffered terribly all the time, but the world was cheering for a medical miracle and did not know.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Barnard continued to perform transplants, but only ten were done in the following five years. His fifth patient lived for another 13 years and his sixth 23 years. He then took on heterotopic transplantation, where only the diseased portion of the recipient’s heart was removed. He performed some 49 procedures over a nine-year period, but the results were mixed. <strong>6 ………… . </strong>Heart transplant recipients today enjoy a oneyear survival rate of over 80% and five-year survival of about 70%.</p>

        <p><strong>Chris Barnard – </strong>the first surgeon to perform a heart transplant&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In 1967, an obscure cardiac surgeon in South Africa became an instant household name. The name Christiaan Barnard was indelibly linked to a feat once thought impossible – transplanting the human heart. Christiaan Barnard was born in 1922 in South Africa. He graduated in 1946 from the University of Cape Town Medical School. After an internship at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, he worked as a general practitioner in the rural town of Ceres. In 1951, Barnard won a scholarship for postgraduate training in cardiothoracic surgery at the University of Minnesota in the United States (US). There, he learnt to surgically correct congenital heart defects. <strong>1 ………… . </strong>There he established Groote Schuur Hospital’s first heart unit and soon headed its Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In 1964, Barnard began working with canine kidney transplants. He spent three months with kidney transplant surgeon David Hume at the Medical College of Virginia in the US.<strong> 2 ………… . </strong>He also began experimenting with canine heart transplants with the help of gifted laboratory technician Hamilton Naki, a South African man. Near the end of the 19th century, famed British physician, Sir James Paget was quoted as saying: “Surgery of the heart has probably reached the limits set by nature to all surgery.” Yet, less than a century later, pioneering research in heart transplant surgery had begun in earnest. South Africa raced to become the first in line.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For his first attempt at a heart transplant, Barnard selected as the recipient Louis Washkansky, a 54-year-old grocer with severe coronary artery disease. Then on 2 December 1967, opportunity came with the tragedy of 25-year-old Denise Darvall. <strong>3 ………… .</strong> Barnard’s transplant team gained permission from Darvall’s father to use her heart. The entire procedure took nine hours and involved a team of 30 professionals. The recipient patient only lived 18 days with his new heart, succumbing to pneumonia while on a hefty immunosuppressive regimen. His short survival prompted doubts about the true value of the procedure. Critics felt Barnard did not deserve the acclaim when Dr Shumway (American) had done the bulk of the background research.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Barnard became an overnight international celebrity. A New York Times article captured public sentiment with these words: “The world was startled to learn that the human heart, traditional seat of the emotions, home of the soul, symbol of love, could be transplanted from one person to another as though it were nothing more than a complicated piece of plumbing.” Barnard’s picture graced the covers of magazines such as Time, and he accepted invitations worldwide to meet dignitaries and heads of states. One of his colleagues summed up Barnard’s complex character&nbsp;in these words: “He was then, at once, rough-at-the-edges poor boy and charming sophisticate, democrat and tyrant, selfless healer and boorish egotist, lover and Don Juan, shrewd but naive acceptor of glitterati adulation. <strong>4 ………… .</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Barnard’s next transplant candidate was 59-year-old dentist, Philip Blaiberg. He modified the surgical technique and added antilymphocyte serum to the posttransplant immunosuppressive procedure. Blaiberg lived for 19 months after his transplant. <strong>5 …………</strong> . However, Blaiberg’s daughter asserted after his death, “My father’s life was hell after the transplant. He suffered terribly all the time, but the world was cheering for a medical miracle and did not know.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Barnard continued to perform transplants, but only ten were done in the following five years. His fifth patient lived for another 13 years and his sixth 23 years. He then took on heterotopic transplantation, where only the diseased portion of the recipient’s heart was removed. He performed some 49 procedures over a nine-year period, but the results were mixed. <strong>6 ………… . </strong>Heart transplant recipients today enjoy a oneyear survival rate of over 80% and five-year survival of about 70%.</p>

        <p><strong>Chris Barnard – </strong>the first surgeon to perform a heart transplant&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In 1967, an obscure cardiac surgeon in South Africa became an instant household name. The name Christiaan Barnard was indelibly linked to a feat once thought impossible – transplanting the human heart. Christiaan Barnard was born in 1922 in South Africa. He graduated in 1946 from the University of Cape Town Medical School. After an internship at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, he worked as a general practitioner in the rural town of Ceres. In 1951, Barnard won a scholarship for postgraduate training in cardiothoracic surgery at the University of Minnesota in the United States (US). There, he learnt to surgically correct congenital heart defects. <strong>1 ………… . </strong>There he established Groote Schuur Hospital’s first heart unit and soon headed its Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In 1964, Barnard began working with canine kidney transplants. He spent three months with kidney transplant surgeon David Hume at the Medical College of Virginia in the US.<strong> 2 ………… . </strong>He also began experimenting with canine heart transplants with the help of gifted laboratory technician Hamilton Naki, a South African man. Near the end of the 19th century, famed British physician, Sir James Paget was quoted as saying: “Surgery of the heart has probably reached the limits set by nature to all surgery.” Yet, less than a century later, pioneering research in heart transplant surgery had begun in earnest. South Africa raced to become the first in line.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For his first attempt at a heart transplant, Barnard selected as the recipient Louis Washkansky, a 54-year-old grocer with severe coronary artery disease. Then on 2 December 1967, opportunity came with the tragedy of 25-year-old Denise Darvall. <strong>3 ………… .</strong> Barnard’s transplant team gained permission from Darvall’s father to use her heart. The entire procedure took nine hours and involved a team of 30 professionals. The recipient patient only lived 18 days with his new heart, succumbing to pneumonia while on a hefty immunosuppressive regimen. His short survival prompted doubts about the true value of the procedure. Critics felt Barnard did not deserve the acclaim when Dr Shumway (American) had done the bulk of the background research.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Barnard became an overnight international celebrity. A New York Times article captured public sentiment with these words: “The world was startled to learn that the human heart, traditional seat of the emotions, home of the soul, symbol of love, could be transplanted from one person to another as though it were nothing more than a complicated piece of plumbing.” Barnard’s picture graced the covers of magazines such as Time, and he accepted invitations worldwide to meet dignitaries and heads of states. One of his colleagues summed up Barnard’s complex character&nbsp;in these words: “He was then, at once, rough-at-the-edges poor boy and charming sophisticate, democrat and tyrant, selfless healer and boorish egotist, lover and Don Juan, shrewd but naive acceptor of glitterati adulation. <strong>4 ………… .</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Barnard’s next transplant candidate was 59-year-old dentist, Philip Blaiberg. He modified the surgical technique and added antilymphocyte serum to the posttransplant immunosuppressive procedure. Blaiberg lived for 19 months after his transplant. <strong>5 …………</strong> . However, Blaiberg’s daughter asserted after his death, “My father’s life was hell after the transplant. He suffered terribly all the time, but the world was cheering for a medical miracle and did not know.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Barnard continued to perform transplants, but only ten were done in the following five years. His fifth patient lived for another 13 years and his sixth 23 years. He then took on heterotopic transplantation, where only the diseased portion of the recipient’s heart was removed. He performed some 49 procedures over a nine-year period, but the results were mixed. <strong>6 ………… . </strong>Heart transplant recipients today enjoy a oneyear survival rate of over 80% and five-year survival of about 70%.</p>

        <p>
          <em>Read the extract below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Extract A&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Do you give much thought to whether you are an “includer” by nature – or not? This is something we can easily fail to develop in ourselves and may not value or develop in our children. Yet the capacity and willingness to think about others and include them makes a profound difference for people of all ages. It could be a child at pre-school who is willing to share, an adult at a party who keeps an eye out for anyone standing on their own, or a colleague who will take the time to show a newcomer around the workplace. In so many situations a moment of generosity and thoughtfulness can make all the difference between someone feeling like an outsider, with all the agonies that can produce, and feeling included.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The image of a child standing alone in a crowded playground, without the protection of company and friends, haunts many adults. Feeling included is vital for our emotional health and wellbeing and it will affect dramatically how we think about other people as well as ourselves. Because most of us underestimate our own personal power and overestimate other people’s, we are likely to spend far more time worrying about being left out rather than whether and how we are including others.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Extract B&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>A sense of place is one of the most important pillars of our psyche, providing the base from which we grow and develop. My own sense of place is profoundly linked with the area I grew up in, the Grampians mountainous area. Right now it is one of my favourite times of the year there—the depths of winter— and I have spent the last three weekends in its green and brown embrace. Granted, trekking through a damp forest is not everyone’s cup of tea, and I’ve had the tracks largely to myself. It's been cold and sometimes wet, but also glorious.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When things go wrong here it makes me angry. I don't like it when great strips of land are bulldozed to protect private property from fires, and I don't like the many fire tracks that criss-cross the landscape and break up the wilderness— the legacy of a different era. I hate the rubbish people sometimes leave behind. It makes me angry because I feel a strong sense of belonging to the Grampians, this beautiful strip of mountains on a shimmering Wimmera plain, home of so many happy memories from the weekends and years spent amongst its rocky places.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Extract C&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Think of a favourite lullaby or children’s song passed down through the generations, or of crowds listening to the national anthem at a baseball game. Music is one way of communicating belonging, which may increase your sense of safety and obligation toward your group. When we discover that someone likes a piece of music that we like, we tend to think better of them—as if musical preference had a deeper meaning than just entertainment. Music also influences how we think others will get along. In one recent study, participants listened to music or to silence while they watched videos in which three people were seen walking either in step or out of step with one another. The participants who listened to music reported seeing a greater sense of unity among the walkers than those participants who didn’t listen to music. This suggests that music somehow enhances our view of social cohesion among people, perhaps through mistaking our own feelings for those of the people we observe.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Extract D&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>I get my Larrakia and Tiwi blood from my mother. My mum was, and still is, a staunch Aboriginal woman who loved her family fiercely. I get my predominantly Irish Roman Catholic heritage from my father. Dad is extremely affectionate and has a very good sense of humour, even if his jokes can be stereotypically Dad-like. At home I’ve never had to choose between my mother’s Aboriginality or my father’s European ancestry. My background doesn’t dilute my lived experience or diminish my identity.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They say it takes a village to raise a child and that was certainly my experience. My grandparents, uncles and aunties always stepped in to babysit when my parents needed them to. My mother would take me out to protest meetings, the Larrakia having one of the longest ongoing land claims in Australia. Larrakia country covers most of the Darwin region. Many of the pictures of me as a baby were taken on a tarpaulin or a swag out bush when my family were camping or fishing.</p>

        <p>Do you give much thought to whether you are an “includer” by nature – or not? This is something we can easily fail to develop in ourselves and may not value or develop in our children. Yet the capacity and willingness to think about others and include them makes a profound difference for people of all ages. It could be a child at pre-school who is willing to share, an adult at a party who keeps an eye out for anyone standing on their own, or a colleague who will take the time to show a newcomer around the workplace. In so many situations a moment of generosity and thoughtfulness can make all the difference between someone feeling like an outsider, with all the agonies that can produce, and feeling included.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The image of a child standing alone in a crowded playground, without the protection of company and friends, haunts many adults. Feeling included is vital for our emotional health and wellbeing and it will affect dramatically how we think about other people as well as ourselves. Because most of us underestimate our own personal power and overestimate other people’s, we are likely to spend far more time worrying about being left out rather than whether and how we are including others.</p>

          <strong>Extract B&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>A sense of place is one of the most important pillars of our psyche, providing the base from which we grow and develop. My own sense of place is profoundly linked with the area I grew up in, the Grampians mountainous area. Right now it is one of my favourite times of the year there—the depths of winter— and I have spent the last three weekends in its green and brown embrace. Granted, trekking through a damp forest is not everyone’s cup of tea, and I’ve had the tracks largely to myself. It's been cold and sometimes wet, but also glorious.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When things go wrong here it makes me angry. I don't like it when great strips of land are bulldozed to protect private property from fires, and I don't like the many fire tracks that criss-cross the landscape and break up the wilderness— the legacy of a different era. I hate the rubbish people sometimes leave behind. It makes me angry because I feel a strong sense of belonging to the Grampians, this beautiful strip of mountains on a shimmering Wimmera plain, home of so many happy memories from the weekends and years spent amongst its rocky places.</p>

        </p>
        <p>I get my Larrakia and Tiwi blood from my mother. My mum was, and still is, a staunch Aboriginal woman who loved her family fiercely. I get my predominantly Irish Roman Catholic heritage from my father. Dad is extremely affectionate and has a very good sense of humour, even if his jokes can be stereotypically Dad-like. At home I’ve never had to choose between my mother’s Aboriginality or my father’s European ancestry. My background doesn’t dilute my lived experience or diminish my identity.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They say it takes a village to raise a child and that was certainly my experience. My grandparents, uncles and aunties always stepped in to babysit when my parents needed them to. My mother would take me out to protest meetings, the Larrakia having one of the longest ongoing land claims in Australia. Larrakia country covers most of the Darwin region. Many of the pictures of me as a baby were taken on a tarpaulin or a swag out bush when my family were camping or fishing.</p>

This suggests that music somehow enhances our view of social cohesion among people, perhaps through mistaking our own feelings for those of the people we observe.</p>

        <p>Do you give much thought to whether you are an “includer” by nature – or not? This is something we can easily fail to develop in ourselves and may not value or develop in our children. Yet the capacity and willingness to think about others and include them makes a profound difference for people of all ages. It could be a child at pre-school who is willing to share, an adult at a party who keeps an eye out for anyone standing on their own, or a colleague who will take the time to show a newcomer around the workplace. In so many situations a moment of generosity and thoughtfulness can make all the difference between someone feeling like an outsider, with all the agonies that can produce, and feeling included.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The image of a child standing alone in a crowded playground, without the protection of company and friends, haunts many adults. Feeling included is vital for our emotional health and wellbeing and it will affect dramatically how we think about other people as well as ourselves. Because most of us underestimate our own personal power and overestimate other people’s, we are likely to spend far more time worrying about being left out rather than whether and how we are including others.</p>

        </p>
        <p>A sense of place is one of the most important pillars of our psyche, providing the base from which we grow and develop. My own sense of place is profoundly linked with the area I grew up in, the Grampians mountainous area. Right now it is one of my favourite times of the year there—the depths of winter— and I have spent the last three weekends in its green and brown embrace. Granted, trekking through a damp forest is not everyone’s cup of tea, and I’ve had the tracks largely to myself. It's been cold and sometimes wet, but also glorious.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When things go wrong here it makes me angry. I don't like it when great strips of land are bulldozed to protect private property from fires, and I don't like the many fire tracks that criss-cross the landscape and break up the wilderness— the legacy of a different era. I hate the rubbish people sometimes leave behind. It makes me angry because I feel a strong sense of belonging to the Grampians, this beautiful strip of mountains on a shimmering Wimmera plain, home of so many happy memories from the weekends and years spent amongst its rocky places.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Think of a favourite lullaby or children’s song passed down through the generations, or of crowds listening to the national anthem at a baseball game. Music is one way of communicating belonging, which may increase your sense of safety and obligation toward your group. When we discover that someone likes a piece of music that we like, we tend to think better of them—as if musical preference had a deeper meaning than just entertainment. Music also influences how we think others will get along. In one recent study, participants listened to music or to silence while they watched videos in which three people were seen walking either in step or out of step with one another. The participants who listened to music reported seeing a greater sense of unity among the walkers than those participants who didn’t listen to music.

        <p>A sense of place is one of the most important pillars of our psyche, providing the base from which we grow and develop. My own sense of place is profoundly linked with the area I grew up in, the Grampians mountainous area. Right now it is one of my favourite times of the year there—the depths of winter— and I have spent the last three weekends in its green and brown embrace. Granted, trekking through a damp forest is not everyone’s cup of tea, and I’ve had the tracks largely to myself. It's been cold and sometimes wet, but also glorious.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When things go wrong here it makes me angry. I don't like it when great strips of land are bulldozed to protect private property from fires, and I don't like the many fire tracks that criss-cross the landscape and break up the wilderness— the legacy of a different era. I hate the rubbish people sometimes leave behind. It makes me angry because I feel a strong sense of belonging to the Grampians, this beautiful strip of mountains on a shimmering Wimmera plain, home of so many happy memories from the weekends and years spent amongst its rocky places.</p>

        <p>Think of a favourite lullaby or children’s song passed down through the generations, or of crowds listening to the national anthem at a baseball game. Music is one way of communicating belonging, which may increase your sense of safety and obligation toward your group. When we discover that someone likes a piece of music that we like, we tend to think better of them—as if musical preference had a deeper meaning than just entertainment. Music also influences how we think others will get along. In one recent study, participants listened to music or to silence while they watched videos in which three people were seen walking either in step or out of step with one another. The participants who listened to music reported seeing a greater sense of unity among the walkers than those participants who didn’t listen to music. This suggests that music somehow enhances our view of social cohesion among people, perhaps through mistaking our own feelings for those of the people we observe.</p>

        <p>I get my Larrakia and Tiwi blood from my mother. My mum was, and still is, a staunch Aboriginal woman who loved her family fiercely. I get my predominantly Irish Roman Catholic heritage from my father. Dad is extremely affectionate and has a very good sense of humour, even if his jokes can be stereotypically Dad-like. At home I’ve never had to choose between my mother’s Aboriginality or my father’s European ancestry. My background doesn’t dilute my lived experience or diminish my identity.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They say it takes a village to raise a child and that was certainly my experience. My grandparents, uncles and aunties always stepped in to babysit when my parents needed them to. My mother would take me out to protest meetings, the Larrakia having one of the longest ongoing land claims in Australia. Larrakia country covers most of the Darwin region. Many of the pictures of me as a baby were taken on a tarpaulin or a swag out bush when my family were camping or fishing.</p>

        <p>Do you give much thought to whether you are an “includer” by nature – or not? This is something we can easily fail to develop in ourselves and may not value or develop in our children. Yet the capacity and willingness to think about others and include them makes a profound difference for people of all ages. It could be a child at pre-school who is willing to share, an adult at a party who keeps an eye out for anyone standing on their own, or a colleague who will take the time to show a newcomer around the workplace. In so many situations a moment of generosity and thoughtfulness can make all the difference between someone feeling like an outsider, with all the agonies that can produce, and feeling included.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The image of a child standing alone in a crowded playground, without the protection of company and friends, haunts many adults. Feeling included is vital for our emotional health and wellbeing and it will affect dramatically how we think about other people as well as ourselves. Because most of us underestimate our own personal power and overestimate other people’s, we are likely to spend far more time worrying about being left out rather than whether and how we are including others.</p>

        <p>The most amazing discoveries of diamonds were mostly found by accident. The northern Cape in 1867 was a hot and desolate place where Erasmus Jacobs, 15, amused himself by playing with the 'klippies' (small stones) which abounded on their farm, De Kalk, not that far from Kimberley in South Africa. Erasmus was somewhat amused when a neighbour, Schalk van Niekerk, asked if he could borrow one of the play stones which he had found a year earlier - a particularly shiny one. It became known as the Eureka Diamond.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Although Erasmus Jacobs never found another diamond, Schalk van Niekerk was luckier three years later. Having learned something of precious stones, Schalk traded a shepherd boy for a stone, giving him five hundred sheep, ten oxen and a horse. It was practically all of van Niekerk's possessions, but a few days later he sold the rough crystal in Hopetown for £11,200. In 1974, it was sold for 1.6 million Swiss Francs.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In July 1871, a labourer, working for diggers from Colesberg, came to work one Monday morning. His boss told him to ‘run to that hill over there, and don’t come back until you have found diamonds. It wasn’t long before he was back with stones in his hat, among which were three diamonds. This small hillock came to be known, locally, as the Colesberg Kopje. A new rush of diggers descended on what later became known as the De Beers mine, which soon dug out the whole hill, and then continued mining underground the flat terrain.</p>

        <p>The greatest and most important adventure of our lives is discovering who we really are. Yet, so many of us walk around without asking the most important question we’ll ever ask: Who am I really? As Mary Oliver put it, “what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?” Finding yourself may sound like an inherently selfcentred goal, but it is actually an unselfish process that is at the root of everything we do in life and that will benefit others. This personal journey is one every individual will benefit from taking. It is a process that involves breaking down – shedding layers that do not serve us in our lives and don’t reflect who we really are. Yet, it also involves a tremendous act of building up – recognising who we want to be and passionately going about fulfilling our unique destiny – whatever that may be. It’s a matter of recognising our personal power yet being open and vulnerable to our experiences. It isn’t something to fear or avoid, berating ourselves along the way, but rather something to seek out with the curiosity and compassion we would have toward a fascinating new friend.</p>

        <p>Science is all about facts and discoveries, with some of the remarkable breakthroughs coming from seemingly everyday occurrences and experiences. One of the oldest and well-known tales revolves around Archimedes' legendary “Eureka moment” while taking a bath in a tub. This was when he made a remarkable discovery, which is now known as the Archimedes Principle. Supposedly, Archimedes was so thrilled and excited with this discovery that he immediately hopped out of the bath and ran onto the streets to tell the ancient Greek king, shouting loudly 'Eureka! Eureka!' (I have found it! I have found it!), in delight. Archimedes went on to make a number of important contributions in science and mathematics. He was the first to realise that the number Pi features in the formula for the circumference of the circle, the area of the circle, and the volume and area of the sphere (notably, he determined an accurate estimation of the value of Pi).</p>

        <p>The most amazing discoveries of diamonds were mostly found by accident. The northern Cape in 1867 was a hot and desolate place where Erasmus Jacobs, 15, amused himself by playing with the 'klippies' (small stones) which abounded on their farm, De Kalk, not that far from Kimberley in South Africa. Erasmus was somewhat amused when a neighbour, Schalk van Niekerk, asked if he could borrow one of the play stones which he had found a year earlier - a particularly shiny one. It became known as the Eureka Diamond.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Although Erasmus Jacobs never found another diamond, Schalk van Niekerk was luckier three years later. Having learned something of precious stones, Schalk traded a shepherd boy for a stone, giving him five hundred sheep, ten oxen and a horse. It was practically all of van Niekerk's possessions, but a few days later he sold the rough crystal in Hopetown for £11,200. In 1974, it was sold for 1.6 million Swiss Francs.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In July 1871, a labourer, working for diggers from Colesberg, came to work one Monday morning. His boss told him to ‘run to that hill over there, and don’t come back until you have found diamonds. It wasn’t long before he was back with stones in his hat, among which were three diamonds. This small hillock came to be known, locally, as the Colesberg Kopje. A new rush of diggers descended on what later became known as the De Beers mine, which soon dug out the whole hill, and then continued mining underground the flat terrain.</p>

        <p>The greatest and most important adventure of our lives is discovering who we really are. Yet, so many of us walk around without asking the most important question we’ll ever ask: Who am I really? As Mary Oliver put it, “what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?” Finding yourself may sound like an inherently selfcentred goal, but it is actually an unselfish process that is at the root of everything we do in life and that will benefit others. This personal journey is one every individual will benefit from taking. It is a process that involves breaking down – shedding layers that do not serve us in our lives and don’t reflect who we really are. Yet, it also involves a tremendous act of building up – recognising who we want to be and passionately going about fulfilling our unique destiny – whatever that may be. It’s a matter of recognising our personal power yet being open and vulnerable to our experiences. It isn’t something to fear or avoid, berating ourselves along the way, but rather something to seek out with the curiosity and compassion we would have toward a fascinating new friend.</p>

        <p>Science is all about facts and discoveries, with some of the remarkable breakthroughs coming from seemingly everyday occurrences and experiences. One of the oldest and well-known tales revolves around Archimedes' legendary “Eureka moment” while taking a bath in a tub. This was when he made a remarkable discovery, which is now known as the Archimedes Principle. Supposedly, Archimedes was so thrilled and excited with this discovery that he immediately hopped out of the bath and ran onto the streets to tell the ancient Greek king, shouting loudly 'Eureka! Eureka!' (I have found it! I have found it!), in delight. Archimedes went on to make a number of important contributions in science and mathematics. He was the first to realise that the number Pi features in the formula for the circumference of the circle, the area of the circle, and the volume and area of the sphere (notably, he determined an accurate estimation of the value of Pi).</p>

        <p>It’s time to dive into the film, ‘<em>Finding Nemo</em>’ - a hilarious adventure of discovery that takes you into the breathtaking underwater world of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. When Nemo, a young clownfish, is unexpectedly carried far from home, his overprotective father, Marlin, and Dory, a friendly but forgetful regal blue tang fish embark on an epic journey that leads to encounters with vegetarian sharks, surfer dude turtles, hypnotic jellyfish and hungry seagulls!&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘<em>Finding Nemo</em>’ teaches the classic, cartoon Pixar/Disney lessons about the importance of family and discovering acceptance, kindness, and love, but it also an exciting tale of adventure, overcoming adversity, and teamwork. The film is beautiful from start to finish and a truly exceptional technical feat. Finding Nemo sets itself apart from other Disney films by having the whole package: tight storytelling, great characters, winning performances, technical brilliance, laughter, tears, and a very quotable script.</p>

        <p>The most amazing discoveries of diamonds were mostly found by accident. The northern Cape in 1867 was a hot and desolate place where Erasmus Jacobs, 15, amused himself by playing with the 'klippies' (small stones) which abounded on their farm, De Kalk, not that far from Kimberley in South Africa. Erasmus was somewhat amused when a neighbour, Schalk van Niekerk, asked if he could borrow one of the play stones which he had found a year earlier - a particularly shiny one. It became known as the Eureka Diamond.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Although Erasmus Jacobs never found another diamond, Schalk van Niekerk was luckier three years later. Having learned something of precious stones, Schalk traded a shepherd boy for a stone, giving him five hundred sheep, ten oxen and a horse. It was practically all of van Niekerk's possessions, but a few days later he sold the rough crystal in Hopetown for £11,200. In 1974, it was sold for 1.6 million Swiss Francs.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In July 1871, a labourer, working for diggers from Colesberg, came to work one Monday morning. His boss told him to ‘run to that hill over there, and don’t come back until you have found diamonds. It wasn’t long before he was back with stones in his hat, among which were three diamonds. This small hillock came to be known, locally, as the Colesberg Kopje. A new rush of diggers descended on what later became known as the De Beers mine, which soon dug out the whole hill, and then continued mining underground the flat terrain.</p>

        <p>The greatest and most important adventure of our lives is discovering who we really are. Yet, so many of us walk around without asking the most important question we’ll ever ask: Who am I really? As Mary Oliver put it, “what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?” Finding yourself may sound like an inherently selfcentred goal, but it is actually an unselfish process that is at the root of everything we do in life and that will benefit others. This personal journey is one every individual will benefit from taking. It is a process that involves breaking down – shedding layers that do not serve us in our lives and don’t reflect who we really are. Yet, it also involves a tremendous act of building up – recognising who we want to be and passionately going about fulfilling our unique destiny – whatever that may be. It’s a matter of recognising our personal power yet being open and vulnerable to our experiences. It isn’t something to fear or avoid, berating ourselves along the way, but rather something to seek out with the curiosity and compassion we would have toward a fascinating new friend.</p>

        <p>Science is all about facts and discoveries, with some of the remarkable breakthroughs coming from seemingly everyday occurrences and experiences. One of the oldest and well-known tales revolves around Archimedes' legendary “Eureka moment” while taking a bath in a tub. This was when he made a remarkable discovery, which is now known as the Archimedes Principle. Supposedly, Archimedes was so thrilled and excited with this discovery that he immediately hopped out of the bath and ran onto the streets to tell the ancient Greek king, shouting loudly 'Eureka! Eureka!' (I have found it! I have found it!), in delight. Archimedes went on to make a number of important contributions in science and mathematics. He was the first to realise that the number Pi features in the formula for the circumference of the circle, the area of the circle, and the volume and area of the sphere (notably, he determined an accurate estimation of the value of Pi).</p>

        <p>It’s time to dive into the film, ‘<em>Finding Nemo</em>’ - a hilarious adventure of discovery that takes you into the breathtaking underwater world of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. When Nemo, a young clownfish, is unexpectedly carried far from home, his overprotective father, Marlin, and Dory, a friendly but forgetful regal blue tang fish embark on an epic journey that leads to encounters with vegetarian sharks, surfer dude turtles, hypnotic jellyfish and hungry seagulls!&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘<em>Finding Nemo</em>’ teaches the classic, cartoon Pixar/Disney lessons about the importance of family and discovering acceptance, kindness, and love, but it also an exciting tale of adventure, overcoming adversity, and teamwork. The film is beautiful from start to finish and a truly exceptional technical feat. Finding Nemo sets itself apart from other Disney films by having the whole package: tight storytelling, great characters, winning performances, technical brilliance, laughter, tears, and a very quotable script.</p>

          <strong>Extract A&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>On December 5, 1945, five Navy planes took off from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, USA, on a training mission. They flew over the Bermuda Triangle. The men, along with the planes, disappeared and were never seen again. From that day forward, people became fascinated with the Bermuda Triangle. Over the years, numerous ships and aircraft have vanished with no apparent explanation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Are you wondering what the Bermuda Triangle is all about? Can humans ever survive a trip to the Bermuda Triangle? There are many theories that try to explain the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Bermuda Triangle is an area in the Atlantic Ocean that is twice the size of Texas. That's about 500,000 square miles. The Bermuda Triangle has a triangular shape with ends — geometry teachers would call them vertices — in Miami, Florida, Bermuda and Puerto Rico. Within this triangle of water, compasses often act strangely. Most compasses don't point directly north toward the North Pole. Instead, they point to something called “magnetic north", which is in Canada. In the Bermuda Triangle, however, a compass will often point directly to the North Pole. That's mysterious! There are many more mysterious incidents and unexplained disappearances besides these tragic stories. So far, scientists have not come up with clear reasons to explain the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle.</p>

          <strong>Extract B&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Why do oceans and seas matter? We live on a blue planet, with oceans and seas covering more than 70 per cent of the Earth’s surface. Oceans feed us, regulate our climate and generate most of the oxygen we breathe. They also serve as the foundation for much of the world’s economy, supporting sectors from tourism to fisheries to international shipping.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But despite their importance, oceans are facing unprecedented threats as a result of human activity. Every year, an estimated 8 million tonnes of plastic waste end up in the world’s oceans. At the same time, climate change is damaging coral reefs and other key ecosystems; overfishing is threatening the stability of fish stocks; nutrient pollution is contributing to the creation of dead zones; and nearly 80 per cent of the world’s wastewater is discharged without treatment. UN Environment is tackling these challenges head-on. They have initiated several campaigns and work with governments, businesses, universities and civil society groups around the world to promote the protection and sustainable management of our precious marine and coastal environments.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Extract C&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>What lies at the lowest point of the ocean? At the deepest point of the ocean, strange creatures, you have never seen before, thrive. As vast as the planet and undiscovered like space, are the depths of the ocean. While we continue to make progress in biological discoveries, some parts of the ocean are so inaccessible, that we have only discovered a sliver of the truth. But we do know something about the Mariana Trench, the lowest part of the ocean, which surrounds the Mariana islands near Japan.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So, what lies in these treacherously deep, dark waters. Find out if you can afford a scare. Flappy ears, deep-set eyes and eight tiny tentacles; named after the Disney favourite, the Dumbo Octopus is arguably the most eye-soothing sight, found at least 9,800 metres under the sea in the Mariana trench. Hardly spooky, these adorable 8– 12-inch creatures stream through the ocean by flapping their ears. Charming as they may be, the dumbo octopus is a predator that can swallow its prey in one gulp. Then, there’s the Black Seadevil Fish. Any fan of ‘<em>Finding Nemo</em>’ might quickly recognise this fish. Featured as a scary creature in the film, the Black Seadevil is just as terrifying in real life. Sharp teeth, gaping mouth and eyes exploding out of their sockets; this angler fish is known for its luminous antenna-like muscle protruding from its head. This light attracts its prey into close vicinity for an easy catch. These are only two of the amazing creatures of the deepest parts of the ocean.</p>

          <strong>Extract D&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>In our recent National Poetry Day poll, Samuel Coleridge's poetic ballad, "<em>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</em>" was enthusiastically mentioned by several pollsters. It's a poem most people read when young; quickly falling under the powerful spell of its simple ballad rhyme and rhythm, its dramatic storytelling and ever-shifting imagery. <em>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</em> recounts the experiences of a sailor who has returned from a long sea voyage. The mariner (sailor) stops a man who is on his way to a wedding ceremony and begins to narrate a story. The story is about a man on a voyage by ship, who in one impulsive and terrible act, changes the course of his life – and death. The Mariner faces an inner struggle over the crime he has committed and he must understand his actions and perform his penance.&nbsp;</p>
