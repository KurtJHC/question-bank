        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Drought has significantly affected farmers in East Gippsland, Northern Victoria and parts of New South Wales and Queensland, while all other farmers are also affected by the drought to some degree because of increased feed and water costs. Drought can increase the price of feed and deplete water stores for animals and other farm uses. During these times farmers often need to make tough decisions which can affect their health and wellbeing. Climatic variability such as drought presents significant challenges for Australian farmers and their communities, including dairy farmers. Dry conditions can reduce the ability of farmers to grow feed and can also impact the availability and cost of bought in feed. Drought can also deplete water stores for animals and other farm uses. Current dry seasonal conditions across much of Australia have driven up feed and water prices, due to high demand and limited availability. This is impacting all farmers with the cost of grain alone being felt in all agricultural regions. During challenging seasonal conditions, farmers are encouraged to plan ahead and take action to prepare for the season ahead.<br>

Secretary of Agriculture, Claude R. Wickard, himself a farmer, told a meeting of the Future Farmers of America on October 10, 1944: “I like farming. It is a good life. After more than 30 years of it, I still would rather farm than do anything else. I envy you future farmers who have such great things ahead.” Dr. Baker - who may be regarded as a spokesman for the school of farming enthusiasts - said, “I have a son now less than 5 years old, and I hope when he grows up that he will decide to be a farmer.” Dr. Baker’s reasons for wanting his son to be a farmer were as follows. Firstly, a farmer has more and better food to eat than most people who live in cities. Secondly, he is healthier and will probably live longer. Thirdly, he is likely to enjoy his work more than most city people do. And fourthly, he is more likely to rear a family and thereby promote the future welfare of the nation.<br>

Enough food is produced today to feed everyone on the planet, but hunger is on the rise in some parts of the world, and some 821 million people are considered to be “chronically undernourished”. What steps are being taken to ensure that everyone, worldwide, receives sufficient food? Whilst there is no silver bullet to solving hunger, the World Food Programme has outlined a vision that breaks the issue down into five steps. We will look at three of them that focus on food production. Firstly, reduce food waste. Around one third of the food produced each year is loss or wasted, costing the global economy some $1 trillion per year. Secondly, grow a wider variety of crops. Around 60 per cent of all calories consumed come from just four crops: rice, wheat, corn and soy. Ensuring food access and availability in the face of climate change will require the production of a wider range of foods by farmers. And thirdly, focus on using food for child nutrition. Good health and nutrition in a child’s first 1,000 days is essential to prevent stunting and promote healthy development.<br>

So, why and how did I become a farmer? With each passing day, I had a strong urge to break free of the consumerist shackles binding us in its vicious cycle. With every new learning I was moving towards slowly blending my carefully built modern lifestyle with more of the sensible tried and tested ways of life; with just a dash of modern comforts of course, which I can’t live without. When it came to farming, I wanted to do everything with an expert along my side, as we were novices in this field. But I guess that wasn’t part of the grand plan. We would wait and wait for the perfect timing to have an expert by our side to guide us step by step, and somehow it would never materialise. This happened quite a few times before we decided to take things in our own hands and to learn by doing, learn by making mistakes, if that’s what it takes.<br>

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Drought has significantly affected farmers in East Gippsland, Northern Victoria and parts of New South Wales and Queensland, while all other farmers are also affected by the drought to some degree because of increased feed and water costs. Drought can increase the price of feed and deplete water stores for animals and other farm uses. During these times farmers often need to make tough decisions which can affect their health and wellbeing. Climatic variability such as drought presents significant challenges for Australian farmers and their communities, including dairy farmers. Dry conditions can reduce the ability of farmers to grow feed and can also impact the availability and cost of bought in feed. Drought can also deplete water stores for animals and other farm uses. Current dry seasonal conditions across much of Australia have driven up feed and water prices, due to high demand and limited availability. This is impacting all farmers with the cost of grain alone being felt in all agricultural regions. During challenging seasonal conditions, farmers are encouraged to plan ahead and take action to prepare for the season ahead.<br>

Secretary of Agriculture, Claude R. Wickard, himself a farmer, told a meeting of the Future Farmers of America on October 10, 1944: “I like farming. It is a good life. After more than 30 years of it, I still would rather farm than do anything else. I envy you future farmers who have such great things ahead.” Dr. Baker - who may be regarded as a spokesman for the school of farming enthusiasts - said, “I have a son now less than 5 years old, and I hope when he grows up that he will decide to be a farmer.” Dr. Baker’s reasons for wanting his son to be a farmer were as follows. Firstly, a farmer has more and better food to eat than most people who live in cities. Secondly, he is healthier and will probably live longer. Thirdly, he is likely to enjoy his work more than most city people do. And fourthly, he is more likely to rear a family and thereby promote the future welfare of the nation.<br>

Enough food is produced today to feed everyone on the planet, but hunger is on the rise in some parts of the world, and some 821 million people are considered to be “chronically undernourished”. What steps are being taken to ensure that everyone, worldwide, receives sufficient food? Whilst there is no silver bullet to solving hunger, the World Food Programme has outlined a vision that breaks the issue down into five steps. We will look at three of them that focus on food production. Firstly, reduce food waste. Around one third of the food produced each year is loss or wasted, costing the global economy some $1 trillion per year. Secondly, grow a wider variety of crops. Around 60 per cent of all calories consumed come from just four crops: rice, wheat, corn and soy. Ensuring food access and availability in the face of climate change will require the production of a wider range of foods by farmers. And thirdly, focus on using food for child nutrition. Good health and nutrition in a child’s first 1,000 days is essential to prevent stunting and promote healthy development.<br>

So, why and how did I become a farmer? With each passing day, I had a strong urge to break free of the consumerist shackles binding us in its vicious cycle. With every new learning I was moving towards slowly blending my carefully built modern lifestyle with more of the sensible tried and tested ways of life; with just a dash of modern comforts of course, which I can’t live without. When it came to farming, I wanted to do everything with an expert along my side, as we were novices in this field. But I guess that wasn’t part of the grand plan. We would wait and wait for the perfect timing to have an expert by our side to guide us step by step, and somehow it would never materialise. This happened quite a few times before we decided to take things in our own hands and to learn by doing, learn by making mistakes, if that’s what it takes.<br>

        <p>Using this method, he found that some televisions were very close in score, so he decided that if there was only 1 point difference between the top two scores or if there were equal top scores, he would choose the television that was the easiest to use out of the top scorers.</p>

The King's Gallows.<br>
<em>The King's Gallows.</em><br>
<br>
The King's Gallows was a glorious ship. The sides were etched with gold outlining and the flag waved a bloodied crown.<br>
<br>
This ship represented fear of the kingdoms afar. Alas, it was no pirate ship, but an enemy of society. It lived through storms of cold, hurricanes of treachery and maelstroms of burning ash.<br>
<br>
The King's Gallows was not only a symbol of rebellion, but of revolution! It sparked revolts that could scare giants. It destroyed the foundation of society. It created light where there was only dark.<br>
<br>
But this ship, oh this ship. It lived through countless battles with kings of all the lands. It fought against pirates and empires alike. It became battered and bruised to the point where a slight breeze could rip the sails. But this ship, oh this ship. It would keep crossing the seven seas without failure. It would prevail through the toughest of nights and the grittiest of days.<br>
<br>
This ship. This ship was&nbsp;<em>The King’s Gallows</em><br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
She was a beautiful vessel, built to last, but not for war. At thirteen feet stern to bow, she could barely be considered anything but a rowboat. Her hull, while aged, was still clean, with few marks showing where she has run ashore.<br>
<br>
She wasn't built for war. She saw solely the calm waters of peace, brought up shore during times of turbulence. She saw not the cares of a nation, but the cares of a family. She symbolised the lifeblood of those on the coast but saw only the blood of fish.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
The old one stood on the observation deck watching the activities in the bay below. Techs and bots swarmed in the familiar and comforting chaos that is a ship preparing for departure. Once more he would tread the decks of the ship that had brought him to this part of the Arm and first shocked, then changed the Commonwealth. They all might just survive this war after all. The legendary planet called Terra had been found and it changed everything. The ship didn't look much different than a standard heavy shuttle, looked almost more grown than manufactured, certainly not something that changed history. She almost seemed a bit menacing crouched there on her landing struts. It was the matte black colour that did that. The cargo hold ramp under the nose rose and shut now that loading was complete.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong> ^}<br>
Teardrops splattered along the damp sands as they yelled their goodbyes to an old friend, their words barely intelligible over the roaring, crackling flame. They wished their beloved ship well in the next life, apologising for how it had been treated in this one. Much to their surprise, their kind words did not fall upon deaf ears as the Merry herself, expressed profound gratitude and slight regret. She wished that she could have carried them even a mile more, to experience just one last adventure.<br>
<br>
Though he didn't know how to show it, the captain grieved most of all, remembering all the moments that they had shared. He pulled his straw hat down, hoping to veil his lapsing composure as he saw the Going Merry in his mind just as it had been the day, they received it. The modest wooden vessel that sat happily upon the waves, its plain brown exterior further accentuated by a fanciful white trim. Her smiling face, a figurehead of a sheep, at the forefront. The captain's seat.<br>

But this ship, oh this ship. It lived through countless battles with kings of all the lands. It fought against pirates and empires alike.

She was a beautiful vessel, built to last, but not for war. At thirteen feet stern to bow, she could barely be considered anything but a rowboat. Her hull, while aged, was still clean, with few marks showing where she has run ashore.<br>
<br>
She wasn't built for war. She saw solely the calm waters of peace, brought up shore during times of turbulence. She saw not the cares of a nation, but the cares of a family. She symbolised the lifeblood of those on the coast but saw only the blood of fish.<br>

The old one stood on the observation deck watching the activities in the bay below. Techs and bots swarmed in the familiar and comforting chaos that is a ship preparing for departure. Once more he would tread the decks of the ship that had brought him to this part of the Arm and first shocked, then changed the Commonwealth. They all might just survive this war after all. The legendary planet called Terra had been found and it changed everything. The ship didn't look much different than a standard heavy shuttle, looked almost more grown than manufactured, certainly not something that changed history.

Teardrops splattered along the damp sands as they yelled their goodbyes to an old friend, their words barely intelligible over the roaring, crackling flame. They wished their beloved ship well in the next life, apologising for how it had been treated in this one. Much to their surprise, their kind words did not fall upon deaf ears as the Merry herself, expressed profound gratitude and slight regret.

Though he didn't know how to show it, the captain grieved most of all, remembering all the moments that they had shared. He pulled his straw hat down, hoping to veil his lapsing composure as he saw the Going Merry in his mind just as it had been the day, they received it. The modest wooden vessel that sat happily upon the waves, its plain brown exterior further accentuated by a fanciful white trim. Her smiling face, a figurehead of a sheep, at the forefront.
