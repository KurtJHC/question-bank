There’s no doubt about it - Australia is a big country. Hopping on a guided tour is certainly a stress-free way to see the highlights, but there are benefits to taking your itinerary into your own hands. Leave the crowds behind and seek out adventure by heading to some of the best ‘undiscovered’ parts of the country. These hidden gems will reward your efforts with awe inspiring landscapes, wildlife, star-filled skies and a chance to connect with nature in a way that few get to experience.<br>
<br>
The Grampians National Park is just three hours from Melbourne, yet feels worlds away. The area is famous for quality red wines, hiking trails and Aboriginal history. The craggy peaks and rocky gorges of South Australia’s Flinders Ranges require a five-hour road trip from Adelaide, but are well worth the journey. Explore the 100 kilometre crater that is Wilpena Pound, taste kangaroo and emu at an outback pub and glamp under the stars at Arkaba Station. Or you could head off road. There are just some places that a tour bus can’t go. The Great Beach Drive, a 200 kilometre wave-washed highway on the Sunshine Coast, is the perfect example of an incredible experience you can only have by hopping behind the wheel. You'll need a 4WD and a sense of adventure, but you’ll never forget the feeling of sand beneath your wheels as the waves crash just metres away.&nbsp;<br>

Even after the sun goes down there’s plenty to see and do around Uluru in the NSW outback. The award-winning exhibition Field of Light is available to enjoy and experience. The outdoor installation, aptly named Tili Wiru Tjuta Nyakutjaku or ‘looking at lots of beautiful lights’ in local Pitjantjatjara, sees more than 50,000 solar-powered stems light up at sunset and glow throughout the night. In keeping with the desert’s vast scale, the brightly coloured light stems cover an area the size of four football fields. Explore it on your own or join a tour to see the sunset over the twinkling lights.<br>
<br>
A visit to the Red Centre wouldn’t be complete without experiencing this iconic Australian landmark. But there’s more than one way to see it. While many people choose to walk the 10 kilometres around the base of Uluru, there are countless other ways you can take it all in. Perhaps one of the most memorable is a scenic helicopter flight which will allow you to truly appreciate the full scale of Uluru and Kata Tjuta. If you’re more comfortable on the ground you can hop on a segway to cruise around the base, ride a camel at sunset or even take a motorcycle ride through the desert for a fun and exciting way to experience this sacred spot.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Have an Australian seafood adventure, from ocean to plate. Australia is home to some of the world’s most pristine waters – one major reason why Australian seafood has a global reputation for excellence. If you’re keen to sample some of Australia’s best seafood, start at Sydney Fish Market - an iconic local attraction in Sydney where visitors flock daily to see the bountiful supplies of fresh fish. Alternatively, head to nearby restaurants like multiaward-winning Saint Peter, which showcases Australia’s sustainable approach to sourcing and eating local delicacies like marron and Sydney rock oysters.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
On Tasmania’s beautiful eastern coast, at luxury lodge Saffire Freycinet or Freycinet Marine Farm, you can even pluck your own oysters and eat them directly from the sea. Or head to the Kimberley to experience the traditional hunt for mud crab with Indigenous custodian, Brian Lee.<br>

“Australians are very unfair in this way. They spend half of any conversation insisting that the country's dangers are vastly overrated and that there's nothing to worry about, and the other half telling you how six months ago their Uncle Bob was driving near Mudgee when a tiger snake slid out from under the dashboard and bit him on the groin, but that it's okay now because he's off the life support machine and they've discovered he can communicate with eye blinks.” … “As the saying goes, it takes all kinds to make the world go around, though perhaps some shouldn't go quite so far around it as others.” … “The people are immensely likable— cheerful, extrovert, quick-witted and unfailingly obliging. Their cities are safe and clean and nearly always built on water. They have a society that is prosperous, well ordered and instinctively egalitarian. The food is excellent. The sun nearly always shines. There is coffee on every corner. Life doesn't get much better than this.” - Bill Bryson, In a Sunburned Country<br>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Penrith Panthers take the NRL Grand Final&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Penrith Panthers have won a thrilling NRL 2021 Grand Final at Lang Park, Queensland, beating South Sydney Rabbitohs 14-12. They led 8-6 at half-time and held on after a frantic contest. The game was played at a tremendous tempo that captivated the 39,322- strong, COVID-limited Lang Park crowd. <strong>15 ………. </strong>He won the Clive Churchill Medal for best on ground, off the back of a tremendous kicking display. "This doesn't even feel real. I'm pinching myself," Cleary told ABC Sport after the game.</p>
        <p>Despite playing an NRL grand final in Brisbane for the first time, fans of both sides packed the stands at either end. The flag-waving masses helped to create a tremendous atmosphere. It is Penrith's first premiership since 2003 and third overall, and scenes of jubilation greeted the final whistle —both in the stands and on the field. <strong>16 ………. </strong>"The loss in the grand final last year really hurt," Ivan Cleary told ABC after the game. "It's one thing to say you want to make up for it, but it's so hard to get back here. It wasn't going to be anything other than a win that we'd be satisfied with tonight."</p>
        <p>Souths, having beaten Penrith in the first week of the finals, were supposed to benefit from the extra rest their 16-10 victory in that game earned them. However, the Panthers were relentless in both defence and attack. They rushed to the line and forced the Rabbitohs back with huge hit after huge hit. <strong>17 ……….</strong> Penrith swarmed the Rabbitohs in defence, forcing Souths into energy-sapping runs away from their own in-goal area, that would eventually tell.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the opening 10 minutes, the Panthers forced two goal-line restarts off the back of some immaculate kicking by Cleary. A third resulted in the opening try of the game. Matt Burton ran onto a perfect Jarome Luai pass to burst through a massive hole in the Souths defence. South Sydney were drained by the repeat sets and bewildered by an excellent lead run by Liam Martin. Matt Burton opened the scoring in the 16th minute of the match. Cody Walker hit back almost instantly with a stunning solo try. <strong>18 ……….</strong> Souths might have been denied territory, but Cody Walker ignored that, to capitalise with one of the Rabbitohs' only entries into the Panthers 20. He ran onto an Adam Reynolds pass before cruising past three despairing Panthers. He included a dismissive shove on Cleary before accelerating past Dylan Edwards to score a wonderful solo try. Cleary and Reynolds exchanged penalty goals either side of half-time. This left the sides locked at 8-8 for the majority of an excruciatingly tight second half.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The tightness and tension of the occasion demanded that any mistakes be brutally punished — and it looked like that mistake would be Walker's. His floating pass wide was intercepted by Stephen Crichton, who romped home from 40 metres out. <strong>19 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>Stephen Crichton intercept try in the 67th minute proved the difference. Souths then threw caution to the wind and scored a sensational try through Alex Johnston, having moved the ball nicely down their left side through quick hands by Walker and Dane Gagai. Reynolds would have backed himself to nail the conversion from the sideline, as he has done on countless occasions, but it went wide by the narrowest of margins in the tightest of grand finals.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Adam Reynolds looked dejected after missing a cruel field goal to level the score. "Sorry we couldn't get the job done tonight," the Brisbane-bound half player said, afterwards. <strong>20 ………. </strong>He paid credit to the five injured players in the side. "This finals series, we had five blokes who wouldn't normally play ... the bravery of these boys is amazing," he said.&nbsp;</p>
