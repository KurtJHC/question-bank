Amaranthe sprinted down the narrow, muddy trail, leaping past snarls of mossy roots and ducking leaves so large they felt like wrecking balls when they smashed against her face. The shouts behind her had dwindled, and she wondered if she might have outrun her pursuers.</p><p>A stone-tipped spear blurred past her ear, almost depriving her of a chunk of hair—and scalp. Ah, there was that pursuit.</p><p>The weapon slammed into the trail in front of her. It landed at an angle, and she almost impaled herself on the butt of it. Fortunately, a year of training with Sicarius hadn’t been undone by a couple of months of vacation, and she twisted to evade the obstacle at the same time as she ducked under a branch thoughtlessly growing across the path at eye level. She did bump into a bush before finding her way back onto the trail, and thin branches shuddered, raining droplets of water onto her head. Monkeys howled in the treetops, either irritated by her disturbance or entertained by her plight.</p><p>Amaranthe eyed the foliage to either side of her. Getting off this main route and finding another way to the beach might be wise, but the lush jungle grew denser than soldiers in a Turgonian infantry unit. And some of those spiky vines were just as dangerous. If she had thought to bring her sword, she might have cut a path, but she had gone to that village to trade, not to start a war.</p><p>She plowed onward, sticking to her trail and hoping to reach the lagoon before her pursuers caught up. She thought about hollering for Sicarius, but it was his presence on the island that had gotten her into this predicament. If he started slitting throats…</p><p>As Amaranthe leaped over another mossy log, something snatched her about the waist, yanking her into the foliage. She kept from yelping in surprise, but barely. And only because she had a hunch as to her captor’s identity.</p><p>Yes, the blond hairs on the muscular arm wrapped around her waist were familiar. As usual, Sicarius put action above words and hauled her several dozen meters into the jungle before pausing to discuss anything.&nbsp;He&nbsp;had a sword, of course, and used it to cut canes and vines, though he had a knack for weaving through the dense undergrowth <span class="txt-underline"><strong>as if he were simply pushing aside silk curtains</strong></span>. Having a woman—a woman who was more than ready to start using her own feet again—tucked against his side didn’t slow him at all.</p><p>Finally, he stopped, crouching in the hollow of a giant red tree that was broader than some of the shopfronts in Ink Alley back home. Amaranthe wriggled free, noting for the first time that he was carrying his black dagger clenched in his teeth…</p><p>Sicarius removed the dagger. “I was fishing.” Despite the shouts of the male villagers racing past on the trail they had just left, his tone was as dry and unconcerned as ever. The dampness of his short blond hair attested to how recently he had left the water. “You assured me that you would find no trouble in the village.” His eyebrow twitched.</p><p>“And I wouldn’t have, but—”</p><p>Foliage rattled in the direction of the trail, and a clunk sounded, an axe sheering away a branch. Sicarius peered around the tree, lifting a hand for silence. The villagers must have realized Amaranthe had left the path.</p><p>She dug into her pocket and pulled out a crinkled piece of parchment, deciding it could do the talking for her. The yellowed sheet held a portrait of a face. The black ink had faded to dull gray over the years, but it was still possible to make out the familiar features. A younger and harder—at least to Amaranthe’s eyes—version of Sicarius without the recently obtained knot of scar tissue at his temple. She didn’t recognize the language of the lines written below the portrait, but she knew a wanted poster when she saw one.</p><p>Sicarius knew it too. What he thought of it, she couldn’t tell. When he did show emotion, it seemed a conscious effort, as if he was trying to please her by doing so, but when other things were on his mind, he grew as hard to decipher as a <span class="txt-underline"><strong>granite slab</strong></span>.</p><p>“Is there a way we can get back to the beach?” Amaranthe whispered.</p><p>“Yes, but there are men on it.”</p><p>“Men with spears?”</p><p>“Yes.” Sicarius gazed into her eyes, waiting, she sensed, to see what she wanted to do. He had been an assassin all of his life and still tended to think in terms of eliminating people as answers to problems, though he’d gradually grown willing to accept less violent solutions if she could propose feasible ones. Or unfeasible ones that she could finesse—or manhandle—into working, regardless.</p>
“Lead us as close as we can get without being seen,” Amaranthe said, aware that the rustling of leaves and hacking of branches was drawing nearer. “Then we’ll… think of something creative.”</div>

          <strong>Bird in the Classroom</strong>

in the Teacher's ponderous monotone -<br>

melted and run together, <span class="txt-underline"><strong>desk and flesh as one.</strong></span><br>

with lidded eyes and lolling weighted heads,<br>

or borne from the room on a heaving wilderness of beds.<br>
And then on a sudden, a bird's cool voice<br>
punched out song. Crisp and spare<br>
on the startled air,<br>
<br>
beak-beamed<br>
or idly tossed,<br>
each note gleamed<br>
like a bead of frost.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A bird's cool voice from a neighbour's tree<br>
with five clear calls - mere grains of sound<br>
rare and neat<br>
repeated twice<br>
but they sprang from the heat<br>
like drops of ice.<br>
<br>
Ears cocked, before the comment ran<br>
fading and chuckling where a wattle stirred,<br>
the students wondered how they could have heard<br>
such dreary monotone from a man, and<br>
such wisdom from a bird.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below and then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>Movin' On Up: The Curious Birth and Rapid Rise of the Escalator</strong><br><br>
Today, escalators are a routine part of modern existence, moving people in nearly every mall, airport, mass transit station and stadium in the world. <strong>12 .............</strong> They're practical, user-friendly and (<span class="txt-underline">relatively</span>) safe.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was a&nbsp;day long ago, however, when somebody had the idea to make stairs move. While the first working escalator made its public debut as an attraction, this present-day convenience was a product of false starts, imaginative thinking, and a changing industrial world. <strong>13 .............</strong></p>
        <p>The first person to design an escalator was Nathan Ames. Graduating from Harvard in 1848, Ames was a lawyer who wrote poetry about&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">local pirate legends</span>. <strong>14 .............</strong> His most enduring patent, though, was the “Revolving Stairs.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The machine would allow people to "ascend and descend from one story of a building to another, without exerting any muscular strength," Ames wrote, thinking it would exist in private residences. Ames imagined the revolving stairs could benefit those who could not climb stairs on their own ("the sick, aged, and infirm") and the rich, whose houses proved too big to traverse on foot alone. <strong>15 .............</strong> He may have been a lot of things, but Ames was no engineer.</p>
        <p>Born during the Civil War in Kansas, Reno moved east and attended the prestigious engineering school at&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania</span>. Inspired by the school being on the side of a mountain, Reno began work on the invention that would change how people moved up in the world. <strong>16 .............</strong></p>
        <p>Following Reno's New York debut, improvements on his invention began showing up across the world. The explorer George Wheeler actually registered&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">a patent around the same time</span>&nbsp;as Reno, and his design featured actual steps like the escalators of today. He never built it. An enterprising man named Charles D. Seeberger bought the patent from Wheeler, naming the machine the "escalator"-effectively taking the Latin word for steps, "scala," and forming a sort of portmanteau with "elevator."</p>
        <p>Today, there are&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">escalators for bicycles</span>, <span class="txt-underline">exceedingly long escalators</span>, and&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">spiral escalators</span>, <strong>17 .............</strong></p>

        <p><em>Read the text below and then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>Movin' On Up: The Curious Birth and Rapid Rise of the Escalator</strong><br><br>
Today, escalators are a routine part of modern existence, moving people in nearly every mall, airport, mass transit station and stadium in the world. <strong>12 .............</strong> They're practical, user-friendly and (<span class="txt-underline">relatively</span>) safe.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was a&nbsp;day long ago, however, when somebody had the idea to make stairs move. While the first working escalator made its public debut as an attraction, this present-day convenience was a product of false starts, imaginative thinking, and a changing industrial world. <strong>13 .............</strong></p>
        <p>The first person to design an escalator was Nathan Ames. Graduating from Harvard in 1848, Ames was a lawyer who wrote poetry about&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">local pirate legends</span>. <strong>14 .............</strong> His most enduring patent, though, was the “Revolving Stairs.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The machine would allow people to "ascend and descend from one story of a building to another, without exerting any muscular strength," Ames wrote, thinking it would exist in private residences. Ames imagined the revolving stairs could benefit those who could not climb stairs on their own ("the sick, aged, and infirm") and the rich, whose houses proved too big to traverse on foot alone. <strong>15 .............</strong> He may have been a lot of things, but Ames was no engineer.</p>
        <p>Born during the Civil War in Kansas, Reno moved east and attended the prestigious engineering school at&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania</span>. Inspired by the school being on the side of a mountain, Reno began work on the invention that would change how people moved up in the world. <strong>16 .............</strong></p>
        <p>Following Reno's New York debut, improvements on his invention began showing up across the world. The explorer George Wheeler actually registered&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">a patent around the same time</span>&nbsp;as Reno, and his design featured actual steps like the escalators of today. He never built it. An enterprising man named Charles D. Seeberger bought the patent from Wheeler, naming the machine the "escalator"-effectively taking the Latin word for steps, "scala," and forming a sort of portmanteau with "elevator."</p>
        <p>Today, there are&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">escalators for bicycles</span>, <span class="txt-underline">exceedingly long escalators</span>, and&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">spiral escalators</span>, <strong>17 .............</strong></p>

        <p><em>Read the text below and then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>Movin' On Up: The Curious Birth and Rapid Rise of the Escalator</strong><br><br>
Today, escalators are a routine part of modern existence, moving people in nearly every mall, airport, mass transit station and stadium in the world. <strong>12 .............</strong> They're practical, user-friendly and (<span class="txt-underline">relatively</span>) safe.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was a&nbsp;day long ago, however, when somebody had the idea to make stairs move. While the first working escalator made its public debut as an attraction, this present-day convenience was a product of false starts, imaginative thinking, and a changing industrial world. <strong>13 .............</strong></p>
        <p>The first person to design an escalator was Nathan Ames. Graduating from Harvard in 1848, Ames was a lawyer who wrote poetry about&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">local pirate legends</span>. <strong>14 .............</strong> His most enduring patent, though, was the “Revolving Stairs.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The machine would allow people to "ascend and descend from one story of a building to another, without exerting any muscular strength," Ames wrote, thinking it would exist in private residences. Ames imagined the revolving stairs could benefit those who could not climb stairs on their own ("the sick, aged, and infirm") and the rich, whose houses proved too big to traverse on foot alone. <strong>15 .............</strong> He may have been a lot of things, but Ames was no engineer.</p>
        <p>Born during the Civil War in Kansas, Reno moved east and attended the prestigious engineering school at&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania</span>. Inspired by the school being on the side of a mountain, Reno began work on the invention that would change how people moved up in the world. <strong>16 .............</strong></p>
        <p>Following Reno's New York debut, improvements on his invention began showing up across the world. The explorer George Wheeler actually registered&nbsp;a <span class="txt-underline">patent around the same time</span>&nbsp;as Reno, and his design featured actual steps like the escalators of today. He never built it. An enterprising man named Charles D. Seeberger bought the patent from Wheeler, naming the machine the "escalator"-effectively taking the Latin word for steps, "scala," and forming a sort of portmanteau with "elevator."</p>
        <p>Today, there are&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">escalators for bicycles</span>, <span class="txt-underline">exceedingly long escalators</span>, and&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">spiral escalators</span>, <strong>17 .............</strong></p>

        <p><em>Read the text below and then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>Movin' On Up: The Curious Birth and Rapid Rise of the Escalator</strong><br><br>
Today, escalators are a routine part of modern existence, moving people in nearly every mall, airport, mass transit station and stadium in the world. <strong>12 .............</strong> They're practical, user-friendly and (<span class="txt-underline">relatively</span>) safe.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was a&nbsp;day long ago, however, when somebody had the idea to make stairs move. While the first working escalator made its public debut as an attraction, this present-day convenience was a product of false starts, imaginative thinking, and a changing industrial world. <strong>13 .............</strong></p>
        <p>The first person to design an escalator was Nathan Ames. Graduating from Harvard in 1848, Ames was a lawyer who wrote poetry about&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">local pirate legends</span>. <strong>14 .............</strong> His most enduring patent, though, was the “Revolving Stairs.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The machine would allow people to "ascend and descend from one story of a building to another, without exerting any muscular strength," Ames wrote, thinking it would exist in private residences. Ames imagined the revolving stairs could benefit those who could not climb stairs on their own ("the sick, aged, and infirm") and the rich, whose houses proved too big to traverse on foot alone. <strong>15 .............</strong> He may have been a lot of things, but Ames was no engineer.</p>
        <p>Born during the Civil War in Kansas, Reno moved east and attended the prestigious engineering school at&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania</span>. Inspired by the school being on the side of a mountain, Reno began work on the invention that would change how people moved up in the world. <strong>16 .............</strong></p>
        <p>Following Reno's New York debut, improvements on his invention began showing up across the world. The explorer George Wheeler actually registered&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">a patent around the same time</span>&nbsp;as Reno, and his design featured actual steps like the escalators of today. He never built it. An enterprising man named Charles D. Seeberger bought the patent from Wheeler, naming the machine the "escalator"-effectively taking the Latin word for steps, "scala," and forming a sort of portmanteau with "elevator."</p>
        <p>Today, there are&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">escalators for bicycles</span>, <span class="txt-underline">exceedingly long escalators</span>, and&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">spiral escalators</span>, <strong>17 .............</strong></p>

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
40,000 years ago, primitive artists invented the first pigments, using a combination of soil, animal fat, minerals, charcoal, and chalk. With these natural materials, they painted cave walls with a limited colour palette of red, yellow, brown, black, and white. Since then, scientific and technological advancements have led to countless colours and types of paint for art.<br>
As societies advanced around the world, transportation of materials became increasingly common. This was apparent in Ancient Greece and Egypt, where people imported paints from all over Europe and Asia in order to paint their temples and tombs. Processes for making paint also began to change, allowing artists a wider colour palette to choose from (albeit still limited). For example, sand, lime, and copper ore could be mixed together and heated to make a greenish blue pigment called&nbsp;<em>Egyptian blue</em>; a vibrant&nbsp;red was produced by mixing and roasting together hazardous mercury with sulfur; and&nbsp;white was made by sealing strips of lead in earthenware pots with vinegar and covering with manure.<br>

Yves Saint Laurent said: “A visit to Marrakech was a great shock to me. This city taught me color”. A friend of Yves Saint Laurent, Pierre Berge said: “When my friend Yves Saint Laurent and I first visited Marrakech, we could not even imagine that it will become a second home for us”. In 1980 Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Berge bought an abandoned house, which was prepared to be destroyed. The house, which was the property of French artist Jacques Majorelle, had a previously beautiful garden. Couturier began restoration work. Now it is a legendary Palace in Marrakech, glowing with all the colours of the rainbow – one of the best creations of the great Yves Saint Laurent. The ashes of the great couturier were dispelled right here. “I wanted – said Pierre Berge – to tell the visitors about Yves Saint Laurent’s love of Morocco. He is very well known all over the world, but in the hearts of Moroccans, he stands out.”<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Without&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">light</span>, there&nbsp;is&nbsp;no colour. When people see colours, they are really seeing different types of light bouncing off objects. Light travels in waves. Scientists use an idea called wavelength to describe these waves. Some light waves have long wavelengths, while others have short wavelengths. Light of different wavelengths appears as different colours. For example, red light has a long wavelength, and violet light has a short wavelength. Normally all the wavelengths, or colours, travel together as white light.<br>
When white light passes through a special piece of glass called a&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">prism</span>, the light bends. Shorter wavelengths (violet, blue, and green) bend more than longer wavelengths (yellow, orange, and red). This bending causes the white light to separate into the colours of the&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">rainbow</span>. White light also separates into different colours when it strikes objects. For example, when white light strikes a ripe tomato, mostly red wavelengths reflect, or bounce, off the tomato. The tomato absorbs, or takes in, all the other colours. This causes the tomato to look red.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
The sacred Aboriginal colours, said to be given to the Aborigines during the Dreamtime, are Black, Red, Yellow and White.&nbsp;Black represents the earth, marking the campfires of the dreamtime ancestors.&nbsp;Red represents fire, energy and blood - 'Djang', a power found in places of importance to the Aborigines.<br>
Many communities started off with the traditional colours and moved on to a broader palette.&nbsp; The artists of Balgo are a good example of such a group. Balgo&nbsp;is a small Aboriginal community that connects with both the Great Sandy Desert and the Tanami Desert.&nbsp;The early paintings from Balgo in the mid-1980s used a lot of black and brown with a little bit of yellow and white as highlights. It was a very austere colour palette that they started with. At some point they decided to embrace all the tones of reds and yellows and maybe pinks and introduce blues and so on. Over a five or ten year period the art from that community was transformed.<br>

40,000 years ago, primitive artists invented the first pigments, using a combination of soil, animal fat, minerals, charcoal, and chalk. With these natural materials, they painted cave walls with a limited colour palette of red, yellow, brown, black, and white. Since then, scientific and technological advancements have led to countless colours and types of paint for art.<br>
As societies advanced around the world, transportation of materials became increasingly common. This was apparent in Ancient Greece and Egypt, where people imported paints from all over Europe and Asia in order to paint their temples and tombs. Processes for making paint also began to change, allowing artists a wider colour palette to choose from (albeit still limited). For example, sand, lime, and copper ore could be mixed together and heated to make a greenish blue pigment called&nbsp;<em>Egyptian blue</em>; a vibrant&nbsp;red was produced by mixing and roasting together hazardous mercury with sulfur; and&nbsp;white was made by sealing strips of lead in earthenware pots with vinegar and covering with manure.<br>

Yves Saint Laurent said: “A visit to Marrakech was a great shock to me. This city taught me color”. A friend of Yves Saint Laurent, Pierre Berge said: “When my friend Yves Saint Laurent and I first visited Marrakech, we could not even imagine that it will become a second home for us”. In 1980 Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Berge bought an abandoned house, which was prepared to be destroyed. The house, which was the property of French artist Jacques Majorelle, had a previously beautiful garden. Couturier began restoration work. Now it is a legendary Palace in Marrakech, glowing with all the colours of the rainbow – one of the best creations of the great Yves Saint Laurent. The ashes of the great couturier were dispelled right here. “I wanted – said Pierre Berge – to tell the visitors about Yves Saint Laurent’s love of Morocco. He is very well known all over the world, but in the hearts of Moroccans, he stands out.”<br>

Without&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">light</span>, there&nbsp;is&nbsp;no colour. When people see colours, they are really seeing different types of light bouncing off objects. Light travels in waves. Scientists use an idea called wavelength to describe these waves. Some light waves have long wavelengths, while others have short wavelengths. Light of different wavelengths appears as different colours. For example, red light has a long wavelength, and violet light has a short wavelength. Normally all the wavelengths, or colours, travel together as white light.<br>
When white light passes through a special piece of glass called a&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">prism</span>, the light bends. Shorter wavelengths (violet, blue, and green) bend more than longer wavelengths (yellow, orange, and red). This bending causes the white light to separate into the colours of the&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">rainbow</span>. White light also separates into different colours when it strikes objects. For example, when white light strikes a ripe tomato, mostly red wavelengths reflect, or bounce, off the tomato. The tomato absorbs, or takes in, all the other colours. This causes the tomato to look red.<br>

The sacred Aboriginal colours, said to be given to the Aborigines during the Dreamtime, are Black, Red, Yellow and White.&nbsp;Black represents the earth, marking the campfires of the dreamtime ancestors.&nbsp;Red represents fire, energy and blood - 'Djang', a power found in places of importance to the Aborigines.<br>
Many communities started off with the traditional colours and moved on to a broader palette.&nbsp; The artists of Balgo are a good example of such a group. Balgo&nbsp;is a small Aboriginal community that connects with both the Great Sandy Desert and the Tanami Desert.&nbsp;The early paintings from Balgo in the mid-1980s used a lot of black and brown with a little bit of yellow and white as highlights. It was a very austere colour palette that they started with. At some point they decided to embrace all the tones of reds and yellows and maybe pinks and introduce blues and so on. Over a five or ten year period the art from that community was transformed.<br>

This bending causes the white light to separate into the colours of the&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">rainbow</span>. White light also separates into different colours when it strikes objects. For example, when white light strikes a ripe tomato, mostly red wavelengths reflect, or bounce, off the tomato. The tomato absorbs, or takes in, all the other colours. This causes the tomato to look red.<br>

The sacred Aboriginal colours, said to be given to the Aborigines during the Dreamtime, are Black, Red, Yellow and White.&nbsp;Black represents the earth, marking the campfires of the dreamtime ancestors.&nbsp;Red represents fire, energy and blood - 'Djang', a power found in places of importance to the Aborigines.<br>
Many communities started off with the traditional colours and moved on to a broader palette.&nbsp; The artists of Balgo are a good example of such a group. Balgo&nbsp;is a small Aboriginal community that connects with both the Great Sandy Desert and the Tanami Desert.&nbsp;The early paintings from Balgo in the mid-1980s used a lot of black and brown with a little bit of yellow and white as highlights. It was a very austere colour palette that they started with. At some point they decided to embrace all the tones of reds and yellows and maybe pinks and introduce blues and so on. Over a five or ten year period the art from that community was transformed.<br>

40,000 years ago, primitive artists invented the first pigments, using a combination of soil, animal fat, minerals, charcoal, and chalk. With these natural materials, they painted cave walls with a limited colour palette of red, yellow, brown, black, and white. Since then, scientific and technological advancements have led to countless colours and types of paint for art.<br>
As societies advanced around the world, transportation of materials became increasingly common. This was apparent in Ancient Greece and Egypt, where people imported paints from all over Europe and Asia in order to paint their temples and tombs. Processes for making paint also began to change, allowing artists a wider colour palette to choose from (albeit still limited). For example, sand, lime, and copper ore could be mixed together and heated to make a greenish blue pigment called&nbsp;<em>Egyptian blue</em>; a vibrant&nbsp;red was produced by mixing and roasting together hazardous mercury with sulfur; and&nbsp;white was made by sealing strips of lead in earthenware pots with vinegar and covering with manure.<br>

Yves Saint Laurent said: “A visit to Marrakech was a great shock to me. This city taught me color”. A friend of Yves Saint Laurent, Pierre Berge said: “When my friend Yves Saint Laurent and I first visited Marrakech, we could not even imagine that it will become a second home for us”. In 1980 Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Berge bought an abandoned house, which was prepared to be destroyed. The house, which was the property of French artist Jacques Majorelle, had a previously beautiful garden. Couturier began restoration work. Now it is a legendary Palace in Marrakech, glowing with all the colours of the rainbow – one of the best creations of the great Yves Saint Laurent. The ashes of the great couturier were dispelled right here. “I wanted – said Pierre Berge – to tell the visitors about Yves Saint Laurent’s love of Morocco. He is very well known all over the world, but in the hearts of Moroccans, he stands out.”<br>

Without&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">light</span>, there&nbsp;is&nbsp;no colour. When people see colours, they are really seeing different types of light bouncing off objects. Light travels in waves. Scientists use an idea called wavelength to describe these waves. Some light waves have long wavelengths, while others have short wavelengths. Light of different wavelengths appears as different colours. For example, red light has a long wavelength, and violet light has a short wavelength. Normally all the wavelengths, or colours, travel together as white light.<br>
