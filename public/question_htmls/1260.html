              <em>Playing violent video games causes more aggression, bullying and fighting.&nbsp;</em>
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>60% of middle school boys and 40% of middle school girls who played at least one Mature-rated (M-rated) game, hit or beat up someone, compared with 39% of boys and 14% of girls who did not play M-rated games. A 2014 peer-reviewed study in the&nbsp;<em>Journal of the American Medical Association</em>&nbsp;found that habitual violent video game playing had a causal link with increased, long-term, aggressive behaviour. Several peer-reviewed studies have shown that children who play M-rated games are more likely to bully and cyberbully their peers, get into physical fights, be hostile, argue with teachers, and show aggression towards their peers throughout the school year.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Lauren Farrar, Producer for KQED Learning’s YouTube series&nbsp;<em>Above the Noise, </em>stated: “Often times after a tragic mass shooting, we hear politicians turn the blame to violent video games, but the reality is that the research doesn’t really support that claim. In general, violence usually refers to physical harm or physical acts that hurt someone– like hitting, kicking, punching, and pushing. Aggression is a more broad term that refers to angry or hostile thoughts, feelings or behaviours. So, everything that is violent is aggressive, but not everything that is aggressive is violent. For example, getting frustrated, yelling, talking back and arguing are all aggressive behaviours, but they aren’t violent. The research on the effects of violent video games and behaviour often looks at these milder forms of aggressive behaviour.”&nbsp;</p>

It is like going to see a sad movie. It might make you cry but it doesn’t make you clinically depressed. Politicians on both sides go after video games as it is this weird unifying force allowing for a convenient scapegoat. It makes them look like they are doing something and makes violent video games look scary. But research just doesn’t support that there’s a link [to violent behaviour].”&nbsp;</p>

In general, violence usually refers to physical harm or physical acts that hurt someone– like hitting, kicking, punching, and pushing. Aggression is a more broad term that refers to angry or hostile thoughts, feelings or behaviours. So, everything that is violent is aggressive, but not everything that is aggressive is violent. For example, getting frustrated, yelling, talking back and arguing are all aggressive behaviours, but they aren’t violent. The research on the effects of violent video games and behaviour often looks at these milder forms of aggressive behaviour.”&nbsp;</p>

In general, violence usually refers to physical harm or physical acts that hurt someone– like hitting, kicking, punching, and pushing. Aggression is a more broad term that refers to angry or hostile thoughts, feelings or behaviours. So, everything that is violent is aggressive, but not everything that is aggressive is violent. For example, getting frustrated, yelling, talking back and arguing are all aggressive behaviours, but they aren’t violent. The research on the effects of violent video games and behaviour often looks at these milder forms of aggressive behaviour.”&nbsp;</p>

              <em>Violent video games are a convenient scapegoat for those who would rather not deal with the actual causes of violence in the US.&nbsp;</em>
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Patrick Markey, PhD, Psychology Professor at Villanova University, stated: “The general story is people who play video games right after might be a little hopped up and jerky but it doesn’t fundamentally alter who they are. It is like going to see a sad movie. It might make you cry but it doesn’t make you clinically depressed. Politicians on both sides go after video games as it is this weird unifying force allowing for a convenient scapegoat. It makes them look like they are doing something and makes violent video games look scary. But research just doesn’t support that there’s a link [to violent behaviour].”&nbsp;</p>

              <em>By inhabiting violent characters in video games, children are more likely to imitate the behaviours of those characters and have difficulty distinguishing reality from fantasy.&nbsp;</em>
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Violent video games require active participation and identification with violent characters, which reinforces violent behaviour. Young children are more likely to confuse fantasy violence with real world violence, and without a framework for ethical decision making, they may mimic the actions they see in violent video games. Child Development and Early Childhood Education expert Jane Katch stated in an interview with&nbsp;<em>Education Week</em>,&nbsp;“I found that young children often have difficulty separating fantasy from reality when they are playing and can temporarily believe they are the character they are pretending to be.”</p>

        <p>1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;position gets 3 points, 2<sup>nd&nbsp;</sup>position gets 2 points and 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;position gets 1 point.</p>
        <p>Using this method, he found that some televisions were very close in score, so he decided that if there was only 1 point difference between the top two scores or if there were equal top scores, he would choose the television that was the easiest to use out of the top scorers.</p>
