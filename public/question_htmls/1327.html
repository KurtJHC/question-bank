          <strong>A Sound of Thunder&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>by Ray Bradbury&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>Using a time machine, an organisation called Time Safari transports clients into the past to participate in hunting expeditions. A tourist Mr Eckels, together with tour guide, Travis, is visiting a prehistoric jungle in order to hunt a Tyrannosaurus Rex.</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The jungle was high and the jungle was broad. Sounds like music and flying tents filled the sky, and those were pterodactyls soaring with huge grey wings.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘I’ve hunted tiger, wild boar, buffalo, elephant, but now, this is it,’ said Eckels. ‘I’m shaking like a kid.’</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Ah,’ said Travis. Everyone stopped. Travis raised his hand. ‘Ahead,’ he whispered, ‘In the mist. There he is. There’s&nbsp;<strong><span class="txt-underline">his Royal Majesty</span></strong> now.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The jungle was wide and full of twitterings, rustlings, murmurs, and sighs. Suddenly, it all ceased, as if someone had shut a door. Silence. A sound of thunder. Out of the mist, one hundred yards away, came Tyrannosaurus Rex. ‘It,’ whispered Eckels, ‘It......’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Ssh!’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It came on great oiled, resilient, striding legs. It towered thirty feet above half of the trees, a great evil god, folding its delicate watchmaker’s claws close to its oily reptilian chest. Each lower leg was a piston, a thousand pounds of white bone, sunk in thick ropes of muscle, sheathed over in a gleam of pebbled skin like the armour of a terrible warrior. Each thigh was a ton of meat, ivory, and steel mesh. And from the great breathing cage of the upper body those two delicate arms dangled out front, arms with hands which might pick up and examine men like toys, while the snake neck coiled. And the head itself, a ton of sculptured stone, lifted easily upon the sky. Its mouth gaped, exposing a fence of teeth like daggers. Its eyes rolled, ostrich eggs, empty of all expression save hunger. It closed its mouth in a death grin. It ran, its pelvic bones crushing aside trees and bushes, its taloned feet clawing damp earth, leaving prints six inches deep wherever it settled its weight. It ran with a gliding ballet step, far too poised and balanced for its ten tons. It moved into a sunlit area warily, its beautifully reptilian hands feeling the air.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Why, why...,’ Eckels twitched his mouth, ‘It could reach up and grab the moon.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Ssh!’ Travis jerked angrily. ‘He hasn’t seen us yet.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘It can’t be killed.’ Eckels pronounced this verdict quietly, as if there could be no argument. He had weighed the evidence and this was his considered opinion. The rifle in his hands seemed like a toy gun. ‘We were fools to come. This is impossible.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Shut up!’ hissed Travis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Nightmare.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Turn around,’ commanded Travis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Walk quietly to the Machine. We’ll remit half your fee.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘I didn’t realise it would be this big,’ said Eckels. ‘I miscalculated, that’s all. And now I want out.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘It sees us!’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘There’s the red paint on its chest.’ The Tyrant Lizard raised itself. Its armoured flesh glittered like a thousand green coins. The coins, crusted with slime, steamed. In the slime, tiny insects wriggled, so that the entire body seemed to twitch and undulate, even while the monster itself did not move. It exhaled. The stink of raw flesh blew down the wilderness.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Get me out of here,’ said Eckels. ‘It was never like this before. I was always sure I’d come through alive. I had good guides, good safaris, and safety. This time, I figured wrong. I’ve met my match and admit it. This is too much for me to get hold of.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Don’t run,’ said Lesperance. ‘Turn around. Hide in the Machine.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Yes.’ Eckels seemed to be numb. He looked at his feet as if trying to make them move. He gave a grunt of helplessness.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Eckels!’ He took a few steps, blinking, shuffling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Not that way!’ The Monster, at the first motion, lunged forward with a terrible scream. It covered one hundred yards in six seconds. The rifles jerked up and blazed fire. A windstorm from the beast’s mouth engulfed them in the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>stench of slime and old blood</strong></span>. The Monster roared, teeth glittering with sun. The rifles cracked again, but their sound was lost in shriek and lizard thunder. The great level of the reptile’s tail swung up, lashed sideways. Trees exploded in clouds of leaf and branch. The Monster twitched its jeweller’s hands down to fondle at the men, to twist them in half, to crush them like berries, to cram them into its teeth and its screaming throat. Its boulder-stone eyes levelled with the men. They saw themselves mirrored. They fired at the metallic eyelids and the blazing black iris. Like a stone idol, like a mountain avalanche, Tyrannosaurus fell.</p>

          <strong>Tom the Chimney Sweeper&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So he and his master set out at five in the morning; Grimes rode the donkey in front, and Tom and the brushes walked behind; out of the court, and up the street, past the closed window-shutters, and the winking weary policemen, and the roofs all shining grey in the grey dawn.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They passed through the miners’ village, all shut up and silent now, and through the turnpike; and then they were out in the real country, and plodding along the black dusty road, between black slag walls, with no sound but the groaning and thumping of the mine pit-engine in the next field. But soon the road grew white, and the walls likewise; and at the wall’s foot grew long grass and bright flowers, all drenched with dew; and instead of the groaning of the pit-engine, they heard the skylark singing his song high up in the air, and the pit-bird warbling in the sedges, as he had warbled all night long.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All else was silent. For old Mrs Earth was still fast asleep; and, like many pretty people, she looked still prettier asleep than awake. The great elm-trees in the gold-green meadows were fast asleep above, and the cows fast asleep beneath them; nay, the few clouds which were about were fast asleep likewise, and so tired that they had lain down on the earth to rest, in long white flakes and bars, among the stems of the elm-trees, and along the tops of the alders by the stream, waiting for the sun to bid them rise and go about their day’s business in the clear blue overhead.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On they went; and Tom looked, and looked, for he never had been so far into the country before; and longed to get over a gate, and pick buttercups, and look for birds’ nests in the hedge; but Mr. Grimes was a man of business and would not have heard of that.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Soon they came up with a poor Irishwoman, trudging along with a bundle at her back. She had a grey shawl over her head, and a crimson tartan dress; so you may be sure she came from Galway. She had neither shoes nor stockings and limped along as if she were tired and footsore; but she was a very tall handsome woman, with bright grey eyes, and heavy black hair hanging about her cheeks. And she took Mr. Grimes’ fancy so much, that when he came alongside he called out to her:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“This is a hard road for a bare foot like that. Will ye wish upon a ride upon my donkey?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But, perhaps, she did not admire Mr. Grimes’ look and voice; for she answered quietly:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“No, thank you: I’d sooner walk with your little lad here.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“You may please yourself,” growled Grimes, and went on smoking.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So she walked beside Tom, and talked to him, and asked him where he lived, and what he knew, and all about himself, till Tom thought he had never met such a pleasant-spoken woman. And she asked him, at last, whether he said his prayers! And seemed sad when he told her that he knew no prayers to say.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then he asked her where she lived, and she said far away by the sea. And Tom asked her about the sea, for he had never laid eyes on the sea; and she told him how it rolled and roared over the rocks in winter nights, and lay still in the bright summer days, for the children to bathe and play in it; and many a story more, till Tom longed to go and see the sea, and bathe in it likewise.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>So he and his master set out at five in the morning; Grimes rode the donkey in front, and Tom and the brushes walked behind; out of the court, and up the street, past the closed window-shutters, and the winking weary policemen, and the roofs all shining grey in the grey dawn.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They passed through the miners’ village, all shut up and silent now, and through the turnpike; and then they were out in the real country, and plodding along the black dusty road, between black slag walls, with no sound but the groaning and thumping of the mine pit-engine in the next field. But soon the road grew white, and the walls likewise; and at the wall’s foot grew long grass and bright flowers, all drenched with dew; and instead of the groaning of the pit-engine, they heard the skylark singing his song high up in the air, and the pit-bird warbling in the sedges, as he had warbled all night long.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All else was silent. For old Mrs Earth was still fast asleep; and, like many pretty people, she looked still prettier asleep than awake. The great elm-trees in the gold-green meadows were fast asleep above, and the cows fast asleep beneath them; nay, the few clouds which were about were fast asleep likewise, and so tired that they had lain down on the earth to rest, in long white flakes and bars, among the stems of the elm-trees, and along the tops of the alders by the stream, waiting for the sun to bid them rise and go about their day’s business in the clear blue overhead.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On they went; and Tom looked, and looked, for he never had been so far into the country before; and longed to get over a gate, and pick buttercups, and look for birds’ nests in the hedge; but Mr. Grimes was a man of business and would not have heard of that.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Soon they came up with a poor Irishwoman, trudging along with a bundle at her back. She had a grey shawl over her head, and a crimson tartan dress; so you may be sure she came from Galway. She had neither shoes nor stockings and limped along as if she were tired and footsore; but she was a very tall handsome woman, with bright grey eyes, and heavy black hair hanging about her cheeks. And she took Mr. Grimes’ fancy so much, that when he came alongside he called out to her:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“This is a hard road for a bare foot like that. Will ye wish upon a ride upon my donkey?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But, perhaps, she did not admire Mr. Grimes’ look and voice; for she answered quietly:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“No, thank you: I’d sooner walk with your little lad here.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“You may please yourself,” growled Grimes, and went on smoking.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So she walked beside Tom, and talked to him, and asked him where he lived, and what he knew, and all about himself, till Tom thought he had never met such a pleasant-spoken woman. And she asked him, at last, whether he said his prayers! And seemed sad when he told her that he knew no prayers to say.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then he asked her where she lived, and she said far away by the sea. And Tom asked her about the sea, for he had never laid eyes on the sea; and she told him how it rolled and roared over the rocks in winter nights, and lay still in the bright summer days, for the children to bathe and play in it; and many a story more, till Tom longed to go and see the sea, and bathe in it likewise.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Tom the Chimney Sweeper&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So he and his master set out at five in the morning; Grimes rode the donkey in front, and Tom and the brushes walked behind; out of the court, and up the street, past the closed window-shutters, and the winking weary policemen, and the roofs all shining grey in the grey dawn.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They passed through the miners’ village, all shut up and silent now, and through the turnpike; and then they were out in the real country, and plodding along the black dusty road, between black slag walls, with no sound but the groaning and thumping of the mine pit-engine in the next field. But soon the road grew white, and the walls likewise; and at the wall’s foot grew long grass and bright flowers, all drenched with dew; and instead of the groaning of the pit-engine, they heard the skylark singing his song high up in the air, and the pit-bird warbling in the sedges, as he had warbled all night long.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All else was silent. For old Mrs Earth was still fast asleep; and, like many pretty people, she looked still prettier asleep than awake. The great elm-trees in the gold-green meadows were fast asleep above, and the cows fast asleep beneath them; nay, the few clouds which were about were fast asleep likewise, and so tired that they had lain down on the earth to rest, in long white flakes and bars, among the stems of the elm-trees, and along the tops of the alders by the stream, waiting for the sun to bid them rise and go about their day’s business in the clear blue overhead.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On they went; and Tom looked, and looked, for he never had been so far into the country before; and longed to get over a gate, and pick buttercups, and look for birds’ nests in the hedge; but Mr. Grimes was a man of business and would not have heard of that.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Soon they came up with a poor Irishwoman, trudging along with a bundle at her back. She had a grey shawl over her head, and a crimson tartan dress; so you may be sure she came from Galway. She had neither shoes nor stockings and limped along as if she were tired and footsore; but she was a very tall handsome woman, with bright grey eyes, and heavy black hair hanging about her cheeks. And she took Mr. Grimes’ fancy so much, that when he came alongside he called out to her:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“This is a hard road for a bare foot like that. Will ye wish upon a ride upon my donkey?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But, perhaps, she did not admire Mr. Grimes’ look and voice; for she answered quietly:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“No, thank you: I’d sooner walk with your little lad here.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“You may please yourself,” growled Grimes, and went on smoking.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So she walked beside Tom, and talked to him, and asked him where he lived, and what he knew, and all about himself, till Tom thought he had never met such a pleasant-spoken woman. And she asked him, at last, whether he said his prayers! And seemed sad when he told her that he knew no prayers to say.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then he asked her where she lived, and she said far away by the sea. And Tom asked her about the sea, for he had never laid eyes on the sea; and she told him how it rolled and roared over the rocks in winter nights, and lay still in the bright summer days, for the children to bathe and play in it; and many a story more, till Tom longed to go and see the sea, and bathe in it likewise.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Tom the Chimney Sweeper&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So he and his master set out at five in the morning; Grimes rode the donkey in front, and Tom and the brushes walked behind; out of the court, and up the street, past the closed window-shutters, and the winking weary policemen, and the roofs all shining grey in the grey dawn.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They passed through the miners’ village, all shut up and silent now, and through the turnpike; and then they were out in the real country, and plodding along the black dusty road, between black slag walls, with no sound but the groaning and thumping of the mine pit-engine in the next field. But soon the road grew white, and the walls likewise; and at the wall’s foot grew long grass and bright flowers, all drenched with dew; and instead of the groaning of the pit-engine, they heard the skylark singing his song high up in the air, and the pit-bird warbling in the sedges, as he had warbled all night long.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All else was silent. For old Mrs Earth was still fast asleep; and, like many pretty people, she looked still prettier asleep than awake. The great elm-trees in the gold-green meadows were fast asleep above, and the cows fast asleep beneath them; nay, the few clouds which were about were fast asleep likewise, and so tired that they had lain down on the earth to rest, in long white flakes and bars, among the stems of the elm-trees, and along the tops of the alders by the stream, waiting for the sun to bid them rise and go about their day’s business in the clear blue overhead.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On they went; and Tom looked, and looked, for he never had been so far into the country before; and longed to get over a gate, and pick buttercups, and look for birds’ nests in the hedge; but Mr. Grimes was a man of business and would not have heard of that.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Soon they came up with a poor Irishwoman, trudging along with a bundle at her back. She had a grey shawl over her head, and a crimson tartan dress; so you may be sure she came from Galway. She had neither shoes nor stockings and limped along as if she were tired and footsore; but she was a very tall handsome woman, with bright grey eyes, and heavy black hair hanging about her cheeks. And she took Mr. Grimes’ fancy so much, that when he came alongside he called out to her:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“This is a hard road for a bare foot like that. Will ye wish upon a ride upon my donkey?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But, perhaps, she did not admire Mr. Grimes’ look and voice; for she answered quietly:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“No, thank you: I’d sooner walk with your little lad here.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“You may please yourself,” growled Grimes, and went on smoking.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So she walked beside Tom, and talked to him, and asked him where he lived, and what he knew, and all about himself, till Tom thought he had never met such a pleasant-spoken woman. And she asked him, at last, whether he said his prayers! And seemed sad when he told her that he knew no prayers to say.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then he asked her where she lived, and she said far away by the sea. And Tom asked her about the sea, for he had never laid eyes on the sea; and she told him how it rolled and roared over the rocks in winter nights, and lay still in the bright summer days, for the children to bathe and play in it; and many a story more, till Tom longed to go and see the sea, and bathe in it likewise.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>THE GREAT HARRY HOUDINI</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Harry Houdini was born on March 24, 1874 in Budpest, Hungary, with the name of Ehrich Weisz. He was one of six children and the son of Rabbi Mayer Weisz and his second wife, Cecilia Steiner. In early 1876, Mayer Weisz immigrated to the United States with the dream of a better life. He found work as a rabbi and changed his last name to Weiss.<strong> 1 ..........&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The family moved to Milwaukee when Ehrich was eight years old. During his early years, Ehrich sold newspapers and shined shoes to help support the family. On October 28, 1883, nine year old Ehrich made his first appearance on stage, performing a trapeze act. He billed himself, “Ehrich, the Prince of the Air.” <strong>2 ..........</strong> A year later he returned to New York. He continued to help support his family by working as a messenger, necktie cutter, and photography assistant. Nothing is known of his year away from his family.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>About this time, Ehrich and his brother, Theo began to pursue an interest in magic. As a stage name, Ehrich Weiss became Harry Houdini. <strong>3 .......... </strong>Harry is simply an Americanised version of his nickname, Ehrie. At 17, Ehrich, now known as Harry Houdini, left his family to pursue his magic career. By the age of twenty, Harry had been performing small acts throughout New York. He soon married and joined a circus where he began to develop and perfect his escape tricks.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>4 .......... </strong>Harry was even given certificates from various wardens for escaping from their prisons. After making his name in America, Harry toured Europe. There he expanded his repertoire by escaping from straitjackets and coffins. Eventually, Harry was able to accomplish his dream of having a full show dedicated to his magic.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In his later years, Harry took his talent to the film arena, where he both acted and started his own film laboratory called The Film Development Corporation. Years later, Harry would&nbsp;receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. <strong>5 .......... </strong>He was the first person to ever fly over Australian soil. In the 1920s, Harry became interested in the occult, specifically in debunking mediums and psychics. His training in magic helped him expose frauds that scientists and academics could not. He chronicled his time investigating the occult in his book, <em>A Magician Among the Spirits</em>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In 1926 Houdini died as a result of a ruptured appendix, after suffering a blow to the abdomen by university student J. Gordon Whitehead. <strong>6 ..........</strong> He continued to travel, eventually succumbing to periotonitis on October 24, 1926 at the age of 52.</p>

          <strong>THE GREAT HARRY HOUDINI</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Harry Houdini was born on March 24, 1874 in Budpest, Hungary, with the name of Ehrich Weisz. He was one of six children and the son of Rabbi Mayer Weisz and his second wife, Cecilia Steiner. In early 1876, Mayer Weisz immigrated to the United States with the dream of a better life. He found work as a rabbi and changed his last name to Weiss.<strong> 1 ..........&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The family moved to Milwaukee when Ehrich was eight years old. During his early years, Ehrich sold newspapers and shined shoes to help support the family. On October 28, 1883, nine year old Ehrich made his first appearance on stage, performing a trapeze act. He billed himself, “Ehrich, the Prince of the Air.” <strong>2 ..........</strong> A year later he returned to New York. He continued to help support his family by working as a messenger, necktie cutter, and photography assistant. Nothing is known of his year away from his family.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>About this time, Ehrich and his brother, Theo began to pursue an interest in magic. As a stage name, Ehrich Weiss became Harry Houdini. <strong>3 .......... </strong>Harry is simply an Americanised version of his nickname, Ehrie. At 17, Ehrich, now known as Harry Houdini, left his family to pursue his magic career. By the age of twenty, Harry had been performing small acts throughout New York. He soon married and joined a circus where he began to develop and perfect his escape tricks.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>4 .......... </strong>Harry was even given certificates from various wardens for escaping from their prisons. After making his name in America, Harry toured Europe. There he expanded his repertoire by escaping from straitjackets and coffins. Eventually, Harry was able to accomplish his dream of having a full show dedicated to his magic.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In his later years, Harry took his talent to the film arena, where he both acted and started his own film laboratory called The Film Development Corporation. Years later, Harry would&nbsp;receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. <strong>5 .......... </strong>He was the first person to ever fly over Australian soil. In the 1920s, Harry became interested in the occult, specifically in debunking mediums and psychics. His training in magic helped him expose frauds that scientists and academics could not. He chronicled his time investigating the occult in his book, <em>A Magician Among the Spirits</em>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In 1926 Houdini died as a result of a ruptured appendix, after suffering a blow to the abdomen by university student J. Gordon Whitehead. <strong>6 ..........</strong> He continued to travel, eventually succumbing to periotonitis on October 24, 1926 at the age of 52.</p>

          <strong>THE GREAT HARRY HOUDINI</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Harry Houdini was born on March 24, 1874 in Budpest, Hungary, with the name of Ehrich Weisz. He was one of six children and the son of Rabbi Mayer Weisz and his second wife, Cecilia Steiner. In early 1876, Mayer Weisz immigrated to the United States with the dream of a better life. He found work as a rabbi and changed his last name to Weiss.<strong> 1 ..........&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The family moved to Milwaukee when Ehrich was eight years old. During his early years, Ehrich sold newspapers and shined shoes to help support the family. On October 28, 1883, nine year old Ehrich made his first appearance on stage, performing a trapeze act. He billed himself, “Ehrich, the Prince of the Air.” <strong>2 ..........</strong> A year later he returned to New York. He continued to help support his family by working as a messenger, necktie cutter, and photography assistant. Nothing is known of his year away from his family.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>About this time, Ehrich and his brother, Theo began to pursue an interest in magic. As a stage name, Ehrich Weiss became Harry Houdini. <strong>3 .......... </strong>Harry is simply an Americanised version of his nickname, Ehrie. At 17, Ehrich, now known as Harry Houdini, left his family to pursue his magic career. By the age of twenty, Harry had been performing small acts throughout New York. He soon married and joined a circus where he began to develop and perfect his escape tricks.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>4 .......... </strong>Harry was even given certificates from various wardens for escaping from their prisons. After making his name in America, Harry toured Europe. There he expanded his repertoire by escaping from straitjackets and coffins. Eventually, Harry was able to accomplish his dream of having a full show dedicated to his magic.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In his later years, Harry took his talent to the film arena, where he both acted and started his own film laboratory called The Film Development Corporation. Years later, Harry would&nbsp;receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. <strong>5 .......... </strong>He was the first person to ever fly over Australian soil. In the 1920s, Harry became interested in the occult, specifically in debunking mediums and psychics. His training in magic helped him expose frauds that scientists and academics could not. He chronicled his time investigating the occult in his book, <em>A Magician Among the Spirits</em>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In 1926 Houdini died as a result of a ruptured appendix, after suffering a blow to the abdomen by university student J. Gordon Whitehead. <strong>6 ..........</strong> He continued to travel, eventually succumbing to periotonitis on October 24, 1926 at the age of 52.</p>

He was one of six children and the son of Rabbi Mayer Weisz and his second wife, Cecilia Steiner. In early 1876, Mayer Weisz immigrated to the United States with the dream of a better life. He found work as a rabbi and changed his last name to Weiss.<strong> 1 ..........&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The family moved to Milwaukee when Ehrich was eight years old. During his early years, Ehrich sold newspapers and shined shoes to help support the family. On October 28, 1883, nine year old Ehrich made his first appearance on stage, performing a trapeze act. He billed himself, “Ehrich, the Prince of the Air.” <strong>2 ..........</strong> A year later he returned to New York. He continued to help support his family by working as a messenger, necktie cutter, and photography assistant. Nothing is known of his year away from his family.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>About this time, Ehrich and his brother, Theo began to pursue an interest in magic. As a stage name, Ehrich Weiss became Harry Houdini. <strong>3 .......... </strong>Harry is simply an Americanised version of his nickname, Ehrie. At 17, Ehrich, now known as Harry Houdini, left his family to pursue his magic career. By the age of twenty, Harry had been performing small acts throughout New York. He soon married and joined a circus where he began to develop and perfect his escape tricks.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>4 .......... </strong>Harry was even given certificates from various wardens for escaping from their prisons. After making his name in America, Harry toured Europe. There he expanded his repertoire by escaping from straitjackets and coffins. Eventually, Harry was able to accomplish his dream of having a full show dedicated to his magic.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In his later years, Harry took his talent to the film arena, where he both acted and started his own film laboratory called The Film Development Corporation. Years later, Harry would&nbsp;receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. <strong>5 .......... </strong>He was the first person to ever fly over Australian soil. In the 1920s, Harry became interested in the occult, specifically in debunking mediums and psychics. His training in magic helped him expose frauds that scientists and academics could not. He chronicled his time investigating the occult in his book, <em>A Magician Among the Spirits</em>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In 1926 Houdini died as a result of a ruptured appendix, after suffering a blow to the abdomen by university student J. Gordon Whitehead. <strong>6 ..........</strong> He continued to travel, eventually succumbing to periotonitis on October 24, 1926 at the age of 52.</p>

        <p>I thought of the pleasure of taking</p>
