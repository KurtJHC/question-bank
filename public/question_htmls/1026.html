How many planets make up our solar system? There are eight planets in our solar system, which is part of the Milky Way galaxy. Pluto was once called the ninth planet in our solar system, but the International Astronomical Union made some category changes in 2006 and Pluto became a minor, or dwarf planet. The main reason for this decision is that Pluto’s wild-card orbit crosses the orbit of Neptune. The idea of a ninth planet has persisted, and astronomers are now searching for Planet X, or Planet Nine, after mathematical evidence from 2016. Planet Nine is thought to be five thousand times the mass of Pluto and 10 times the mass of Earth, and to orbit beyond Neptune. The planets are typically ordered by their distance from the Sun, with Mercury being the closest. Half of the eight planets are known as the terrestrial, or inner, planets - with Mercury being closest to the Sun, followed by Venus, Earth, and then Mars. The other half are the Jovian, or Jupiter-like planets. In order of distance from the Sun, these are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.&nbsp;<br>

The Little Prince asked me: “What is that object?”&nbsp;<br>
“That is not an object. It flies. It is an air-plane. It is my air-plane.” And I was proud to have him learn that I could fly. He cried out, then “What! You dropped down from the sky?”<br>
“Yes,” I answered, modestly.<br>
“Oh! That is funny!” And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter, which irritated me very much. Then he added: “So you, too, come from the sky! Which is your planet?” At&nbsp;that moment I caught a gleam of light in the impenetrable mystery of his presence; and I demanded, abruptly: “Do you come from another planet?” But he did not reply. He tossed his head gently, without taking his eyes from my plane: “It is true that on that you can’t have come from very far away...” Then the little prince said, earnestly: “That doesn’t matter. Where I live, everything is so small!” And, with perhaps a hint of sadness, he added: “Straight ahead of you, nobody can go very far...” I had thus learned a second fact of great importance: this was that the planet the little prince came from was scarcely any larger than a house!<br>

THE COMING OF THE MARTIANS. No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man’s and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinised and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their control over physical matter. It is possible that small creatures under the microscope do the same. No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources of human danger, or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable.<br>

Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue-green planet whose ape-descended life forms still think that digital watches are a pretty neat idea. This planet has – or rather had – a problem, which was this; most people living on it were unhappy for pretty much most of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn’t the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy. And then one Thursday ... a girl sitting in a café in Rickmansworth suddenly realised what had been going wrong ... and how the world could be made a happy and good place. Sadly, however, before she could tell anyone about it, a terrible, stupid catastrophe occurred and the idea was lost for ever.<br>

How many planets make up our solar system? There are eight planets in our solar system, which is part of the Milky Way galaxy. Pluto was once called the ninth planet in our solar system, but the International Astronomical Union made some category changes in 2006 and Pluto became a minor, or dwarf planet. The main reason for this decision is that Pluto’s wild-card orbit crosses the orbit of Neptune. The idea of a ninth planet has persisted, and astronomers are now searching for Planet X, or Planet Nine, after mathematical evidence from 2016. Planet Nine is thought to be five thousand times the mass of Pluto and 10 times the mass of Earth, and to orbit beyond Neptune. The planets are typically ordered by their distance from the Sun, with Mercury being the closest. Half of the eight planets are known as the terrestrial, or inner, planets - with Mercury being closest to the Sun, followed by Venus, Earth, and then Mars. The other half are the Jovian, or Jupiter-like planets. In order of distance from the Sun, these are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.&nbsp;<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
The Little Prince asked me: “What is that object?”&nbsp;<br>
“That is not an object. It flies. It is an air-plane. It is my air-plane.” And I was proud to have him learn that I could fly. He cried out, then “What! You dropped down from the sky?”<br>
“Yes,” I answered, modestly.<br>
“Oh! That is funny!” And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter, which irritated me very much. Then he added: “So you, too, come from the sky! Which is your planet?” At&nbsp;that moment I caught a gleam of light in the impenetrable mystery of his presence; and I demanded, abruptly: “Do you come from another planet?” But he did not reply. He tossed his head gently, without taking his eyes from my plane: “It is true that on that you can’t have come from very far away...” Then the little prince said, earnestly: “That doesn’t matter. Where I live, everything is so small!” And, with perhaps a hint of sadness, he added: “Straight ahead of you, nobody can go very far...” I had thus learned a second fact of great importance: this was that the planet the little prince came from was scarcely any larger than a house!<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
THE COMING OF THE MARTIANS. No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man’s and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinised and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their control over physical matter. It is possible that small creatures under the microscope do the same. No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources of human danger, or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable.<br>
<em>H.G Wells</em><br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue-green planet whose ape-descended life forms still think that digital watches are a pretty neat idea. This planet has – or rather had – a problem, which was this; most people living on it were unhappy for pretty much most of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn’t the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy. And then one Thursday ... a girl sitting in a café in Rickmansworth suddenly realised what had been going wrong ... and how the world could be made a happy and good place. Sadly, however, before she could tell anyone about it, a terrible, stupid catastrophe occurred and the idea was lost for ever.<br>
