<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A and B), read the two extracts from the novel written by John Steinbeck and the short biography, and then answer the questions.&nbsp;</strong><br>
<br>
Extract A:&nbsp;<strong>Of Mice and Men</strong><br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Lennie lumbered to his feet and disappeared into the brush. George lay where he was and whistled softly to himself. There were sounds of splashings down the river in the direction Lennie had taken. George stopped whistling and listened. ‘Poor bastard’ he said softly and then went on whistling again.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;In a moment Lennie came crashing back through the brush. He carried one small willow stick in his hand. George sat up. ‘Awright’ he said brusquely. ‘Gi’me that mouse.’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;But Lennie made an elaborate pantomime of innocence. ‘What mouse, George? I ain’t go no mouse.’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;George held out his hand. ‘Come on. Give it to me. You ain’t puttin’ nothing over.’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Lennie hesitated, backed away, looked wildly at the brush line as though he contemplated running for his freedom. George said coldly: ‘You gonna give me that mouse or do I have to sock you?’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;‘Give you what, George?’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;‘You know damn well what. I want that mouse.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Lennie reluctantly reached into his pocket. His voice broke a little. ‘I don’t know why I can’t keep it. It ain’t nobody’s mouse. I didn’t steal it. I found it lyin’ right beside the road.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;George’s hand remained outstretched imperiously. Slowly, like a terrier who doesn’t want to bring a ball to his master, Lennie approached, drew back, approached again. George snapped his fingers sharply, and at the sound Lennie laid the mouse in his hand.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;‘I wasn’t doing nothing bad with it, George. Jus’ stroking it.’ George stood up and threw the mouse as far as he could into the darkening brush., and then stepped to the pool and washed his hands. ‘You crazy fool. Don’t you think that I could see your feet was wet where you went across the river to get it?’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;He heard Lennie’s whimpering cry and wheeled about.&nbsp; ‘Blubbering like a baby? A big guy like you!’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Lennie’s lip quivered and tears started in his eyes. ‘Aw, Lennie!’ George put his hand on Lennie’s shoulder. ‘I ain’t taking it away jus’ for meanness. That mouse ain’t fresh; and besides you’ve broke it pettin’ it. You get another mouse that’s fresh and I’ll let you keep it a while.’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Lennie sat on the ground and hung his head dejectedly. ‘I don’t know where there is&nbsp; no other mouse. I remember a lady used to give them to me – ever’one she’s got. But that lady ain’t here.’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;George scoffed. ‘Lady, huh? Don’t even remember who that lady was. That was your own Aunt Clara. An’ she stopped givin’ them to ya. You always killed them.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Lennie looked sadly up at him ‘They was so little,’ he said apologetically. ‘I’d pet them and pretty soon they bit my fingers and I pinched their heads a little and then they was dead – because they was so little.’<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A and B), read the two extracts from the novel written by John Steinbeck and the short biography, and then answer the questions.</strong><br>
<br>
Extract B:&nbsp;<strong>John Steinbeck</strong><br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;John Ernst Steinbeck Jr ; (February 27, 1902 – December 20, 1968) was an American writer and the 1962 Nobel Prize in Literature winner "for his realistic and imaginative writings, combining as they do sympathetic humour and keen social perception." He has been called "a giant of American letters."<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;During his writing career, he authored 33 books, with one book coauthored alongside Edward Ricketts, including 16 novels, six non-fiction books, and two collections of short stories. He is widely known for the comic novels Tortilla Flat (1935) and Cannery Row (1945), the multi-generation epic East of Eden (1952), and the novellas The Red Pony (1933) and Of Mice and Men (1937). The Pulitzer Prize–winning The Grapes of Wrath (1939) is considered Steinbeck's masterpiece and part of the American literary canon. In the first 75 years after it was published, it sold 14 million copies.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Most of Steinbeck's work is set in central California, particularly in the Salinas Valley and the California Coast Ranges region. His works frequently explored the themes of fate and injustice, especially as applied to downtrodden or everyman protagonists.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp;George’s hand remained outstretched imperiously. Slowly, like a terrier who doesn’t want to bring a ball to his master, Lennie approached, drew back, approached again. George snapped his fingers sharply, and at the sound Lennie laid the mouse in his hand.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;‘I wasn’t doing nothing bad with it, George. Jus’ stroking it.’ George stood up and threw the mouse as far as he could into the darkening brush., and then stepped to the pool and washed his hands. ‘You crazy fool.

&nbsp; &nbsp;He heard Lennie’s whimpering cry and wheeled about.&nbsp; ‘Blubbering like a baby? A big guy like you!’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Lennie’s lip quivered and tears started in his eyes. ‘Aw, Lennie!’ George put his hand on Lennie’s shoulder. ‘I ain’t taking it away jus’ for meanness. That mouse ain’t fresh; and besides you’ve broke it pettin’ it. You get another mouse that’s fresh and I’ll let you keep it a while.’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Lennie sat on the ground and hung his head dejectedly. ‘I don’t know where there is&nbsp; no other mouse. I remember a lady used to give them to me – ever’one she’s got. But that lady ain’t here.’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;George scoffed. ‘Lady, huh? Don’t even remember who that lady was. That was your own Aunt Clara. An’ she stopped givin’ them to ya. You always killed them.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Lennie looked sadly up at him ‘They was so little,’ he said apologetically. ‘I’d pet them and pretty soon they bit my fingers and I pinched their heads a little and then they was dead – because they was so little.’<br>

Extract B: <strong>John Steinbeck</strong><br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;John Ernst Steinbeck Jr ; (February 27, 1902 – December 20, 1968) was an American writer and the 1962 Nobel Prize in Literature winner "for his realistic and imaginative writings, combining as they do sympathetic humour and keen social perception." He has been called "a giant of American letters."<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;During his writing career, he authored 33 books, with one book coauthored alongside Edward Ricketts, including 16 novels, six non-fiction books, and two collections of short stories. He is widely known for the comic novels Tortilla Flat (1935) and Cannery Row (1945), the multi-generation epic East of Eden (1952), and the novellas The Red Pony (1933) and Of Mice and Men (1937). The Pulitzer Prize–winning The Grapes of Wrath (1939) is considered Steinbeck's masterpiece and part of the American literary canon. In the first 75 years after it was published, it sold 14 million copies.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Most of Steinbeck's work is set in central California, particularly in the Salinas Valley and the California Coast Ranges region. His works frequently explored the themes of fate and injustice, especially as applied to downtrodden or everyman protagonists.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp;Lennie lumbered to his feet and disappeared into the brush. George lay where he was and whistled softly to himself. There were sounds of splashings down the river in the direction Lennie had taken. George stopped whistling and listened. ‘Poor bastard’ he said softly and then went on whistling again.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;In a moment Lennie came crashing back through the brush. He carried one small willow stick in his hand. George sat up. ‘Awright’ he said brusquely. ‘Gi’me that mouse.’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;But Lennie made an elaborate pantomime of innocence. ‘What mouse, George? I ain’t go no mouse.’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;George held out his hand. ‘Come on. Give it to me. You ain’t puttin’ nothing over.’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Lennie hesitated, backed away, looked wildly at the brush line as though he contemplated running for his freedom. George said coldly: ‘You gonna give me that mouse or do I have to sock you?’<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp;John Ernst Steinbeck Jr ; (February 27, 1902 – December 20, 1968) was an American writer and the 1962 Nobel Prize in Literature winner "for his realistic and imaginative writings, combining as they do sympathetic humour and keen social perception." He has been called "a giant of American letters."<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;During his writing career, he authored 33 books, with one book coauthored alongside Edward Ricketts, including 16 novels, six non-fiction books, and two collections of short stories. He is widely known for the comic novels Tortilla Flat (1935) and Cannery Row (1945), the multi-generation epic East of Eden (1952), and the novellas The Red Pony (1933) and Of Mice and Men (1937). The Pulitzer Prize–winning The Grapes of Wrath (1939) is considered Steinbeck's masterpiece and part of the American literary canon. In the first 75 years after it was published, it sold 14 million copies.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Most of Steinbeck's work is set in central California, particularly in the Salinas Valley and the California Coast Ranges region. His works frequently explored the themes of fate and injustice, especially as applied to downtrodden or everyman protagonists.<br>

<br>
Extract A: <strong>Of Mice and Men</strong>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Lennie lumbered to his feet and disappeared into the brush. George lay where he was and whistled softly to himself. There were sounds of splashings down the river in the direction Lennie had taken. George stopped whistling and listened. ‘Poor bastard’ he said softly and then went on whistling again.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;In a moment Lennie came crashing back through the brush. He carried one small willow stick in his hand. George sat up. ‘Awright’ he said brusquely. ‘Gi’me that mouse.’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;But Lennie made an elaborate pantomime of innocence. ‘What mouse, George? I ain’t go no mouse.’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;George held out his hand. ‘Come on. Give it to me. You ain’t puttin’ nothing over.’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Lennie hesitated, backed away, looked wildly at the brush line as though he contemplated running for his freedom. George said coldly: ‘You gonna give me that mouse or do I have to sock you?’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;‘Give you what, George?’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;‘You know damn well what. I want that mouse.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Lennie reluctantly reached into his pocket. His voice broke a little. ‘I don’t know why I can’t keep it. It ain’t nobody’s mouse. I didn’t steal it. I found it lyin’ right beside the road.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;George’s hand remained outstretched imperiously. Slowly, like a terrier who doesn’t want to bring a ball to his master, Lennie approached, drew back, approached again. George snapped his fingers sharply, and at the sound Lennie laid the mouse in his hand.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;‘I wasn’t doing nothing bad with it, George. Jus’ stroking it.’ George stood up and threw the mouse as far as he could into the darkening brush., and then stepped to the pool and washed his hands. ‘You crazy fool. Don’t you think that I could see your feet was wet where you went across the river to get it?’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;He heard Lennie’s whimpering cry and wheeled about.&nbsp; ‘Blubbering like a baby? A big guy like you!’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Lennie’s lip quivered and tears started in his eyes. ‘Aw, Lennie!’ George put his hand on Lennie’s shoulder. ‘I ain’t taking it away jus’ for meanness. That mouse ain’t fresh; and besides you’ve broke it pettin’ it. You get another mouse that’s fresh and I’ll let you keep it a while.’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Lennie sat on the ground and hung his head dejectedly. ‘I don’t know where there is&nbsp; no other mouse. I remember a lady used to give them to me – ever’one she’s got. But that lady ain’t here.’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;George scoffed. ‘Lady, huh? Don’t even remember who that lady was. That was your own Aunt Clara. An’ she stopped givin’ them to ya. You always killed them.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Lennie looked sadly up at him ‘They was so little,’ he said apologetically. ‘I’d pet them and pretty soon they bit my fingers and I pinched their heads a little and then they was dead – because they was so little.’<br>

<br>
Extract A:&nbsp;<strong>Of Mice and Men</strong><br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Lennie lumbered to his feet and disappeared into the brush. George lay where he was and whistled softly to himself. There were sounds of splashings down the river in the direction Lennie had taken. George stopped whistling and listened. ‘Poor bastard’ he said softly and then went on whistling again.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;In a moment Lennie came crashing back through the brush. He carried one small willow stick in his hand. George sat up. ‘Awright’ he said brusquely. ‘Gi’me that mouse.’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;But Lennie made an elaborate pantomime of innocence. ‘What mouse, George? I ain’t go no mouse.’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;George held out his hand. ‘Come on. Give it to me. You ain’t puttin’ nothing over.’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Lennie hesitated, backed away, looked wildly at the brush line as though he contemplated running for his freedom. George said coldly: ‘You gonna give me that mouse or do I have to sock you?’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;‘Give you what, George?’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;‘You know damn well what. I want that mouse.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Lennie reluctantly reached into his pocket. His voice broke a little. ‘I don’t know why I can’t keep it. It ain’t nobody’s mouse. I didn’t steal it. I found it lyin’ right beside the road.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;George’s hand remained outstretched imperiously. Slowly, like a terrier who doesn’t want to bring a ball to his master, Lennie approached, drew back, approached again. George snapped his fingers sharply, and at the sound Lennie laid the mouse in his hand.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;‘I wasn’t doing nothing bad with it, George. Jus’ stroking it.’ George stood up and threw the mouse as far as he could into the darkening brush., and then stepped to the pool and washed his hands. ‘You crazy fool. Don’t you think that I could see your feet was wet where you went across the river to get it?’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;He heard Lennie’s whimpering cry and wheeled about.&nbsp; ‘Blubbering like a baby? A big guy like you!’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Lennie’s lip quivered and tears started in his eyes. ‘Aw, Lennie!’ George put his hand on Lennie’s shoulder. ‘I ain’t taking it away jus’ for meanness. That mouse ain’t fresh; and besides you’ve broke it pettin’ it. You get another mouse that’s fresh and I’ll let you keep it a while.’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Lennie sat on the ground and hung his head dejectedly. ‘I don’t know where there is&nbsp; no other mouse. I remember a lady used to give them to me – ever’one she’s got. But that lady ain’t here.’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;George scoffed. ‘Lady, huh? Don’t even remember who that lady was. That was your own Aunt Clara. An’ she stopped givin’ them to ya. You always killed them.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Lennie looked sadly up at him ‘They was so little,’ he said apologetically. ‘I’d pet them and pretty soon they bit my fingers and I pinched their heads a little and then they was dead – because they was so little.’<br>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A and B), read the two extracts from the novel written by John Steinbeck and the short biography, and then answer the questions.</strong><br>
<br>
Extract B: <strong>John Steinbeck</strong><br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;John Ernst Steinbeck Jr ; (February 27, 1902 – December 20, 1968) was an American writer and the 1962 Nobel Prize in Literature winner "for his realistic and imaginative writings, combining as they do sympathetic humour and keen social perception." He has been called "a giant of American letters."<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;During his writing career, he authored 33 books, with one book coauthored alongside Edward Ricketts, including 16 novels, six non-fiction books, and two collections of short stories. He is widely known for the comic novels Tortilla Flat (1935) and Cannery Row (1945), the multi-generation epic East of Eden (1952), and the novellas The Red Pony (1933) and Of Mice and Men (1937). The Pulitzer Prize–winning The Grapes of Wrath (1939) is considered Steinbeck's masterpiece and part of the American literary canon. In the first 75 years after it was published, it sold 14 million copies.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Most of Steinbeck's work is set in central California, particularly in the Salinas Valley and the California Coast Ranges region. His works frequently explored the themes of fate and injustice, especially as applied to downtrodden or everyman protagonists.<br>

Send a signal that she's hanging all her hopes on the stars<br>

          <strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To the Moon and Back</strong>
        </p>
        <p>She's taking her time making up the reasons<br>
To justify all the hurt inside<br>
Guess she knows from the smiles and the look in their eyes<br>
Everyone's got a theory about the bitter one<br>
They're saying Mama never loved her much<br>
And Daddy never keeps in touch<br>
That's why she shies away from human affection<br>
But somewhere in a private place<br>
She packs her bags for <span class="txt-underline"><strong>outer space</strong></span><br>
And now she's waiting for the right kind of pilot&nbsp;<br>
To come (and she'll say to him)<br>
She's saying<br>
<br>
I would fly you to the moon and back<br>
If you'll be if you'll be my baby<br>
Got a ticket for a world where we belong<br>
So would you be my baby<br>
<br>
Ooh-ooh<br>
<br>
She can't remember a time&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
When she felt needed<br>
If love was red then she was colour-blind<br>
All her friends they've been tried for treason<br>
And crimes that were never defined<br>
She's saying Love is like a barren place<br>
And reaching out for human faith is<br>
Is like a journey I just don't have a map for<br>
So baby gonna take a dive and push the shift to overdrive<br>
Send a signal that she's hanging all her hopes on the stars<br>
(What a pleasant dream) just saying<br>
<br>
I would fly you to the moon and back<br>
If you'll be if you'll be my baby<br>
Got a ticket for a world where we belong<br>
So would you be my baby</p>

          <strong>The Great Plague 1665 – the Black Death</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Ben Johnson</em><br><br><strong>15</strong>&nbsp; ………&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In two successive years of the 17th century London suffered two terrible disasters. In the spring and summer of 1665 an outbreak of Bubonic Plague spread from parish to parish until thousands had died and the huge pits dug to receive the bodies were full. In 1666 the Great Fire of London destroyed much of the centre of London, but also helped to kill off some of the black rats and fleas that carried the plague bacillus.</p>
        <p><strong>16&nbsp; </strong>………&nbsp; Bubonic Plague was known as the Black Death and had been known in England for centuries. The plague started in the East, possibly China, and quickly spread through Europe. The plague lasted in London until the late autumn when the colder weather helped kill off the fleas. The King, Charles II and his Court left London and fled to Oxford. Those people who could sent their families away from London during these months, but the poor had no recourse but to stay. In his diary, Samuel Pepys gives a vivid account of the empty streets in London, as all who could had left in an attempt to flee the pestilence.</p>
        <p><strong>17&nbsp; </strong>………&nbsp; Whole communities were wiped out and corpses littered the streets as there was no one left to bury them. It began in London in the poor, overcrowded parish of St. Giles-in-the-Field. It started slowly at first but by May of 1665, 43 had died. In June, 6137 people died, in July, 17036 people and at its peak in August, 31159 people died. In all, 15% of the population perished during that terrible summer. It was a ghastly disease. The victim’s skin turned black in patches and inflamed glands or ‘buboes’ in the groin, combined with compulsive vomiting, swollen tongue and splitting headaches made it a horrible, agonizing killer. Incubation took a mere four to six days and when the plague appeared in a household, the house was sealed, thus condemning the whole family to death! These houses were distinguished by a painted red cross on the door and the words, ‘Lord have mercy on us’. At night the corpses were brought out in answer to the cry, ’Bring out your dead’, put in a cart and taken away to the plague pits. One called the Great Pit was at Aldgate in London and another at Finsbury Fields.</p>
        <p><strong>18&nbsp; </strong>………&nbsp; It was believed that holding a posy of flowers to the nose kept away the plague and to this day judges are still given a nose-gay to carry on ceremonial occasions as a protection against the plague! A song about the plague is still sung by children. ‘Ring-a-ring of roses‘ describes in great detail the symptoms of the plague and ends with ‘All fall down’. The last word, ‘dead’, is omitted today.</p>
        <p><strong>19&nbsp; </strong>………&nbsp; The plague spread to many parts of England. York was one city badly affected. The plague victims were buried outside the city walls and it is said that they have never been disturbed since then, as a precaution against a resurgence of the dreaded plague. The grassy embankments below the city walls are the sites of these plague pits. In some towns and villages in England there are still the old market crosses which have a depression at the foot of the stone cross. This was filled with vinegar during times of plague as it was believed that vinegar would kill any germs on the coins and so contain the disease.</p>
        <p><strong>20&nbsp; </strong>………&nbsp; Over the centuries Bubonic Plague has broken out in Europe and the Far East. In 1900 there were outbreaks of plague in places as far apart as Portugal and Australia. Influenza seems to be the modern form of plague. At the end of World War One an influenza outbreak circled the world during 1918 – 1919. Within a year 20 million people had died world-wide.</p>

          <strong>The Great Plague 1665 – the Black Death</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Ben Johnson</em><br><br><strong>15</strong>&nbsp; ………&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In two successive years of the 17th century London suffered two terrible disasters. In the spring and summer of 1665 an outbreak of Bubonic Plague spread from parish to parish until thousands had died and the huge pits dug to receive the bodies were full. In 1666 the Great Fire of London destroyed much of the centre of London, but also helped to kill off some of the black rats and fleas that carried the plague bacillus.</p>
        <p><strong>16&nbsp; </strong>………&nbsp; Bubonic Plague was known as the Black Death and had been known in England for centuries. The plague started in the East, possibly China, and quickly spread through Europe. The plague lasted in London until the late autumn when the colder weather helped kill off the fleas. The King, Charles II and his Court left London and fled to Oxford. Those people who could sent their families away from London during these months, but the poor had no recourse but to stay. In his diary, Samuel Pepys gives a vivid account of the empty streets in London, as all who could had left in an attempt to flee the pestilence.</p>
        <p><strong>17&nbsp; </strong>………&nbsp; Whole communities were wiped out and corpses littered the streets as there was no one left to bury them. It began in London in the poor, overcrowded parish of St. Giles-in-the-Field. It started slowly at first but by May of 1665, 43 had died. In June, 6137 people died, in July, 17036 people and at its peak in August, 31159 people died. In all, 15% of the population perished during that terrible summer. It was a ghastly disease. The victim’s skin turned black in patches and inflamed glands or ‘buboes’ in the groin, combined with compulsive vomiting, swollen tongue and splitting headaches made it a horrible, agonizing killer. Incubation took a mere four to six days and when the plague appeared in a household, the house was sealed, thus condemning the whole family to death! These houses were distinguished by a painted red cross on the door and the words, ‘Lord have mercy on us’. At night the corpses were brought out in answer to the cry, ’Bring out your dead’, put in a cart and taken away to the plague pits. One called the Great Pit was at Aldgate in London and another at Finsbury Fields.</p>
        <p><strong>18&nbsp; </strong>………&nbsp; It was believed that holding a posy of flowers to the nose kept away the plague and to this day judges are still given a nose-gay to carry on ceremonial occasions as a protection against the plague! A song about the plague is still sung by children. ‘Ring-a-ring of roses‘ describes in great detail the symptoms of the plague and ends with ‘All fall down’. The last word, ‘dead’, is omitted today.</p>
        <p><strong>19&nbsp; </strong>………&nbsp; The plague spread to many parts of England. York was one city badly affected. The plague victims were buried outside the city walls and it is said that they have never been disturbed since then, as a precaution against a resurgence of the dreaded plague. The grassy embankments below the city walls are the sites of these plague pits. In some towns and villages in England there are still the old market crosses which have a depression at the foot of the stone cross. This was filled with vinegar during times of plague as it was believed that vinegar would kill any germs on the coins and so contain the disease.</p>
        <p><strong>20&nbsp; </strong>………&nbsp; Over the centuries Bubonic Plague has broken out in Europe and the Far East. In 1900 there were outbreaks of plague in places as far apart as Portugal and Australia. Influenza seems to be the modern form of plague. At the end of World War One an influenza outbreak circled the world during 1918 – 1919. Within a year 20 million people had died world-wide.</p>

          <strong>The Great Plague 1665 – the Black Death</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Ben Johnson</em><br><br><strong>15</strong>&nbsp; ………&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In two successive years of the 17th century London suffered two terrible disasters. In the spring and summer of 1665 an outbreak of Bubonic Plague spread from parish to parish until thousands had died and the huge pits dug to receive the bodies were full. In 1666 the Great Fire of London destroyed much of the centre of London, but also helped to kill off some of the black rats and fleas that carried the plague bacillus.</p>

          <strong>The Great Plague 1665 – the Black Death</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Ben Johnson</em><br><br><strong>15</strong>&nbsp; ………&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In two successive years of the 17th century London suffered two terrible disasters. In the spring and summer of 1665 an outbreak of Bubonic Plague spread from parish to parish until thousands had died and the huge pits dug to receive the bodies were full. In 1666 the Great Fire of London destroyed much of the centre of London, but also helped to kill off some of the black rats and fleas that carried the plague bacillus.</p>
        <p><strong>16&nbsp; </strong>………&nbsp; Bubonic Plague was known as the Black Death and had been known in England for centuries. The plague started in the East, possibly China, and quickly spread through Europe. The plague lasted in London until the late autumn when the colder weather helped kill off the fleas. The King, Charles II and his Court left London and fled to Oxford. Those people who could sent their families away from London during these months, but the poor had no recourse but to stay. In his diary, Samuel Pepys gives a vivid account of the empty streets in London, as all who could had left in an attempt to flee the pestilence.</p>
        <p><strong>17&nbsp; </strong>………&nbsp; Whole communities were wiped out and corpses littered the streets as there was no one left to bury them. It began in London in the poor, overcrowded parish of St. Giles-in-the-Field. It started slowly at first but by May of 1665, 43 had died. In June, 6137 people died, in July, 17036 people and at its peak in August, 31159 people died. In all, 15% of the population perished during that terrible summer. It was a ghastly disease. The victim’s skin turned black in patches and inflamed glands or ‘buboes’ in the groin, combined with compulsive vomiting, swollen tongue and splitting headaches made it a horrible, agonizing killer. Incubation took a mere four to six days and when the plague appeared in a household, the house was sealed, thus condemning the whole family to death! These houses were distinguished by a painted red cross on the door and the words, ‘Lord have mercy on us’. At night the corpses were brought out in answer to the cry, ’Bring out your dead’, put in a cart and taken away to the plague pits. One called the Great Pit was at Aldgate in London and another at Finsbury Fields.</p>
        <p><strong>18&nbsp; </strong>………&nbsp; It was believed that holding a posy of flowers to the nose kept away the plague and to this day judges are still given a nose-gay to carry on ceremonial occasions as a protection against the plague! A song about the plague is still sung by children. ‘Ring-a-ring of roses‘ describes in great detail the symptoms of the plague and ends with ‘All fall down’. The last word, ‘dead’, is omitted today.</p>
        <p><strong>19&nbsp; </strong>………&nbsp; The plague spread to many parts of England. York was one city badly affected. The plague victims were buried outside the city walls and it is said that they have never been disturbed since then, as a precaution against a resurgence of the dreaded plague. The grassy embankments below the city walls are the sites of these plague pits. In some towns and villages in England there are still the old market crosses which have a depression at the foot of the stone cross. This was filled with vinegar during times of plague as it was believed that vinegar would kill any germs on the coins and so contain the disease.</p>
        <p><strong>20&nbsp; </strong>………&nbsp; Over the centuries Bubonic Plague has broken out in Europe and the Far East. In 1900 there were outbreaks of plague in places as far apart as Portugal and Australia. Influenza seems to be the modern form of plague. At the end of World War One an influenza outbreak circled the world during 1918 – 1919. Within a year 20 million people had died world-wide.</p>

          <strong>The Great Plague 1665 – the Black Death</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Ben Johnson</em><br><br><strong>15</strong>&nbsp; ………&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In two successive years of the 17th century London suffered two terrible disasters. In the spring and summer of 1665 an outbreak of Bubonic Plague spread from parish to parish until thousands had died and the huge pits dug to receive the bodies were full. In 1666 the Great Fire of London destroyed much of the centre of London, but also helped to kill off some of the black rats and fleas that carried the plague bacillus.</p>
        <p><strong>16&nbsp; </strong>………&nbsp; Bubonic Plague was known as the Black Death and had been known in England for centuries. The plague started in the East, possibly China, and quickly spread through Europe. The plague lasted in London until the late autumn when the colder weather helped kill off the fleas. The King, Charles II and his Court left London and fled to Oxford. Those people who could sent their families away from London during these months, but the poor had no recourse but to stay. In his diary, Samuel Pepys gives a vivid account of the empty streets in London, as all who could had left in an attempt to flee the pestilence.</p>
        <p><strong>17&nbsp; </strong>………&nbsp; Whole communities were wiped out and corpses littered the streets as there was no one left to bury them. It began in London in the poor, overcrowded parish of St. Giles-in-the-Field. It started slowly at first but by May of 1665, 43 had died. In June, 6137 people died, in July, 17036 people and at its peak in August, 31159 people died. In all, 15% of the population perished during that terrible summer. It was a ghastly disease. The victim’s skin turned black in patches and inflamed glands or ‘buboes’ in the groin, combined with compulsive vomiting, swollen tongue and splitting headaches made it a horrible, agonizing killer. Incubation took a mere four to six days and when the plague appeared in a household, the house was sealed, thus condemning the whole family to death! These houses were distinguished by a painted red cross on the door and the words, ‘Lord have mercy on us’. At night the corpses were brought out in answer to the cry, ’Bring out your dead’, put in a cart and taken away to the plague pits. One called the Great Pit was at Aldgate in London and another at Finsbury Fields.</p>
        <p><strong>18&nbsp; </strong>………&nbsp; It was believed that holding a posy of flowers to the nose kept away the plague and to this day judges are still given a nose-gay to carry on ceremonial occasions as a protection against the plague! A song about the plague is still sung by children. ‘Ring-a-ring of roses‘ describes in great detail the symptoms of the plague and ends with ‘All fall down’. The last word, ‘dead’, is omitted today.</p>
        <p><strong>19&nbsp; </strong>………&nbsp; The plague spread to many parts of England. York was one city badly affected. The plague victims were buried outside the city walls and it is said that they have never been disturbed since then, as a precaution against a resurgence of the dreaded plague. The grassy embankments below the city walls are the sites of these plague pits. In some towns and villages in England there are still the old market crosses which have a depression at the foot of the stone cross. This was filled with vinegar during times of plague as it was believed that vinegar would kill any germs on the coins and so contain the disease.</p>
        <p><strong>20&nbsp; </strong>………&nbsp; Over the centuries Bubonic Plague has broken out in Europe and the Far East. In 1900 there were outbreaks of plague in places as far apart as Portugal and Australia. Influenza seems to be the modern form of plague. At the end of World War One an influenza outbreak circled the world during 1918 – 1919. Within a year 20 million people had died world-wide.</p>

When I was a child, I could spend all day at Shining Time Station, the fictive train depot with its own eponymous TV show, where Thomas the Tank Engine and all his plate-faced locomotive friends worked and lived. To my undeveloped brain, each episode seemed like a beautiful daydream, in which an orderly, magical, trance-inducing universe ticked on under bluebird skies. For company, there was the Conductor, voiced first by Ringo Starr and later by George Carlin, and then the trains: gentle blue Edward, moody green Henry, big strong Gordon, little red James, and, of course, Thomas, with his pointed eyebrows and perpetual smile. The show, which included segments that had first aired on a British show called “Thomas &amp; Friends,” began airing on PBS in 1989, and each episode opened with a Joe Cocker-ish theme song: “Reach for the steam, reach for the whistle, go where the railway runs/ Reach for the words, reach for the story, follow the rainbow sun.” I would hum along. Though “Shining Time Station” ended in the nineties, Thomas the Tank Engine shows have aired almost continuously since. “Thomas &amp; Friends” has gone on in some form for twenty seasons, two of which featured Alec Baldwin as the narrator.<br>

The steam engine was one of the most important inventions of the Industrial Revolution. Steam engines were used in all sorts of applications including factories, mines, locomotives, and steamboats. Steam engines use hot steam from boiling water to drive a piston (or pistons) back and forth. The movement of the piston was then used to power a machine or turn a wheel. To create the steam, most steam engines heated the water by burning coal. The steam engine helped to power the Industrial Revolution. Before steam power, most factories and mills were powered by water, wind, horse, or man. Water was a good source of power, but factories had to be located near a river. Both water and wind power could be unreliable as sometimes rivers could dry up during a drought or freeze during the winter and wind didn't always blow.<br>

Brought to contemporary fame through Wes Anderson’s movie Darjeeling Limited, you might be surprised to read that the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway steam train is not just a figment of his dazzling imagination. Quite on the contrary - the precipice-topping train is actually UNESCO-listed and has been operating in some form since the late 19th century. Affectionately nicknamed “toy train” by locals, the legendary train zigzags through the breathtaking scenery of cloud-topped valleys, undulating foothills and lush tea plantations so characteristic of the Eastern Himalayas and is sure to provide you with a mesmerizing and once-in-a-lifetime experience.<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong> ^}<br>
The steam engine kickstarted a new era in transportation. It allowed passengers to travel in comfort and speed, with many amenities travelers have never seen before. Freight was easily transported across land, as the steam locomotive was extremely powerful, as even early steam engines could pull up to thirty cars. Before the advent of the steam locomotive the only option for travel was by horseback or maritime. For many, railways were much more convenient as they were easily accessible, and in most cases, quicker than maritime travel. When steam locomotives were first introduced, people around that time were in awe of its power and size, as in the early nineteenth century, there were not many machines with similar power and size. People began to catch on to the idea of the steam engine, and many railways were built throughout the world. The United States, seeking western expansion, built towns and businesses along the railway to ship their goods and travel. The steam locomotive did not just change transportation, it changed the way people lived.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

Brought to contemporary fame through Wes Anderson’s movie Darjeeling Limited, you might be surprised to read that the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway steam train is not just a figment of his dazzling imagination. Quite on the contrary - the precipice-topping train is actually UNESCO-listed and has been operating in some form since the late 19th century. Affectionately nicknamed “toy train” by locals, the legendary train zigzags through the breathtaking scenery of cloud-topped valleys, undulating foothills and lush tea plantations so characteristic of the Eastern Himalayas and is sure to provide you with a mesmerizing and once-in-a-lifetime experience.<br>

The steam engine kickstarted a new era in transportation. It allowed passengers to travel in comfort and speed, with many amenities travelers have never seen before. Freight was easily transported across land, as the steam locomotive was extremely powerful, as even early steam engines could pull up to thirty cars. Before the advent of the steam locomotive the only option for travel was by horseback or maritime. For many, railways were much more convenient as they were easily accessible, and in most cases, quicker than maritime travel. When steam locomotives were first introduced, people around that time were in awe of its power and size, as in the early nineteenth century, there were not many machines with similar power and size. People began to catch on to the idea of the steam engine, and many railways were built throughout the world. The United States, seeking western expansion, built towns and businesses along the railway to ship their goods and travel. The steam locomotive did not just change transportation, it changed the way people lived.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

When I was a child, I could spend all day at Shining Time Station, the fictive train depot with its own eponymous TV show, where Thomas the Tank Engine and all his plate-faced locomotive friends worked and lived. To my undeveloped brain, each episode seemed like a beautiful daydream, in which an orderly, magical, trance-inducing universe ticked on under bluebird skies. For company, there was the Conductor, voiced first by Ringo Starr and later by George Carlin, and then the trains: gentle blue Edward, moody green Henry, big strong Gordon, little red James, and, of course, Thomas, with his pointed eyebrows and perpetual smile. The show, which included segments that had first aired on a British show called “Thomas &amp; Friends,” began airing on PBS in 1989, and each episode opened with a Joe Cocker-ish theme song: “Reach for the steam, reach for the whistle, go where the railway runs/ Reach for the words, reach for the story, follow the rainbow sun.” I would hum along. Though “Shining Time Station” ended in the nineties, Thomas the Tank Engine shows have aired almost continuously since. “Thomas &amp; Friends” has gone on in some form for twenty seasons, two of which featured Alec Baldwin as the narrator.<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
The steam engine was one of the most important inventions of the Industrial Revolution. Steam engines were used in all sorts of applications including factories, mines, locomotives, and steamboats. Steam engines use hot steam from boiling water to drive a piston (or pistons) back and forth. The movement of the piston was then used to power a machine or turn a wheel. To create the steam, most steam engines heated the water by burning coal. The steam engine helped to power the Industrial Revolution. Before steam power, most factories and mills were powered by water, wind, horse, or man. Water was a good source of power, but factories had to be located near a river. Both water and wind power could be unreliable as sometimes rivers could dry up during a drought or freeze during the winter and wind didn't always blow.<br>
