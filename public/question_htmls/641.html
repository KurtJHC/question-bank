            <strong>THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GUITAR</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The association of the classic guitar with Spain is justified because of its centuries of popularity there. To refer to the instrument as a “Spanish guitar,” however, would erroneously limit its interest and acceptance as a major musical instrument. At no time during its long history, which dates back to the 11<sup>th</sup> century, has the development and use of the guitar been strictly confined to one country. Recent studies reveal conclusive evidence that the guitar was not invented by Spaniards, but was developed from the ancient Greek <em>kithara</em> by Provencals circa 1000 CE, and only had four strings. The old six-string <em>vihuela</em>, so widely used in Spain for centuries before the advent of the modern guitar, is now recognised as a development of the Provencal instrument. (The European lute is sometimes mentioned in connection with the origin of the guitar. While both are plucked instruments, they are not related in basic construction or by name.) Whether or not the modern guitar is a development of the vihuela in Spain is not known, but it is recorded that the instrument was being used and developed in other European countries at the same time it was gaining prominence. In approximately 1788, a German craftsman named Jacob Otto added a sixth string to the then-popular five-string guitar. It should be noted that some of the finest guitars ever produced have come from Germany, and excellent instruments have been constructed in Spain and other countries as well. Many ordinary features of the modern classic guitar, such as the loop bridge, width of the fingerboard, and customary inner construction, were established in Spain about 150 years ago; but for the same reason the violin is not called the, “Italian violin,” simply because its general characteristics were established by Italian craftsmen, the guitar should be recognised as an international instrument that is at home in the many lands and cultures of the world.</p>

        <p>It was one of those thunderstorms that do not burst suddenly with a volley of lightning bolts and thunder, but take a great deal of time and hold back their energies for a long while. For two hours, it skulked about indecisively in the sky, with delicate sheet lightning, soft murmurs, shifting from neighbourhood to neighbourhood as if it didn’t know where it should gather its forces, and, expanding all the while, it grew and grew, finally waited again, using its irresolution to load itself with even more potent tension, and still it did not break… Nothing moved beneath the blanket. Not the slightest breeze stirred in the sultry air, not a leaf, not a particle of dust, the city lay there as if numbed, it trembled under the crippling tension, as if the city itself were the thunderstorm waiting to erupt into the sky.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And then, finally, as morning was already approaching and with it a hint of dawn, there was a bang, a single one, as violent as if the whole city were exploding. Jonathan reared up in bed. His conscious mind had not heard the bang, let alone recognised it as a clap of thunder. This was worse: in that second of awakening, it was as if the explosion had coursed like sheer terror through his body, like a terror whose source he did not know, like the fear of death. The only thing that he perceived was the reverberation of the bang, a multiple rumbling, roaring echo of thunder. It sounded as if the houses outside were collapsing like bookcases, and his first thought was: here we go, this is it, the end. And he did not mean by that simply his own end, but the end of the world. Doomsday – an earthquake, the atom bomb, or both – at any rate, the absolute end.</p>

        <p>It was one of those thunderstorms that do not burst suddenly with a volley of lightning bolts and thunder, but take a great deal of time and hold back their energies for a long while. For two hours, it skulked about indecisively in the sky, with delicate sheet lightning, soft murmurs, shifting from neighbourhood to neighbourhood as if it didn’t know where it should gather its forces, and, expanding all the while, it grew and grew, finally waited again, using its irresolution to load itself with even more potent tension, and still it did not break… Nothing moved beneath the blanket. Not the slightest breeze stirred in the sultry air, not a leaf, not a particle of dust, the city lay there as if numbed, it trembled under the crippling tension, as if the city itself were the thunderstorm waiting to erupt into the sky.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And then, finally, as morning was already approaching and with it a hint of dawn, there was a bang, a single one, as violent as if the whole city were exploding. Jonathan reared up in bed. His conscious mind had not heard the bang, let alone recognised it as a clap of thunder. This was worse: in that second of awakening, it was as if the explosion had coursed like sheer terror through his body, like a terror whose source he did not know, like the fear of death. The only thing that he perceived was the reverberation of the bang, a multiple rumbling, roaring echo of thunder. It sounded as if the houses outside were collapsing like bookcases, and his first thought was: here we go, this is it, the end. And he did not mean by that simply his own end, but the end of the world. Doomsday – an earthquake, the atom bomb, or both – at any rate, the absolute end.</p>

I cast my prayers upon the water<br>
Like breadcrumbs, to feed you peace,<br>
For to find malice where none resides<br>
Must surely herald a hurting heart<br>

So when you were not love to me,<br>

        <p>Use the extract from Duncan Ball’s <span class="txt-underline"><em>Selby’s Selection</em></span> below to answer Questions 24 - 28.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“If this new invention of mine takes off then no one will ever have to go to the toilet again!” Dr Trifle announced.<br>
<br>
Selby lay nearby watching as Mrs Trifle took a tray of her famous chocolate and vanilla biscuits out of the oven. “But everyone has to go to the toilet,” Mrs Trifle said.<br>
<br>
“I don’t mean people won’t have to <em>go </em>to the toilet anymore,” Dr Trifle said. “What I’m saying is that now they won’t have to go<em> to the toilet.</em>”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“You just said the same thing twice.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“No, I didn’t. <em>Going</em> to the toilet is completely different from going <em>to the toilet.</em>”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">****</p>
        <p>Dr Trifle took a little black plastic thing out of his pocket. It looked like a TV remote control but with a joystick in the middle. “While we’re waiting for Jetty, I could show you my new toilet invention,” he said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“The one that makes going to the toilet unnecessary?” Mrs Trifle said.<br>
<br>
“That’s the one, the perfect toilet for busy people,” Dr Trifle said, pushing the ON button on the controls. Suddenly there was a whirring and beeping from down the hallway. Dr Trifle grabbed the joystick and pushed it forward. Selby jumped to his feet as a toilet came tearing out of the bathroom, sped down the hall, and screeched to a stop outside the kitchen. Mrs Trifle jumped back.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“What in heaven’s name is that?!” she cried.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“It’s my TOOT.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“What do you mean <em>your </em>toot? That’s <em>our </em>toot, only it’s got wheels on it!”<br>
<br>
“Well yes but you don’t understand. I call it my Transmigratory Orbital Orienting Toilet – T-O-O-T. It’s the world’s first travelling toot,” said Dr Trifle proudly. “With this you’ll never have to go to the toilet again because the toilet will come to you!”</p>

        <p>“If this new invention of mine takes off then no one will ever have to go to the toilet again!” Dr Trifle announced.<br>
<br>
Selby lay nearby watching as Mrs Trifle took a tray of her famous chocolate and vanilla biscuits out of the oven. “But everyone has to go to the toilet,” Mrs Trifle said.<br>
<br>
“I don’t mean people won’t have to <em>go </em>to the toilet anymore,” Dr Trifle said. “What I’m saying is that now they won’t have to go<em> to the toilet.</em>”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“You just said the same thing twice.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“No, I didn’t. <em>Going</em> to the toilet is completely different from going <em>to the toilet.</em>”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Dr Trifle took a little black plastic thing out of his pocket. It looked like a TV remote control but with a joystick in the middle. “While we’re waiting for Jetty, I could show you my new toilet invention,” he said.</p>

        <p>Use the extract from Duncan Ball’s <span class="txt-underline"><em>Selby’s Selection</em></span> below to answer Questions 24 - 28.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“If this new invention of mine takes off then no one will ever have to go to the toilet again!” Dr Trifle announced.<br>
<br>
Selby lay nearby watching as Mrs Trifle took a tray of her famous chocolate and vanilla biscuits out of the oven. “But everyone has to go to the toilet,” Mrs Trifle said.<br>
<br>
“I don’t mean people won’t have to <em>go </em>to the toilet anymore,” Dr Trifle said. “What I’m saying is that now they won’t have to go<em> to the toilet.</em>”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“You just said the same thing twice.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“No, I didn’t. <em>Going</em> to the toilet is completely different from going <em>to the toilet.</em>”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">****</p>
        <p>Dr Trifle took a little black plastic thing out of his pocket. It looked like a TV remote control but with a joystick in the middle. “While we’re waiting for Jetty, I could show you my new toilet invention,” he said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“The one that makes going to the toilet unnecessary?” Mrs Trifle said.<br>
<br>
“That’s the one, the perfect toilet for busy people,” Dr Trifle said, pushing the ON button on the controls. Suddenly there was a whirring and beeping from down the hallway. Dr Trifle grabbed the joystick and pushed it forward. Selby jumped to his feet as a toilet came tearing out of the bathroom, sped down the hall, and screeched to a stop outside the kitchen. Mrs Trifle jumped back.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“What in heaven’s name is that?!” she cried.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“It’s my TOOT.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“What do you mean <em>your </em>toot? That’s <em>our </em>toot, only it’s got wheels on it!”<br>
<br>
“Well yes but you don’t understand. I call it my Transmigratory Orbital Orienting Toilet – T-O-O-T. It’s the world’s first travelling toot,” said Dr Trifle proudly. “With this you’ll never have to go to the toilet again because the toilet will come to you!”</p>

        <p>Read the following extract from Rebecca Priestley’s memoir to answer Questions 31-35.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I started school in London. As a newly single mother with two pre-school children, my mother, Ruth, had embraced the freedoms of the 1970s, and had taken us to live in London for six months where she took sculpture and dance classes and sold hand-painted and embroidered clothes to north London boutiques. When we returned to our rented house on a hillside acre in the ‘semi-rural’ suburb of Korokoro in Wellington, a young family were living in one room of the house: Jane and Paul and baby Toby.</p>
        <p>‘This is&nbsp;<em>our</em>&nbsp;house,’ I proclaimed as they greeted us at the door. My hostility was short-lived—it was fun having a baby around and soon sharing a house with another family was what we did. We had returned to New Zealand in summer, but it was months before Rachel and I would venture further than the rectangle of cracked concrete outside the back door, the size of our London backyard. Once I was confident in our expanse of garden I would run from the house, past an enormous veggie patch, past an enormous kōwhai tree that always bloomed in time for Rachel’s birthday, past a high bank crawling with banana passionfruit and topped by damson trees. At the end of the garden, next to a line of trees that marked the next-door boundary, was an old wooden shed. If you dared look inside, you could see—through the darkness and the ubiquitous spiders’ webs—dead seagulls hanging from the ceiling. It was art, or somewhere in the process of becoming art.</p>
        <p>Inside the house, in Jane and Paul’s room, was a large stuffed owl looking down from a high dresser. In the living room, more birds watched me: black-and-white photographs of the birds and Paul’s own drawings, all safely behind glass.</p>
        <p>We were often taken to exhibition openings where we would inevitably have our photos taken. In the London scrapbooks Ruth made for us—they continued for a few months after our return—is a clipping from the front page of the&nbsp;<em>Dominion</em>&nbsp;from August 1973. It shows a large picture of Rachel, knees and hands on the floor, forehead resting on a block of rubber on top of two bricks. Beside the installation was a sign:&nbsp;<em>Kneel on pillow and bounce forehead against rubber until enlightened</em>. Sometimes it was Ruth’s art on show. In their coverage of a ‘preview to their exhibition of paintings’ by Ruth and Joanna Paul, the newspaper printed a photo of me, aged five, and Rachel, three, wearing embroidered clothes and looking straight at the camera. Rachel is smiling. ‘These wistful little girls attracted almost as much attention as their mum’s paintings,’ said the caption.</p>
        <p>Some of the openings I don’t need a picture of to remember. One time the architect Ian Athfield and another man—both grinning behind their beards—strode into a gallery, where the men all wore jeans and the women dresses and everyone had long hair, and poured a bucket of cold baked beans onto the floor. Straight away Rachel and Toby got down onto the floor and used their fingers to draw patterns in the beans. Toby put a few beans in his mouth. It was art. By now I knew the photographers were watching and I was too self-conscious to join in. Besides, I was the oldest. I didn’t do finger painting.</p>
        <p>Locals called our house ‘the commune’. My mother was a ‘Ms’, or just ‘Ruth’. I wore handmade or secondhand clothes and we ate brown rice and lentil curries. I didn’t even wish I was like the other kids; I just knew that I wasn’t. Being a white-socked, neat-haired girl with a Mr and a Mrs for parents and Mallowpuffs in the kitchen and a colour TV in the living room was way beyond my reach.</p>

        <p>Read the following extract from Rebecca Priestley’s memoir to answer Questions 31-35.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I started school in London. As a newly single mother with two pre-school children, my mother, Ruth, had embraced the freedoms of the 1970s, and had taken us to live in London for six months where she took sculpture and dance classes and sold hand-painted and embroidered clothes to north London boutiques. When we returned to our rented house on a hillside acre in the ‘semi-rural’ suburb of Korokoro in Wellington, a young family were living in one room of the house: Jane and Paul and baby Toby.</p>
        <p>‘This is&nbsp;<em>our</em>&nbsp;house,’ I proclaimed as they greeted us at the door. My hostility was short-lived—it was fun having a baby around and soon sharing a house with another family was what we did. We had returned to New Zealand in summer, but it was months before Rachel and I would venture further than the rectangle of cracked concrete outside the back door, the size of our London backyard. Once I was confident in our expanse of garden I would run from the house, past an enormous veggie patch, past an enormous kōwhai tree that always bloomed in time for Rachel’s birthday, past a high bank crawling with banana passionfruit and topped by damson trees. At the end of the garden, next to a line of trees that marked the next-door boundary, was an old wooden shed. If you dared look inside, you could see—through the darkness and the ubiquitous spiders’ webs—dead seagulls hanging from the ceiling. It was art, or somewhere in the process of becoming art.</p>
        <p>Inside the house, in Jane and Paul’s room, was a large stuffed owl looking down from a high dresser. In the living room, more birds watched me: black-and-white photographs of the birds and Paul’s own drawings, all safely behind glass.</p>
        <p>We were often taken to exhibition openings where we would inevitably have our photos taken. In the London scrapbooks Ruth made for us—they continued for a few months after our return—is a clipping from the front page of the&nbsp;<em>Dominion</em>&nbsp;from August 1973. It shows a large picture of Rachel, knees and hands on the floor, forehead resting on a block of rubber on top of two bricks. Beside the installation was a sign:&nbsp;<em>Kneel on pillow and bounce forehead against rubber until enlightened</em>. Sometimes it was Ruth’s art on show. In their coverage of a ‘preview to their exhibition of paintings’ by Ruth and Joanna Paul, the newspaper printed a photo of me, aged five, and Rachel, three, wearing embroidered clothes and looking straight at the camera. Rachel is smiling. ‘These wistful little girls attracted almost as much attention as their mum’s paintings,’ said the caption.</p>
        <p>Some of the openings I don’t need a picture of to remember. One time the architect Ian Athfield and another man—both grinning behind their beards—strode into a gallery, where the men all wore jeans and the women dresses and everyone had long hair, and poured a bucket of cold baked beans onto the floor. Straight away Rachel and Toby got down onto the floor and used their fingers to draw patterns in the beans. Toby put a few beans in his mouth. It was art. By now I knew the photographers were watching and I was too self-conscious to join in. Besides, I was the oldest. I didn’t do finger painting.</p>
        <p>Locals called our house ‘the commune’. My mother was a ‘Ms’, or just ‘Ruth’. I wore handmade or secondhand clothes and we ate brown rice and lentil curries. I didn’t even wish I was like the other kids; I just knew that I wasn’t. Being a white-socked, neat-haired girl with a Mr and a Mrs for parents and Mallowpuffs in the kitchen and a colour TV in the living room was way beyond my reach.</p>
