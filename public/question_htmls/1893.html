          <strong>The Witches by Roald Dahl&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>It is always a shock to discover that you are being watched when you think you are alone.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And what was this strange woman doing in our garden anyway?&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I noticed that she was wearing a small black hat and she had black gloves on her hands and the gloves came nearly up to her elbows.</p>
        <p><span class="txt-underline"><em><strong>Gloves!</strong></em></span>&nbsp;She was wearing <em><span class="txt-underline"><strong>gloves!</strong></span></em>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I froze all over.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I have a present for you,” she said, still staring at me, still smiling, still showing her teeth and gums.</p>
        <p>I didn’t answer.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Come down out of that tree, little boy,” she said, “and I shall give you the most exciting present you’ve ever had.” Her voice had a curious rasping quality. It made a sort of metallic sound, as though her throat was full of drawing pins.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Without taking her eyes from my face, she very slowly put one of those gloved hands into her purse and drew out a small green snake. She held it up for me to see.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“It’s tame,” she said.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The snake began to coil itself around her forearm. It was a brilliant green.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“If you come down here, I shall give him to you,” she said.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Oh Grandmamma, I thought, come and help me!&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then I panicked. I dropped the hammer and shot up that enormous tree like a monkey. I didn't stop until I was as high as I could possibly go, and there I stayed, quivering with fear. I couldn't see the woman now. There were layers and layers of leaves between her and me.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I stayed up there for hours and I kept very still. It began to grow dark. At last, I heard my grandmother calling my name.</p>
        <p>“I'm up here,” I shouted back.</p>
        <p>“Come down at once!” she called out. “It's past your suppertime.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Grandmamma!” I shouted. “Has that woman gone?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“What woman?” My grandmother called back.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“The woman in the black gloves!”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was silence from below. It was the silence of somebody who was too stunned to speak.</p>
        <p>“Grandmamma!” I shouted again. “Has she gone?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Yes,” my grandmother answered at last. “She's gone. I'm here, my darling. I'll look after you. You can come down now.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I climbed down. I was trembling. My grandmother enfolded me in her arms. “I've seen a witch,” I said.</p>
        <p>“Come inside,” she said. “You'll be all right with me.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She led me into the house and gave me a cup of hot cocoa with lots of sugar in it. “Tell me everything,” she said.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I told her.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>By the time I had finished, it was my grandmother who was trembling. Her face was ashy grey and I saw her glance down at that hand of hers that didn't have a thumb. “You know what this means,” she said. “It means that there is one of them in our district. From now on I'm not letting you walk alone to school.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Do you think she could be after me specially?” I asked.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“No,” she said. “I doubt that. One child is as good as any other to those creatures.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It is hardly surprising that after that I became a very witch-conscious little boy. If I happened to be alone on the road and saw a woman approaching who was wearing gloves, I would quickly skip across to the other side. And as the weather remained pretty cold during the whole of that month, nearly everybody was wearing gloves. Curiously enough though, I never saw the woman with the green snake again.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That was my first witch. But it wasn't my last.</p>

Bertie was a Goldfish,<br>
not your average pet.<br>
For unlike other Goldfish,<br>
He hated getting wet.<br>
<br>
When all the other fishies,<br>
Were swimming, having fun,<br>
Bert would slap on <span class="txt-underline"><strong>factor 12</strong></span>,<br>
And chill out in the sun.<br>
<br>
He's hiked across a mountain,<br>
And Bungee jumped in France,<br>
He's best friends with the neighbour’s cat,<br>
And he's taught him how to dance.<br>
<br>
He's raced a Formula 1 Car,<br>
And would have won a medal,<br>
But Bert's a fish, he has no feet,<br>
And couldn't reach the pedals.<br>
<br>
Next year he plans to travel,<br>
to countries with hot weather.<br>
The only fish in the whole wide world,<br>
That packs an umbrella.<br>
<br>
He may go to Morocco,<br>
To Bert, it doesn't matter.<br>
But you'll never find him on your plate,<br>
All wrapped up in batter.</p>

Bertie was a Goldfish,<br>
not your average pet.<br>
For unlike other Goldfish,<br>
He hated getting wet.<br>
<br>
When all the other fishies,<br>
Were swimming, having fun,<br>
Bert would slap on&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline"><strong>factor 12</strong></span>,<br>
And chill out in the sun.<br>
<br>
He's hiked across a mountain,<br>
And Bungee jumped in France,<br>
He's best friends with the neighbour’s cat,<br>
And he's taught him how to dance.<br>
<br>
He's raced a Formula 1 Car,<br>
And would have won a medal,<br>
But Bert's a fish, he has no feet,<br>
And couldn't reach the pedals.<br>
<br>
Next year he plans to travel,<br>
to countries with hot weather.<br>
The only fish in the whole wide world,<br>
That packs an umbrella.<br>
<br>
He may go to Morocco,<br>
To Bert, it doesn't matter.<br>
But you'll never find him on your plate,<br>
All wrapped up in batter.</p>

        <p><strong>WHAT CAUSES A FALLING STAR?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>StarChild – NASA Kids&nbsp;</em><br><br>
A “falling star” or a “shooting star” has nothing to do at all with a star!&nbsp;<strong>12</strong> ……….&nbsp;The shortlived trail of light the burning meteorite produces is called a meteor.&nbsp;<strong>13</strong> ………&nbsp;If any part of the meteoroid survives burning up and actually hits the Earth, that remaining bit is then called a meteorite.<br>
<br>
At certain times of the year, you are likely to see a great number of meteors in the night sky.&nbsp;<strong>14</strong> ………&nbsp;and they occur when the Earth passes through the trail of debris left by a comet as it orbits the Sun.&nbsp;<strong>15</strong> ………&nbsp;For example, the Leonid Meteor Shower, or Leonids, appear to originate in the constellation Leo. It is important to understand that the meteoroids (and therefore the meteors) do not really originate from the constellations or any of the stars in the constellations, however.&nbsp;<strong>16</strong> ………&nbsp;Associating the shower name with the region of the sky they seem to come from just helps astronomers know where to look!&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Note that one of the best meteor showers, the Perseids, happens in August. The “peak time” is when you are likely to see the largest number of meteors per hour.&nbsp;<strong>17</strong> ………</p>

          <strong>WHAT CAUSES A FALLING STAR?&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>StarChild – NASA Kids&nbsp;</em><br><br>
A “falling star” or a “shooting star” has nothing to do at all with a star!&nbsp;<strong>12</strong>&nbsp;……….&nbsp;The shortlived trail of light the burning meteorite produces is called a meteor.&nbsp;<strong>13</strong>&nbsp;………&nbsp;If any part of the meteoroid survives burning up and actually hits the Earth, that remaining bit is then called a meteorite.<br>
<br>
At certain times of the year, you are likely to see a great number of meteors in the night sky.&nbsp;<strong>14</strong>&nbsp;………&nbsp;and they occur when the Earth passes through the trail of debris left by a comet as it orbits the Sun.&nbsp;<strong>15</strong>&nbsp;………&nbsp;For example, the Leonid Meteor Shower, or Leonids, appear to originate in the constellation Leo. It is important to understand that the meteoroids (and therefore the meteors) do not really originate from the constellations or any of the stars in the constellations, however.&nbsp;<strong>16</strong>&nbsp;………&nbsp;Associating the shower name with the region of the sky they seem to come from just helps astronomers know where to look!&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Note that one of the best meteor showers, the Perseids, happens in August. The “peak time” is when you are likely to see the largest number of meteors per hour.&nbsp;<strong>17</strong>&nbsp;………</p>

          <strong>WHAT CAUSES A FALLING STAR?&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>StarChild – NASA Kids&nbsp;</em><br><br>
A “falling star” or a “shooting star” has nothing to do at all with a star!&nbsp;<strong>12</strong>&nbsp;……….&nbsp;The shortlived trail of light the burning meteorite produces is called a meteor.&nbsp;<strong>13</strong>&nbsp;………&nbsp;If any part of the meteoroid survives burning up and actually hits the Earth, that remaining bit is then called a meteorite.<br>
<br>
At certain times of the year, you are likely to see a great number of meteors in the night sky.&nbsp;<strong>14</strong>&nbsp;………&nbsp;and they occur when the Earth passes through the trail of debris left by a comet as it orbits the Sun.&nbsp;<strong>15</strong>&nbsp;………&nbsp;For example, the Leonid Meteor Shower, or Leonids, appear to originate in the constellation Leo. It is important to understand that the meteoroids (and therefore the meteors) do not really originate from the constellations or any of the stars in the constellations, however.&nbsp;<strong>16</strong>&nbsp;………&nbsp;Associating the shower name with the region of the sky they seem to come from just helps astronomers know where to look!&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Note that one of the best meteor showers, the Perseids, happens in August. The “peak time” is when you are likely to see the largest number of meteors per hour.&nbsp;<strong>17</strong>&nbsp;………</p>

          <strong>WHAT CAUSES A FALLING STAR?&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>StarChild – NASA Kids&nbsp;</em><br><br>
A “falling star” or a “shooting star” has nothing to do at all with a star!&nbsp;<strong>12</strong>&nbsp;……….&nbsp;The shortlived trail of light the burning meteorite produces is called a meteor.&nbsp;<strong>13</strong>&nbsp;………&nbsp;If any part of the meteoroid survives burning up and actually hits the Earth, that remaining bit is then called a meteorite.<br>
<br>
At certain times of the year, you are likely to see a great number of meteors in the night sky.&nbsp;<strong>14</strong>&nbsp;………&nbsp;and they occur when the Earth passes through the trail of debris left by a comet as it orbits the Sun.&nbsp;<strong>15</strong>&nbsp;………&nbsp;For example, the Leonid Meteor Shower, or Leonids, appear to originate in the constellation Leo. It is important to understand that the meteoroids (and therefore the meteors) do not really originate from the constellations or any of the stars in the constellations, however.&nbsp;<strong>16</strong>&nbsp;………&nbsp;Associating the shower name with the region of the sky they seem to come from just helps astronomers know where to look!&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Note that one of the best meteor showers, the Perseids, happens in August. The “peak time” is when you are likely to see the largest number of meteors per hour.&nbsp;<strong>17</strong>&nbsp;………</p>

Incredibly, our culture teaches us to regard persistence as a virtue. We boast that once we are set on a certain course, nothing can dissuade us from following it to the end. We teach our children that it’s a sign of weakness, even of immorality, to leave anything half done. It’s undeniable that our affairs benefit greatly from the capacity to persevere in the face of adversity. But it’s quite another thing to suggest that this capacity should always and indiscriminately be exercised. A useful distinction may be drawn between <em>persistence </em>and <em>perseverance</em>. We persevere when we steadfastly pursue our aims despite the obstacles that are encountered along the way. But we merely persist if we doggedly carry on in directions that are known to lead to a dead end.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}

<p>There are tasks that provide literally endless opportunities for amplification. However much we do in the service of these goals, it’s still possible to do more. If we want to be rich, there’s always more money to be made. We can always rehearse a speech one more time. If we keep looking, there’s always a chance that we’ll find a higher scoring Scrabble word. And when we make a decision, there are always additional factors that may be taken into account. Having compared the academic reputation, athletic prowess and architectural merits of several universities, we may still seek advice on where to go.<br>
Having discussed our options with a dozen people, we can always solicit the opinion of a thirteenth.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C&nbsp;</strong>^}<br>

Incredibly, our culture teaches us to regard persistence as a virtue. We boast that once we are set on a certain course, nothing can dissuade us from following it to the end. We teach our children that it’s a sign of weakness, even of immorality, to leave anything half done. It’s undeniable that our affairs benefit greatly from the capacity to persevere in the face of adversity. But it’s quite another thing to suggest that this capacity should always and indiscriminately be exercised. A useful distinction may be drawn between <em>persistence </em>and <em>perseverance</em>. We persevere when we steadfastly pursue our aims despite the obstacles that are encountered along the way. But we merely persist if we doggedly carry on in directions that are known to lead to a dead end.<br>

And when we make a decision, there are always additional factors that may be taken into account.

When we can’t do anything useful to advance our aim, we would do better to forget about it and turn to something else – even if the aim is enormously important and the alternative is just barely worth a glance.

When we’re standing in line, we can observe the other people. When we’re stuck in traffic, we can do mental maths.

We overwork if we act now when the same result can be more easily attained at a later time. Here is a contrived example that clearly delineates the nature of this trap. Expecting a letter of acceptance or rejection, we compose two replies – one for each possibility. Had we waited until the letter was received, we would have needed to do only half as much work, and result would have been the same. Hence, we overworked. In this case, the overwork is so transparent that only the most severely trapped people would engage in it. But many of us would be unable to resist giving an occasional thought to each reply in the course of the day. Half of these thoughts are destined to prove useless.<br>
