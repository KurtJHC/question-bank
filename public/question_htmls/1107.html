            <p>There is a particular mystique associated with the quiet of a Sunday in Hollywood that I have always found hard to articulate. For the director of sales at the Hollywood Palladium, Chris Payton, the tranquility associated with the reduced decibel level of street noise has been especially noticeable. “Now every day feels like Sunday morning at 7 a.m.,” he says. I could not agree more. The re-opening of the Hollywood Farmers Market has been a huge blessing as well, which Payton describes as a “great local tradition and resource.” In the future, he foresees the neighbourhood’s infrastructure focusing “more toward the regulars who live and work around here due to all the new builds.” Perhaps there will be a trend toward more restaurants and shops that cater to the residents as Hollywood adds more inhabitants.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>For long-time resident and substitute teacher, Daniel Moran, Hollywood is a mecca for theatres, record stores, and classic restaurants. “As a 20-year LAUSD substitute teacher, I have gotten to know students and parents of every ethnicity and social class, as I float from school to school. This has offered me a familiarity with and an understanding of the local population that I would not have experienced otherwise.” During this time, he looks forward to returning to Sunday services at Blessed Sacrament Church, going to all the local movie theatres and restaurants, plus exercising at Gold’s Gym.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>There is a particular mystique associated with the quiet of a Sunday in Hollywood that I have always found hard to articulate. For the director of sales at the Hollywood Palladium, Chris Payton, the tranquility associated with the reduced decibel level of street noise has been especially noticeable. “Now every day feels like Sunday morning at 7 a.m.,” he says. I could not agree more. The re-opening of the Hollywood Farmers Market has been a huge blessing as well, which Payton describes as a “great local tradition and resource.” In the future, he foresees the neighbourhood’s infrastructure focusing “more toward the regulars who live and work around here due to all the new builds.” Perhaps there will be a trend toward more restaurants and shops that cater to the residents as Hollywood adds more inhabitants.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Without the flow of tourists taking photos and posing with their favourite terrazzo and brass stars, the Walk of Fame certainly feels different as Hollywood reverts to its role as a neighbourhood again. However, for Bill LaVallee, an 83-year-old singer and actor with arguably some of the best stories about Hollywood’s heyday, he would assert that “those are the real people of Hollywood. There was a time in the 1950s and 60s when you really saw movie stars walking on the sidewalk.” For him, the Walk of Fame serves as a sweet reminder that this neighbourhood is still and always will be rooted in its origin story: “I love its history and being a part of it.”&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Tamra Brown, comedian and walking tour guide for Red Line Tours, has lived in Hollywood for nearly 20 years; and does not see herself moving anywhere else. “Hollywood is like a small town,” she says as she recalls some of the “regulars” she sees on a daily basis. “I think to most of Los Angeles that don’t live in Hollywood, they think Hollywood belongs to the tourists. But the residents would say it belongs to us.” On walks she is more aware of how “peaceful and beautiful” Hollywood feels at the moment. In the calmness, she notices the sunset more, and it can be emotionally overwhelming.</p>

            <p>Tamra Brown, comedian and walking tour guide for Red Line Tours, has lived in Hollywood for nearly 20 years; and does not see herself moving anywhere else. “Hollywood is like a small town,” she says as she recalls some of the “regulars” she sees on a daily basis. “I think to most of Los Angeles that don’t live in Hollywood, they think Hollywood belongs to the tourists. But the residents would say it belongs to us.” On walks she is more aware of how “peaceful and beautiful” Hollywood feels at the moment.

            </p>
            <p>There is a particular mystique associated with the quiet of a Sunday in Hollywood that I have always found hard to articulate. For the director of sales at the Hollywood Palladium, Chris Payton, the tranquility associated with the reduced decibel level of street noise has been especially noticeable. “Now every day feels like Sunday morning at 7 a.m.,” he says. I could not agree more. The re-opening of the Hollywood Farmers Market has been a huge blessing as well, which Payton describes as a “great local tradition and resource.” In the future, he foresees the neighbourhood’s infrastructure focusing “more toward the regulars who live and work around here due to all the new builds.” Perhaps there will be a trend toward more restaurants and shops that cater to the residents as Hollywood adds more inhabitants.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>For long-time resident and substitute teacher, Daniel Moran, Hollywood is a mecca for theatres, record stores, and classic restaurants. “As a 20-year LAUSD substitute teacher, I have gotten to know students and parents of every ethnicity and social class, as I float from school to school. This has offered me a familiarity with and an understanding of the local population that I would not have experienced otherwise.” During this time, he looks forward to returning to Sunday services at Blessed Sacrament Church, going to all the local movie theatres and restaurants, plus exercising at Gold’s Gym.&nbsp;</p>

            </p>
            <p>There is a particular mystique associated with the quiet of a Sunday in Hollywood that I have always found hard to articulate. For the director of sales at the Hollywood Palladium, Chris Payton, the tranquility associated with the reduced decibel level of street noise has been especially noticeable. “Now every day feels like Sunday morning at 7 a.m.,” he says. I could not agree more. The re-opening of the Hollywood Farmers Market has been a huge blessing as well, which Payton describes as a “great local tradition and resource.” In the future, he foresees the neighbourhood’s infrastructure focusing “more toward the regulars who live and work around here due to all the new builds.” Perhaps there will be a trend toward more restaurants and shops that cater to the residents as Hollywood adds more inhabitants.&nbsp;</p>

            </p>
            <p>For long-time resident and substitute teacher, Daniel Moran, Hollywood is a mecca for theatres, record stores, and classic restaurants. “As a 20-year LAUSD substitute teacher, I have gotten to know students and parents of every ethnicity and social class, as I float from school to school. This has offered me a familiarity with and an understanding of the local population that I would not have experienced otherwise.” During this time, he looks forward to returning to Sunday services at Blessed Sacrament Church, going to all the local movie theatres and restaurants, plus exercising at Gold’s Gym.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>You’re Not Broken&nbsp;</strong><em>by Sarah Woodhouse</em><br>
<br>
I’ve seen a lot of different therapists over the years. Some were great, some good, and some worryingly bad. When I was twenty-three, one of the great ones said to me:<br>
<br>
“Every symptom and issue you bring to me, Sarah, makes me believe that you carry trauma. I think something happened in your past that made you deeply overwhelmed and afraid, and you’re still reacting to it.”<br>
<br>
I stared at her in stunned silence. I’d had a stable upbringing. I’d been to a good school. I was struggling, yes, but I hadn’t been through anything&nbsp;<em>traumatic</em>.<br>
<br>
Once I regained my composure I decided I’d better set her straight. “You’ve got it totally wrong,” I told her firmly. “I don’t have trauma.”<br>
<br>
“Okay,” she said. And I pretty much left there and then.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
My defensive&nbsp;<em>how-dare-you</em>&nbsp;response to the therapist’s suggestion that I carried trauma was about my own denial. But it also reflects a wider cultural fear of what trauma means. Within mainstream culture, three false-truths about trauma persist. First, that trauma is a&nbsp;<em>disorder</em>. Second, that trauma only happens to an unlucky few who experience very extreme events and symptoms. Third, that trauma permanently damages us, leaving us fundamentally broken.<br>
<br>
The result of these misperceptions is, of course, that many of us are afraid of the word. We push it away, when really what we need to do is move towards it so we can better understand it.<br>
<br>
Trauma is a protective human&nbsp;<em>reaction</em>, not a disorder. Post-traumatic Stress&nbsp;<em>Disorder&nbsp;</em>(PTSD) is the name clinical psychologists and psychiatrists have given to high levels of trauma that are prolonged, but it’s just a name.<br>
<br>
The fact remains that trauma is a reaction, and this is true whether the reaction is more or less severe. (For some reason they lost sight of this as they labelled it in the 1970s.) This reaction can be a response to extreme events, but it can also be a response to common everyday experiences. Maybe the incident was relatively&nbsp;<em>small</em>: one we didn’t label as traumatic at the time, but as time goes on we can see the lasting effect isn’t&nbsp;<em>small&nbsp;</em>at all. To a greater or lesser extent, we’ve all expe-rienced this traumatic reaction. It’s part of being human – it unifies us. And far from leaving us fundamentally broken, understanding our own traumatic reactions can lead to our greatest transformation. As we move towards the thing we’ve been pushing away, we break free and reclaim our life.<br>
<br>
When we&nbsp;<em>don’t</em>&nbsp;recognise how traumatic experiences have affected us, we remain bound to the past and disconected from our true selves. We’re trapped in painful old reactions, patterns and self-limiting traumatic beliefs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Perhaps something happened that didn’t feel at all okay, but you laughed it off? Perhaps you can’t remember exactly what happened, but you just know there’s something there, something you’ve been afraid to look back at? You’re happy to admit things could be better; that you’re struggling a little, but – <em>trauma</em>? That just sounds too much, too serious, too something-that-happens-to-veterans.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I was afraid for a long time too. My fear held me back from living a full, free, authentic life. Incredible growth is possible once we’re brave enough to consider the idea that maybe (just maybe) the difficulties we’re experiencing today are connected to our own past traumas. Once we do, and as our understanding grows, we change. We stop feeling afraid of the past. We see the patterns we’re stuck in. We see, as clear as day, how the past has affected our selfbelief, thoughts, feelings, choices, even our body. We shift from confusion to clarity, and with that clarity comes freedom and growth, coupled with empowerment and thriving.</p>

<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>You’re Not Broken&nbsp;</strong><em>by Sarah Woodhouse</em><br>
<br>
I’ve seen a lot of different therapists over the years. Some were great, some good, and some worryingly bad. When I was twenty-three, one of the great ones said to me:<br>
<br>
“Every symptom and issue you bring to me, Sarah, makes me believe that you carry trauma. I think something happened in your past that made you deeply overwhelmed and afraid, and you’re still reacting to it.”<br>
<br>
I stared at her in stunned silence. I’d had a stable upbringing. I’d been to a good school. I was struggling, yes, but I hadn’t been through anything&nbsp;<em>traumatic</em>.<br>
<br>
Once I regained my composure I decided I’d better set her straight. “You’ve got it totally wrong,” I told her firmly. “I don’t have trauma.”<br>
<br>
“Okay,” she said. And I pretty much left there and then.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
My defensive&nbsp;<em>how-dare-you</em>&nbsp;response to the therapist’s suggestion that I carried trauma was about my own denial. But it also reflects a wider cultural fear of what trauma means. Within mainstream culture, three false-truths about trauma persist. First, that trauma is a&nbsp;<em>disorder</em>. Second, that trauma only happens to an unlucky few who experience very extreme events and symptoms. Third, that trauma permanently damages us, leaving us fundamentally broken.<br>
<br>
The result of these misperceptions is, of course, that many of us are afraid of the word. We push it away, when really what we need to do is move towards it so we can better understand it.<br>
<br>
Trauma is a protective human&nbsp;<em>reaction</em>, not a disorder. Post-traumatic Stress&nbsp;<em>Disorder&nbsp;</em>(PTSD) is the name clinical psychologists and psychiatrists have given to high levels of trauma that are prolonged, but it’s just a name.<br>
<br>
The fact remains that trauma is a reaction, and this is true whether the reaction is more or less severe. (For some reason they lost sight of this as they labelled it in the 1970s.) This reaction can be a response to extreme events, but it can also be a response to common everyday experiences. Maybe the incident was relatively&nbsp;<em>small</em>: one we didn’t label as traumatic at the time, but as time goes on we can see the lasting effect isn’t&nbsp;<em>small&nbsp;</em>at all. To a greater or lesser extent, we’ve all expe-rienced this traumatic reaction. It’s part of being human – it unifies us. And far from leaving us fundamentally broken, understanding our own traumatic reactions can lead to our greatest transformation. As we move towards the thing we’ve been pushing away, we break free and reclaim our life.<br>
<br>
When we&nbsp;<em>don’t</em>&nbsp;recognise how traumatic experiences have affected us, we remain bound to the past and disconected from our true selves. We’re trapped in painful old reactions, patterns and self-limiting traumatic beliefs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Perhaps something happened that didn’t feel at all okay, but you laughed it off? Perhaps you can’t remember exactly what happened, but you just know there’s something there, something you’ve been afraid to look back at? You’re happy to admit things could be better; that you’re struggling a little, but – <em>trauma</em>? That just sounds too much, too serious, too something-that-happens-to-veterans.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I was afraid for a long time too. My fear held me back from living a full, free, authentic life. Incredible growth is possible once we’re brave enough to consider the idea that maybe (just maybe) the difficulties we’re experiencing today are connected to our own past traumas. Once we do, and as our understanding grows, we change. We stop feeling afraid of the past. We see the patterns we’re stuck in. We see, as clear as day, how the past has affected our selfbelief, thoughts, feelings, choices, even our body. We shift from confusion to clarity, and with that clarity comes freedom and growth, coupled with empowerment and thriving.</p>

<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>You’re Not Broken&nbsp;</strong><em>by Sarah Woodhouse</em><br>
<br>
I’ve seen a lot of different therapists over the years. Some were great, some good, and some worryingly bad. When I was twenty-three, one of the great ones said to me:<br>
<br>
“Every symptom and issue you bring to me, Sarah, makes me believe that you carry trauma. I think something happened in your past that made you deeply overwhelmed and afraid, and you’re still reacting to it.”<br>
<br>
I stared at her in stunned silence. I’d had a stable upbringing. I’d been to a good school. I was struggling, yes, but I hadn’t been through anything&nbsp;<em>traumatic</em>.<br>
<br>
Once I regained my composure I decided I’d better set her straight. “You’ve got it totally wrong,” I told her firmly. “I don’t have trauma.”<br>
<br>
“Okay,” she said. And I pretty much left there and then.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
My defensive&nbsp;<em>how-dare-you</em>&nbsp;response to the therapist’s suggestion that I carried trauma was about my own denial. But it also reflects a wider cultural fear of what trauma means. Within mainstream culture, three false-truths about trauma persist. First, that trauma is a&nbsp;<em>disorder</em>. Second, that trauma only happens to an unlucky few who experience very extreme events and symptoms. Third, that trauma permanently damages us, leaving us fundamentally broken.<br>
<br>
The result of these misperceptions is, of course, that many of us are afraid of the word. We push it away, when really what we need to do is move towards it so we can better understand it.<br>
<br>
Trauma is a protective human&nbsp;<em>reaction</em>, not a disorder. Post-traumatic Stress&nbsp;<em>Disorder&nbsp;</em>(PTSD) is the name clinical psychologists and psychiatrists have given to high levels of trauma that are prolonged, but it’s just a name.<br>
<br>
The fact remains that trauma is a reaction, and this is true whether the reaction is more or less severe. (For some reason they lost sight of this as they labelled it in the 1970s.) This reaction can be a response to extreme events, but it can also be a response to common everyday experiences. Maybe the incident was relatively&nbsp;<em>small</em>: one we didn’t label as traumatic at the time, but as time goes on we can see the lasting effect isn’t&nbsp;<em>small&nbsp;</em>at all. To a greater or lesser extent, we’ve all expe-rienced this traumatic reaction. It’s part of being human – it unifies us. And far from leaving us fundamentally broken, understanding our own traumatic reactions can lead to our greatest transformation. As we move towards the thing we’ve been pushing away, we break free and reclaim our life.<br>
<br>
When we&nbsp;<em>don’t</em>&nbsp;recognise how traumatic experiences have affected us, we remain bound to the past and disconected from our true selves. We’re trapped in painful old reactions, patterns and self-limiting traumatic beliefs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Perhaps something happened that didn’t feel at all okay, but you laughed it off? Perhaps you can’t remember exactly what happened, but you just know there’s something there, something you’ve been afraid to look back at? You’re happy to admit things could be better; that you’re struggling a little, but – <em>trauma</em>? That just sounds too much, too serious, too something-that-happens-to-veterans.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I was afraid for a long time too. My fear held me back from living a full, free, authentic life. Incredible growth is possible once we’re brave enough to consider the idea that maybe (just maybe) the difficulties we’re experiencing today are connected to our own past traumas. Once we do, and as our understanding grows, we change. We stop feeling afraid of the past. We see the patterns we’re stuck in. We see, as clear as day, how the past has affected our selfbelief, thoughts, feelings, choices, even our body. We shift from confusion to clarity, and with that clarity comes freedom and growth, coupled with empowerment and thriving.</p>

And far from leaving us fundamentally broken, understanding our own traumatic reactions can lead to our greatest transformation. As we move towards the thing we’ve been pushing away, we break free and reclaim our life.<br>
<br>
When we&nbsp;<em>don’t</em>&nbsp;recognise how traumatic experiences have affected us, we remain bound to the past and disconected from our true selves. We’re trapped in painful old reactions, patterns and self-limiting traumatic beliefs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Perhaps something happened that didn’t feel at all okay, but you laughed it off? Perhaps you can’t remember exactly what happened, but you just know there’s something there, something you’ve been afraid to look back at? You’re happy to admit things could be better; that you’re struggling a little, but – <em>trauma</em>? That just sounds too much, too serious, too something-that-happens-to-veterans.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I was afraid for a long time too. My fear held me back from living a full, free, authentic life. Incredible growth is possible once we’re brave enough to consider the idea that maybe (just maybe) the difficulties we’re experiencing today are connected to our own past traumas. Once we do, and as our understanding grows, we change. We stop feeling afraid of the past. We see the patterns we’re stuck in. We see, as clear as day, how the past has affected our selfbelief, thoughts, feelings, choices, even our body. We shift from confusion to clarity, and with that clarity comes freedom and growth, coupled with empowerment and thriving.</p>

<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>You’re Not Broken&nbsp;</strong><em>by Sarah Woodhouse</em><br>
<br>
I’ve seen a lot of different therapists over the years. Some were great, some good, and some worryingly bad. When I was twenty-three, one of the great ones said to me:<br>
<br>
“Every symptom and issue you bring to me, Sarah, makes me believe that you carry trauma. I think something happened in your past that made you deeply overwhelmed and afraid, and you’re still reacting to it.”<br>
<br>
I stared at her in stunned silence. I’d had a stable upbringing. I’d been to a good school. I was struggling, yes, but I hadn’t been through anything&nbsp;<em>traumatic</em>.<br>
<br>
Once I regained my composure I decided I’d better set her straight. “You’ve got it totally wrong,” I told her firmly. “I don’t have trauma.”<br>
<br>
“Okay,” she said. And I pretty much left there and then.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
My defensive&nbsp;<em>how-dare-you</em>&nbsp;response to the therapist’s suggestion that I carried trauma was about my own denial. But it also reflects a wider cultural fear of what trauma means. Within mainstream culture, three false-truths about trauma persist. First, that trauma is a&nbsp;<em>disorder</em>. Second, that trauma only happens to an unlucky few who experience very extreme events and symptoms. Third, that trauma permanently damages us, leaving us fundamentally broken.<br>
<br>
The result of these misperceptions is, of course, that many of us are afraid of the word. We push it away, when really what we need to do is move towards it so we can better understand it.<br>
<br>
Trauma is a protective human&nbsp;<em>reaction</em>, not a disorder. Post-traumatic Stress&nbsp;<em>Disorder&nbsp;</em>(PTSD) is the name clinical psychologists and psychiatrists have given to high levels of trauma that are prolonged, but it’s just a name.<br>
<br>
The fact remains that trauma is a reaction, and this is true whether the reaction is more or less severe. (For some reason they lost sight of this as they labelled it in the 1970s.) This reaction can be a response to extreme events, but it can also be a response to common everyday experiences. Maybe the incident was relatively&nbsp;<em>small</em>: one we didn’t label as traumatic at the time, but as time goes on we can see the lasting effect isn’t&nbsp;<em>small&nbsp;</em>at all. To a greater or lesser extent, we’ve all expe-rienced this traumatic reaction. It’s part of being human – it unifies us. And far from leaving us fundamentally broken, understanding our own traumatic reactions can lead to our greatest transformation. As we move towards the thing we’ve been pushing away, we break free and reclaim our life.<br>
<br>
When we&nbsp;<em>don’t</em>&nbsp;recognise how traumatic experiences have affected us, we remain bound to the past and disconected from our true selves. We’re trapped in painful old reactions, patterns and self-limiting traumatic beliefs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Perhaps something happened that didn’t feel at all okay, but you laughed it off? Perhaps you can’t remember exactly what happened, but you just know there’s something there, something you’ve been afraid to look back at? You’re happy to admit things could be better; that you’re struggling a little, but – <em>trauma</em>? That just sounds too much, too serious, too something-that-happens-to-veterans.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I was afraid for a long time too. My fear held me back from living a full, free, authentic life. Incredible growth is possible once we’re brave enough to consider the idea that maybe (just maybe) the difficulties we’re experiencing today are connected to our own past traumas. Once we do, and as our understanding grows, we change. We stop feeling afraid of the past. We see the patterns we’re stuck in. We see, as clear as day, how the past has affected our selfbelief, thoughts, feelings, choices, even our body. We shift from confusion to clarity, and with that clarity comes freedom and growth, coupled with empowerment and thriving.</p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>You’re Not Broken&nbsp;</strong><em>by Sarah Woodhouse</em><br>
<br>
I’ve seen a lot of different therapists over the years. Some were great, some good, and some worryingly bad. When I was twenty-three, one of the great ones said to me:<br>
<br>

            <p>The HMS Birkenhead, also referred to as HM Troopship Birkenhead or Steam Frigate Birkenhead, was one of the first iron-hulled ships built for the Royal Navy. She was designed as a steam frigate, but was converted to a troopship before being commissioned. She was ship-wrecked on 26 February 1852, while transporting troops to Algoa Bay at Danger Point near Gansbaai, 87 miles (140 kilometres) from Cape Town in the Cape Colony. There were not enough serviceable lifeboats for all the passengers, and the soldiers famously stood firm on board, thereby allowing&nbsp;the women and children to board the boats safely and escape the sinking. Only 193 of the estimated 643 people on board survived, and the soldiers’ chivalry gave rise to the unofficial “women and children first” protocol when abandoning ship, while the “Birkenhead drill” of Rudyard Kipling’s poem came to describe courage in face of hopeless circumstances.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Deep in the bottom of the sea, some 3,800 metres below the surface of the freezing Atlantic Ocean, lies the wreckage of a ship: the unmistakable carcass of the Titanic, once man’s grandest mechanical achievement, now stripped of its former glory, after it sank in 1912. According to the famous movie, almost one long century later, intrigued by Titanic’s hidden riches, the modern treasure hunter, Brock Lovett, and his well-equipped technical crew, find themselves in the middle of the ocean, digging for answers for the past three years; nevertheless, without any success. But, when centenarian Rose Calvert, one of the few survivors of the Titanic, learns about this ambitious crusade, she decides to unfold her incredible and utterly tragic story; one that intertwines the extraordinary journey of the exquisite, deep-blue Heart-of-the-Ocean diamond of King Louis XVI, with the unlikely romance of Rose and the young bohemian vagabond, Jack Dawson. Now, an emotional trip down memory lane awaits. Can the mistakes of the past teach a lesson in humility to paupers and royalty alike?</p>

            <p>The Queen Anne’s Revenge has to be the world’s most famous pirate ship. In 1717, the pirate, Blackbeard captured La Concorde, a French slaving vessel. He realised that it would make a perfect pirate ship. It was large yet fast and big enough to mount 40 cannons on board. He renamed it Queen Anne’s Revenge: the name referred to Anne, Queen of England and Scotland. Many pirates favoured the return of the throne of Great Britain from the House of Hanover to the House of Stuart. It had changed hands after Anne’s death. Blackbeard preferred to intimidate his victims into surrendering, as fights were costly. For several months in 1717-18, Blackbeard used the Queen Anne’s Revenge to effectively terrorize shipping in the Atlantic. Between the massive frigate and his own fearsome appearance and reputation, Blackbeard’s victims rarely put up a fight and handed over their cargoes peacefully. He plundered the shipping lanes at will. He was even able to blockade the port of Charleston for a week in April of 1718, looting several ships. In June of 1718, the Queen Anne’s Revenge hit a sandbar off of North Carolina and had to be abandoned. Blackbeard took the opportunity to make off with all of the loot and a select few of his favorite pirates, leaving the others to fend for themselves. Blackbeard went legit (sort of) for a little while, but within a few months, Blackbeard returned to piracy and in November, 1718, he was killed by pirate hunters in a pitched battle off of North Carolina. In 1996, a shipwreck believed to be that of the Queen Anne’s Revenge was discovered off North Carolina. For 15 years it was excavated and studied, and in 2011 it was confirmed to be Blackbeard’s ship. The shipwreck has yielded many interesting artifacts, including weapons, cannons, medical gear and a massive anchor.</p>

            <p>Appearing in Richard Wagner’s opera as a man searching for love, as a ship manned by octopusfaced Davy Jones in Pirates of the Caribbean, and even as a green spirit in the animation SpongeBob SquarePants, the Flying Dutchman is a popular maritime legend. Known for its terrible storms and treacherous outcrops of rock, The Cape of Good Hope in South Africa (around Cape Town) once had a far darker name: The Cape of Storms. It is from here that the legend of the Flying Dutchman set sail. The story behind of the Flying Dutchman begins in 1641 with a sea captain, Hendrik van der Decken and his crew who were returning to Holland from the Far East when they, like all trade ships, had to risk the dangerous passage around The Cape of Good Hope. Legend has it that, as van der Decken and his crew attempted to round the Cape, a storm began. The crew begged their captain not to sail into the storm, but he was determined to face the chaotic waters and screaming winds. Van der Decken vowed that he would sail around the Cape, even if it took him ‘until Doomsday’ to accomplish it. Some say that, at one point, an angel appeared to van der Decken, and the Dutch trader shot at his otherworldly visitor. With that, the ship’s fate was sealed. The Flying Dutchman is said to appear as a ghostly, glowing ship. It will materialise suddenly and then, just as suddenly, vanish. Some claim the ship, doomed to sail the seas forever, will attempt to make contact with other travellers, and that seeing the Flying Dutchman is a sign of horrible misfortune to come. Whether maritime superstition or true event, the Flying Dutchman continues to haunt the Cape and stories of the sea. Standing on the beach on South Africa’s southern coast, looking out into the swirling clouds and crashing waves, you may just catch a glimpse of a strange-looking ship desperate to get home.</p>

            <p>The HMS Birkenhead, also referred to as HM Troopship Birkenhead or Steam Frigate Birkenhead, was one of the first iron-hulled ships built for the Royal Navy. She was designed as a steam frigate, but was converted to a troopship before being commissioned. She was ship-wrecked on 26 February 1852, while transporting troops to Algoa Bay at Danger Point near Gansbaai, 87 miles (140 kilometres) from Cape Town in the Cape Colony. There were not enough serviceable lifeboats for all the passengers, and the soldiers famously stood firm on board, thereby allowing&nbsp;the women and children to board the boats safely and escape the sinking. Only 193 of the estimated 643 people on board survived, and the soldiers’ chivalry gave rise to the unofficial “women and children first” protocol when abandoning ship, while the “Birkenhead drill” of Rudyard Kipling’s poem came to describe courage in face of hopeless circumstances.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Deep in the bottom of the sea, some 3,800 metres below the surface of the freezing Atlantic Ocean, lies the wreckage of a ship: the unmistakable carcass of the Titanic, once man’s grandest mechanical achievement, now stripped of its former glory, after it sank in 1912. According to the famous movie, almost one long century later, intrigued by Titanic’s hidden riches, the modern treasure hunter, Brock Lovett, and his well-equipped technical crew, find themselves in the middle of the ocean, digging for answers for the past three years; nevertheless, without any success. But, when centenarian Rose Calvert, one of the few survivors of the Titanic, learns about this ambitious crusade, she decides to unfold her incredible and utterly tragic story; one that intertwines the extraordinary journey of the exquisite, deep-blue Heart-of-the-Ocean diamond of King Louis XVI, with the unlikely romance of Rose and the young bohemian vagabond, Jack Dawson. Now, an emotional trip down memory lane awaits. Can the mistakes of the past teach a lesson in humility to paupers and royalty alike?</p>

            <p>The Queen Anne’s Revenge has to be the world’s most famous pirate ship. In 1717, the pirate, Blackbeard captured La Concorde, a French slaving vessel. He realised that it would make a perfect pirate ship. It was large yet fast and big enough to mount 40 cannons on board. He renamed it Queen Anne’s Revenge: the name referred to Anne, Queen of England and Scotland. Many pirates favoured the return of the throne of Great Britain from the House of Hanover to the House of Stuart. It had changed hands after Anne’s death. Blackbeard preferred to intimidate his victims into surrendering, as fights were costly. For several months in 1717-18, Blackbeard used the Queen Anne’s Revenge to effectively terrorize shipping in the Atlantic. Between the massive frigate and his own fearsome appearance and reputation, Blackbeard’s victims rarely put up a fight and handed over their cargoes peacefully. He plundered the shipping lanes at will. He was even able to blockade the port of Charleston for a week in April of 1718, looting several ships. In June of 1718, the Queen Anne’s Revenge hit a sandbar off of North Carolina and had to be abandoned. Blackbeard took the opportunity to make off with all of the loot and a select few of his favorite pirates, leaving the others to fend for themselves. Blackbeard went legit (sort of) for a little while, but within a few months, Blackbeard returned to piracy and in November, 1718, he was killed by pirate hunters in a pitched battle off of North Carolina. In 1996, a shipwreck believed to be that of the Queen Anne’s Revenge was discovered off North Carolina. For 15 years it was excavated and studied, and in 2011 it was confirmed to be Blackbeard’s ship. The shipwreck has yielded many interesting artifacts, including weapons, cannons, medical gear and a massive anchor.</p>

            <p>Appearing in Richard Wagner’s opera as a man searching for love, as a ship manned by octopusfaced Davy Jones in Pirates of the Caribbean, and even as a green spirit in the animation SpongeBob SquarePants, the Flying Dutchman is a popular maritime legend. Known for its terrible storms and treacherous outcrops of rock, The Cape of Good Hope in South Africa (around Cape Town) once had a far darker name: The Cape of Storms. It is from here that the legend of the Flying Dutchman set sail. The story behind of the Flying Dutchman begins in 1641 with a sea captain, Hendrik van der Decken and his crew who were returning to Holland from the Far East when they, like all trade ships, had to risk the dangerous passage around The Cape of Good Hope. Legend has it that, as van der Decken and his crew attempted to round the Cape, a storm began. The crew begged their captain not to sail into the storm, but he was determined to face the chaotic waters and screaming winds. Van der Decken vowed that he would sail around the Cape, even if it took him ‘until Doomsday’ to accomplish it. Some say that, at one point, an angel appeared to van der Decken, and the Dutch trader shot at his otherworldly visitor. With that, the ship’s fate was sealed. The Flying Dutchman is said to appear as a ghostly, glowing ship. It will materialise suddenly and then, just as suddenly, vanish. Some claim the ship, doomed to sail the seas forever, will attempt to make contact with other travellers, and that seeing the Flying Dutchman is a sign of horrible misfortune to come. Whether maritime superstition or true event, the Flying Dutchman continues to haunt the Cape and stories of the sea. Standing on the beach on South Africa’s southern coast, looking out into the swirling clouds and crashing waves, you may just catch a glimpse of a strange-looking ship desperate to get home.</p>
