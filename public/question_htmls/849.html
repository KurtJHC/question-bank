          <strong>Ellie and Tess and the Lost Letter</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <em>Adam Margit&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>No one heard the tapping noise, except Winkle-Dog. He sat bolt upright. His tongue stopped poking at his teeth. His paws stopped padding. Even his shaggy bottom stopped wobbling. He pricked up his ears.</p>
        <p>Ellie looked at Winkle-Dog. She stopped laughing. She sat still and listened.</p>
        <p><em>Tap tap tap</em>, very faintly.</p>
        <p>Tess stopped laughing, too. She stood up. Then she heard it as well.</p>
        <p><em>Tap tap tap</em>, again. Then louder. TAP TAP TAP.</p>
        <p>It was coming from the front door. A visitor? At the front door? Only visits from strangers - official visits - started at the front door. Fleur always came in at the back. So did everybody else.</p>
        <p>Mummy and Daddy were still in bed. The twins were in their pyjamas. KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.</p>
        <p>Ellie, Tess, and Winkle-Dog raced each other through the living room to the front door. Then Winkle-Dog skidded to a halt. Tess tried to stop, but couldn't, and crashed into the back of him. Ellie ran into both of them.</p>
        <p>'Are we ready?' she asked.</p>
        <p>'Ready ' answered Tess, and opened the door. Then she stared, and Ellie stared, and Winkle-Dog stared, too.</p>
        <p>In the doorway stood Mr Drew, in his pilot's uniform. He was Webster's dad - the boy who had fetched the tea towel for Mrs Hertz. He was carrying a shiny black suitcase with a bright orange strap around its middle. Mr Drew grinned at the three of them.</p>
        <p>'Good morning, ladies and dog,' he said, and bowed politely.</p>
        <p>Winkle-Dog bowed politely back. Ellie and Tess didn't bow. They didn't even say 'good morning'. They were staring straight past Mr Drew's blue jacket, with the tassels and golden loops on the shoulders, and past the shiny black suitcase in his hand.</p>
        <p>Behind Mr Drew stood a young girl, beaming from ear to ear. She was wearing loose floppy black pants and a red jacket all covered in flowers. On her feet were black shoes made like slippers, with a strap and a big white button on the side. Her hair was pulled into four bunches, two at the front and two at the back. Around each were four brightly coloured ribbons, tied up into bows, with long thin streamers hanging down the sides, even longer than her hair. When she shook her head, this mass of ribbons fluttered about like a hundred butterflies ready to take off.</p>
        <p>'Fei Fei?' Ellie couldn't believe her eyes.</p>
        <p>'I found her at the airport . . .' Mr Drew started to explain, but no one was listening. 'Fei Fei ' Tess squealed with delight.</p>
        <p>'Yes, it is I, Fei Fei, your visitor,' said Fei Fei. So they were not dreaming.</p>
        <p>They dashed towards the girl in the doorway. They couldn't get her into the house quickly enough. With a great many 'hello's and 'come in's, they hugged and tugged Fei Fei inside. Tess called out for Daddy. They quite forgot Mr Drew standing in the doorway holding the suitcase.</p>
        <p>But Winkle-Dog didn't forget. In all the excitement he started to jump about, too. He jumped straight at Mr Drew. He wanted to welcome the pilot with a long friendly face lick. Winkle-Dog's wide hairy padded paws landed on Mr Drew's shoulders. His sloppy tongue, big as Daddy's hankie, wiped itself all over Mr Drew's face.</p>

Around each were four brightly coloured ribbons, tied up into bows, with long thin streamers hanging down the sides, even longer than her hair. When she shook her head, this mass of ribbons fluttered about like a hundred butterflies ready to take off.</p>
        <p>'Fei Fei?' Ellie couldn't believe her eyes.</p>
        <p>'I found her at the airport . . .' Mr Drew started to explain, but no one was listening. 'Fei Fei ' Tess squealed with delight.</p>
        <p>'Yes, it is I, Fei Fei, your visitor,' said Fei Fei. So they were not dreaming.</p>
        <p>They dashed towards the girl in the doorway. They couldn't get her into the house quickly enough. With a great many 'hello's and 'come in's, they hugged and tugged Fei Fei inside. Tess called out for Daddy. They quite forgot Mr Drew standing in the doorway holding the suitcase.</p>
        <p>But Winkle-Dog didn't forget. In all the excitement he started to jump about, too. He jumped straight at Mr Drew. He wanted to welcome the pilot with a long friendly face lick. Winkle-Dog's wide hairy padded paws landed on Mr Drew's shoulders. His sloppy tongue, big as Daddy's hankie, wiped itself all over Mr Drew's face.</p>

          <em>Adam Margit&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>No one heard the tapping noise, except Winkle-Dog. He sat bolt upright. His tongue stopped poking at his teeth. His paws stopped padding. Even his shaggy bottom stopped wobbling. He pricked up his ears.</p>
        <p>Ellie looked at Winkle-Dog. She stopped laughing. She sat still and listened.</p>
        <p><em>Tap tap tap</em>, very faintly.</p>
        <p>Tess stopped laughing, too. She stood up. Then she heard it as well.</p>
        <p><em>Tap tap tap</em>, again. Then louder. TAP TAP TAP.</p>
        <p>It was coming from the front door. A visitor? At the front door? Only visits from strangers - official visits - started at the front door. Fleur always came in at the back. So did everybody else.</p>
        <p>Mummy and Daddy were still in bed. The twins were in their pyjamas. KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.</p>
        <p>Ellie, Tess, and Winkle-Dog raced each other through the living room to the front door. Then Winkle-Dog skidded to a halt. Tess tried to stop, but couldn't, and crashed into the back of him. Ellie ran into both of them.</p>
        <p>'Are we ready?' she asked.</p>
        <p>'Ready ' answered Tess, and opened the door. Then she stared, and Ellie stared, and Winkle-Dog stared, too.</p>
        <p>In the doorway stood Mr Drew, in his pilot's uniform. He was Webster's dad - the boy who had fetched the tea towel for Mrs Hertz. He was carrying a shiny black suitcase with a bright orange strap around its middle. Mr Drew grinned at the three of them.</p>
        <p>'Good morning, ladies and dog,' he said, and bowed politely.</p>
        <p>Winkle-Dog bowed politely back. Ellie and Tess didn't bow. They didn't even say 'good morning'. They were staring straight past Mr Drew's blue jacket, with the tassels and golden loops on the shoulders, and past the shiny black suitcase in his hand.</p>
        <p>Behind Mr Drew stood a young girl, beaming from ear to ear. She was wearing loose floppy black pants and a red jacket all covered in flowers.

          <strong>Ellie and Tess and the Lost Letter</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <em>Adam Margit&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>No one heard the tapping noise, except Winkle-Dog. He sat bolt upright. His tongue stopped poking at his teeth. His paws stopped padding. Even his shaggy bottom stopped wobbling. He pricked up his ears.</p>
        <p>Ellie looked at Winkle-Dog. She stopped laughing. She sat still and listened.</p>
        <p><em>Tap tap tap</em>, very faintly.</p>
        <p>Tess stopped laughing, too. She stood up. Then she heard it as well.</p>
        <p><em>Tap tap tap</em>, again. Then louder. TAP TAP TAP.</p>
        <p>It was coming from the front door. A visitor? At the front door? Only visits from strangers - official visits - started at the front door. Fleur always came in at the back. So did everybody else.</p>
        <p>Mummy and Daddy were still in bed. The twins were in their pyjamas. KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.</p>
        <p>Ellie, Tess, and Winkle-Dog raced each other through the living room to the front door. Then Winkle-Dog skidded to a halt. Tess tried to stop, but couldn't, and crashed into the back of him. Ellie ran into both of them.</p>
        <p>'Are we ready?' she asked.</p>
        <p>'Ready ' answered Tess, and opened the door. Then she stared, and Ellie stared, and Winkle-Dog stared, too.</p>
        <p>In the doorway stood Mr Drew, in his pilot's uniform. He was Webster's dad - the boy who had fetched the tea towel for Mrs Hertz. He was carrying a shiny black suitcase with a bright orange strap around its middle. Mr Drew grinned at the three of them.</p>
        <p>'Good morning, ladies and dog,' he said, and bowed politely.</p>
        <p>Winkle-Dog bowed politely back. Ellie and Tess didn't bow. They didn't even say 'good morning'. They were staring straight past Mr Drew's blue jacket, with the tassels and golden loops on the shoulders, and past the shiny black suitcase in his hand.</p>
        <p>Behind Mr Drew stood a young girl, beaming from ear to ear. She was wearing loose floppy black pants and a red jacket all covered in flowers. On her feet were black shoes made like slippers, with a strap and a big white button on the side. Her hair was pulled into four bunches, two at the front and two at the back. Around each were four brightly coloured ribbons, tied up into bows, with long thin streamers hanging down the sides, even longer than her hair. When she shook her head, this mass of ribbons fluttered about like a hundred butterflies ready to take off.</p>
        <p>'Fei Fei?' Ellie couldn't believe her eyes.</p>
        <p>'I found her at the airport . . .' Mr Drew started to explain, but no one was listening. 'Fei Fei ' Tess squealed with delight.</p>
        <p>'Yes, it is I, Fei Fei, your visitor,' said Fei Fei. So they were not dreaming.</p>
        <p>They dashed towards the girl in the doorway. They couldn't get her into the house quickly enough. With a great many 'hello's and 'come in's, they hugged and tugged Fei Fei inside. Tess called out for Daddy. They quite forgot Mr Drew standing in the doorway holding the suitcase.</p>
        <p>But Winkle-Dog didn't forget. In all the excitement he started to jump about, too. He jumped straight at Mr Drew. He wanted to welcome the pilot with a long friendly face lick. Winkle-Dog's wide hairy padded paws landed on Mr Drew's shoulders. His sloppy tongue, big as Daddy's hankie, wiped itself all over Mr Drew's face.</p>

          <strong>SNAKE ALERT</strong>
        </p>
        <p>CATHERINE ELLIS, REPORTER: <em>Snakes Some people love them; some are terrified of them</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But the word is, if you leave your doors or windows open, you might just get a visit from one</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Snake catchers like Ian Renton have been very busy. He says people have been finding snakes in kitchen cupboards, dropping out of ceiling lights, oven exhaust fans - they've even been found in toilets</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>IAN RENTON, SNAKE CATCHER: <em>They're coming in all areas.</em></p>
        <p>Ian's job is to remove the snakes and take them somewhere away from humans.</p>
        <p>But he says there are ways of preventing the creatures from coming near your home in the first place.</p>

          <strong>SNAKE ALERT</strong>
        </p>
        <p>CATHERINE ELLIS, REPORTER: <em>Snakes Some people love them; some are terrified of them</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But the word is, if you leave your doors or windows open, you might just get a visit from one</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Snake catchers like Ian Renton have been very busy. He says people have been finding snakes in kitchen cupboards, dropping out of ceiling lights, oven exhaust fans - they've even been found in toilets</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>IAN RENTON, SNAKE CATCHER: <em>They're coming in all areas.</em></p>
        <p>Ian's job is to remove the snakes and take them somewhere away from humans.</p>
        <p>But he says there are ways of preventing the creatures from coming near your home in the first place.</p>
        <p>Like moving pet water bowls away from the back door because a snake might want a sip And having a tidy back yard so that snakes won't have anywhere to hide.</p>

        <p>Okay so the first thing Ian did was place a sterile dressing over the bite, but it doesn't matter if you don't have one, the bandaging is the important part.</p>
        <p>Starting over the bite Ian wrapped the bandage firmly all the way along my limb - he then repeated that with a second bandage.</p>
        <p>IAN RENTON, SNAKE CATCHER: <em>You're compressing the tissue and slowing the movement of the venom down.</em></p>
        <p>Next he got a splint, which is something firm like a stick or a rolled up newspaper and he tied it to my arm to stop it moving.</p>
        <p>I would then need to stay quiet and still while someone else called for help.</p>

          <strong>SNAKE ALERT</strong>
        </p>
        <p>CATHERINE ELLIS, REPORTER: <em>Snakes Some people love them; some are terrified of them</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But the word is, if you leave your doors or windows open, you might just get a visit from one</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Snake catchers like Ian Renton have been very busy. He says people have been finding snakes in kitchen cupboards, dropping out of ceiling lights, oven exhaust fans - they've even been found in toilets</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>IAN RENTON, SNAKE CATCHER: <em>They're coming in all areas.</em></p>
        <p>Ian's job is to remove the snakes and take them somewhere away from humans.</p>
        <p>But he says there are ways of preventing the creatures from coming near your home in the first place.</p>
        <p>Like moving pet water bowls away from the back door because a snake might want a sip And having a tidy back yard so that snakes won't have anywhere to hide.</p>
        <p>But if you do see a snake, it's important you don't go anywhere near it.</p>
        <p>IAN RENTON, SNAKE CATCHER: <em>Stand still, watch where the snake goes from a safe distance and then call for the nearest adult you know.</em></p>
        <p>This snake that Ian showed us is a brown snake. They're responsible for causing the most snakebite deaths in Australia.</p>
        <p>
          <em>It was a little feisty And see that scaly belly on the right, the snake swung up and bit our camera mike</em>
        </p>
        <p>Luckily the cameraman was standing back at the time</p>
        <p>I quickly took a few photos and a video so I could show you guys.</p>
        <p>CATHERINE ELLIS, REPORTER: <em>The snake has actually injected venom onto our microphone, apparently that is enough venom to kill 20 adults</em></p>
        <p>
          <em>Now, what would you do if you were bitten by a snake? Well not many Aussies, including mums and dads seem to know.</em>
        </p>
        <p>So I thought we should find out.</p>

          <strong>SNAKE ALERT</strong>
        </p>
        <p>CATHERINE ELLIS, REPORTER: <em>Snakes Some people love them; some are terrified of them</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But the word is, if you leave your doors or windows open, you might just get a visit from one</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Snake catchers like Ian Renton have been very busy. He says people have been finding snakes in kitchen cupboards, dropping out of ceiling lights, oven exhaust fans - they've even been found in toilets</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>IAN RENTON, SNAKE CATCHER: <em>They're coming in all areas.</em></p>
        <p>Ian's job is to remove the snakes and take them somewhere away from humans.</p>
        <p>But he says there are ways of preventing the creatures from coming near your home in the first place.</p>
        <p>Like moving pet water bowls away from the back door because a snake might want a sip And having a tidy back yard so that snakes won't have anywhere to hide.</p>
        <p>But if you do see a snake, it's important you don't go anywhere near it.</p>
        <p>IAN RENTON, SNAKE CATCHER: <em>Stand still, watch where the snake goes from a safe distance and then call for the nearest adult you know.</em></p>
        <p>This snake that Ian showed us is a brown snake. They're responsible for causing the most snakebite deaths in Australia.</p>
        <p>
          <em>It was a little feisty And see that scaly belly on the right, the snake swung up and bit our camera mike</em>
        </p>
        <p>Luckily the cameraman was standing back at the time</p>
        <p>I quickly took a few photos and a video so I could show you guys.</p>
        <p>CATHERINE ELLIS, REPORTER: <em>The snake has actually injected venom onto our microphone, apparently that is enough venom to kill 20 adults</em></p>
        <p>
          <em>Now, what would you do if you were bitten by a snake? Well not many Aussies, including mums and dads seem to know.</em>
        </p>
        <p>So I thought we should find out.</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
                  <img width="76%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766026349/rt0u9bqepv3jcle3hi6z.gif" alt="NAP_Y5_M2_RC_29_2">


        </p>
        <p>CATHERINE ELLIS, REPORTER: <em>Ian, let’s pretend I was bitten just there.</em></p>
        <p>Okay so the first thing Ian did was place a sterile dressing over the bite, but it doesn't matter if you don't have one, the bandaging is the important part.</p>
        <p>Starting over the bite Ian wrapped the bandage firmly all the way along my limb - he then repeated that with a second bandage.</p>
        <p>IAN RENTON, SNAKE CATCHER: <em>You're compressing the tissue and slowing the movement of the venom down.</em></p>
        <p>Next he got a splint, which is something firm like a stick or a rolled up newspaper and he tied it to my arm to stop it moving.</p>
        <p>I would then need to stay quiet and still while someone else called for help.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A map is a two dimensional description of a specific area of land. Maps describe in a&nbsp; visual or graphic format certain key features of the territory being examined. For example, a road map of the state of Montana shows many of the important state roads, and how they interconnect. A roadmap might also show the towns and cities, as well as a few of the more popular destinations within a state. Other maps might show the distribution of birds along the wetlands of the Great Salt Lake, or the distribution of human populations throughout the world.</p>
        <p>Maps are important tools and are <strong>indispensable </strong>to geographers. They help geographers understand in a visual way, important things about the surface of the Earth. Where do evergreens grow, where are volcanoes actively erupting, and where trout are most likely to be found, are all examples of how a geographer might use a map.</p>

        <p>A map is a two dimensional description of a specific area of land. Maps describe in a&nbsp; visual or graphic format certain key features of the territory being examined. For example, a road map of the state of Montana shows many of the important state roads, and how they interconnect. A roadmap might also show the towns and cities, as well as a few of the more popular destinations within a state. Other maps might show the distribution of birds along the wetlands of the Great Salt Lake, or the distribution of human populations throughout the world.</p>
        <p>Maps are important tools and are <strong>indispensable </strong>to geographers. They help geographers understand in a visual way, important things about the surface of the Earth. Where do evergreens grow, where are volcanoes actively erupting, and where trout are most likely to be found, are all examples of how a geographer might use a map.</p>
