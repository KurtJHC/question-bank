<strong>India &amp; Japan</strong>: Birthdays in India are a celebration of togetherness and indulgence. Children ditch their school threads in favour of new clothes, often brightly coloured and being worn for the first time on their birthday. You start with your dessert, before dinner! After a happy birthday song has been sung, the birthday boy or girl slices the cake, takes a small slice and then feeds it to their guests. The guests will, in turn, return the favour and feed the birthday celebrator back.<br>
<br>
Prior to the 50s, Japan had one day that was dedicated to the celebration of birthdays. New Year’s Day. Everyone’s birthday would be celebrated then, as according to the ancient beliefs, that was the day everyone got older. As time has gone on, this has changed and birthdays are celebrated individually, on each person’s true birthday. The only time you’d organise your own party is as a child. Once older anything that is arranged is done so a few days before your actual birthday – and a cake is a must. It is very common in Japan to save your actual birthday for spending time with your partner, alone.<br>
<br>

Mexico: The traditions start with mariachis singing a song called ‘Las Mañanitas’ to serenade you as the sun rises. This song can be sung throughout the day as well. It is sung when the candles on the cake are lit, and it translates to ‘Little Mornings’.<br>
<br>
Speaking of cake, another Mexican birthday tradition is the good ol’ faceplant. The face of the birthday boy or girl is pushed into a creamy cake in this tradition known as ‘la mordida’, while everyone chants Mordida! Of course, we can’t forget the traditional piñata, as no Mexican birthday is complete without one!<br>
<br>
One of my favourites is the traditional tres leches cake (just in case you’re wondering – that’s a multicoloured mega cake). The more cream and the more layers, the better (couldn’t agree more). This cake is usually adorned with the things you love, similarly to in Western cultures, but in a multicoloured-mega-form. Another incredibly adorable tradition is the covering of your car. This sees your car absolutely covered in an array of brightly coloured post-its, each with a special something written on it. How sweet!<br>
<br>
{^ <strong>Extract C</strong> ^}<br>
China: In China, being born automatically gives you a birthday. While in Western cultures you are born and then you live a year before celebrating your first birthday, in China you are born as a one-year-old. Additionally in some Chinese traditions, although less common now, you will have a further year added to your age on your first Luna New Year’s Day. By the time you reach what would be considered your “first birthday” in other cultures, you could be three years old with “East Asian age reckoning”.<br>
<br>
There are some ages which are considered unlucky too, for women the main ones would be 30, 33 or 60. To avoid bad luck, a Chinese woman would remain 29 until she turned 31. Similarly, men dodge back by not acknowledging being 40.<br>
&nbsp;
<p>As far as Chinese celebrations and traditions go, all birthdays need to be celebrated before or on someone’s birthday. Never late. Birthday cakes have made their way into traditions, but most importantly a longevity noodle would be eaten. This is an unbroken egg noodle that would fill an entire bowl. It would be slurped up in one continuous strand, so to not cut your life short. Other traditional birthday banquet foods would include red- dyed hard-boiled eggs (cultural symbol for happiness) and dumplings (cultural symbol for good fortune).<br>
<br>
{^ <strong>Extract D</strong> ^}<br>
Judaism (Jewish culture): There are a lot of Jewish holidays which can last days at a time throughout the calendar, however, typically Judaism doesn’t make too much of a fuss about birthdays. That being said, there are certainly no objections to celebrating either a birthday when it occurs on either the Jewish or Gregorian calendar.<br>
<br>
As far as celebrations go, there are a few special birthdays where specific things would be celebrated, for example, the second or third, when the child’s weaning would be celebrated. Another is the third birthday, which is when traditional Jews would cut a son’s hair for the first time, or 12th/13th (depending on gender) when the Bar/Bat Mitzvah is celebrated. Outside of these specific milestone celebrations, there is not a traditional way to celebrate a birthday.<br>

Outside of these specific milestone celebrations, there is not a traditional way to celebrate a birthday.<br>

<strong>India &amp; Japan</strong>: Birthdays in India are a celebration of togetherness and indulgence. Children ditch their school threads in favour of new clothes, often brightly coloured and being worn for the first time on their birthday. You start with your dessert, before dinner! After a happy birthday song has been sung, the birthday boy or girl slices the cake, takes a small slice and then feeds it to their guests. The guests will, in turn, return the favour and feed the birthday celebrator back.<br>
<br>
Prior to the 50s, Japan had one day that was dedicated to the celebration of birthdays. New Year’s Day. Everyone’s birthday would be celebrated then, as according to the ancient beliefs, that was the day everyone got older. As time has gone on, this has changed and birthdays are celebrated individually, on each person’s true birthday. The only time you’d organise your own party is as a child. Once older anything that is arranged is done so a few days before your actual birthday – and a cake is a must. It is very common in Japan to save your actual birthday for spending time with your partner, alone.<br>
<br>
{^ <strong>Extract B</strong> ^}<br>
Mexico: The traditions start with mariachis singing a song called ‘Las Mañanitas’ to serenade you as the sun rises. This song can be sung throughout the day as well. It is sung when the candles on the cake are lit, and it translates to ‘Little Mornings’.<br>
<br>
Speaking of cake, another Mexican birthday tradition is the good ol’ faceplant. The face of the birthday boy or girl is pushed into a creamy cake in this tradition known as ‘la mordida’, while everyone chants Mordida! Of course, we can’t forget the traditional piñata, as no Mexican birthday is complete without one!<br>
<br>
One of my favourites is the traditional tres leches cake (just in case you’re wondering – that’s a multicoloured mega cake). The more cream and the more layers, the better (couldn’t agree more). This cake is usually adorned with the things you love, similarly to in Western cultures, but in a multicoloured-mega-form. Another incredibly adorable tradition is the covering of your car. This sees your car absolutely covered in an array of brightly coloured post-its, each with a special something written on it. How sweet!<br>
<br>
{^ <strong>Extract C</strong> ^}<br>
China: In China, being born automatically gives you a birthday. While in Western cultures you are born and then you live a year before celebrating your first birthday, in China you are born as a one-year-old. Additionally in some Chinese traditions, although less common now, you will have a further year added to your age on your first Luna New Year’s Day. By the time you reach what would be considered your “first birthday” in other cultures, you could be three years old with “East Asian age reckoning”.<br>
<br>
There are some ages which are considered unlucky too, for women the main ones would be 30, 33 or 60. To avoid bad luck, a Chinese woman would remain 29 until she turned 31. Similarly, men dodge back by not acknowledging being 40.<br>
&nbsp;
<p>As far as Chinese celebrations and traditions go, all birthdays need to be celebrated before or on someone’s birthday. Never late. Birthday cakes have made their way into traditions, but most importantly a longevity noodle would be eaten. This is an unbroken egg noodle that would fill an entire bowl. It would be slurped up in one continuous strand, so to not cut your life short. Other traditional birthday banquet foods would include red- dyed hard-boiled eggs (cultural symbol for happiness) and dumplings (cultural symbol for good fortune).<br>
<br>
{^ <strong>Extract D</strong> ^}<br>
Judaism (Jewish culture): There are a lot of Jewish holidays which can last days at a time throughout the calendar, however, typically Judaism doesn’t make too much of a fuss about birthdays. That being said, there are certainly no objections to celebrating either a birthday when it occurs on either the Jewish or Gregorian calendar.<br>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>The Little Prince</strong><br><br><em>by Antoine de Saint-Exupery</em><br><br>
“Nothing is perfect,” sighed the fox. But he came back to his idea. “My life is very monotonous,” the fox said. “I hunt chickens; men hunt me. All the chickens are just alike, and all the men are just alike. And, in consequence, I am a little bored. But if you tame me, it will be as if the sun came to shine on my life.<span class="txt-underline">&nbsp;</span><strong><span class="txt-underline">I shall know the sound of a step that will be different from all the others.</span>&nbsp;</strong>Other steps send me hurrying back underneath the ground. Yours will call me, like music, out of my burrow. And then look: you see the grain-fields down yonder? I do not eat bread. Wheat is of no use to me. The wheat fields have nothing to say to me. And that is sad. But you have hair that is the colour of gold. Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me! The grain, which is also golden, will bring me back the thought of you. And, I shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat...” The fox gazed at the little prince, for a long time. “Please — tame me!” he said.<br>
<br>
“I want to, very much,” the little prince replied. “But I have not much time. I have friends to discover, and a great many things to understand.”<br>
<br>
“One only understands the things that one tames,” said the fox. “Men have no more time to understand anything. They buy things all ready made at the shops. But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends anymore. If you want a friend, tame me...”<br>
<br>
“What must I do, to tame you?” asked the little prince.<br>
<br>
“You must be very patient,” replied the fox. “First you will sit down at a little distance from me — like that — in the grass. I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing. Words are the source of misunderstandings. But you will sit a little closer to me, every day...” The next day the little prince came back. “It would have been better to come back at the same hour,” said the fox. “If, for example, you come at four o’clock in the afternoon, then at three o’clock I shall begin to be happy. I shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances. At four o’clock, I shall already be worrying and jumping about. I shall show you how happy I am! But if you come at just any time, I shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you... One must observe the proper&nbsp; rites...”<br>
<br>
“What is a rite?” asked the little prince.<br>
<br>
“Those also are actions too often neglected,” said the fox. “They are what make one day different from other days, one hour from other hours. There is a rite, for example, among my hunters. Every Thursday they dance with the village girls. So Thursday is a wonderful day for me! I can take a walk as far as the vineyards. But if the hunters danced at just any time, every day would be like every other day, and I should never have any vacation at all.” So the little prince tamed the fox. And when the hour of his departure drew near — “Ah,” said the fox, “I shall cry.”<br>
<br>
“It is your own fault,” said the little prince. “I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you...”<br>
“Yes, that is so,” said the fox.<br>
“But now you are going to cry!” said the little prince.<br>
“Yes, that is so,” said the fox.<br>
“Then it has done you no good at all!”<br>
<br>
“It has done me good,” said the fox, “because of the colour of the wheat fields.” And then he added: “Go and look again at the roses. You will understand now that yours is unique in all the world. Then come back to say goodbye to me, and I will make you a present of a secret.” The little prince went away, to look again at the roses.<br>
<br>
“You are not at all like my rose,” he said. “As yet you are nothing. No one has tamed you, and you have tamed no one. You are like my fox when I first knew him. He was only a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But I have made him my friend, and now he is unique in all the world.” And the roses were very much embarrassed. “You are beautiful, but you are empty,” he went on. “One could not die for you. To be sure, an ordinary passerby would think that my rose looked just like you — the rose that belongs to me. But in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses: because it is she that I have watered; because it is she that I have put under the glass globe; because it is she that I have sheltered behind the screen; because it is for her that I have killed the caterpillars (except the two or thre&nbsp;&nbsp;that we saved to become butterflies); because it is she that I have listened to, when she grumbled, or boasted, or even sometimes when she said nothing. Because she is my rose.”<br>
<br>
And he went back to meet the fox.<br>
“Goodbye,” he said.<br>
“Goodbye,” said the fox. “And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly;<strong><span class="txt-underline">what is essential is invisible to the eye</span></strong>.”<br>
“What is essential is invisible to the eye,” the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.<br>
“It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.”<br>
“It is the time I have wasted for my rose — ” said the little prince, so that he would be sure to remember.<br>
“Men have forgotten this truth,” said the fox. “But you must not forget it. You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed. You are responsible for your rose...”<br>
“I am responsible for my rose,” the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.<br>

“Nothing is perfect,” sighed the fox. But he came back to his idea. “My life is very monotonous,” the fox said. “I hunt chickens; men hunt me. All the chickens are just alike, and all the men are just alike. And, in consequence, I am a little bored. But if you tame me, it will be as if the sun came to shine on my life.<span class="txt-underline">&nbsp;</span><strong><span class="txt-underline">I shall know the sound of a step that will be different from all the others.</span>&nbsp;</strong>Other steps send me hurrying back underneath the ground. Yours will call me, like music, out of my burrow. And then look: you see the grain-fields down yonder? I do not eat bread. Wheat is of no use to me. The wheat fields have nothing to say to me. And that is sad. But you have hair that is the colour of gold. Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me! The grain, which is also golden, will bring me back the thought of you. And, I shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat...” The fox gazed at the little prince, for a long time. “Please — tame me!” he said.<br>
<br>
“I want to, very much,” the little prince replied. “But I have not much time. I have friends to discover, and a great many things to understand.”<br>
<br>
“One only understands the things that one tames,” said the fox. “Men have no more time to understand anything. They buy things all ready made at the shops. But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends anymore. If you want a friend, tame me...”<br>
<br>
“What must I do, to tame you?” asked the little prince.<br>
<br>
“You must be very patient,” replied the fox. “First you will sit down at a little distance from me — like that — in the grass. I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing. Words are the source of misunderstandings. But you will sit a little closer to me, every day...” The next day the little prince came back. “It would have been better to come back at the same hour,” said the fox. “If, for example, you come at four o’clock in the afternoon, then at three o’clock I shall begin to be happy. I shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances. At four o’clock, I shall already be worrying and jumping about. I shall show you how happy I am! But if you come at just any time, I shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you... One must observe the proper&nbsp; rites...”<br>
<br>
“What is a rite?” asked the little prince.<br>
<br>
“Those also are actions too often neglected,” said the fox. “They are what make one day different from other days, one hour from other hours. There is a rite, for example, among my hunters. Every Thursday they dance with the village girls. So Thursday is a wonderful day for me! I can take a walk as far as the vineyards. But if the hunters danced at just any time, every day would be like every other day, and I should never have any vacation at all.” So the little prince tamed the fox. And when the hour of his departure drew near — “Ah,” said the fox, “I shall cry.”<br>
<br>
“It is your own fault,” said the little prince. “I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you...”<br>
“Yes, that is so,” said the fox.<br>
“But now you are going to cry!” said the little prince.<br>
“Yes, that is so,” said the fox.<br>
“Then it has done you no good at all!”<br>
<br>
“It has done me good,” said the fox, “because of the colour of the wheat fields.” And then he added: “Go and look again at the roses. You will understand now that yours is unique in all the world. Then come back to say goodbye to me, and I will make you a present of a secret.” The little prince went away, to look again at the roses.<br>
<br>
“You are not at all like my rose,” he said. “As yet you are nothing. No one has tamed you, and you have tamed no one. You are like my fox when I first knew him. He was only a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But I have made him my friend, and now he is unique in all the world.” And the roses were very much embarrassed. “You are beautiful, but you are empty,” he went on. “One could not die for you. To be sure, an ordinary passerby would think that my rose looked just like you — the rose that belongs to me. But in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses: because it is she that I have watered; because it is she that I have put under the glass globe; because it is she that I have sheltered behind the screen; because it is for her that I have killed the caterpillars (except the two or thre&nbsp;&nbsp;that we saved to become butterflies); because it is she that I have listened to, when she grumbled, or boasted, or even sometimes when she said nothing. Because she is my rose.”<br>
<br>
And he went back to meet the fox.<br>
“Goodbye,” he said.<br>
“Goodbye,” said the fox. “And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly;<strong><span class="txt-underline">what is essential is invisible to the eye</span></strong>.”<br>
“What is essential is invisible to the eye,” the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.<br>
“It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.”<br>
“It is the time I have wasted for my rose — ” said the little prince, so that he would be sure to remember.<br>
“Men have forgotten this truth,” said the fox. “But you must not forget it. You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed. You are responsible for your rose...”<br>
“I am responsible for my rose,” the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.<br>

And, I shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat...” The fox gazed at the little prince, for a long time. “Please — tame me!” he said.<br>
<br>
“I want to, very much,” the little prince replied. “But I have not much time. I have friends to discover, and a great many things to understand.”<br>
<br>
“One only understands the things that one tames,” said the fox. “Men have no more time to understand anything. They buy things all ready made at the shops. But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends anymore. If you want a friend, tame me...”<br>
<br>
“What must I do, to tame you?” asked the little prince.<br>
<br>
“You must be very patient,” replied the fox. “First you will sit down at a little distance from me — like that — in the grass. I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing. Words are the source of misunderstandings. But you will sit a little closer to me, every day...” The next day the little prince came back. “It would have been better to come back at the same hour,” said the fox. “If, for example, you come at four o’clock in the afternoon, then at three o’clock I shall begin to be happy. I shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances. At four o’clock, I shall already be worrying and jumping about. I shall show you how happy I am! But if you come at just any time, I shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you... One must observe the proper&nbsp; rites...”<br>
<br>
“What is a rite?” asked the little prince.<br>
<br>
“Those also are actions too often neglected,” said the fox. “They are what make one day different from other days, one hour from other hours. There is a rite, for example, among my hunters. Every Thursday they dance with the village girls. So Thursday is a wonderful day for me! I can take a walk as far as the vineyards. But if the hunters danced at just any time, every day would be like every other day, and I should never have any vacation at all.” So the little prince tamed the fox. And when the hour of his departure drew near — “Ah,” said the fox, “I shall cry.”<br>
<br>
“It is your own fault,” said the little prince. “I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you...”<br>
“Yes, that is so,” said the fox.<br>
“But now you are going to cry!” said the little prince.<br>
“Yes, that is so,” said the fox.<br>
“Then it has done you no good at all!”<br>
<br>
“It has done me good,” said the fox, “because of the colour of the wheat fields.” And then he added: “Go and look again at the roses. You will understand now that yours is unique in all the world. Then come back to say goodbye to me, and I will make you a present of a secret.” The little prince went away, to look again at the roses.<br>
<br>
“You are not at all like my rose,” he said. “As yet you are nothing. No one has tamed you, and you have tamed no one. You are like my fox when I first knew him. He was only a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But I have made him my friend, and now he is unique in all the world.” And the roses were very much embarrassed. “You are beautiful, but you are empty,” he went on. “One could not die for you. To be sure, an ordinary passerby would think that my rose looked just like you — the rose that belongs to me. But in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses: because it is she that I have watered; because it is she that I have put under the glass globe; because it is she that I have sheltered behind the screen; because it is for her that I have killed the caterpillars (except the two or thre&nbsp;&nbsp;that we saved to become butterflies); because it is she that I have listened to, when she grumbled, or boasted, or even sometimes when she said nothing. Because she is my rose.”<br>
<br>
And he went back to meet the fox.<br>
“Goodbye,” he said.<br>
“Goodbye,” said the fox. “And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly;<strong><span class="txt-underline">what is essential is invisible to the eye</span></strong>.”<br>
“What is essential is invisible to the eye,” the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.<br>
“It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.”<br>
“It is the time I have wasted for my rose — ” said the little prince, so that he would be sure to remember.<br>
“Men have forgotten this truth,” said the fox. “But you must not forget it. You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed. You are responsible for your rose...”<br>
“I am responsible for my rose,” the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.<br>

“Nothing is perfect,” sighed the fox. But he came back to his idea. “My life is very monotonous,” the fox said. “I hunt chickens; men hunt me.

I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing. Words are the source of misunderstandings. But you will sit a little closer to me, every day...” The next day the little prince came back. “It would have been better to come back at the same hour,” said the fox. “If, for example, you come at four o’clock in the afternoon, then at three o’clock I shall begin to be happy. I shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances. At four o’clock, I shall already be worrying and jumping about. I shall show you how happy I am! But if you come at just any time, I shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you... One must observe the proper&nbsp; rites...”<br>
<br>
“What is a rite?” asked the little prince.<br>
<br>
“Those also are actions too often neglected,” said the fox. “They are what make one day different from other days, one hour from other hours. There is a rite, for example, among my hunters. Every Thursday they dance with the village girls. So Thursday is a wonderful day for me! I can take a walk as far as the vineyards. But if the hunters danced at just any time, every day would be like every other day, and I should never have any vacation at all.” So the little prince tamed the fox. And when the hour of his departure drew near — “Ah,” said the fox, “I shall cry.”<br>
<br>
“It is your own fault,” said the little prince. “I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you...”<br>
“Yes, that is so,” said the fox.<br>
“But now you are going to cry!” said the little prince.<br>
“Yes, that is so,” said the fox.<br>
“Then it has done you no good at all!”<br>
<br>
“It has done me good,” said the fox, “because of the colour of the wheat fields.” And then he added: “Go and look again at the roses. You will understand now that yours is unique in all the world. Then come back to say goodbye to me, and I will make you a present of a secret.” The little prince went away, to look again at the roses.<br>
<br>
“You are not at all like my rose,” he said. “As yet you are nothing. No one has tamed you, and you have tamed no one. You are like my fox when I first knew him. He was only a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But I have made him my friend, and now he is unique in all the world.” And the roses were very much embarrassed. “You are beautiful, but you are empty,” he went on. “One could not die for you. To be sure, an ordinary passerby would think that my rose looked just like you — the rose that belongs to me. But in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses: because it is she that I have watered; because it is she that I have put under the glass globe; because it is she that I have sheltered behind the screen; because it is for her that I have killed the caterpillars (except the two or thre&nbsp;&nbsp;that we saved to become butterflies); because it is she that I have listened to, when she grumbled, or boasted, or even sometimes when she said nothing. Because she is my rose.”<br>
<br>
And he went back to meet the fox.<br>
“Goodbye,” he said.<br>
“Goodbye,” said the fox. “And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly;<strong><span class="txt-underline">what is essential is invisible to the eye</span></strong>.”<br>
“What is essential is invisible to the eye,” the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.<br>
“It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.”<br>
“It is the time I have wasted for my rose — ” said the little prince, so that he would be sure to remember.<br>
“Men have forgotten this truth,” said the fox. “But you must not forget it. You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed. You are responsible for your rose...”<br>
“I am responsible for my rose,” the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.<br>

<strong>India &amp; Japan</strong>: Birthdays in India are a celebration of togetherness and indulgence. Children ditch their school threads in favour of new clothes, often brightly coloured and being worn for the first time on their birthday. You start with your dessert, before dinner! After a happy birthday song has been sung, the birthday boy or girl slices the cake, takes a small slice and then feeds it to their guests. The guests will, in turn, return the favour and feed the birthday celebrator back.<br>
<br>
Prior to the 50s, Japan had one day that was dedicated to the celebration of birthdays. New Year’s Day. Everyone’s birthday would be celebrated then, as according to the ancient beliefs, that was the day everyone got older. As time has gone on, this has changed and birthdays are celebrated individually, on each person’s true birthday. The only time you’d organise your own party is as a child. Once older anything that is arranged is done so a few days before your actual birthday – and a cake is a must. It is very common in Japan to save your actual birthday for spending time with your partner, alone.<br>
<br>
{^ <strong>Extract B</strong> ^}<br>
Mexico: The traditions start with mariachis singing a song called ‘Las Mañanitas’ to serenade you as the sun rises. This song can be sung throughout the day as well. It is sung when the candles on the cake are lit, and it translates to ‘Little Mornings’.<br>
<br>
Speaking of cake, another Mexican birthday tradition is the good ol’ faceplant. The face of the birthday boy or girl is pushed into a creamy cake in this tradition known as ‘la mordida’, while everyone chants Mordida! Of course, we can’t forget the traditional piñata, as no Mexican birthday is complete without one!<br>
<br>
One of my favourites is the traditional tres leches cake (just in case you’re wondering – that’s a multicoloured mega cake). The more cream and the more layers, the better (couldn’t agree more). This cake is usually adorned with the things you love, similarly to in Western cultures, but in a multicoloured-mega-form. Another incredibly adorable tradition is the covering of your car. This sees your car absolutely covered in an array of brightly coloured post-its, each with a special something written on it. How sweet!<br>
<br>
{^ <strong>Extract C</strong> ^}<br>
China: In China, being born automatically gives you a birthday. While in Western cultures you are born and then you live a year before celebrating your first birthday, in China you are born as a one-year-old. Additionally in some Chinese traditions, although less common now, you will have a further year added to your age on your first Luna New Year’s Day. By the time you reach what would be considered your “first birthday” in other cultures, you could be three years old with “East Asian age reckoning”.<br>
<br>
There are some ages which are considered unlucky too, for women the main ones would be 30, 33 or 60. To avoid bad luck, a Chinese woman would remain 29 until she turned 31. Similarly, men dodge back by not acknowledging being 40.<br>
&nbsp;
<p>As far as Chinese celebrations and traditions go, all birthdays need to be celebrated before or on someone’s birthday. Never late. Birthday cakes have made their way into traditions, but most importantly a longevity noodle would be eaten. This is an unbroken egg noodle that would fill an entire bowl. It would be slurped up in one continuous strand, so to not cut your life short. Other traditional birthday banquet foods would include red- dyed hard-boiled eggs (cultural symbol for happiness) and dumplings (cultural symbol for good fortune).<br>
<br>
{^ <strong>Extract D</strong> ^}<br>
Judaism (Jewish culture): There are a lot of Jewish holidays which can last days at a time throughout the calendar, however, typically Judaism doesn’t make too much of a fuss about birthdays. That being said, there are certainly no objections to celebrating either a birthday when it occurs on either the Jewish or Gregorian calendar.<br>
<br>
As far as celebrations go, there are a few special birthdays where specific things would be celebrated, for example, the second or third, when the child’s weaning would be celebrated. Another is the third birthday, which is when traditional Jews would cut a son’s hair for the first time, or 12th/13th (depending on gender) when the Bar/Bat Mitzvah is celebrated. Outside of these specific milestone celebrations, there is not a traditional way to celebrate a birthday.<br>

<strong>India &amp; Japan</strong>: Birthdays in India are a celebration of togetherness and indulgence. Children ditch their school threads in favour of new clothes, often brightly coloured and being worn for the first time on their birthday. You start with your dessert, before dinner! After a happy birthday song has been sung, the birthday boy or girl slices the cake, takes a small slice and then feeds it to their guests. The guests will, in turn, return the favour and feed the birthday celebrator back.<br>
<br>
Prior to the 50s, Japan had one day that was dedicated to the celebration of birthdays. New Year’s Day. Everyone’s birthday would be celebrated then, as according to the ancient beliefs, that was the day everyone got older. As time has gone on, this has changed and birthdays are celebrated individually, on each person’s true birthday. The only time you’d organise your own party is as a child. Once older anything that is arranged is done so a few days before your actual birthday – and a cake is a must. It is very common in Japan to save your actual birthday for spending time with your partner, alone.<br>
<br>

Mexico: The traditions start with mariachis singing a song called ‘Las Mañanitas’ to serenade you as the sun rises. This song can be sung throughout the day as well. It is sung when the candles on the cake are lit, and it translates to ‘Little Mornings’.<br>
<br>
Speaking of cake, another Mexican birthday tradition is the good ol’ faceplant. The face of the birthday boy or girl is pushed into a creamy cake in this tradition known as ‘la mordida’, while everyone chants Mordida! Of course, we can’t forget the traditional piñata, as no Mexican birthday is complete without one!<br>
<br>
One of my favourites is the traditional tres leches cake (just in case you’re wondering – that’s a multicoloured mega cake). The more cream and the more layers, the better (couldn’t agree more). This cake is usually adorned with the things you love, similarly to in Western cultures, but in a multicoloured-mega-form. Another incredibly adorable tradition is the covering of your car. This sees your car absolutely covered in an array of brightly coloured post-its, each with a special something written on it. How sweet!<br>
<br>
{^ <strong>Extract C</strong> ^}<br>
China: In China, being born automatically gives you a birthday. While in Western cultures you are born and then you live a year before celebrating your first birthday, in China you are born as a one-year-old. Additionally in some Chinese traditions, although less common now, you will have a further year added to your age on your first Luna New Year’s Day. By the time you reach what would be considered your “first birthday” in other cultures, you could be three years old with “East Asian age reckoning”.<br>
<br>
There are some ages which are considered unlucky too, for women the main ones would be 30, 33 or 60. To avoid bad luck, a Chinese woman would remain 29 until she turned 31. Similarly, men dodge back by not acknowledging being 40.<br>
&nbsp;
<p>As far as Chinese celebrations and traditions go, all birthdays need to be celebrated before or on someone’s birthday. Never late. Birthday cakes have made their way into traditions, but most importantly a longevity noodle would be eaten. This is an unbroken egg noodle that would fill an entire bowl. It would be slurped up in one continuous strand, so to not cut your life short. Other traditional birthday banquet foods would include red- dyed hard-boiled eggs (cultural symbol for happiness) and dumplings (cultural symbol for good fortune).<br>
<br>
{^ <strong>Extract D</strong> ^}<br>
Judaism (Jewish culture): There are a lot of Jewish holidays which can last days at a time throughout the calendar, however, typically Judaism doesn’t make too much of a fuss about birthdays. That being said, there are certainly no objections to celebrating either a birthday when it occurs on either the Jewish or Gregorian calendar.<br>
<br>
As far as celebrations go, there are a few special birthdays where specific things would be celebrated, for example, the second or third, when the child’s weaning would be celebrated. Another is the third birthday, which is when traditional Jews would cut a son’s hair for the first time, or 12th/13th (depending on gender) when the Bar/Bat Mitzvah is celebrated. Outside of these specific milestone celebrations, there is not a traditional way to celebrate a birthday.<br>
