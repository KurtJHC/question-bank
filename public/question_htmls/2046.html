        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Where the Red Fern Grows&nbsp;</strong><br><em>by Wilson Rawls</em>&nbsp;<br><br>
When I left my office that beautiful spring day, I had no idea what was in store for me. To begin with, everything was too perfect for anything unusual to happen. It was one of those days when a man feels good, feels like speaking to his neighbor, is glad to live in a country like ours, and proud of his government. You know what I mean, one of those rare days when everything is right and nothing is wrong.</p>
        <p>I was walking along whistling when I heard the dogfight. At first, I paid no attention to it. After all it wasn’t anything to get excited about, just another dogfight in a residential section.</p>
        <p>As the sound of the fight grew nearer, I could tell there were quite a few dogs mixed up in it. They boiled out of an alley, turned, and headed straight toward me. Not wanting to get bitten or run over, I moved over to the edge of the sidewalk.</p>
        <p>I could see that all the dogs were fighting one. About twenty-five feet from me they caught him and down he went. I felt sorry for the unfortunate one. I knew if something wasn’t done quickly the sanitation department would have to pick up a dead dog.</p>
        <p>I was trying to make up my mind to help when I got a surprise. Up out of that snarling, growling, slashing mass reared an old redbone hound. For a second, I saw him. I caught my breath. I couldn’t believe what I had seen.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Twisting and slashing, he fought his way through the pack and backed up under the low branches of a hedge. Growling and snarling, they formed a halfmoon circle around him. A big bird dog, bolder than the others, darted in. The hedge shook as he tangled with the hound. He came out so fast he fell over backwards. I saw that his right ear was split wide open. It was too much for him and he took off down the street, squalling like a scalded cat.</p>
        <p>A big ugly cur tried his luck. He didn’t get off so easy. He came out with his left shoulder laid open to the bone. He sat down on his rear and let the world know that he had been hurt.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>By this time, my fighting blood was boiling. It’s hard for a man to stand and watch an old hound fight against such odds, especially if that man has memories in his heart like I had in mine. I had seen the time when an old hound like that had given his life so that I might live.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Taking off my coat, I waded in. My yelling and scolding didn’t have much effect, but the swinging coat did. The dogs scattered and left.</p>
        <p>Down on my knees, I peered back under the hedge. The hound was still mad. He growled at me and showed his teeth. I knew it wasn’t his nature to fight a man.</p>
        <p>In a soft voice, I started talking to him. “Come on, boy,” I said. “It’s all right. I’m your friend. Come on now.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fighting fire slowly left his eyes. He bowed his head and his long, red tail started thumping the ground. I kept coaxing. On his stomach, an inch at a time, he came to me and laid his head in my hand.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I almost cried at what I saw. His coat was dirty and mud-caked. His skin was stretched drum-tight over his bony frame. The knotty joints of his hips and shoulders stood out a good three inches from his body. I could tell he was starved.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I couldn’t figure it out. He didn’t belong in town. He was far out of place with the boxers, poodles, bird dogs, and other breeds of town dogs. He belonged in the country. He was a hunting hound.</p>

        <p><em>Read the poem below by Linda Ellis then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>The Dash Poem&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
I read of a man who stood to speak&nbsp;<br>
at the funeral of a friend.&nbsp;<br>
He referred to the dates on the tombstone&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
from the beginning…to the end.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He noted that first came the date of birth&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
and spoke of the following date with tears&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
but said what mattered most of all&nbsp;<br>
was the dash between those years.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For that dash represents all the time&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
they spent alive on earth&nbsp;<br>
and now only those who loved them&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
know what that little line is worth.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For it matters not, how much we own,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
the cars…the house…the cash.&nbsp;<br>
What matters is how we lived&nbsp;<br>
and loved and <span class="txt-underline"><strong>how we spend our dash.</strong></span>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So, think about this long and hard;&nbsp;<br>
are there things you’d like to change?&nbsp;<br>
For you never know how much time is left&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
that still can be rearranged.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To be less quick to anger&nbsp;<br>
and show appreciation more&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
and love the people in our lives&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
like we’ve never loved before.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If we treat each other with respect&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
and more often wear a smile…&nbsp;<br>
<span class="txt-underline"><strong>remembering that this special dash</strong></span><br>
<span class="txt-underline"><strong>might only last a little while.</strong></span></p>
        <p>So, when your eulogy is being read,&nbsp;<br>
with your life’s actions to rehash,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
would you be proud of the things&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
they say about how you lived your dash?</p>

        <p><em>Read the poem below by Linda Ellis then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>The Dash Poem&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
I read of a man who stood to speak&nbsp;<br>
at the funeral of a friend.&nbsp;<br>
He referred to the dates on the tombstone&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
from the beginning…to the end.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He noted that first came the date of birth&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
and spoke of the following date with tears&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
but said what mattered most of all&nbsp;<br>
was the dash between those years.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For that dash represents all the time&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
they spent alive on earth&nbsp;<br>
and now only those who loved them&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
know what that little line is worth.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For it matters not, how much we own,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
the cars…the house…the cash.&nbsp;<br>
What matters is how we lived&nbsp;<br>
and loved and&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline"><strong>how we spend our dash</strong></span>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So, think about this long and hard;&nbsp;<br>
are there things you’d like to change?&nbsp;<br>
For you never know how much time is left&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
that still can be rearranged.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To be less quick to anger&nbsp;<br>
and show appreciation more&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
and love the people in our lives&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
like we’ve never loved before.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If we treat each other with respect&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
and more often wear a smile…&nbsp;<br>
<span class="txt-underline"><strong>remembering that this special dash<br>
might only last a little while.</strong></span></p>
        <p>So, when your eulogy is being read,&nbsp;<br>
with your life’s actions to rehash,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
would you be proud of the things&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
​they say about how you lived your dash?</p>

        <p><em>Read the poem below by Linda Ellis then answer the questions.</em>&nbsp;<br><br><strong>The Dash Poem&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
I read of a man who stood to speak&nbsp;<br>
at the funeral of a friend.&nbsp;<br>
He referred to the dates on the tombstone&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
from the beginning…to the end.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He noted that first came the date of birth&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
and spoke of the following date with tears&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
but said what mattered most of all&nbsp;<br>
was the dash between those years.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For that dash represents all the time&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
they spent alive on earth&nbsp;<br>
and now only those who loved them&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
know what that little line is worth.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For it matters not, how much we own,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
the cars…the house…the cash.&nbsp;<br>
What matters is how we lived&nbsp;<br>
and loved and&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline"><strong>how we spend our dash</strong></span>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So, think about this long and hard;&nbsp;<br>
are there things you’d like to change?&nbsp;<br>
For you never know how much time is left&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
that still can be rearranged.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To be less quick to anger&nbsp;<br>
and show appreciation more&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
and love the people in our lives&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Madrid is the capital of Spain. It's also one of the most eclectic cities in the world. Madrid is filled with culture as well as excitement. There is literally something in Madrid that will attract young and old alike. Whether you're looking for culture or activities, Madrid has it all.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Madrid is a cosmopolitan city and is the economic, administrative and financial center of Spain. The city offers vast artistic and cultural legacies and heritage. Whether you're visiting Madrid for business or pleasure, you'll find a pleasing blend of old and new, past and present throughout the streets.<br>
<br>
Madrid is also famous for its sightseeing tours, monuments, and exquisite architectural cathedrals and buildings. While in Madrid, don't pass up an opportunity to visit the 17<sup>th</sup> century&nbsp;<em>Cuchilleros Arch</em>&nbsp;or the <em>San Francisco El Grande Basilica</em>. The&nbsp;<em>Cibeles Fountain</em>&nbsp;is one of the most famous symbols of Madrid, also constructed in the 17<sup>th</sup> century.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Barcelona, nestled along the western shores of the Mediterranean, is also a modern and cosmopolitan city, but one rich in history. Visitors to Barcelona can roam among Roman remains, medieval quarters, and 20<sup>th</sup> century architecture. Barcelona is home to several World Heritage Sites, including architectural wonders by Catalan architects Gaud and Montaner.<br>
<br>
Like Madrid, Barcelona offers a variety of parks and gardens, museums, monuments, and other entertainments. The younger crowd may enjoy its beaches. Spanish architecture is at its finest in Barcelona, and visitors to the area shouldn't pass up the opportunity to visit the&nbsp;<em>Picasso Museum</em>&nbsp;or the&nbsp;<em>Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art</em>.<br>
<br>
One cannot visit Barcelona without visiting at least one beach. You have plenty to choose from, <em>La Barceloneta</em>&nbsp;beach to&nbsp;<em>Playa del Paseo Martimo</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>La Mar Bella</em>, each offering beautiful stretches of beachfront, glistening and warm Mediterranean waters, and easy access.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Seville is one of the oldest cities in Spain, and one of the most beautiful. Seville is rich in the heritage of the Moors, located on the banks of the Guadalquivir River. Located in Andalusia, the Southern city is filled with squares, historic quarters and lively streets. The city boasts a large number of theme parks, art centres, museums, and theatres that cater to just about every age and fancy.<br>
<br>
While in Seville, take an afternoon and visit the&nbsp;<em>Seville Museum of Art and Popular</em> Customs, the&nbsp;<em>Andalusia Contemporary Art Center</em>, or the <em>Seville Archaeological Museum</em>.<br>
<br>
View and stroll through the impressive&nbsp;<em>Seville Cathedral</em>, which stands on the side of the great Mosque from the 12<sup>th</sup> century. Or visit the&nbsp;<em>Casa de Pilatos House</em>, whose construction began near the end of the 15<sup>th</sup> century and has become the prototype of Andalusian palaces. One of the most beautiful sights in Seville is the&nbsp;<em>Santa Paula Convent</em>, where nuns still live and sell their unique sweets. No visit to Seville would be complete without visiting the&nbsp;<em>Torre del Oro Tower</em>, one of the most famous symbols of Seville.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
If your travels or business ventures happen to take you outside of Madrid, Barcelona, or Seville, see if you can sneak a side trip into a variety of other Spanish destinations including the Canary Islands. Alternatively, take a drive through the Pyrenees Mountains, or take an afternoon drive along the thousands of miles of beachfront roads.<br>
<br>
Cities such as Valencia, Cordoba, and Salamanca offer visitors additional delights, sites, and tourist attractions. Travel the route of the Knights Templar or follow the path of St. James through Spain.<br>
<br>
Spain is home of the second-largest number of World Heritage Sites around the globe. These UNESCO sites are scattered throughout Spain, a majority of them found in Central Spain and along the Mediterranean coastline, from Barcelona to Gibraltar.<br>

Madrid is the capital of Spain. It's also one of the most eclectic cities in the world. Madrid is filled with culture as well as excitement. There is literally something in Madrid that will attract young and old alike. Whether you're looking for culture or activities, Madrid has it all.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Madrid is a cosmopolitan city and is the economic, administrative and financial center of Spain. The city offers vast artistic and cultural legacies and heritage. Whether you're visiting Madrid for business or pleasure, you'll find a pleasing blend of old and new, past and present throughout the streets.<br>
<br>
Madrid is also famous for its sightseeing tours, monuments, and exquisite architectural cathedrals and buildings. While in Madrid, don't pass up an opportunity to visit the 17<sup>th</sup> century&nbsp;<em>Cuchilleros Arch</em>&nbsp;or the&nbsp;<em>San Francisco El Grande Basilica</em>. The&nbsp;<em>Cibeles Fountain</em>&nbsp;is one of the most famous symbols of Madrid, also constructed in the 17<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Barcelona, nestled along the western shores of the Mediterranean, is also a modern and cosmopolitan city, but one rich in history. Visitors to Barcelona can roam among Roman remains, medieval quarters, and 20<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century architecture. Barcelona is home to several World Heritage Sites, including architectural wonders by Catalan architects Gaud and Montaner.<br>
<br>
Like Madrid, Barcelona offers a variety of parks and gardens, museums, monuments, and other entertainments. The younger crowd may enjoy its beaches. Spanish architecture is at its finest in Barcelona, and visitors to the area shouldn't pass up the opportunity to visit the&nbsp;<em>Picasso Museum</em>&nbsp;or the&nbsp;<em>Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art</em>.<br>
<br>
One cannot visit Barcelona without visiting at least one beach. You have plenty to choose from, <em>La Barceloneta</em>&nbsp;beach to&nbsp;<em>Playa del Paseo Martimo</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>La Mar Bella</em>, each offering beautiful stretches of beachfront, glistening and warm Mediterranean waters, and easy access.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Seville is one of the oldest cities in Spain, and one of the most beautiful. Seville is rich in the heritage of the Moors, located on the banks of the Guadalquivir River. Located in Andalusia, the Southern city is filled with squares, historic quarters and lively streets. The city boasts a large number of theme parks, art centres, museums, and theatres that cater to just about every age and fancy.<br>
<br>
While in Seville, take an afternoon and visit the&nbsp;<em>Seville Museum of Art</em> <em>and Popular&nbsp;Customs, the&nbsp;Andalusia Contemporary Art Center</em>, or the&nbsp;<em>Seville Archaeological Museum</em>.<br>
<br>
View and stroll through the impressive&nbsp;<em>Seville Cathedral</em>, which stands on the side of the great Mosque from the 12<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century. Or visit the&nbsp;<em>Casa de Pilatos House</em>, whose construction began near the end of the 15<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century and has become the prototype of Andalusian palaces. One of the most beautiful sights in Seville is the&nbsp;<em>Santa Paula Convent</em>, where nuns still live and sell their unique sweets. No visit to Seville would be complete without visiting the&nbsp;<em>Torre del Oro Tower</em>, one of the most famous symbols of Seville.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
If your travels or business ventures happen to take you outside of Madrid, Barcelona, or Seville, see if you can sneak a side trip into a variety of other Spanish destinations including the Canary Islands. Alternatively, take a drive through the Pyrenees Mountains, or take an afternoon drive along the thousands of miles of beachfront roads.<br>
<br>
Cities such as Valencia, Cordoba, and Salamanca offer visitors additional delights, sites, and tourist attractions. Travel the route of the Knights Templar or follow the path of St. James through Spain.<br>
<br>
Spain is home of the second-largest number of World Heritage Sites around the globe. These UNESCO sites are scattered throughout Spain, a majority of them found in Central Spain and along the Mediterranean coastline, from Barcelona to Gibraltar.<br>

While in Seville, take an afternoon and visit the<em>&nbsp;Seville Museum of Art&nbsp;and&nbsp;Popular&nbsp;Customs</em>, the&nbsp;<em>Andalusia Contemporary Art Center</em>, or the&nbsp;<em>Seville Archaeological Museum</em>.<br>
<br>
View and stroll through the impressive&nbsp;<em>Seville Cathedral</em>, which stands on the side of the great Mosque from the 12<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century. Or visit the&nbsp;<em>Casa de Pilatos House</em>, whose construction began near the end of the 15<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century and has become the prototype of Andalusian palaces. One of the most beautiful sights in Seville is the&nbsp;<em>Santa Paula Convent</em>, where nuns still live and sell their unique sweets. No visit to Seville would be complete without visiting the&nbsp;<em>Torre del Oro Tower</em>, one of the most famous symbols of Seville.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
If your travels or business ventures happen to take you outside of Madrid, Barcelona, or Seville, see if you can sneak a side trip into a variety of other Spanish destinations including the Canary Islands. Alternatively, take a drive through the Pyrenees Mountains, or take an afternoon drive along the thousands of miles of beachfront roads.<br>
<br>
Cities such as Valencia, Cordoba, and Salamanca offer visitors additional delights, sites, and tourist attractions. Travel the route of the Knights Templar or follow the path of St. James through Spain.<br>
<br>
Spain is home of the second-largest number of World Heritage Sites around the globe. These UNESCO sites are scattered throughout Spain, a majority of them found in Central Spain and along the Mediterranean coastline, from Barcelona to Gibraltar.<br>

Madrid is the capital of Spain. It's also one of the most eclectic cities in the world. Madrid is filled with culture as well as excitement. There is literally something in Madrid that will attract young and old alike. Whether you're looking for culture or activities, Madrid has it all.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Madrid is a cosmopolitan city and is the economic, administrative and financial center of Spain. The city offers vast artistic and cultural legacies and heritage. Whether you're visiting Madrid for business or pleasure, you'll find a pleasing blend of old and new, past and present throughout the streets.<br>
<br>
Madrid is also famous for its sightseeing tours, monuments, and exquisite architectural cathedrals and buildings. While in Madrid, don't pass up an opportunity to visit the 17<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century&nbsp;<em>Cuchilleros Arch</em>&nbsp;or the&nbsp;<em>San Francisco El Grande Basilica</em>. The&nbsp;<em>Cibeles Fountain</em>&nbsp;is one of the most famous symbols of Madrid, also constructed in the 17<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Barcelona, nestled along the western shores of the Mediterranean, is also a modern and cosmopolitan city, but one rich in history. Visitors to Barcelona can roam among Roman remains, medieval quarters, and 20<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century architecture. Barcelona is home to several World Heritage Sites, including architectural wonders by <em>Catalan architects Gaud and Montaner</em>.<br>
<br>
Like Madrid, Barcelona offers a variety of parks and gardens, museums, monuments, and other entertainments. The younger crowd may enjoy its beaches. Spanish architecture is at its finest in Barcelona, and visitors to the area shouldn't pass up the opportunity to visit the&nbsp;<em>Picasso Museum</em>&nbsp;or the&nbsp;<em>Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art</em>.<br>
<br>
One cannot visit Barcelona without visiting at least one beach. You have plenty to choose from,&nbsp;<em>La Barceloneta</em>&nbsp;beach to&nbsp;<em>Playa del Paseo Martimo</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>La Mar Bella</em>, each offering beautiful stretches of beachfront, glistening and warm Mediterranean waters, and easy access.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Seville is one of the oldest cities in Spain, and one of the most beautiful. Seville is rich in the heritage of the Moors, located on the banks of the Guadalquivir River. Located in Andalusia, the Southern city is filled with squares, historic quarters and lively streets. The city boasts a large number of theme parks, art centres, museums, and theatres that cater to just about every age and fancy.<br>
<br>
