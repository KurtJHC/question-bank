          <strong>Nina the Gorilla</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by John V. Eickhoff</em>
        </p>
        <p>Nina the gorilla was seven years old when I met her and her companions, Kiki and one other male. When I began working with them, I was doing a research project. My main job was to write down what each gorilla did at a particular time.</p>
        <p>Nina seemed to like me. When I stood outside the cage window, she ambled over to sit beside me. She looked over my shoulder as I wrote. She followed me around.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; The research I did helped me understand the kinds of behaviour that are acceptable in a gorilla troop. Gorillas behave differently toward one another, depending on whether the other animal is higher or lower in&nbsp;rank. The troop is led by the highest-ranking male, who is respected by the other gorillas. In the wild, he is responsible for the safety and wellbeing of the troop.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Leader</strong><br>
Kiki was leader of the gorilla troop that lived at the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle, Washington. Almost from the beginning, he resented my presence.</p>
        <p>When he noticed me, he stiffened his arms and legs to make himself taller. He lifted his head and pressed his lips tightly together. He then strutted back and forth, his hair standing up. All of these behaviours are signals of aggression in gorillas.</p>
        <p>If this didn’t drive me away, he charged and hit the heavy glass that separated us. That is about as aggressive as a gorilla ever gets. This behaviour is the same as that of a wild gorilla who is challenged by the actions of another male. Kiki seemed to think I was challenging his position, probably because I am a big man and because of the way Nina reacted to me.</p>
        <p>I tried to ease the tension between us by saying, in gorilla body language, “I recognize your dominance over me.” I did this by avoiding eye contact, turning my face away when he looked at me, and trying to make myself smaller when he approached.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Gorilla Language</strong><br>
Gorillas communicate using body posture, facial expressions, and gestures. They can't speak as we do, partly because their lips, tongues, and vocal cords cannot make many of the sounds of human speech.</p>
        <p>They can make some sounds, about twenty, each of which has a different meaning. For example, a short grunt means, “I am content.” But most of their communication is not by sounds.</p>
        <p>By watching the gorillas closely and spending a lot of time “talking” to them, I found we could communicate on a simple level. I could give them the idea of what I wanted them to do, such as take their vitamin pills or move from one cage to another.</p>
        <p>I learned to tell when they were feeling irritable, content, happy, sad or playful. The&nbsp;gorillas learned that by gesturing they could ask to go outside or tell me that they wanted a&nbsp;certain food.</p>
        <p>It was a crude way to communicate, but it was all we needed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Big News</strong><br>
After working at the zoo for about six years, I moved to another city but continued to visit. One day, I read in the newspaper that Nina had given birth to her fourth baby. This was exciting news because gorilla births in zoos are fairly rare.</p>
        <p>I was anxious to see Nina and her baby, but it was several months before I got the chance. It had been nearly a year since I had visited the gorillas. I wondered if they would remember me after such a long time.</p>
        <p>As I entered the viewing area, I saw the gorillas foraging for food in their large, brushy yard. Nina was eating about a hundred feet away. As I approached the glass that separated us, she glanced in my direction and immediately froze in mid-chew.</p>
        <p>She tilted her head as if she wanted to confirm that I was really there. She then made the gesture that we had used as our greeting signal-a Jerk of her head while pursing her lips, as though throwing a kiss.</p>
        <p>She was showing me she recognized me. I was surprised she still remembered me, but a bigger surprise was yet to come.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Nina's Baby</strong><br>
I returned her greeting, and she immediately began searching through the tall grass nearby. She soon found what she was looking for.</p>
        <p>Reaching behind a log, she picked up a small bundle of black fur. Placing it on her back, where it clung tightly, she began walking toward me. She glanced up occasionally to make sure I was still there. She smacked her lips in excitement.</p>
        <p>She stopped next to me and sat down. Reaching behind her, she&nbsp;removed her baby from her back and held it toward me. Then&nbsp;she cradled it in her arms, patting it gently on the head.</p>
        <p>She looked at me questioningly and I clapped my hands in&nbsp;approval. The questioning look disappeared, and she seemed&nbsp;content. Through the glass I could hear a grunt of satisfaction.</p>
        <p>She then began to play with the baby, holding up its hands and&nbsp;feet and pointing to its fingers and toes. It was as if she were proudly showing me that it&nbsp;had the right parts.</p>
        <p>Now, each time I see any kind of ape portrayed as a monster, I remember Nina gently&nbsp;showing me her baby’s fingers and toes</p>

          <strong>Nina the Gorilla</strong>

          <strong>Nina the Gorilla</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by John V. Eickhoff</em>
        </p>
        <p>Nina the gorilla was seven years old when I met her and her companions, Kiki and one other male. When I began working with them, I was doing a research project. My main job was to write down what each gorilla did at a particular time.</p>
        <p>Nina seemed to like me. When I stood outside the cage window, she ambled over to sit beside me. She looked over my shoulder as I wrote. She followed me around.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; The research I did helped me understand the kinds of behaviour that are acceptable in a gorilla troop. Gorillas behave differently toward one another, depending on whether the other animal is higher or lower in&nbsp;rank. The troop is led by the highest-ranking male, who is respected by the other gorillas. In the wild, he is responsible for the safety and wellbeing of the troop.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Leader</strong><br>
Kiki was leader of the gorilla troop that lived at the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle, Washington. Almost from the beginning, he resented my presence.</p>
        <p>When he noticed me, he stiffened his arms and legs to make himself taller. He lifted his head and pressed his lips tightly together. He then strutted back and forth, his hair standing up. All of these behaviours are signals of aggression in gorillas.</p>
        <p>If this didn’t drive me away, he charged and hit the heavy glass that separated us. That is about as aggressive as a gorilla ever gets. This behaviour is the same as that of a wild gorilla who is challenged by the actions of another male. Kiki seemed to think I was challenging his position, probably because I am a big man and because of the way Nina reacted to me.</p>
        <p>I tried to ease the tension between us by saying, in gorilla body language, “I recognize your dominance over me.” I did this by avoiding eye contact, turning my face away when he looked at me, and trying to make myself smaller when he approached.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Gorilla Language</strong><br>
Gorillas communicate using body posture, facial expressions, and gestures. They can't speak as we do, partly because their lips, tongues, and vocal cords cannot make many of the sounds of human speech.</p>
        <p>They can make some sounds, about twenty, each of which has a different meaning. For example, a short grunt means, “I am content.” But most of their communication is not by sounds.</p>
        <p>By watching the gorillas closely and spending a lot of time “talking” to them, I found we could communicate on a simple level. I could give them the idea of what I wanted them to do, such as take their vitamin pills or move from one cage to another.</p>
        <p>I learned to tell when they were feeling irritable, content, happy, sad or playful. The&nbsp;gorillas learned that by gesturing they could ask to go outside or tell me that they wanted a&nbsp;certain food.</p>
        <p>It was a crude way to communicate, but it was all we needed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Big News</strong><br>
After working at the zoo for about six years, I moved to another city but continued to visit. One day, I read in the newspaper that Nina had given birth to her fourth baby. This was exciting news because gorilla births in zoos are fairly rare.</p>
        <p>I was anxious to see Nina and her baby, but it was several months before I got the chance. It had been nearly a year since I had visited the gorillas. I wondered if they would remember me after such a long time.</p>
        <p>As I entered the viewing area, I saw the gorillas foraging for food in their large, brushy yard. Nina was eating about a hundred feet away. As I approached the glass that separated us, she glanced in my direction and immediately froze in mid-chew.</p>
        <p>She tilted her head as if she wanted to confirm that I was really there. She then made the gesture that we had used as our greeting signal-a Jerk of her head while pursing her lips, as though throwing a kiss.</p>
        <p>She was showing me she recognized me. I was surprised she still remembered me, but a bigger surprise was yet to come.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Nina's Baby</strong><br>
I returned her greeting, and she immediately began searching through the tall grass nearby. She soon found what she was looking for.</p>
        <p>Reaching behind a log, she picked up a small bundle of black fur. Placing it on her back, where it clung tightly, she began walking toward me. She glanced up occasionally to make sure I was still there. She smacked her lips in excitement.</p>
        <p>She stopped next to me and sat down. Reaching behind her, she&nbsp;removed her baby from her back and held it toward me. Then&nbsp;she cradled it in her arms, patting it gently on the head.</p>
        <p>She looked at me questioningly and I clapped my hands in&nbsp;approval. The questioning look disappeared, and she seemed&nbsp;content. Through the glass I could hear a grunt of satisfaction.</p>
        <p>She then began to play with the baby, holding up its hands and&nbsp;feet and pointing to its fingers and toes. It was as if she were proudly showing me that it&nbsp;had the right parts.</p>
        <p>Now, each time I see any kind of ape portrayed as a monster, I remember Nina gently&nbsp;showing me her baby’s fingers and toes</p>

          <strong>Nina the Gorilla</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by John V. Eickhoff</em>
        </p>
        <p>Nina the gorilla was seven years old when I met her and her companions, Kiki and one other male. When I began working with them, I was doing a research project. My main job was to write down what each gorilla did at a particular time.</p>
        <p>Nina seemed to like me. When I stood outside the cage window, she ambled over to sit beside me. She looked over my shoulder as I wrote. She followed me around.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; The research I did helped me understand the kinds of behaviour that are acceptable in a gorilla troop. Gorillas behave differently toward one another, depending on whether the other animal is higher or lower in&nbsp;rank. The troop is led by the highest-ranking male, who is respected by the other gorillas. In the wild, he is responsible for the safety and wellbeing of the troop.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Leader</strong><br>
Kiki was leader of the gorilla troop that lived at the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle, Washington. Almost from the beginning, he resented my presence.</p>
        <p>When he noticed me, he stiffened his arms and legs to make himself taller. He lifted his head and pressed his lips tightly together. He then strutted back and forth, his hair standing up. All of these behaviours are signals of aggression in gorillas.</p>
        <p>If this didn’t drive me away, he charged and hit the heavy glass that separated us. That is about as aggressive as a gorilla ever gets. This behaviour is the same as that of a wild gorilla who is challenged by the actions of another male. Kiki seemed to think I was challenging his position, probably because I am a big man and because of the way Nina reacted to me.</p>
        <p>I tried to ease the tension between us by saying, in gorilla body language, “I recognize your dominance over me.” I did this by avoiding eye contact, turning my face away when he looked at me, and trying to make myself smaller when he approached.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Gorilla Language</strong><br>
Gorillas communicate using body posture, facial expressions, and gestures. They can't speak as we do, partly because their lips, tongues, and vocal cords cannot make many of the sounds of human speech.</p>
        <p>They can make some sounds, about twenty, each of which has a different meaning. For example, a short grunt means, “I am content.” But most of their communication is not by sounds.</p>
        <p>By watching the gorillas closely and spending a lot of time “talking” to them, I found we could communicate on a simple level. I could give them the idea of what I wanted them to do, such as take their vitamin pills or move from one cage to another.</p>
        <p>I learned to tell when they were feeling irritable, content, happy, sad or playful. The&nbsp;gorillas learned that by gesturing they could ask to go outside or tell me that they wanted a&nbsp;certain food.</p>
        <p>It was a crude way to communicate, but it was all we needed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Big News</strong><br>
After working at the zoo for about six years, I moved to another city but continued to visit. One day, I read in the newspaper that Nina had given birth to her fourth baby. This was exciting news because gorilla births in zoos are fairly rare.</p>
        <p>I was anxious to see Nina and her baby, but it was several months before I got the chance. It had been nearly a year since I had visited the gorillas. I wondered if they would remember me after such a long time.</p>
        <p>As I entered the viewing area, I saw the gorillas foraging for food in their large, brushy yard. Nina was eating about a hundred feet away. As I approached the glass that separated us, she glanced in my direction and immediately froze in mid-chew.</p>
        <p>She tilted her head as if she wanted to confirm that I was really there. She then made the gesture that we had used as our greeting signal-a Jerk of her head while pursing her lips, as though throwing a kiss.</p>
        <p>She was showing me she recognized me. I was surprised she still remembered me, but a bigger surprise was yet to come.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Nina's Baby</strong><br>
I returned her greeting, and she immediately began searching through the tall grass nearby. She soon found what she was looking for.</p>
        <p>Reaching behind a log, she picked up a small bundle of black fur. Placing it on her back, where it clung tightly, she began walking toward me. She glanced up occasionally to make sure I was still there. She smacked her lips in excitement.</p>
        <p>She stopped next to me and sat down. Reaching behind her, she&nbsp;removed her baby from her back and held it toward me. Then&nbsp;she cradled it in her arms, patting it gently on the head.</p>
        <p>She looked at me questioningly and I clapped my hands in&nbsp;approval. The questioning look disappeared, and she seemed&nbsp;content. Through the glass I could hear a grunt of satisfaction.</p>
        <p>She then began to play with the baby, holding up its hands and&nbsp;feet and pointing to its fingers and toes. It was as if she were proudly showing me that it&nbsp;had the right parts.</p>
        <p>Now, each time I see any kind of ape portrayed as a monster, I remember Nina gently&nbsp;showing me her baby’s fingers and toes</p>

          <strong>Young Night Thought</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Robert Louis Stevenson</em>

        <p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All night long and every night,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When my mama puts out the light,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I see the people marching by,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As plain as day, before my eye.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; Armies and emperors and kings,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All carrying different kinds of things,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And marching in so grand a way,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You never saw the like by day.</p>
        <p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So fine a show was never seen,<br>
10&nbsp; At the great circus on the green,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For every kind of beast and man,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is marching in that caravan.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At first they move a little slow,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But still the faster on they go,<br>
15&nbsp; And still beside them close I keep,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until we reach the town of Sleep.</p>

          <strong>Young Night Thought</strong>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All night long and every night,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When my mama puts out the light,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I see the people marching by,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As plain as day, before my eye.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; Armies and emperors and kings,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All carrying different kinds of things,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And marching in so grand a way,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You never saw the like by day.</p>
        <p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So fine a show was never seen,<br>
10&nbsp; At the great circus on the green,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For every kind of beast and man,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is marching in that caravan.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At first they move a little slow,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But still the faster on they go,<br>
15&nbsp; And still beside them close I keep,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until we reach the town of Sleep.</p>

          <strong>The Clever Judge</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">retold by Babette Deutsch and Avrahm Yarmolinsky</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>Babette Deutsch, one of the authors of </em>Tales of Faraway Folk<em>, from which this story is taken, identifies “The Clever Judge” as a Kirghiz folk tale. In the introduction she says: “The people who tell this tale live on the vast steppes or prairies of south-western Asia. They are herders of cattle, sheep, and goats. And they are clever fellows, too, as you shall see.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; There lived a man in the steppes who was famous for his justice and wisdom. At that time if a man was known for his fairness, people came to him from far and wide to ask him to settle their disputes. And so it was that one day two villagers appeared before this wise man and asked him to settle their quarrel.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Tell me your story,” the judge said to Sergio, the plaintiff.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“I had to leave my village,” said Sergio, “for I had business elsewhere. And all my wealth was a hundred gold coins. I did not come by them easily. I had to work hard for them, and I did not want them to be stolen while I was away. Nor did I care to carry so much money with me on my journey. So I entrusted these gold coins for safekeeping to this man here. When I got back from my journey, he denied that he had ever received the money from me.”</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“And who saw you give him these hundred gold coins?” asked the judge.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“No one saw it. We went together to the heart of the forest and there I handed him the coins.”</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“What have you to say to this?” the judge asked, turning to the defendant, Goran.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Goran shrugged his shoulders. “I don’t know what he is talking about,” said the man. “I never went to the forest with him. I never saw his gold coins.”</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Do you remember the place where you handed over the money?” the judge asked Sergio.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Of course I do. It was under a tall oak. I remember it very well. I can point it out with no trouble at all.”</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“So you do have a witness, after all,” said the judge. “Here, take my signet ring, go to the tall tree under which you stood when you handed over the money,&nbsp;set the seal of my signet ring against the trunk, and bid the tree appear before me to bear out the truth of your story.”</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sergio took the signet ring and went off to carry out the demand of the judge. Goran remained behind and waited for his return.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After some time had passed, the judge turned to Goran and asked, “Do you think he has reached the oak by this time?”</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“No, not yet,” was the answer.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After further time had passed, the judge again turned to Goran and asked, “Do you think he has reached the tree by this time?”</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes,” was the answer, “by now he must have reached it.” Not long after that Sergio returned.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Well?” asked the judge.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“I did just as you said,” replied Sergio. “I walked as far as the forest and then I went on until I came to the tall oak under which we stood when I handed over my gold coins. I set the seal of your signet ring against the trunk of the tree and I bade it appear before you as a witness. But the tree refused to budge.”</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Never mind,” said the judge. “The oak has appeared before me and it has borne witness in your favour.”</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At that Goran exclaimed, “How can you say such a thing! I have been here all this while and no tree has stalked into the place.”</p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“But,” replied the judge, “you said that you had not been in the forest at all. And yet when I asked you whether Sergio had reached the oak, first you answered that he could not have reached it, and the second time you said that he must surely have reached it. Therefore, you were in the forest and you remembered where the oak was under which you stood when Sergio handed his gold coins to you for safekeeping. Now you must not only return him his hundred gold pieces, but you must also pay a fine for having tried to cheat him.”</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">21&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;So the tree was a witness without budging, and justice was done.</p>
