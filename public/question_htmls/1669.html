        <p><strong>Holden Equinox</strong>: While the Holden Equinox was a comparatively late entrant into the medium-sized SUV market, it has quickly established itself as one of the very best.</p>
        <p>Boasting a massive goodie bag of features, including a 7-inch touchscreen, active noise cancellation, 17-inch alloy wheels, a reversing camera, and automatic headlights, the Equinox is certainly top of its class when it comes to kit.</p>
        <p>In terms of on-road performance, the Equinox fares equally well, offering a comfortable ride with a ton of storage space, highlighted by an engine that delivers a stunning 188kW of power – far more than any of its competitors. Of course, this added power doesn’t compromise the safety or practicality you would expect from a top of the line medium-sized SUV.</p>

        <p><strong>Hyundai Tucson</strong>: The Hyundai Tucson has everything that you would expect from a high-quality medium-sized SUV – comfort, safety, an eye-catching design, and a long list of features.</p>
        <p>However, what really sets it apart from competitors is its on-road performance, offering a smooth, comfortable ride unmatched by any other opponents, highlighted by top-notch suspension, a refined engine, and reliable steering.</p>
        <p>In terms of safety, the Tucson is also a winner, delivering six airbags (including dual front airbags), as well as front-side and full-length curtain airbags, and electronic stability control. Partner this with an extremely spacious boot and ISOFIX anchor points, and the Hyundai Tucson is sure to appeal to parents.</p>

        <p><strong>Mitsubishi Outlander</strong>: If you’re lucky enough to land in an Outlander, you’ll quickly see why this roomy SUV has been making waves. The Mitsubishi Outlander is equipped with 7 seats – a rare sight among its closest competitors in the medium-sized SUV market, exceeding expectancies of what a medium-sized SUV is often presumed to be. This makes for an extremely spacious interior, and no lack of storage room.</p>
        <p>Also setting it apart from other medium-sized SUVs, the Outlander features a turbo-diesel engine, which makes for a refined and effortless driving experience. Between the seven seats and the diesel engine, the Mitsubishi Outlander is in a class all of its own when it comes to medium-sized SUVs. Pair this with a solid entertainment system, a standard list of safety features and an intuitive design, and the Mitsubishi Outlander is a real standout!</p>

exceptionally well-designed interior. Really, there are little touches of class wherever you look.</p>
        <p>The CX-9 also knocks it out of the park when it comes to safety beating all of its competitors, including a rear-view camera, blind-spot monitoring, autonomous braking in case of emergency, ISOFIX connection points, rear sensors for parking, and six airbags.</p>

        <p><strong>Holden Equinox</strong>: While the Holden Equinox was a comparatively late entrant into the medium-sized SUV market, it has quickly established itself as one of the very best.</p>
        <p>Boasting a massive goodie bag of features, including a 7-inch touchscreen, active noise cancellation, 17-inch alloy wheels, a reversing camera, and automatic headlights, the Equinox is certainly top of its class when it comes to kit.</p>
        <p>In terms of on-road performance, the Equinox fares equally well, offering a comfortable ride with a ton of storage space, highlighted by an engine that delivers a stunning 188kW of power – far more than any of its competitors. Of course, this added power doesn’t compromise the safety or practicality you would expect from a top of the line medium-sized SUV.</p>

        <p><strong>Hyundai Tucson</strong>: The Hyundai Tucson has everything that you would expect from a high-quality medium-sized SUV – comfort, safety, an eye-catching design, and a long list of features.</p>
        <p>However, what really sets it apart from competitors is its on-road performance, offering a smooth, comfortable ride unmatched by any other opponents, highlighted by top-notch suspension, a refined engine, and reliable steering.</p>
        <p>In terms of safety, the Tucson is also a winner, delivering six airbags (including dual front airbags), as well as front-side and full-length curtain airbags, and electronic stability control. Partner this with an extremely spacious boot and ISOFIX anchor points, and the Hyundai Tucson is sure to appeal to parents.</p>

        <p><strong>Mitsubishi Outlander</strong>: If you’re lucky enough to land in an Outlander, you’ll quickly see why this roomy SUV has been making waves. The Mitsubishi Outlander is equipped with 7 seats – a rare sight among its closest competitors in the medium-sized SUV market, exceeding expectancies of what a medium-sized SUV is often presumed to be. This makes for an extremely spacious interior, and no lack of storage room.</p>
        <p>Also setting it apart from other medium-sized SUVs, the Outlander features a turbo-diesel engine, which makes for a refined and effortless driving experience. Between the seven seats and the diesel engine, the Mitsubishi Outlander is in a class all of its own when it comes to medium-sized SUVs. Pair this with a solid entertainment system, a standard list of safety features and an intuitive design, and the Mitsubishi Outlander is a real standout!</p>

exceptionally well-designed interior. Really, there are little touches of class wherever you look.</p>
        <p>The CX-9 also knocks it out of the park when it comes to safety beating all of its competitors, including a rear-view camera, blind-spot monitoring, autonomous braking in case of emergency, ISOFIX connection points, rear sensors for parking, and six airbags.</p>

Mazda obviously don’t believe in trading size for comfort, with the large CX-9 featuring an elegant leather steering wheel, paired with black cloth seat covers, which round out an<br>
exceptionally well-designed interior. Really, there are little touches of class wherever you look.</p>
        <p>The CX-9 also knocks it out of the park when it comes to safety beating all of its competitors, including a rear-view camera, blind-spot monitoring, autonomous braking in case of emergency, ISOFIX connection points, rear sensors for parking, and six airbags.</p>

        <p><strong>Holden Equinox</strong>: While the Holden Equinox was a comparatively late entrant into the medium-sized SUV market, it has quickly established itself as one of the very best.</p>
        <p>Boasting a massive goodie bag of features, including a 7-inch touchscreen, active noise cancellation, 17-inch alloy wheels, a reversing camera, and automatic headlights, the Equinox is certainly top of its class when it comes to kit.</p>
        <p>In terms of on-road performance, the Equinox fares equally well, offering a comfortable ride with a ton of storage space, highlighted by an engine that delivers a stunning 188kW of power – far more than any of its competitors. Of course, this added power doesn’t compromise the safety or practicality you would expect from a top of the line medium-sized SUV.</p>

        <p>However, what really sets it apart from competitors is its on-road performance, offering a smooth, comfortable ride unmatched by any other opponents, highlighted by top-notch suspension, a refined engine, and reliable steering.</p>
        <p>In terms of safety, the Tucson is also a winner, delivering six airbags (including dual front airbags), as well as front-side and full-length curtain airbags, and electronic stability control. Partner this with an extremely spacious boot and ISOFIX anchor points, and the Hyundai Tucson is sure to appeal to parents.</p>

        <p><strong>Mitsubishi Outlander</strong>: If you’re lucky enough to land in an Outlander, you’ll quickly see why this roomy SUV has been making waves. The Mitsubishi Outlander is equipped with 7 seats – a rare sight among its closest competitors in the medium-sized SUV market, exceeding expectancies of what a medium-sized SUV is often presumed to be. This makes for an extremely spacious interior, and no lack of storage room.</p>
        <p>Also setting it apart from other medium-sized SUVs, the Outlander features a turbo-diesel engine, which makes for a refined and effortless driving experience. Between the seven seats and the diesel engine, the Mitsubishi Outlander is in a class all of its own when it comes to medium-sized SUVs. Pair this with a solid entertainment system, a standard list of safety features and an intuitive design, and the Mitsubishi Outlander is a real standout!</p>

        <p><strong>Mitsubishi Outlander</strong>: If you’re lucky enough to land in an Outlander, you’ll quickly see why this roomy SUV has been making waves. The Mitsubishi Outlander is equipped with 7 seats – a rare sight among its closest competitors in the medium-sized SUV market, exceeding expectancies of what a medium-sized SUV is often presumed to be. This makes for an extremely spacious interior, and no lack of storage room.</p>
        <p>Also setting it apart from other medium-sized SUVs, the Outlander features a turbo-diesel engine, which makes for a refined and effortless driving experience. Between the seven seats and the diesel engine, the Mitsubishi Outlander is in a class all of its own when it comes to medium-sized SUVs. Pair this with a solid entertainment system, a standard list of safety features and an intuitive design, and the Mitsubishi Outlander is a real standout!</p>

        <p><strong>Mazda CX-9</strong>: The Mazda CX-9 is a large SUV loaded with a little luxury. Upon entering the CX-9, you could be forgiven for mistaking it for a smaller, flashier model.

<strong>Holden Equinox</strong>: While the Holden Equinox was a comparatively late entrant into the medium-sized SUV market, it has quickly established itself as one of the very best.</p>
        <p>Boasting a massive goodie bag of features, including a 7-inch touchscreen, active noise cancellation, 17-inch alloy wheels, a reversing camera, and automatic headlights, the Equinox is certainly top of its class when it comes to kit.</p>

        <p>In terms of safety, the Tucson is also a winner, delivering six airbags (including dual front airbags), as well as front-side and full-length curtain airbags, and electronic stability control.

This makes for an extremely spacious interior, and no lack of storage room.</p>
        <p>Also setting it apart from other medium-sized SUVs, the Outlander features a turbo-diesel engine, which makes for a refined and effortless driving experience. Between the seven seats and the diesel engine, the Mitsubishi Outlander is in a class all of its own when it comes to medium-sized SUVs.
