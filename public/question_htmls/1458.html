Miscommunication happens often enough face to face. But it happens far more frequently over text messages.<br>

Alice was texting back and forth with her friend when suddenly she went silent after a simple question. In the middle of a meeting, John received a three-page text message from his wife. Sandy accidently sent a personal text message to the wrong person causing a series of awkward responses. All of these misunderstandings could be avoided by following a few simple guidelines.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Here are the top texting rules: Know your audience. Double check everything. Text alone. Texting is casual conversation only, not serious. Always respond, but don’t open a text message unless you intend to respond immediately. Know the difference between useful and non-useful texting. Remember that pictures are not secure and don’t presume that texting is confidential.<br>

In 2021, buying the best phone means looking for something that should last you a few years. Smartphones’ upgrade cycles are slowing down for a reason. Even at lower prices, it’s getting harder and harder to buy a lemon. In other words, you don’t have to spend a huge amount to get something great, as a bunch of great smartphones are available for around $800.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
It’s harder than ever to decide between everything in that range, but for most people, our pick for the best phone is the Apple iPhone 12. Luckily, if you’re looking for a nocompromise smartphone at any price, the choices over a thousand dollars are much clearer. If you like Android, the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra is incredibly good. And if you want to get the best smartphone on a budget, you can find something really good for under $500 or even under $400.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
By texting less and calling more, I was reminded that people are always nicer on the phone than on text. Face to face they are even nicer than that. Arguments are resolved more quickly. But talking on the phone scares people. Technology has created a new rigidity when it comes to conversation. Calling is usually planned and scheduled. I still text all the time. But I am calling more too. I am back in the habit, and for me, it is infinitely more satisfying to have a conversation that is two sided and flexible and unpredictable. No device will be ever able to replace personal conversation.&nbsp;<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Should a young child have a mobile? Most mobiles offer almost complete access to the internet and are much harder to filter and control than your home computer. A mobile also gives the outside world, including undesirables, another way to communicate with a child.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Mobiles also put your child at risk for getting in trouble if limits aren’t in place. Or a child might make prank calls or be blamed for them if a classmate takes their phone and uses it to make inappropriate calls.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Whether or not your child is ready for or needs a mobile is something you will have to decide for yourself. Make sure that your child can handle the responsibility for a mobile before you buy one. When getting your younger child, a mobile, consider putting some limits in place.&nbsp;<br>

          <strong>The Railway Children&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Edith Nesbit</em>&nbsp;<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When they had finished singing, they cried, “Three cheers for <span class="txt-underline"><strong>our Bobbie</strong></span>!” and said them very loudly. Bobbie felt exactly as though she were going to cry — you know that odd feeling in the bridge of your nose and the pricking in your eyelids? But before she had time to begin, they were all kissing and hugging her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Now,” said Mother, “look at your presents.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They were very nice presents. There was a green and red needle-book that Phyllis had made herself in secret moments. There was a darling little silver brooch of Mother's shaped like a buttercup, which Bobbie had known and loved for years, but which she had never, never thought would come to be her very own. There was also a pair of blue glass vases from Mrs. Viney. Roberta had seen and admired them in the village shop. And there were three birthday cards with pretty pictures and wishes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Mother fitted the forget-me-not crown on Bobbie's brown head.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“And now look at the table,” she said.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was a cake on the table covered with white sugar, with 'Dear Bobbie' on it in pink sweets, and there were buns and jam; but the nicest thing was that the big table was almost covered with flowers — wallflowers were laid all around the tea-tray — there was a ring of forget-me-nots round each plate. The cake had a wreath of white lilac round it, and in the middle was something that looked like a pattern all done with single blooms of lilac and wall-flower and laburnum.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“It's a map — a map of the railway!” cried Peter. “Look — those lilac lines are the metals — and there's the station done in brown wallflowers. The lilac is the train, and there are the signal-boxes, and the road up to here — and those fat red daisies are us three waving to the old gentleman — that's him, the pansy in the laburnum train.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“And there's 'Three Chimneys' done in the purple primroses,” said Phyllis. “And that little, tiny rose-bud is Mother looking out for us when we're late for tea. Peter invented it all, and we got all the flowers from the station. We thought you'd like it better.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“That's my present,” said Peter, suddenly dumping down his adored train engine on the table in front of her. Its tender* had been lined with fresh white paper and was full of sweets.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Oh, Peter!” cried Bobbie, quite overcome by this munificence, “not your own dear little engine that you're so fond of?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh, no,” said Peter, very promptly, “not the engine. Only the sweets.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bobbie couldn't help her face changing a little — not so much because she was disappointed at not getting the engine, as because she had thought it so very noble of Peter, and now she felt she had been silly to think it. Also, she felt she must have seemed greedy to expect the engine as well as the sweets. So her face changed. Peter saw it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He hesitated a minute; then his face changed, too, and he said: “I mean not ALL the engine. I'll let you go halves if you like.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You're a brick,” cried Bobbie; “it's a splendid present.” She said no more aloud, but to herself she said: —&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“That was awfully jolly decent of Peter because I know he didn't mean to. Well, the broken half shall be my half of the engine, and I'll get it mended and give it back to Peter for his birthday.” — “Yes, Mother dear, I should like to cut the cake,” she added, and tea began.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was a delightful birthday. After tea Mother played games with them — any game they liked — and of course their first choice was blindman's-buff, in the course of which Bobbie's forget-me-not wreath twisted itself crookedly over one of her ears and stayed there. Then, when it was near bed-time and time to calm down, Mother had a lovely new story to read to them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You won't sit up late working, will you, Mother?” Bobbie asked as they said good night.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Mother said no, she wouldn't — she would only just write to Father and then go to bed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But when Bobbie crept down later to bring up her presents — for she felt she really could not be separated from them all night — Mother was not writing but leaning her head on her arms and her arms on the table. Bobbie slipped quietly away, saying over and over, “She doesn't want me to know she's unhappy, and I won't know; I won't know.” But it made a sad end to the birthday.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>The Railway Children&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Edith Nesbit</em>&nbsp;<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When they had finished singing, they cried, “Three cheers for <span class="txt-underline"><strong>our Bobbie</strong></span>!” and said them very loudly. Bobbie felt exactly as though she were going to cry — you know that odd feeling in the bridge of your nose and the pricking in your eyelids? But before she had time to begin, they were all kissing and hugging her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Now,” said Mother, “look at your presents.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They were very nice presents. There was a green and red needle-book that Phyllis had made herself in secret moments. There was a darling little silver brooch of Mother's shaped like a buttercup, which Bobbie had known and loved for years, but which she had never, never thought would come to be her very own. There was also a pair of blue glass vases from Mrs. Viney. Roberta had seen and admired them in the village shop. And there were three birthday cards with pretty pictures and wishes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Mother fitted the forget-me-not crown on Bobbie's brown head.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“And now look at the table,” she said.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was a cake on the table covered with white sugar, with 'Dear Bobbie' on it in pink sweets, and there were buns and jam; but the nicest thing was that the big table was almost covered with flowers — wallflowers were laid all around the tea-tray — there was a ring of forget-me-nots round each plate. The cake had a wreath of white lilac round it, and in the middle was something that looked like a pattern all done with single blooms of lilac and wall-flower and laburnum.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“It's a map — a map of the railway!” cried Peter. “Look — those lilac lines are the metals — and there's the station done in brown wallflowers. The lilac is the train, and there are the signal-boxes, and the road up to here — and those fat red daisies are us three waving to the old gentleman — that's him, the pansy in the laburnum train.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“And there's 'Three Chimneys' done in the purple primroses,” said Phyllis. “And that little, tiny rose-bud is Mother looking out for us when we're late for tea. Peter invented it all, and we got all the flowers from the station. We thought you'd like it better.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“That's my present,” said Peter, suddenly dumping down his adored train engine on the table in front of her. Its tender* had been lined with fresh white paper and was full of sweets.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Oh, Peter!” cried Bobbie, quite overcome by this munificence, “not your own dear little engine that you're so fond of?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh, no,” said Peter, very promptly, “not the engine. Only the sweets.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bobbie couldn't help her face changing a little — not so much because she was disappointed at not getting the engine, as because she had thought it so very noble of Peter, and now she felt she had been silly to think it. Also, she felt she must have seemed greedy to expect the engine as well as the sweets. So her face changed. Peter saw it.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“That was awfully jolly decent of Peter because I know he didn't mean to. Well, the broken half shall be my half of the engine, and I'll get it mended and give it back to Peter for his birthday.” — “Yes, Mother dear, I should like to cut the cake,” she added, and tea began.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was a delightful birthday. After tea Mother played games with them — any game they liked — and of course their first choice was blindman's-buff, in the course of which Bobbie's forget-me-not wreath twisted itself crookedly over one of her ears and stayed there. Then, when it was near bed-time and time to calm down, Mother had a lovely new story to read to them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You won't sit up late working, will you, Mother?” Bobbie asked as they said good night.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>The Railway Children&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Edith Nesbit</em>&nbsp;<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When they had finished singing, they cried, “Three cheers for <span class="txt-underline"><strong>our Bobbie</strong></span>!” and said them very loudly. Bobbie felt exactly as though she were going to cry — you know that odd feeling in the bridge of your nose and the pricking in your eyelids? But before she had time to begin, they were all kissing and hugging her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Now,” said Mother, “look at your presents.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They were very nice presents. There was a green and red needle-book that Phyllis had made herself in secret moments. There was a darling little silver brooch of Mother's shaped like a buttercup, which Bobbie had known and loved for years, but which she had never, never thought would come to be her very own. There was also a pair of blue glass vases from Mrs. Viney. Roberta had seen and admired them in the village shop. And there were three birthday cards with pretty pictures and wishes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Mother fitted the forget-me-not crown on Bobbie's brown head.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“And now look at the table,” she said.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was a cake on the table covered with white sugar, with 'Dear Bobbie' on it in pink sweets, and there were buns and jam; but the nicest thing was that the big table was almost covered with flowers — wallflowers were laid all around the tea-tray — there was a ring of forget-me-nots round each plate. The cake had a wreath of white lilac round it, and in the middle was something that looked like a pattern all done with single blooms of lilac and wall-flower and laburnum.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“It's a map — a map of the railway!” cried Peter. “Look — those lilac lines are the metals — and there's the station done in brown wallflowers. The lilac is the train, and there are the signal-boxes, and the road up to here — and those fat red daisies are us three waving to the old gentleman — that's him, the pansy in the laburnum train.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“And there's 'Three Chimneys' done in the purple primroses,” said Phyllis. “And that little, tiny rose-bud is Mother looking out for us when we're late for tea. Peter invented it all, and we got all the flowers from the station. We thought you'd like it better.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“That's my present,” said Peter, suddenly dumping down his adored train engine on the table in front of her. Its tender* had been lined with fresh white paper and was full of sweets.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Oh, Peter!” cried Bobbie, quite overcome by this munificence, “not your own dear little engine that you're so fond of?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh, no,” said Peter, very promptly, “not the engine. Only the sweets.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bobbie couldn't help her face changing a little — not so much because she was disappointed at not getting the engine, as because she had thought it so very noble of Peter, and now she felt she had been silly to think it. Also, she felt she must have seemed greedy to expect the engine as well as the sweets. So her face changed. Peter saw it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He hesitated a minute; then his face changed, too, and he said: “I mean not ALL the engine. I'll let you go halves if you like.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You're a brick,” cried Bobbie; “it's a splendid present.” She said no more aloud, but to herself she said: —&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“That was awfully jolly decent of Peter because I know he didn't mean to. Well, the broken half shall be my half of the engine, and I'll get it mended and give it back to Peter for his birthday.” — “Yes, Mother dear, I should like to cut the cake,” she added, and tea began.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was a delightful birthday. After tea Mother played games with them — any game they liked — and of course their first choice was blindman's-buff, in the course of which Bobbie's forget-me-not wreath twisted itself crookedly over one of her ears and stayed there. Then, when it was near bed-time and time to calm down, Mother had a lovely new story to read to them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You won't sit up late working, will you, Mother?” Bobbie asked as they said good night.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Mother said no, she wouldn't — she would only just write to Father and then go to bed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But when Bobbie crept down later to bring up her presents — for she felt she really could not be separated from them all night — Mother was not writing but leaning her head on her arms and her arms on the table. Bobbie slipped quietly away, saying over and over, “She doesn't want me to know she's unhappy, and I won't know; I won't know.” But it made a sad end to the birthday.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>The Railway Children&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Edith Nesbit</em>&nbsp;<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When they had finished singing, they cried, “Three cheers for <span class="txt-underline"><strong>our Bobbie</strong></span>!” and said them very loudly. Bobbie felt exactly as though she were going to cry — you know that odd feeling in the bridge of your nose and the pricking in your eyelids?

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They were very nice presents. There was a green and red needle-book that Phyllis had made herself in secret moments. There was a darling little silver brooch of Mother's shaped like a buttercup, which Bobbie had known and loved for years, but which she had never, never thought would come to be her very own. There was also a pair of blue glass vases from Mrs. Viney. Roberta had seen and admired them in the village shop. And there were three birthday cards with pretty pictures and wishes.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was a cake on the table covered with white sugar, with 'Dear Bobbie' on it in pink sweets, and there were buns and jam; but the nicest thing was that the big table was almost covered with flowers — wallflowers were laid all around the tea-tray — there was a ring of forget-me-nots round each plate. The cake had a wreath of white lilac round it, and in the middle was something that looked like a pattern all done with single blooms of lilac and wall-flower and laburnum.</p>

          <strong>The Railway Children&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Edith Nesbit</em>&nbsp;<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When they had finished singing, they cried, “Three cheers for <span class="txt-underline"><strong>our Bobbie</strong></span>!” and said them very loudly. Bobbie felt exactly as though she were going to cry — you know that odd feeling in the bridge of your nose and the pricking in your eyelids? But before she had time to begin, they were all kissing and hugging her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Now,” said Mother, “look at your presents.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They were very nice presents. There was a green and red needle-book that Phyllis had made herself in secret moments. There was a darling little silver brooch of Mother's shaped like a buttercup, which Bobbie had known and loved for years, but which she had never, never thought would come to be her very own. There was also a pair of blue glass vases from Mrs. Viney. Roberta had seen and admired them in the village shop. And there were three birthday cards with pretty pictures and wishes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Mother fitted the forget-me-not crown on Bobbie's brown head.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“And now look at the table,” she said.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was a cake on the table covered with white sugar, with 'Dear Bobbie' on it in pink sweets, and there were buns and jam; but the nicest thing was that the big table was almost covered with flowers — wallflowers were laid all around the tea-tray — there was a ring of forget-me-nots round each plate. The cake had a wreath of white lilac round it, and in the middle was something that looked like a pattern all done with single blooms of lilac and wall-flower and laburnum.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“It's a map — a map of the railway!” cried Peter. “Look — those lilac lines are the metals — and there's the station done in brown wallflowers. The lilac is the train, and there are the signal-boxes, and the road up to here — and those fat red daisies are us three waving to the old gentleman — that's him, the pansy in the laburnum train.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“And there's 'Three Chimneys' done in the purple primroses,” said Phyllis. “And that little, tiny rose-bud is Mother looking out for us when we're late for tea. Peter invented it all, and we got all the flowers from the station. We thought you'd like it better.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“That's my present,” said Peter, suddenly dumping down his adored train engine on the table in front of her. Its tender* had been lined with fresh white paper and was full of sweets.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Oh, Peter!” cried Bobbie, quite overcome by this munificence, “not your own dear little engine that you're so fond of?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh, no,” said Peter, very promptly, “not the engine. Only the sweets.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bobbie couldn't help her face changing a little — not so much because she was disappointed at not getting the engine, as because she had thought it so very noble of Peter, and now she felt she had been silly to think it. Also, she felt she must have seemed greedy to expect the engine as well as the sweets. So her face changed. Peter saw it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He hesitated a minute; then his face changed, too, and he said: “I mean not ALL the engine. I'll let you go halves if you like.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You're a brick,” cried Bobbie; “it's a splendid present.” She said no more aloud, but to herself she said: —&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“That was awfully jolly decent of Peter because I know he didn't mean to. Well, the broken half shall be my half of the engine, and I'll get it mended and give it back to Peter for his birthday.” — “Yes, Mother dear, I should like to cut the cake,” she added, and tea began.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was a delightful birthday. After tea Mother played games with them — any game they liked — and of course their first choice was blindman's-buff, in the course of which Bobbie's forget-me-not wreath twisted itself crookedly over one of her ears and stayed there. Then, when it was near bed-time and time to calm down, Mother had a lovely new story to read to them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You won't sit up late working, will you, Mother?” Bobbie asked as they said good night.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Mother said no, she wouldn't — she would only just write to Father and then go to bed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But when Bobbie crept down later to bring up her presents — for she felt she really could not be separated from them all night — Mother was not writing but leaning her head on her arms and her arms on the table. Bobbie slipped quietly away, saying over and over, “She doesn't want me to know she's unhappy, and I won't know; I won't know.” But it made a sad end to the birthday.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>The Railway Children&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Edith Nesbit</em>&nbsp;<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When they had finished singing, they cried, “Three cheers for <span class="txt-underline"><strong>our Bobbie</strong></span>!” and said them very loudly. Bobbie felt exactly as though she were going to cry — you know that odd feeling in the bridge of your nose and the pricking in your eyelids? But before she had time to begin, they were all kissing and hugging her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Now,” said Mother, “look at your presents.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They were very nice presents. There was a green and red needle-book that Phyllis had made herself in secret moments. There was a darling little silver brooch of Mother's shaped like a buttercup, which Bobbie had known and loved for years, but which she had never, never thought would come to be her very own. There was also a pair of blue glass vases from Mrs. Viney. Roberta had seen and admired them in the village shop. And there were three birthday cards with pretty pictures and wishes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Mother fitted the forget-me-not crown on Bobbie's brown head.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“And now look at the table,” she said.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was a cake on the table covered with white sugar, with 'Dear Bobbie' on it in pink sweets, and there were buns and jam; but the nicest thing was that the big table was almost covered with flowers — wallflowers were laid all around the tea-tray — there was a ring of forget-me-nots round each plate. The cake had a wreath of white lilac round it, and in the middle was something that looked like a pattern all done with single blooms of lilac and wall-flower and laburnum.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“It's a map — a map of the railway!” cried Peter. “Look — those lilac lines are the metals — and there's the station done in brown wallflowers. The lilac is the train, and there are the signal-boxes, and the road up to here — and those fat red daisies are us three waving to the old gentleman — that's him, the pansy in the laburnum train.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“And there's 'Three Chimneys' done in the purple primroses,” said Phyllis. “And that little, tiny rose-bud is Mother looking out for us when we're late for tea. Peter invented it all, and we got all the flowers from the station. We thought you'd like it better.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“That's my present,” said Peter, suddenly dumping down his adored train engine on the table in front of her. Its tender* had been lined with fresh white paper and was full of sweets.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Oh, Peter!” cried Bobbie, quite overcome by this munificence, “not your own dear little engine that you're so fond of?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh, no,” said Peter, very promptly, “not the engine. Only the sweets.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bobbie couldn't help her face changing a little — not so much because she was disappointed at not getting the engine, as because she had thought it so very noble of Peter, and now she felt she had been silly to think it. Also, she felt she must have seemed greedy to expect the engine as well as the sweets. So her face changed. Peter saw it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He hesitated a minute; then his face changed, too, and he said: “I mean not ALL the engine. I'll let you go halves if you like.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You're a brick,” cried Bobbie; “it's a splendid present.” She said no more aloud, but to herself she said: —&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“That was awfully jolly decent of Peter because I know he didn't mean to. Well, the broken half shall be my half of the engine, and I'll get it mended and give it back to Peter for his birthday.” — “Yes, Mother dear, I should like to cut the cake,” she added, and tea began.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was a delightful birthday. After tea Mother played games with them — any game they liked — and of course their first choice was blindman's-buff, in the course of which Bobbie's forget-me-not wreath twisted itself crookedly over one of her ears and stayed there. Then, when it was near bed-time and time to calm down, Mother had a lovely new story to read to them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You won't sit up late working, will you, Mother?” Bobbie asked as they said good night.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Mother said no, she wouldn't — she would only just write to Father and then go to bed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But when Bobbie crept down later to bring up her presents — for she felt she really could not be separated from them all night — Mother was not writing but leaning her head on her arms and her arms on the table. Bobbie slipped quietly away, saying over and over, “She doesn't want me to know she's unhappy, and I won't know; I won't know.” But it made a sad end to the birthday.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the poem below by E. B. Nesbitt then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Peter’s Steam Engine&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
He had an engine that he loved&nbsp;<br>
With all his heart and soul,&nbsp;<br>
And if he had a wish on earth&nbsp;<br>
It was to keep it whole.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
One day—my friends, prepare your minds;&nbsp;<br>
I'm coming to the worst—&nbsp;<br>
<span class="txt-underline"><strong>Quite suddenly a screw went mad,&nbsp;</strong></span><br>
And then the boiler burst!&nbsp;<br>
<br>
With gloomy face he picked it up&nbsp;<br>
And took it to his Mother,&nbsp;<br>
Though even he could not suppose&nbsp;<br>
That she could make another;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
For those who perished on the line&nbsp;<br>
He did not seem to care,&nbsp;<br>
His engine being more to him&nbsp;<br>
Than all the people there.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
And now you see the reason why&nbsp;<br>
Our Peter has been ill:&nbsp;<br>
He soothes his soul with pigeon-pie&nbsp;<br>
His gnawing grief to kill.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
He wraps himself in blankets warm&nbsp;<br>
And sleeps in bed till late,&nbsp;<br>
Determined thus to overcome&nbsp;<br>
His miserable fate.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
And if his eyes are rather red,&nbsp;<br>
His cold must just excuse it:&nbsp;<br>
Offer him pie; you may be sure&nbsp;<br>
He never will refuse it.</p>

        <p><em>Read the poem below by E. B. Nesbitt then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Peter’s Steam Engine&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
He had an engine that he loved&nbsp;<br>

And if he had a wish on earth&nbsp;<br>
It was to keep it whole.&nbsp;<br>

He soothes his soul with pigeon-pie&nbsp;<br>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Fiordland in New Zealand&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Fiordland is one of the most dramatic and beautiful parts of New Zealand, made entirely by nature. <strong>15 ………. </strong>Absorb the breathtaking treasures of this region by water, air or hiking. The landscape is one where waterfalls cascade hundreds of metres into deep black fiords. Here ancient rainforests cling to mountains and shimmering lakes and granite peaks look as they did a thousand years ago.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Fiordland National Park is a World Heritage Site and includes Milford, Dusky and Doubtful Sounds. Famously described by Rudyard Kipling as the 'eighth wonder of the world', Milford Sound remains ever so beautiful.<strong> 16 ………. </strong>These cliffs scrape the sky and waterfalls cascade downwards from as high as 1000 metres.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When it rains in Milford Sound, and it often does, those waterfalls multiply with magnificent effect. Milford Sound is where plunging cliffs and raging waterfalls meet inky dark waters. It is situated on the west coast of the South Island, hours from the nearest town. <strong>17 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>Some of the fiords can be explored by kayak but if you’d like to see the less accessible fiords, eco-tours can be arranged. But this really is the place for hiking. Fiordland National Park has three of New Zealand’s ‘great walks’, the Milford, Kepler and Routeburn Tracks. <strong>18 ……….</strong> Starting in Te Anau, it takes you over 53 kilometres through the most breathtaking scenery: mountains, lakes and enormous valleys right up to the Sutherland Falls, the tallest waterfall in New Zealand.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The road into Milford Sound is almost as beautiful as the fiord itself. <strong>19 ………. </strong>This includes short walks such as the Mirror Lakes, the Lake Gunn Nature Walk, and Monkey Creek. The small village of Milford Sound also has limited places to stay so pre-booking is advised or choose from the many options in Te Anau or Manapouri. If you're hungry there's a café in the village, or you can enjoy food and drink onboard your boat cruise.</p>
        <p>Fiordland is one of the wettest areas of New Zealand. It is notorious for high rainfall and can have cool temperatures all year round. On average, Milford Sound receives rain 182 days of the year. In summer, temperatures are usually around 18 degrees Celsius and 4 degrees Celsius in winter. No matter when you choose to visit, wear warm layers and bring a waterproof jacket.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Milford Sound is even more beautiful in the rain. More rainfall means the waterfalls are spectacular. <strong>20 ………. </strong>You're likely to get splashed with water when on a Milford Sound cruise anyway, so put on your raincoat and some waterproof shoes and embrace the weather!</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Fiordland in New Zealand&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Fiordland is one of the most dramatic and beautiful parts of New Zealand, made entirely by nature. <strong>15 ………. </strong>Absorb the breathtaking treasures of this region by water, air or hiking. The landscape is one where waterfalls cascade hundreds of metres into deep black fiords. Here ancient rainforests cling to mountains and shimmering lakes and granite peaks look as they did a thousand years ago.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Fiordland National Park is a World Heritage Site and includes Milford, Dusky and Doubtful Sounds. Famously described by Rudyard Kipling as the 'eighth wonder of the world', Milford Sound remains ever so beautiful.<strong> 16 ………. </strong>These cliffs scrape the sky and waterfalls cascade downwards from as high as 1000 metres.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When it rains in Milford Sound, and it often does, those waterfalls multiply with magnificent effect. Milford Sound is where plunging cliffs and raging waterfalls meet inky dark waters. It is situated on the west coast of the South Island, hours from the nearest town. <strong>17 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>Some of the fiords can be explored by kayak but if you’d like to see the less accessible fiords, eco-tours can be arranged. But this really is the place for hiking. Fiordland National Park has three of New Zealand’s ‘great walks’, the Milford, Kepler and Routeburn Tracks. <strong>18 ……….</strong> Starting in Te Anau, it takes you over 53 kilometres through the most breathtaking scenery: mountains, lakes and enormous valleys right up to the Sutherland Falls, the tallest waterfall in New Zealand.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The road into Milford Sound is almost as beautiful as the fiord itself. <strong>19 ………. </strong>This includes short walks such as the Mirror Lakes, the Lake Gunn Nature Walk, and Monkey Creek. The small village of Milford Sound also has limited places to stay so pre-booking is advised or choose from the many options in Te Anau or Manapouri. If you're hungry there's a café in the village, or you can enjoy food and drink onboard your boat cruise.</p>
        <p>Fiordland is one of the wettest areas of New Zealand. It is notorious for high rainfall and can have cool temperatures all year round. On average, Milford Sound receives rain 182 days of the year. In summer, temperatures are usually around 18 degrees Celsius and 4 degrees Celsius in winter. No matter when you choose to visit, wear warm layers and bring a waterproof jacket.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Milford Sound is even more beautiful in the rain. More rainfall means the waterfalls are spectacular. <strong>20 ………. </strong>You're likely to get splashed with water when on a Milford Sound cruise anyway, so put on your raincoat and some waterproof shoes and embrace the weather!</p>

        <p>The road into Milford Sound is almost as beautiful as the fiord itself. <strong>19 ………. </strong>This includes short walks such as the Mirror Lakes, the Lake Gunn Nature Walk, and Monkey Creek. The small village of Milford Sound also has limited places to stay so pre-booking is advised or choose from the many options in Te Anau or Manapouri. If you're hungry there's a café in the village, or you can enjoy food and drink onboard your boat cruise.</p>
        <p>Fiordland is one of the wettest areas of New Zealand. It is notorious for high rainfall and can have cool temperatures all year round. On average, Milford Sound receives rain 182 days of the year. In summer, temperatures are usually around 18 degrees Celsius and 4 degrees Celsius in winter. No matter when you choose to visit, wear warm layers and bring a waterproof jacket.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Milford Sound is even more beautiful in the rain. More rainfall means the waterfalls are spectacular. <strong>20 ………. </strong>You're likely to get splashed with water when on a Milford Sound cruise anyway, so put on your raincoat and some waterproof shoes and embrace the weather!</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Fiordland in New Zealand&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Fiordland is one of the most dramatic and beautiful parts of New Zealand, made entirely by nature. <strong>15 ………. </strong>Absorb the breathtaking treasures of this region by water, air or hiking. The landscape is one where waterfalls cascade hundreds of metres into deep black fiords. Here ancient rainforests cling to mountains and shimmering lakes and granite peaks look as they did a thousand years ago.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Fiordland National Park is a World Heritage Site and includes Milford, Dusky and Doubtful Sounds. Famously described by Rudyard Kipling as the 'eighth wonder of the world', Milford Sound remains ever so beautiful.<strong> 16 ………. </strong>These cliffs scrape the sky and waterfalls cascade downwards from as high as 1000 metres.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When it rains in Milford Sound, and it often does, those waterfalls multiply with magnificent effect. Milford Sound is where plunging cliffs and raging waterfalls meet inky dark waters. It is situated on the west coast of the South Island, hours from the nearest town. <strong>17 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>Some of the fiords can be explored by kayak but if you’d like to see the less accessible fiords, eco-tours can be arranged. But this really is the place for hiking. Fiordland National Park has three of New Zealand’s ‘great walks’, the Milford, Kepler and Routeburn Tracks. <strong>18 ……….</strong> Starting in Te Anau, it takes you over 53 kilometres through the most breathtaking scenery: mountains, lakes and enormous valleys right up to the Sutherland Falls, the tallest waterfall in New Zealand.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The road into Milford Sound is almost as beautiful as the fiord itself. <strong>19 ………. </strong>This includes short walks such as the Mirror Lakes, the Lake Gunn Nature Walk, and Monkey Creek. The small village of Milford Sound also has limited places to stay so pre-booking is advised or choose from the many options in Te Anau or Manapouri. If you're hungry there's a café in the village, or you can enjoy food and drink onboard your boat cruise.</p>
        <p>Fiordland is one of the wettest areas of New Zealand. It is notorious for high rainfall and can have cool temperatures all year round. On average, Milford Sound receives rain 182 days of the year. In summer, temperatures are usually around 18 degrees Celsius and 4 degrees Celsius in winter.

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Fiordland in New Zealand&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Fiordland is one of the most dramatic and beautiful parts of New Zealand, made entirely by nature. <strong>15 ………. </strong>Absorb the breathtaking treasures of this region by water, air or hiking. The landscape is one where waterfalls cascade hundreds of metres into deep black fiords. Here ancient rainforests cling to mountains and shimmering lakes and granite peaks look as they did a thousand years ago.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Fiordland National Park is a World Heritage Site and includes Milford, Dusky and Doubtful Sounds. Famously described by Rudyard Kipling as the 'eighth wonder of the world', Milford Sound remains ever so beautiful.<strong> 16 ………. </strong>These cliffs scrape the sky and waterfalls cascade downwards from as high as 1000 metres.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When it rains in Milford Sound, and it often does, those waterfalls multiply with magnificent effect. Milford Sound is where plunging cliffs and raging waterfalls meet inky dark waters. It is situated on the west coast of the South Island, hours from the nearest town. <strong>17 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>Some of the fiords can be explored by kayak but if you’d like to see the less accessible fiords, eco-tours can be arranged. But this really is the place for hiking. Fiordland National Park has three of New Zealand’s ‘great walks’, the Milford, Kepler and Routeburn Tracks. <strong>18 ……….</strong> Starting in Te Anau, it takes you over 53 kilometres through the most breathtaking scenery: mountains, lakes and enormous valleys right up to the Sutherland Falls, the tallest waterfall in New Zealand.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The road into Milford Sound is almost as beautiful as the fiord itself. <strong>19 ………. </strong>This includes short walks such as the Mirror Lakes, the Lake Gunn Nature Walk, and Monkey Creek. The small village of Milford Sound also has limited places to stay so pre-booking is advised or choose from the many options in Te Anau or Manapouri. If you're hungry there's a café in the village, or you can enjoy food and drink onboard your boat cruise.</p>
        <p>Fiordland is one of the wettest areas of New Zealand. It is notorious for high rainfall and can have cool temperatures all year round. On average, Milford Sound receives rain 182 days of the year. In summer, temperatures are usually around 18 degrees Celsius and 4 degrees Celsius in winter. No matter when you choose to visit, wear warm layers and bring a waterproof jacket.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Milford Sound is even more beautiful in the rain. More rainfall means the waterfalls are spectacular. <strong>20 ………. </strong>You're likely to get splashed with water when on a Milford Sound cruise anyway, so put on your raincoat and some waterproof shoes and embrace the weather!</p>

Miscommunication happens often enough face to face. But it happens far more frequently over text messages.<br>
<br>
Alice was texting back and forth with her friend when suddenly she went silent after a simple question. In the middle of a meeting, John received a three-page text message from his wife. Sandy accidently sent a personal text message to the wrong person causing a series of awkward responses. All of these misunderstandings could be avoided by following a few simple guidelines.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Here are the top texting rules: Know your audience. Double check everything. Text alone. Texting is casual conversation only, not serious. Always respond, but don’t open a text message unless you intend to respond immediately. Know the difference between useful and non-useful texting. Remember that pictures are not secure and don’t presume that texting is confidential.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
In 2021, buying the best phone means looking for something that should last you a few years. Smartphones’ upgrade cycles are slowing down for a reason. Even at lower prices, it’s getting harder and harder to buy a lemon. In other words, you don’t have to spend a huge amount to get something great, as a bunch of great smartphones are available for around $800.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
It’s harder than ever to decide between everything in that range, but for most people, our pick for the best phone is the Apple iPhone 12. Luckily, if you’re looking for a nocompromise smartphone at any price, the choices over a thousand dollars are much clearer. If you like Android, the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra is incredibly good. And if you want to get the best smartphone on a budget, you can find something really good for under $500 or even under $400.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
By texting less and calling more, I was reminded that people are always nicer on the phone than on text. Face to face they are even nicer than that. Arguments are resolved more quickly. But talking on the phone scares people. Technology has created a new rigidity when it comes to conversation. Calling is usually planned and scheduled. I still text all the time. But I am calling more too. I am back in the habit, and for me, it is infinitely more satisfying to have a conversation that is two sided and flexible and unpredictable. No device will be ever able to replace personal conversation.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Should a young child have a mobile? Most mobiles offer almost complete access to the internet and are much harder to filter and control than your home computer. A mobile also gives the outside world, including undesirables, another way to communicate with a child.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Mobiles also put your child at risk for getting in trouble if limits aren’t in place. Or a child might make prank calls or be blamed for them if a classmate takes their phone and uses it to make inappropriate calls.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Whether or not your child is ready for or needs a mobile is something you will have to decide for yourself. Make sure that your child can handle the responsibility for a mobile before you buy one. When getting your younger child, a mobile, consider putting some limits in place.&nbsp;<br>

Miscommunication happens often enough face to face. But it happens far more frequently over text messages.<br>
<br>
Alice was texting back and forth with her friend when suddenly she went silent after a simple question. In the middle of a meeting, John received a three-page text message from his wife. Sandy accidently sent a personal text message to the wrong person causing a series of awkward responses. All of these misunderstandings could be avoided by following a few simple guidelines.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Here are the top texting rules: Know your audience. Double check everything. Text alone. Texting is casual conversation only, not serious. Always respond, but don’t open a text message unless you intend to respond immediately. Know the difference between useful and non-useful texting. Remember that pictures are not secure and don’t presume that texting is confidential.<br>

In 2021, buying the best phone means looking for something that should last you a few years. Smartphones’ upgrade cycles are slowing down for a reason. Even at lower prices, it’s getting harder and harder to buy a lemon. In other words, you don’t have to spend a huge amount to get something great, as a bunch of great smartphones are available for around $800.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
It’s harder than ever to decide between everything in that range, but for most people, our pick for the best phone is the Apple iPhone 12. Luckily, if you’re looking for a nocompromise smartphone at any price, the choices over a thousand dollars are much clearer. If you like Android, the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra is incredibly good. And if you want to get the best smartphone on a budget, you can find something really good for under $500 or even under $400.<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
By texting less and calling more, I was reminded that people are always nicer on the phone than on text. Face to face they are even nicer than that. Arguments are resolved more quickly. But talking on the phone scares people. Technology has created a new rigidity when it comes to conversation. Calling is usually planned and scheduled. I still text all the time. But I am calling more too. I am back in the habit, and for me, it is infinitely more satisfying to have a conversation that is two sided and flexible and unpredictable. No device will be ever able to replace personal conversation.&nbsp;<br>

Should a young child have a mobile? Most mobiles offer almost complete access to the internet and are much harder to filter and control than your home computer. A mobile also gives the outside world, including undesirables, another way to communicate with a child.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Mobiles also put your child at risk for getting in trouble if limits aren’t in place. Or a child might make prank calls or be blamed for them if a classmate takes their phone and uses it to make inappropriate calls.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Whether or not your child is ready for or needs a mobile is something you will have to decide for yourself. Make sure that your child can handle the responsibility for a mobile before you buy one. When getting your younger child, a mobile, consider putting some limits in place.&nbsp;<br>
