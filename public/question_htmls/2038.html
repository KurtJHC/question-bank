        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</strong><br><em>by Ian Fleming</em><br><br>
Most motor-cars are <span class="txt-underline"><strong>conglomerations</strong></span> (this is a long word for bundles) of steel and wire and rubber and plastic, and electricity and oil and petrol and water, and the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>toffee papers</strong></span> you pushed down the crack in the back seat last Sunday. Smoke comes out of the back of them and horn-squawks out of the front, and they have white lights like big eyes in front, and red lights behind. And that is about that—just motor-cars, tin boxes on wheels for running about in.<br>
<br>
But some motor-cars—mine, for instance, and perhaps yours—are different. If you get to like them and understand them, if you are kind to them and don't scratch their paint or bang their doors, if you fill them up and top them up and pump them up when they need it, if you keep them clean and polished and out of the rain and snow as much as possible, you will find, you may find, that they become almost like persons—more than just ordinary persons: MAGICAL PERSONS!<br>
<br>
You don't believe me? All right then! You just read about this car I'm going to tell you about! I believe you can guess its name already—her name, I should say. And then see if you don't agree with me. All motor cars aren't just conglomerations of machinery and fuel. Some are.<br>
<br>
Once upon a time there was a family called Pott. There was the father, who had been in the Royal Navy, Commander Caractacus Pott. (You may think that Caractacus sounds quite a funny name, but in fact the original Caractacus was the British chieftain who was a sort of Robin Hood in A.D. 48 and led an English army against the Roman invaders. I expect since then there have been plenty of other Caractacuses, but I don't know anything about them.) Then there was the mother, Mimsie Pott, and a pair of eight-year-old twins—Jeremy, who was a black-haired boy, and Jemima, who was a golden-haired girl—and they lived in a wood beside a big lake with an island in the middle. On the other side of the lake, M. 20, the big motorway on the Dover road, swept away towards the sea. So they had the best of both worlds—lovely woods for catching beetles and finding birds' eggs, with a lake for newts and tadpoles, and a fine big motor road close by so that they could go off and see the world if they wanted to.<br>
<br>
Well, almost, that is. But the truth of the matter was that they hadn't got enough money between them to buy a car. All the money they had went on necessities—food and heat and light and clothes and all those boring things that one doesn't really notice but families have to have. There was only a little left over for birthday and Easter and Christmas presents and occasional surprise outings—the things that really matter.<br>
<br>
But the Potts were a happy family who all enjoyed their lives and since they weren't in the least sorry for themselves, or sorry that they hadn't got a motor-car to go whirling about in, we needn't be sorry for them either.<br>
<br>
Now Commander Caractacus Pott was an explorer and an inventor, and that may have been the reason why the Pott family was not very rich. Exploring places and inventing things can be very exciting indeed, but it is only very seldom that, in your explorations, you discover a really rare butterfly or animal or insect or mineral or plant that people will pay money to see, and practically never that you discover real treasure, like in books—gold bars and diamonds and jewels in an old oak chest.<br>
<br>
As for inventions, much the same troubles apply. People all over the world, in America, Russia, China, Japan, let alone England and Scotland and Wales and Ireland, are inventing or trying to invent things all the time—every kind of thing from rockets that fly to the moon to ways of making India-rubber balls bounce higher. Everything, everything, everything is being invented or improved all the time by somebody somewhere—whether by teams of scientists in huge factories and laboratories, or by lonely men sitting and just thinking in tiny workshops without many tools.<br>
<br>
Just such a solitary inventor was Commander Caractacus Pott, and I am ashamed to say that because he was always dreaming of impossible inventions and adventures and explorations in the remotest parts of the earth, he was generally known in the neighbourhood as Commander Crackpott! You may think that's cheek, and so it is, but Commander Pott was a humorous man and he knew his own shortcomings very well, so when he heard that that was his nickname in the neighbourhood he was not at all cross. He just roared with laughter and said, "I'll show 'em!" and disappeared into his workshop and didn't come out for a whole day and a night.</p>

Most motor-cars are <span class="txt-underline"><strong>conglomerations</strong></span> (this is a long word for bundles) of steel and wire and rubber and plastic, and electricity and oil and petrol and water, and the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>toffee papers</strong></span> you pushed down the crack in the back seat last Sunday. Smoke comes out of the back of them and horn-squawks out of the front, and they have white lights like big eyes in front, and red lights behind. And that is about that—just motor-cars, tin boxes on wheels for running about in.<br>
<br>
But some motor-cars—mine, for instance, and perhaps yours—are different. If you get to like them and understand them, if you are kind to them and don't scratch their paint or bang their doors, if you fill them up and top them up and pump them up when they need it, if you keep them clean and polished and out of the rain and snow as much as possible, you will find, you may find, that they become almost like persons—more than just ordinary persons: MAGICAL PERSONS!<br>
<br>
You don't believe me? All right then! You just read about this car I'm going to tell you about! I believe you can guess its name already—her name, I should say. And then see if you don't agree with me. All motor cars aren't just conglomerations of machinery and fuel. Some are.<br>
<br>
Once upon a time there was a family called Pott. There was the father, who had been in the Royal Navy, Commander Caractacus Pott. (You may think that Caractacus sounds quite a funny name, but in fact the original Caractacus was the British chieftain who was a sort of Robin Hood in A.D. 48 and led an English army against the Roman invaders. I expect since then there have been plenty of other Caractacuses, but I don't know anything about them.) Then there was the mother, Mimsie Pott, and a pair of eight-year-old twins—Jeremy, who was a black-haired boy, and Jemima, who was a golden-haired girl—and they lived in a wood beside a big lake with an island in the middle. On the other side of the lake, M. 20, the big motorway on the Dover road, swept away towards the sea. So they had the best of both worlds—lovely woods for catching beetles and finding birds' eggs, with a lake for newts and tadpoles, and a fine big motor road close by so that they could go off and see the world if they wanted to.<br>
<br>
Well, almost, that is. But the truth of the matter was that they hadn't got enough money between them to buy a car. All the money they had went on necessities—food and heat and light and clothes and all those boring things that one doesn't really notice but families have to have. There was only a little left over for birthday and Easter and Christmas presents and occasional surprise outings—the things that really matter.<br>
<br>
But the Potts were a happy family who all enjoyed their lives and since they weren't in the least sorry for themselves, or sorry that they hadn't got a motor-car to go whirling about in, we needn't be sorry for them either.<br>
<br>
Now Commander Caractacus Pott was an explorer and an inventor, and that may have been the reason why the Pott family was not very rich. Exploring places and inventing things can be very exciting indeed, but it is only very seldom that, in your explorations, you discover a really rare butterfly or animal or insect or mineral or plant that people will pay money to see, and practically never that you discover real treasure, like in books—gold bars and diamonds and jewels in an old oak chest.<br>

As for inventions, much the same troubles apply. People all over the world, in America, Russia, China, Japan, let alone England and Scotland and Wales and Ireland, are inventing or trying to invent things all the time—every kind of thing from rockets that fly to the moon to ways of making India-rubber balls bounce higher. Everything, everything, everything is being invented or improved all the time by somebody somewhere—whether by teams of scientists in huge factories and laboratories, or by lonely men sitting and just thinking in tiny workshops without many tools.<br>
<br>
Just such a solitary inventor was Commander Caractacus Pott, and I am ashamed to say that because he was always dreaming of impossible inventions and adventures and explorations in the remotest parts of the earth, he was generally known in the neighbourhood as Commander Crackpott! You may think that's cheek, and so it is, but Commander Pott was a humorous man and he knew his own shortcomings very well, so when he heard that that was his nickname in the neighbourhood he was not at all cross. He just roared with laughter and said, "I'll show 'em!" and disappeared into his workshop and didn't come out for a whole day and a night.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</strong><br><em>by Ian Fleming</em><br><br>
Most motor-cars are <span class="txt-underline"><strong>conglomerations</strong></span> (this is a long word for bundles) of steel and wire and rubber and plastic, and electricity and oil and petrol and water, and the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>toffee papers</strong></span> you pushed down the crack in the back seat last Sunday. Smoke comes out of the back of them and horn-squawks out of the front, and they have white lights like big eyes in front, and red lights behind. And that is about that—just motor-cars, tin boxes on wheels for running about in.<br>
<br>
But some motor-cars—mine, for instance, and perhaps yours—are different. If you get to like them and understand them, if you are kind to them and don't scratch their paint or bang their doors, if you fill them up and top them up and pump them up when they need it, if you keep them clean and polished and out of the rain and snow as much as possible, you will find, you may find, that they become almost like persons—more than just ordinary persons: MAGICAL PERSONS!<br>
<br>
You don't believe me? All right then! You just read about this car I'm going to tell you about! I believe you can guess its name already—her name, I should say. And then see if you don't agree with me. All motor cars aren't just conglomerations of machinery and fuel. Some are.<br>
<br>
Once upon a time there was a family called Pott. There was the father, who had been in the Royal Navy, Commander Caractacus Pott. (You may think that Caractacus sounds quite a funny name, but in fact the original Caractacus was the British chieftain who was a sort of Robin Hood in A.D. 48 and led an English army against the Roman invaders. I expect since then there have been plenty of other Caractacuses, but I don't know anything about them.) Then there was the mother, Mimsie Pott, and a pair of eight-year-old twins—Jeremy, who was a black-haired boy, and Jemima, who was a golden-haired girl—and they lived in a wood beside a big lake with an island in the middle. On the other side of the lake, M. 20, the big motorway on the Dover road, swept away towards the sea. So they had the best of both worlds—lovely woods for catching beetles and finding birds' eggs, with a lake for newts and tadpoles, and a fine big motor road close by so that they could go off and see the world if they wanted to.<br>
<br>
Well, almost, that is. But the truth of the matter was that they hadn't got enough money between them to buy a car. All the money they had went on necessities—food and heat and light and clothes and all those boring things that one doesn't really notice but families have to have. There was only a little left over for birthday and Easter and Christmas presents and occasional surprise outings—the things that really matter.<br>
<br>
But the Potts were a happy family who all enjoyed their lives and since they weren't in the least sorry for themselves, or sorry that they hadn't got a motor-car to go whirling about in, we needn't be sorry for them either.<br>
<br>
Now Commander Caractacus Pott was an explorer and an inventor, and that may have been the reason why the Pott family was not very rich. Exploring places and inventing things can be very exciting indeed, but it is only very seldom that, in your explorations, you discover a really rare butterfly or animal or insect or mineral or plant that people will pay money to see, and practically never that you discover real treasure, like in books—gold bars and diamonds and jewels in an old oak chest.<br>

<p><strong>Bottled Water vs Tap Water</strong><br><br>
Over the past few years, bottled water consumption has grown significantly because it’s considered safer and better tasting than tap water. In fact, in the United States, each person drinks approximately 114 litres of bottled water per year. However, due to environmental concerns and potential health effects, many people are starting to wonder whether tap water is better.<br>
<br>
Tap water, also called municipal water, comes from large wells, lakes, rivers, or reservoirs. <strong>12 ..........</strong> While contaminated drinking water is an issue in some regions, tap water is generally safe, convenient, and environmentally friendly. U.S. public tap water is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA is responsible for identifying and setting legal limits for potential contaminants in drinking water under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). Nonetheless, drinking water contamination can still occur. <strong>13 ..........</strong> Additionally, old plumbing may introduce contaminants like lead, and natural disasters like floods can temporarily pollute public water systems.<br>
<br>
Bottled water is often said to taste better than tap water. Yet, in blind taste tests, most people can’t tell the difference between tap and bottled water. In general, tap water tastes the same as bottled water. <strong>14 ..........</strong> Before it reaches your house, water is stored in a treatment facility in which it undergoes several processes to remove potential contaminants. <strong>15 ..........</strong> Then, after you drink water from a glass, you’ll likely wash the glass either by hand or in a dishwasher.<br>
<br>
Bottled water comes from a variety of sources. Some products simply comprise tap water that’s been bottled while others use fresh spring water or another source. While some people believe bottled water to be safer, better tasting, and more convenient than tap water, several concerns surround its safety and environmental impact. Unlike tap water, which is regulated by the EPA, bottled water is overseen by the FDA.<br>
<br>
One of the main drawbacks of bottled water is its environmental impact. From treating and bottling to transportation and refrigeration, bottled water requires large amounts of energy. <strong>16 ..........</strong> The energy input required to produce that amount is equal to 64 million barrels of oil. Furthermore, it’s estimated that only 20% of plastic water bottles in the United States get recycled. Most end up in landfills or bodies of water.<br>
<br>
Studies reveal that one of the main reasons consumers choose bottled water is that it’s convenient. Whether you’re traveling or out and about, bottled water is available at many stores. However, that convenience comes with a hefty price tag.<br>
<br>
3.8 litres of tap water costs roughly $0.005 in the United States, while the same amount of bottled water, obtained from combining single-serving water bottles, costs around $9.47. This not only means that bottled water is pricier than milk and gasoline but also nearly 2,000 times more expensive than tap water. <strong>17 ..........</strong></p>

<p><strong>Bottled Water vs Tap Water</strong><br><br>
Over the past few years, bottled water consumption has grown significantly because it’s considered safer and better tasting than tap water. In fact, in the United States, each person drinks approximately 114 litres of bottled water per year. However, due to environmental concerns and potential health effects, many people are starting to wonder whether tap water is better.<br>
<br>
Tap water, also called municipal water, comes from large wells, lakes, rivers, or reservoirs. <strong>12 ..........</strong> While contaminated drinking water is an issue in some regions, tap water is generally safe, convenient, and environmentally friendly. U.S. public tap water is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA is responsible for identifying and setting legal limits for potential contaminants in drinking water under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). Nonetheless, drinking water contamination can still occur. <strong>13 ..........</strong> Additionally, old plumbing may introduce contaminants like lead, and natural disasters like floods can temporarily pollute public water systems.<br>
<br>
Bottled water is often said to taste better than tap water. Yet, in blind taste tests, most people can’t tell the difference between tap and bottled water. In general, tap water tastes the same as bottled water. <strong>14 ..........</strong> Before it reaches your house, water is stored in a treatment facility in which it undergoes several processes to remove potential contaminants. <strong>15 ..........</strong> Then, after you drink water from a glass, you’ll likely wash the glass either by hand or in a dishwasher.<br>
<br>
Bottled water comes from a variety of sources. Some products simply comprise tap water that’s been bottled while others use fresh spring water or another source. While some people believe bottled water to be safer, better tasting, and more convenient than tap water, several concerns surround its safety and environmental impact. Unlike tap water, which is regulated by the EPA, bottled water is overseen by the FDA.<br>
<br>
One of the main drawbacks of bottled water is its environmental impact. From treating and bottling to transportation and refrigeration, bottled water requires large amounts of energy. <strong>16 ..........</strong> The energy input required to produce that amount is equal to 64 million barrels of oil. Furthermore, it’s estimated that only 20% of plastic water bottles in the United States get recycled. Most end up in landfills or bodies of water.<br>
<br>
Studies reveal that one of the main reasons consumers choose bottled water is that it’s convenient. Whether you’re traveling or out and about, bottled water is available at many stores. However, that convenience comes with a hefty price tag.<br>
<br>
3.8 litres of tap water costs roughly $0.005 in the United States, while the same amount of bottled water, obtained from combining single-serving water bottles, costs around $9.47. This not only means that bottled water is pricier than milk and gasoline but also nearly 2,000 times more expensive than tap water. <strong>17 ..........</strong></p>

Furthermore, it’s estimated that only 20% of plastic water bottles in the United States get recycled. Most end up in landfills or bodies of water.<br>
<br>
Studies reveal that one of the main reasons consumers choose bottled water is that it’s convenient. Whether you’re traveling or out and about, bottled water is available at many stores. However, that convenience comes with a hefty price tag.<br>
<br>
3.8 litres of tap water costs roughly $0.005 in the United States, while the same amount of bottled water, obtained from combining single-serving water bottles, costs around $9.47. This not only means that bottled water is pricier than milk and gasoline but also nearly 2,000 times more expensive than tap water. <strong>17 ..........</strong></p>

<p><strong>Bottled Water vs Tap Water</strong><br><br>
Over the past few years, bottled water consumption has grown significantly because it’s considered safer and better tasting than tap water. In fact, in the United States, each person drinks approximately 114 litres of bottled water per year. However, due to environmental concerns and potential health effects, many people are starting to wonder whether tap water is better.<br>
<br>
Tap water, also called municipal water, comes from large wells, lakes, rivers, or reservoirs. <strong>12 ..........</strong> While contaminated drinking water is an issue in some regions, tap water is generally safe, convenient, and environmentally friendly. U.S. public tap water is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA is responsible for identifying and setting legal limits for potential contaminants in drinking water under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). Nonetheless, drinking water contamination can still occur. <strong>13 ..........</strong> Additionally, old plumbing may introduce contaminants like lead, and natural disasters like floods can temporarily pollute public water systems.<br>
<br>
Bottled water is often said to taste better than tap water. Yet, in blind taste tests, most people can’t tell the difference between tap and bottled water. In general, tap water tastes the same as bottled water. <strong>14 ..........</strong> Before it reaches your house, water is stored in a treatment facility in which it undergoes several processes to remove potential contaminants. <strong>15 ..........</strong> Then, after you drink water from a glass, you’ll likely wash the glass either by hand or in a dishwasher.<br>
<br>
Bottled water comes from a variety of sources. Some products simply comprise tap water that’s been bottled while others use fresh spring water or another source. While some people believe bottled water to be safer, better tasting, and more convenient than tap water, several concerns surround its safety and environmental impact. Unlike tap water, which is regulated by the EPA, bottled water is overseen by the FDA.<br>
<br>
One of the main drawbacks of bottled water is its environmental impact. From treating and bottling to transportation and refrigeration, bottled water requires large amounts of energy. <strong>16 ..........</strong> The energy input required to produce that amount is equal to 64 million barrels of oil. Furthermore, it’s estimated that only 20% of plastic water bottles in the United States get recycled. Most end up in landfills or bodies of water.<br>
<br>
Studies reveal that one of the main reasons consumers choose bottled water is that it’s convenient. Whether you’re traveling or out and about, bottled water is available at many stores. However, that convenience comes with a hefty price tag.<br>
<br>
3.8 litres of tap water costs roughly $0.005 in the United States, while the same amount of bottled water, obtained from combining single-serving water bottles, costs around $9.47. This not only means that bottled water is pricier than milk and gasoline but also nearly 2,000 times more expensive than tap water. <strong>17 ..........</strong></p>

<p><strong>Bottled Water vs Tap Water</strong><br><br>
Over the past few years, bottled water consumption has grown significantly because it’s considered safer and better tasting than tap water. In fact, in the United States, each person drinks approximately 114 litres of bottled water per year. However, due to environmental concerns and potential health effects, many people are starting to wonder whether tap water is better.<br>
<br>
Tap water, also called municipal water, comes from large wells, lakes, rivers, or reservoirs. <strong>12 ..........</strong> While contaminated drinking water is an issue in some regions, tap water is generally safe, convenient, and environmentally friendly. U.S. public tap water is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA is responsible for identifying and setting legal limits for potential contaminants in drinking water under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). Nonetheless, drinking water contamination can still occur. <strong>13 ..........</strong> Additionally, old plumbing may introduce contaminants like lead, and natural disasters like floods can temporarily pollute public water systems.<br>
<br>
Bottled water is often said to taste better than tap water. Yet, in blind taste tests, most people can’t tell the difference between tap and bottled water. In general, tap water tastes the same as bottled water. <strong>14 ..........</strong> Before it reaches your house, water is stored in a treatment facility in which it undergoes several processes to remove potential contaminants. <strong>15 ..........</strong> Then, after you drink water from a glass, you’ll likely wash the glass either by hand or in a dishwasher.<br>
<br>
Bottled water comes from a variety of sources. Some products simply comprise tap water that’s been bottled while others use fresh spring water or another source. While some people believe bottled water to be safer, better tasting, and more convenient than tap water, several concerns surround its safety and environmental impact. Unlike tap water, which is regulated by the EPA, bottled water is overseen by the FDA.<br>
<br>
One of the main drawbacks of bottled water is its environmental impact. From treating and bottling to transportation and refrigeration, bottled water requires large amounts of energy. <strong>16 ..........</strong> The energy input required to produce that amount is equal to 64 million barrels of oil. Furthermore, it’s estimated that only 20% of plastic water bottles in the United States get recycled. Most end up in landfills or bodies of water.<br>
<br>
Studies reveal that one of the main reasons consumers choose bottled water is that it’s convenient. Whether you’re traveling or out and about, bottled water is available at many stores. However, that convenience comes with a hefty price tag.<br>
<br>
3.8 litres of tap water costs roughly $0.005 in the United States, while the same amount of bottled water, obtained from combining single-serving water bottles, costs around $9.47. This not only means that bottled water is pricier than milk and gasoline but also nearly 2,000 times more expensive than tap water. <strong>17 ..........</strong></p>

School leavers interested in learning a trade but dissuaded by society’s bias toward university are encouraged to genuinely compare the two options. When it comes to employability, cost and earning potential, a trade option often can come out on top.<br>
<br>
NECA Electrical Apprenticeships general manager, Tom Emeleus says more school leavers are going to university based on a myth that it is the only way to secure a strong future but fewer jobs require a degree than many people think. “We’re setting up a generation of youth with unrealistic job expectations and large debt,” he says. In NSW there are 10 qualified school teachers seeking employment for every available job. This is just one of numerous examples. “Tradies understand the value of a trade and the career opportunities it represents but the message isn’t getting through to school leavers.”<br>
<br>
{^ <strong>Extract B</strong> ^}<br>
Of 2014’s apprentice and trainee graduates, 84.1 per cent were employed after completion, the National Centre for Vocational Education Research finds. Of university graduates from the same year, by comparison, 68.8 per cent of those looking for full-time work found it within four months, Graduate Careers Australia data shows.<br>
<br>
Emeleus says electrical apprentices in particular have high employment rates and 99 per cent of NECA apprentices are immediately hired. Electrician, Ben Proudfoot does not regret his choice to pursue a trade over university as he was hired straight out of his apprenticeship by host employer Stowe Australia. Proudfoot, a NECA graduate, says his parents never pressured him to go to university but some of his friends that chose that path did not understand the appeals of an apprenticeship – although now they do. “Some of them are happy with what they are doing but some go ‘oh I wish I had a trade’ when they see what I can do,” he says.<br>
<br>
{^ <strong>Extract C</strong> ^}<br>
University fees differ depending on degree and institution but range from $6000 to $10,000 a year. An apprenticeship, on the other hand, is paid for by the employer so the apprentice can graduate without debt. They also earn while they learn unlike with a university degree, during which students must rely on parents or work part time on top of study.<br>
<br>
A first-year apprentice bricklayer employed on award rates, for example, usually earns $12.78 an hour, increasing to $20.07 an hour as a fourth-year apprentice. In electrical trades, Emeleus says an apprentice will typically earn $150,000 over the course of their training.<br>
<br>
{^ <strong>Extract D</strong> ^}<br>
The median annual starting salary for a new bachelor degree graduate younger than 25 and in their first full time job was $54,000 in 2015, Graduate Careers Australia reveals. By comparison, NCVER finds the median annual income of a VET graduate working full time is $56,000. For those employed before finishing training, the median was even higher at $59,000.<br>
<br>
Emeleus says new electricians on award rates start on $56,000 but many in the construction industry can earn as much as $80,000 to $91,000 a year straight out of their apprenticeship.<br>
<br>
TAFE NSW Illawarra Institute director, Di Murray says people are surprised how far a trade, and vocational education, can take them. “You only have to think about how much you might pay a plumber to come in and do some work for you – trade qualifications can<br>
pay very well,’’ she says.</div>

School leavers interested in learning a trade but dissuaded by society’s bias toward university are encouraged to genuinely compare the two options. When it comes to employability, cost and earning potential, a trade option often can come out on top.<br>
<br>
NECA Electrical Apprenticeships general manager, Tom Emeleus says more school leavers are going to university based on a myth that it is the only way to secure a strong future but fewer jobs require a degree than many people think. “We’re setting up a generation of youth with unrealistic job expectations and large debt,” he says. In NSW there are 10 qualified school teachers seeking employment for every available job. This is just one of numerous examples. “Tradies understand the value of a trade and the career opportunities it represents but the message isn’t getting through to school leavers.”<br>

Electrician, Ben Proudfoot does not regret his choice to pursue a trade over university as he was hired straight out of his apprenticeship by host employer Stowe Australia.

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>The Hundred Dresses</strong><br><em>by Eleanor Estes</em><br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; AFTER Peggy and Maddie stopped feeling like intruders in a class that had already begun; they looked across the room and noticed that Wanda was not in her seat. Furthermore her desk was dusty and looked as though she hadn’t been there yesterday either. Come to think of it, they hadn’t seen her yesterday. They had waited for her a little while but had forgotten about her when they reached school.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;They often waited for Wanda Petronski—to have fun with her. Wanda lived way up on <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Boggins Heights</strong></span>, and <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Bog-gins Heights</strong></span> was no place to live. It was a good place to go and pick wild flowers in the summer, but you always held your breath till you got safely past old man Svenson’s yellow house. People in the town said old man Svenson was no good. He didn’t work and, worse still, his house and yard were disgracefully dirty, with rusty-tin cans strewn about and even an old straw hat. He lived alone with his dog and his cat. No wonder, said the people of the town. Who would live with him? And many stories circulated about him and the stories were the kind that made people scurry past his house even in broad day light and hope not to meet him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond Svenson’s there were a few small scattered frame houses, and in one of these Wanda Petronski lived with her father and her brother Jake. Wanda Petronski. Most of the children in Room 13 didn’t have names like that. They had names easy to say, like Thomas, Smith, or Allen. There was one boy named Bounce, Willie Bounce, and people thought that was funny but not funny in the same way that Petronski was.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Wanda didn’t have any friends. She came to school alone and went home alone. She always wore a faded blue dress that didn’t hang right. It was clean, but it looked as though it had never been ironed properly. She didn’t have any friends, but a lot of girls talked to her. They waited for her under the maple trees on the corner of Oliver Street. Or they surrounded her in the school yard as she stood watching some little girls play hopscotch on the worn hard ground. “Wanda,” Peggy would say in a most courteous manner, as though she were talking to Miss Mason or to the principal perhaps. “Wanda,” she’d say, giving one of her friends a nudge, “tell us. How many dresses did you say you had hanging up in your closet?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“A hundred,” said Wanda.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“A hundred!” exclaimed all the girls incredulously, and the little girls would stop playing hopscotch and listen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Yeah, a hundred, all lined up,” said Wanda. Then her thin lips drew together in silence.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“What are they like? All silk, I bet,” said Peggy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Yeah, all silk, all colours.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Velvet too?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Yeah, velvet too. A hundred dresses,” repeated Wanda stolidly. “All lined up in my closet.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Then they’d let her go. And then before she’d gone very far, they couldn’t help bursting into shrieks and peals of laughter. A hundred dresses! Obviously, the only dress Wanda had was the blue one she wore every day. So what did she say she had a hundred for? What a story! And the girls laughed derisively, while Wanda moved over to the sunny place by the ivy-covered brick wall of the school building where she usually stood and waited for the bell to ring. But if the girls had met her at the corner of Oliver Street, they’d carry her along with them for a way, stopping every few feet for more incredulous questions. And it wasn’t always dresses they talked about. Sometimes it was hats, or coats, or even shoes. “How many shoes did you say you had?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Sixty.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Sixty! Sixty pairs or sixty shoes?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Sixty pairs. All lined up in my closet.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Yesterday you said fifty.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Now I got sixty.” Cries of exaggerated politeness greeted this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“All alike?” said the girls.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh, no. Every pair is different. All colours. All lined up.” And Wanda would shift her eyes quickly from Peggy to a distant spot, as though she were looking far ahead, looking but not seeing anything. Then the outer fringe of the crowd of girls would break away gradually, laughing, and little by little, in pairs, the group would disperse.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy, who had thought up this game, and Maddie, her inseparable friend, were always the last to leave. And finally, Wanda would move up the street, her eyes dull and her mouth closed tight, hitching her left shoulder every now and then, finishing the walk to school alone.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>The Hundred Dresses</strong><br><em>by Eleanor Estes</em><br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;AFTER Peggy and Maddie stopped feeling like intruders in a class that had already begun; they looked across the room and noticed that Wanda was not in her seat. Furthermore her desk was dusty and looked as though she hadn’t been there yesterday either. Come to think of it, they hadn’t seen her yesterday. They had waited for her a little while but had forgotten about her when they reached school.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;They often waited for Wanda Petronski—to have fun with her. Wanda lived way up on&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline"><strong>Boggins Heights</strong></span>, and&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline"><strong>Bog-gins Heights</strong></span>&nbsp;was no place to live. It was a good place to go and pick wild flowers in the summer, but you always held your breath till you got safely past old man Svenson’s yellow house. People in the town said old man Svenson was no good. He didn’t work and, worse still, his house and yard were disgracefully dirty, with rusty-tin cans strewn about and even an old straw hat. He lived alone with his dog and his cat. No wonder, said the people of the town. Who would live with him? And many stories circulated about him and the stories were the kind that made people scurry past his house even in broad day light and hope not to meet him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond Svenson’s there were a few small scattered frame houses, and in one of these Wanda Petronski lived with her father and her brother Jake. Wanda Petronski. Most of the children in Room 13 didn’t have names like that. They had names easy to say, like Thomas, Smith, or Allen. There was one boy named Bounce, Willie Bounce, and people thought that was funny but not funny in the same way that Petronski was.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Wanda didn’t have any friends. She came to school alone and went home alone. She always wore a faded blue dress that didn’t hang right. It was clean, but it looked as though it had never been ironed properly. She didn’t have any friends, but a lot of girls talked to her. They waited for her under the maple trees on the corner of Oliver Street. Or they surrounded her in the school yard as she stood watching some little girls play hopscotch on the worn hard ground. “Wanda,” Peggy would say in a most courteous manner, as though she were talking to Miss Mason or to the principal perhaps. “Wanda,” she’d say, giving one of her friends a nudge, “tell us. How many dresses did you say you had hanging up in your closet?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“A hundred,” said Wanda.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“A hundred!” exclaimed all the girls incredulously, and the little girls would stop playing hopscotch and listen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Yeah, a hundred, all lined up,” said Wanda. Then her thin lips drew together in silence.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“What are they like? All silk, I bet,” said Peggy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Yeah, all silk, all colours.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Velvet too?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Yeah, velvet too. A hundred dresses,” repeated Wanda stolidly. “All lined up in my closet.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Then they’d let her go. And then before she’d gone very far, they couldn’t help bursting into shrieks and peals of laughter. A hundred dresses! Obviously, the only dress Wanda had was the blue one she wore every day. So what did she say she had a hundred for? What a story! And the girls laughed derisively, while Wanda moved over to the sunny place by the ivy-covered brick wall of the school building where she usually stood and waited for the bell to ring. But if the girls had met her at the corner of Oliver Street, they’d carry her along with them for a way, stopping every few feet for more incredulous questions. And it wasn’t always dresses they talked about. Sometimes it was hats, or coats, or even shoes. “How many shoes did you say you had?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Sixty.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Sixty! Sixty pairs or sixty shoes?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Sixty pairs. All lined up in my closet.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Yesterday you said fifty.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Now I got sixty.” Cries of exaggerated politeness greeted this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“All alike?” said the girls.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh, no. Every pair is different. All colours. All lined up.” And Wanda would shift her eyes quickly from Peggy to a distant spot, as though she were looking far ahead, looking but not seeing anything. Then the outer fringe of the crowd of girls would break away gradually, laughing, and little by little, in pairs, the group would disperse.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy, who had thought up this game, and Maddie, her inseparable friend, were always the last to leave. And finally, Wanda would move up the street, her eyes dull and her mouth closed tight, hitching her left shoulder every now and then, finishing the walk to school alone.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>The Hundred Dresses</strong><br><em>by Eleanor Estes</em><br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;AFTER Peggy and Maddie stopped feeling like intruders in a class that had already begun; they looked across the room and noticed that Wanda was not in her seat. Furthermore her desk was dusty and looked as though she hadn’t been there yesterday either. Come to think of it, they hadn’t seen her yesterday. They had waited for her a little while but had forgotten about her when they reached school.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;They often waited for Wanda Petronski—to have fun with her. Wanda lived way up on<strong>&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">Boggins Heights</span></strong>, and&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline"><strong>Bog-gins Heights</strong></span>&nbsp;was no place to live. It was a good place to go and pick wild flowers in the summer, but you always held your breath till you got safely past old man Svenson’s yellow house. People in the town said old man Svenson was no good. He didn’t work and, worse still, his house and yard were disgracefully dirty, with rusty-tin cans strewn about and even an old straw hat. He lived alone with his dog and his cat. No wonder, said the people of the town. Who would live with him? And many stories circulated about him and the stories were the kind that made people scurry past his house even in broad day light and hope not to meet him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond Svenson’s there were a few small scattered frame houses, and in one of these Wanda Petronski lived with her father and her brother Jake. Wanda Petronski. Most of the children in Room 13 didn’t have names like that. They had names easy to say, like Thomas, Smith, or Allen. There was one boy named Bounce, Willie Bounce, and people thought that was funny but not funny in the same way that Petronski was.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Wanda didn’t have any friends. She came to school alone and went home alone. She always wore a faded blue dress that didn’t hang right. It was clean, but it looked as though it had never been ironed properly. She didn’t have any friends, but a lot of girls talked to her. They waited for her under the maple trees on the corner of Oliver Street. Or they surrounded her in the school yard as she stood watching some little girls play hopscotch on the worn hard ground. “Wanda,” Peggy would say in a most courteous manner, as though she were talking to Miss Mason or to the principal perhaps. “Wanda,” she’d say, giving one of her friends a nudge, “tell us. How many dresses did you say you had hanging up in your closet?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“A hundred,” said Wanda.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“A hundred!” exclaimed all the girls incredulously, and the little girls would stop playing hopscotch and listen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Yeah, a hundred, all lined up,” said Wanda. Then her thin lips drew together in silence.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“What are they like? All silk, I bet,” said Peggy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Yeah, all silk, all colours.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Velvet too?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Yeah, velvet too. A hundred dresses,” repeated Wanda stolidly. “All lined up in my closet.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Then they’d let her go. And then before she’d gone very far, they couldn’t help bursting into shrieks and peals of laughter. A hundred dresses! Obviously, the only dress Wanda had was the blue one she wore every day. So what did she say she had a hundred for? What a story! And the girls laughed derisively, while Wanda moved over to the sunny place by the ivy-covered brick wall of the school building where she usually stood and waited for the bell to ring. But if the girls had met her at the corner of Oliver Street, they’d carry her along with them for a way, stopping every few feet for more incredulous questions. And it wasn’t always dresses they talked about. Sometimes it was hats, or coats, or even shoes. “How many shoes did you say you had?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Sixty.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Sixty! Sixty pairs or sixty shoes?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Sixty pairs. All lined up in my closet.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Yesterday you said fifty.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Now I got sixty.” Cries of exaggerated politeness greeted this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“All alike?” said the girls.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh, no. Every pair is different. All colours. All lined up.” And Wanda would shift her eyes quickly from Peggy to a distant spot, as though she were looking far ahead, looking but not seeing anything. Then the outer fringe of the crowd of girls would break away gradually, laughing, and little by little, in pairs, the group would disperse.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy, who had thought up this game, and Maddie, her inseparable friend, were always the last to leave. And finally, Wanda would move up the street, her eyes dull and her mouth closed tight, hitching her left shoulder every now and then, finishing the walk to school alone.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>The Hundred Dresses</strong><br><em>by Eleanor Estes</em><br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;AFTER Peggy and Maddie stopped feeling like intruders in a class that had already begun; they looked across the room and noticed that Wanda was not in her seat. Furthermore her desk was dusty and looked as though she hadn’t been there yesterday either. Come to think of it, they hadn’t seen her yesterday. They had waited for her a little while but had forgotten about her when they reached school.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;They often waited for Wanda Petronski—to have fun with her. Wanda lived way up on&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline"><strong>Boggins Heights</strong></span>, and&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline"><strong>Bog-gins Heights</strong></span>&nbsp;was no place to live. It was a good place to go and pick wild flowers in the summer, but you always held your breath till you got safely past old man Svenson’s yellow house. People in the town said old man Svenson was no good. He didn’t work and, worse still, his house and yard were disgracefully dirty, with rusty-tin cans strewn about and even an old straw hat. He lived alone with his dog and his cat. No wonder, said the people of the town. Who would live with him? And many stories circulated about him and the stories were the kind that made people scurry past his house even in broad day light and hope not to meet him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond Svenson’s there were a few small scattered frame houses, and in one of these Wanda Petronski lived with her father and her brother Jake. Wanda Petronski. Most of the children in Room 13 didn’t have names like that. They had names easy to say, like Thomas, Smith, or Allen. There was one boy named Bounce, Willie Bounce, and people thought that was funny but not funny in the same way that Petronski was.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Wanda didn’t have any friends. She came to school alone and went home alone. She always wore a faded blue dress that didn’t hang right. It was clean, but it looked as though it had never been ironed properly. She didn’t have any friends, but a lot of girls talked to her. They waited for her under the maple trees on the corner of Oliver Street. Or they surrounded her in the school yard as she stood watching some little girls play hopscotch on the worn hard ground. “Wanda,” Peggy would say in a most courteous manner, as though she were talking to Miss Mason or to the principal perhaps. “Wanda,” she’d say, giving one of her friends a nudge, “tell us. How many dresses did you say you had hanging up in your closet?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“A hundred,” said Wanda.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“A hundred!” exclaimed all the girls incredulously, and the little girls would stop playing hopscotch and listen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Yeah, a hundred, all lined up,” said Wanda. Then her thin lips drew together in silence.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“What are they like? All silk, I bet,” said Peggy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Yeah, all silk, all colours.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Velvet too?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Yeah, velvet too. A hundred dresses,” repeated Wanda stolidly. “All lined up in my closet.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Then they’d let her go. And then before she’d gone very far, they couldn’t help bursting into shrieks and peals of laughter. A hundred dresses! Obviously, the only dress Wanda had was the blue one she wore every day. So what did she say she had a hundred for? What a story! And the girls laughed derisively, while Wanda moved over to the sunny place by the ivy-covered brick wall of the school building where she usually stood and waited for the bell to ring. But if the girls had met her at the corner of Oliver Street, they’d carry her along with them for a way, stopping every few feet for more incredulous questions. And it wasn’t always dresses they talked about. Sometimes it was hats, or coats, or even shoes. “How many shoes did you say you had?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Sixty.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Sixty! Sixty pairs or sixty shoes?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Sixty pairs. All lined up in my closet.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Yesterday you said fifty.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Now I got sixty.” Cries of exaggerated politeness greeted this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“All alike?” said the girls.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh, no. Every pair is different. All colours. All lined up.” And Wanda would shift her eyes quickly from Peggy to a distant spot, as though she were looking far ahead, looking but not seeing anything. Then the outer fringe of the crowd of girls would break away gradually, laughing, and little by little, in pairs, the group would disperse.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy, who had thought up this game, and Maddie, her inseparable friend, were always the last to leave. And finally, Wanda would move up the street, her eyes dull and her mouth closed tight, hitching her left shoulder every now and then, finishing the walk to school alone.&nbsp;</p>
