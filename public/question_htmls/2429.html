          <strong>The Painter</strong>
        </p>
        <p>1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacob Lawrence was extraordinary. I could tell it from the moment I met him. Maybe it was the way he talked. Or maybe it was the way he acted. For a famous artist he didn’t have even a hint of ego about him. His open manner made him pleasant to be around. This was the first thing I noticed about him when I, a nervous college student, walked into the art class he taught at the University of Washington in Seattle. It was 1980, and I couldn’t have predicted then what an effect this quiet man would have on the rest of my life.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than being impressed by Lawrence’s artwork, I was surprised at how his story mirrored my own. Lawrence spent most of his childhood in Harlem, a mostly African American neighborhood in New York City—the same city I grew up in almost 40 years after he did. He discovered painting during the 1930s at an after-school program when he was 13 years old. He first painted with tempera paint, which was the first kind of paint that I began using as a boy in school. The paint was, and still is, cheap. During the Great Depression, when Lawrence began painting, everyone was searching for ways to save money. Lawrence liked the bright colors of the tempera paint so much that he continued to use it throughout his career, even after he could afford higher quality paints.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lawrence didn’t spend much time talking about himself in his art class, so I read about him on my own. I read that people first noticed his paintings because of how <span class="txt-underline">striking</span> they were. His paintings caught a person’s attention immediately because Lawrence had a style that was all his own. When he painted a picture, he liked to paint using one color at a time. He might begin with red and paint everything that he wanted red in his picture first. Then he would paint the next color. Even if the painting did not appear to make sense in the beginning, by the time all his colors had been added, the images were complete and powerful.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When Lawrence was in his twenties, African American artists had to work very hard to gain recognition. But he continued to paint, and word of his talent and unique style slowly began to spread. Lawrence painted scenes from everyday life in Harlem, as well as portraits of his favorite black heroes. He valued his heritage. Late in life he decided to honor the first black hero that he had learned about as a boy, Toussaint-Louverture, the former slave who founded the Republic of Haiti. Lawrence set about this ambitious project using his signature technique. He laid out 41 large panels. Then, after sketching the scenes he wanted to paint, he began with one color and applied that color across all the panels before picking up the next color. He continued this process until he had painted the significant events from Toussaint’s life—from birth to victory in the Haitian Revolution.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I admire the fact that Lawrence became known as a talented African American artist. But he was bothered by this fact. He didn’t want to be known as a good African American artist. He wanted to be known as a good artist. Lawrence said, “I would like to see them buy my art, buy the art of other Negro artists. I would like to see this done. But again, I would like to see them buy it because it’s a good work of art.”</p>
        <p>6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good art was something that Edith Halpert knew about. Her exclusive art gallery in downtown New York City featured top American artists. Before she became aware of Lawrence, no famous gallery had included the art of African Americans. Halpert decided to change this and invited Lawrence to display his famous Migration Series of paintings at her gallery. He now had a passport to international fame. Soon museums wanted to purchase his art, and his work appeared in a national magazine. Lawrence was gaining recognition for his talent, not his race, and his dream of becoming a respected American artist, not just a good African American artist, was coming true.</p>
        <p>7 By the time I met Lawrence in my college art class, he had long been regarded as one of the greatest American artists of the twentieth century. What’s amazing is that an artist of his stature would take the time to teach students like me. It seemed to me that he truly enjoyed sharing ideas and knowledge with others. He was never one to tell his students that what they painted was wrong. He guided us toward painting what was really inside us, where our hopes and dreams resided.</p>
        <p>8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why after college I returned to the neighborhood where I had grown up to teach art at an after-school program for inner-city youth while I worked on my own artistic style. I knew I would someday have a story to tell with my art, just as Lawrence had. But until my story was told, I wanted to help my students work on stories of their own.</p>

This was the first thing I noticed about him when I, a nervous college student, walked into the art class he taught at the University of Washington in Seattle. It was 1980, and I couldn’t have predicted then what an effect this quiet man would have on the rest of my life.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than being impressed by Lawrence’s artwork, I was surprised at how his story mirrored my own. Lawrence spent most of his childhood in Harlem, a mostly African American neighborhood in New York City—the same city I grew up in almost 40 years after he did. He discovered painting during the 1930s at an after-school program when he was 13 years old. He first painted with tempera paint, which was the first kind of paint that I began using as a boy in school. The paint was, and still is, cheap. During the Great Depression, when Lawrence began painting, everyone was searching for ways to save money. Lawrence liked the bright colors of the tempera paint so much that he continued to use it throughout his career, even after he could afford higher quality paints.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lawrence didn’t spend much time talking about himself in his art class, so I read about him on my own. I read that people first noticed his paintings because of how <span class="txt-underline">striking</span> they were. His paintings caught a person’s attention immediately because Lawrence had a style that was all his own. When he painted a picture, he liked to paint using one color at a time. He might begin with red and paint everything that he wanted red in his picture first. Then he would paint the next color. Even if the painting did not appear to make sense in the beginning, by the time all his colors had been added, the images were complete and powerful.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When Lawrence was in his twenties, African American artists had to work very hard to gain recognition. But he continued to paint, and word of his talent and unique style slowly began to spread. Lawrence painted scenes from everyday life in Harlem, as well as portraits of his favorite black heroes. He valued his heritage. Late in life he decided to honor the first black hero that he had learned about as a boy, Toussaint-Louverture, the former slave who founded the Republic of Haiti. Lawrence set about this ambitious project using his signature technique. He laid out 41 large panels. Then, after sketching the scenes he wanted to paint, he began with one color and applied that color across all the panels before picking up the next color. He continued this process until he had painted the significant events from Toussaint’s life—from birth to victory in the Haitian Revolution.</p>

                  <img width="100%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766038469/i2k1fqoj6seay3mtcmrc.png" alt="STT23_RC_25_2">


        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I admire the fact that Lawrence became known as a talented African American artist. But he was bothered by this fact. He didn’t want to be known as a good African American artist. He wanted to be known as a good artist. Lawrence said, “I would like to see them buy my art, buy the art of other Negro artists. I would like to see this done. But again, I would like to see them buy it because it’s a good work of art.”</p>
        <p>6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good art was something that Edith Halpert knew about. Her exclusive art gallery in downtown New York City featured top American artists. Before she became aware of Lawrence, no famous gallery had included the art of African Americans. Halpert decided to change this and invited Lawrence to display his famous Migration Series of paintings at her gallery. He now had a passport to international fame. Soon museums wanted to purchase his art, and his work appeared in a national magazine. Lawrence was gaining recognition for his talent, not his race, and his dream of becoming a respected American artist, not just a good African American artist, was coming true.</p>
        <p>7 By the time I met Lawrence in my college art class, he had long been regarded as one of the greatest American artists of the twentieth century. What’s amazing is that an artist of his stature would take the time to teach students like me. It seemed to me that he truly enjoyed sharing ideas and knowledge with others. He was never one to tell his students that what they painted was wrong. He guided us toward painting what was really inside us, where our hopes and dreams resided.</p>
        <p>8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why after college I returned to the neighborhood where I had grown up to teach art at an after-school program for inner-city youth while I worked on my own artistic style. I knew I would someday have a story to tell with my art, just as Lawrence had. But until my story was told, I wanted to help my students work on stories of their own.</p>

          <strong>The Corn-Stalk Fiddle</strong>
          <br>
          <em>By Paul Laurence Dunbar</em>
        </p>
        <p>When the corn’s all cut and the bright stalks shine&nbsp; <em>1</em><br>
Like the burnished spears of a field of gold;<br>
When the field-mice rich on the nubbins dine,<br>
And the frost comes white and the wind blows cold;<br>
Then its heigho fellows and hi-diddle-diddle,&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>5</em><br>
For the time is ripe for the corn-stalk fiddle.</p>
        <p><br>
And you take a stalk that is straight and long,<br>
With an expert eye to its worthy points,<br>
And you think of the bubbling strains of song<br>
That are bound between its pithy joints—&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>10</em><br>
Then you cut out strings, with a bridge in the middle,<br>
With a corn-stalk bow for a corn-stalk fiddle.</p>
        <p><br>
Then the strains that grow as you draw the bow<br>
O’er the yielding strings with a practiced hand!<br>
And the music’s flow never loud but low&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>15</em><br>
Is the concert note of a fairy band.<br>
Oh, your dainty songs are a misty riddle<br>
To the simple sweets of the corn-stalk fiddle.</p>
        <p><br>
When the eve comes on and our work is done<br>
And the sun drops down with a tender glance,&nbsp; <em>20</em><br>
With their hearts all prime for the harmless fun,<br>
Come the neighbor girls for the evening’s dance,<br>
And they wait for the well-known twist and twiddle,<br>
More <span class="txt-underline">time than tune</span>—from the corn-stalk fiddle.</p>
        <p><br>
Then brother Jabez takes the bow,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>25</em><br>
While Ned stands off with Susan Bland,<br>
Then Henry stops by Milly Snow<br>
And John takes Nellie Jones’s hand,<br>
While I pair off with Mandy Biddle,<br>
And scrape, scrape, scrape goes the corn-stalk fiddle. <em>30</em></p>
        <p><br>
“Salute your partners,” comes the call,<br>
“All join hands and circle round,”<br>
“Grand train back,” and “Balance all,”<br>
Footsteps lightly spurn the ground,<br>
“Take your lady and balance down the middle”&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>35</em><br>
To the merry strains of the corn-stalk fiddle.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So the night goes on and the dance is o’er,<br>
And the merry girls are homeward gone,<br>
But I see it all in my sleep once more,<br>
And I dream till the very break of dawn&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>40</em><br>
Of an impish dance on a red-hot griddle<br>
To the screech and scrape of a corn-stalk fiddle.</p>

        <p><strong>The Corn-Stalk Fiddle</strong><br><em>By Paul Laurence Dunbar</em><br><br>
When the corn’s all cut and the bright stalks shine&nbsp; <em>1</em><br>
Like the burnished spears of a field of gold;<br>
When the field-mice rich on the nubbins dine,<br>
And the frost comes white and the wind blows cold;<br>
Then its heigho fellows and hi-diddle-diddle,&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>5</em><br>
For the time is ripe for the corn-stalk fiddle.</p>
        <p><br>
And you take a stalk that is straight and long,<br>
With an expert eye to its worthy points,<br>
And you think of the bubbling strains of song<br>
That are bound between its pithy joints—&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>10</em><br>
Then you cut out strings, with a bridge in the middle,<br>
With a corn-stalk bow for a corn-stalk fiddle.</p>
        <p><br>
Then the strains that grow as you draw the bow<br>
O’er the yielding strings with a practiced hand!<br>
And the music’s flow never loud but low&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>15</em><br>
Is the concert note of a fairy band.<br>
Oh, your dainty songs are a misty riddle<br>
To the simple sweets of the corn-stalk fiddle.</p>
        <p><br>
When the eve comes on and our work is done<br>
And the sun drops down with a tender glance,&nbsp; <em>20</em><br>
With their hearts all prime for the harmless fun,<br>
Come the neighbor girls for the evening’s dance,<br>
And they wait for the well-known twist and twiddle,<br>
More <span class="txt-underline">time than tune</span>—from the corn-stalk fiddle.</p>
        <p><br>
Then brother Jabez takes the bow,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>25</em><br>
While Ned stands off with Susan Bland,<br>
Then Henry stops by Milly Snow<br>
And John takes Nellie Jones’s hand,<br>
While I pair off with Mandy Biddle,<br>
And scrape, scrape, scrape goes the corn-stalk fiddle. <em>30</em></p>
        <p><br>
“Salute your partners,” comes the call,<br>
“All join hands and circle round,”<br>
“Grand train back,” and “Balance all,”<br>
Footsteps lightly spurn the ground,<br>
“Take your lady and balance down the middle”&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>35</em><br>
To the merry strains of the corn-stalk fiddle.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So the night goes on and the dance is o’er,<br>
And the merry girls are homeward gone,<br>
But I see it all in my sleep once more,<br>
And I dream till the very break of dawn&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>40</em><br>
Of an impish dance on a red-hot griddle<br>
To the screech and scrape of a corn-stalk fiddle.</p>

        <p><strong>The Corn-Stalk Fiddle</strong><br><em>By Paul Laurence Dunbar</em><br><br>
When the corn’s all cut and the bright stalks shine&nbsp; <em>1</em><br>
Like the burnished spears of a field of gold;<br>
When the field-mice rich on the nubbins dine,<br>
And the frost comes white and the wind blows cold;<br>
Then its heigho fellows and hi-diddle-diddle,&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>5</em><br>
For the time is ripe for the corn-stalk fiddle.</p>
        <p><br>
And you take a stalk that is straight and long,<br>
With an expert eye to its worthy points,<br>
And you think of the bubbling strains of song<br>
That are bound between its pithy joints—&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>10</em><br>
Then you cut out strings, with a bridge in the middle,<br>
With a corn-stalk bow for a corn-stalk fiddle.</p>
        <p><br>
Then the strains that grow as you draw the bow<br>
O’er the yielding strings with a practiced hand!<br>
And the music’s flow never loud but low&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>15</em><br>
Is the concert note of a fairy band.<br>
Oh, your dainty songs are a misty riddle<br>
To the simple sweets of the corn-stalk fiddle.</p>
        <p><br>
When the eve comes on and our work is done<br>
And the sun drops down with a tender glance,&nbsp; <em>20</em><br>
With their hearts all prime for the harmless fun,<br>
Come the neighbor girls for the evening’s dance,<br>
And they wait for the well-known twist and twiddle,<br>
More <span class="txt-underline">time than tune</span>—from the corn-stalk fiddle.</p>
        <p><br>
Then brother Jabez takes the bow,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>25</em><br>
While Ned stands off with Susan Bland,<br>
Then Henry stops by Milly Snow<br>
And John takes Nellie Jones’s hand,<br>
While I pair off with Mandy Biddle,<br>
And scrape, scrape, scrape goes the corn-stalk fiddle. <em>30</em></p>
        <p><br>
“Salute your partners,” comes the call,<br>
“All join hands and circle round,”<br>
“Grand train back,” and “Balance all,”<br>
Footsteps lightly spurn the ground,<br>
“Take your lady and balance down the middle”&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>35</em><br>
To the merry strains of the corn-stalk fiddle.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So the night goes on and the dance is o’er,<br>
And the merry girls are homeward gone,<br>
But I see it all in my sleep once more,<br>
And I dream till the very break of dawn&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>40</em><br>
Of an impish dance on a red-hot griddle<br>
To the screech and scrape of a corn-stalk fiddle.</p>
