&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Byron Bay</strong><br>
<br>
Byron Bay is not what it used to be. No shade intended: This small town on the north coast of the Australian state of New South Wales has always shifted with the times, and that’s no less true now. Byron Bay is known as an epicentre of Australia’s counter-culture. <strong>15 ……...</strong> Locals, for instance, stopped McDonald’s from setting up its golden arches. But it wasn’t always this way: before the New Agers unfurled their prayer flags in the 1970s, it had a less romantic reputation as a hub of sand-mining, cedar-cutting, abattoirs and whaling.<br>
<br>
The Bundjalung nation of the Arakwal Australian Aboriginal people had been living along the coast of Byron Bay for more than 20,000 years when the cape was encountered in 1770 by Capt. James Cook, who named it for Commodore (later Admiral) John Byron, grandfather of the poet Lord Byron. Byron Bay was founded in 1860 as a timber port. It was declared a town in 1896 and a shire in 1906. Before coastal shipping declined, Byron Bay was the principal port between Newcastle (about 630km south) and Brisbane (140km north-northwest). Over the years, Byron Bay’s local economy underwent a dramatic evolution. <strong>16 ……….</strong> For roughly 20 years gold was painstakingly extracted from the black sand as “poor man’s diggings”, which yielded a measure of profit for most who undertook its mining but did not bestow a fortune on anyone. In the mid-1930s it was learned that the sand that had been discarded by the prospectors, contained the valuable minerals rutile and zircon, which became the focus of a sand-mining industry that flourished until the early 1970s.<br>
<br>
Byron—or the Bay, as locals call it—is evolving again. It’s still a magnet for backpackers and surfers. However, these days it also attracts cashed-up visitors, and entrepreneurs who boast about ‘board meetings’ on the water. <strong>17 ……….</strong> But its main selling points—a laid-back pace and beautiful beaches—are still just as appealing.<br>
<br>
To get there, we suggest you take the back road. There are two airports that service Byron Bay. The easiest option is to fly into Ballina Byron Gateway Airport (daily flights from Sydney, Melbourne and Newcastle) and book a transfer to Byron Bay. This will take you via the Coast Road, a scenic, 30-minute intro to the area that winds past windswept beaches, soft tea-tree forests, and cane fields before meandering into town through the lush back door of Broken Head. Alternatively, you’ll find more flight options at Gold Coast Airport, but a longer and less joy-sparking transfer via the freeway. On the upside, if you arrive this way you’ll get to see the famous “Cheer up, slow down, chill out” welcome sign, and the jaunty new silver lighthouse sculpture. Book ahead… Byron is busy year-round these days, so plan well ahead for accommodation. <strong>18 ……….</strong> If you’re on a budget, the recently revamped Byron Bay YHA hostel is a good, cheap, and centrally located option. The Bower’s beach-chic suites and circular pool will rate highly on social media feeds.<br>
Also, more than 17 percent of Byron’s housing is listed on holiday rental platforms like Airbnb, so you should have plenty to choose from.<br>
<br>
And plan your trip. Byron Bay is part of the greater Byron Shire. Byron Bay is small; the Shire is large. <strong>19 ……….</strong> Take The Byron at Byron Resort &amp; Spa, for instance—it sounds like it’s in the centre of Byron, but it’s actually in the suburb Suffolk Park, a 10-minute drive from town. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing—in fact, it can be a blessing to be able to retreat from the Byron bubble—just something to bear in mind when booking. Skip summer. Summer has northerly winds, week-long downpours, and throngs of tourists. The best time to visit is during autumn and winter (March to August), when the weather is great, the surf is at its best, and the crowds ease off (a little). From May to October you’ll also be able to spot humpback whales cruising past on their annual migration.<br>
<br>
Get up early and walk. It’s worth it to soak up the sunrise from Cape Byron, the most easterly point of Australia. You can save time and drive up to the historic lighthouse (there are limited parking spaces and entry is AUD$8). <strong>20 ………. </strong>It winds through rare littoral rainforest, past pristine beaches and across grass-covered cliffs to reach the stately 1901 lighthouse on the headland and sweeping views of the ocean. The full loop is 3.7km and takes around two hours to complete, but don’t be tempted to take the shortcut down the road on the way back—the second half of the track along Tallow Ridge is equally special.</p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Byron Bay</strong><br>
<br>
Byron Bay is not what it used to be. No shade intended: This small town on the north coast of the Australian state of New South Wales has always shifted with the times, and that’s no less true now. Byron Bay is known as an epicentre of Australia’s counter-culture. <strong>15 ……...</strong> Locals, for instance, stopped McDonald’s from setting up its golden arches. But it wasn’t always this way: before the New Agers unfurled their prayer flags in the 1970s, it had a less romantic reputation as a hub of sand-mining, cedar-cutting, abattoirs and whaling.<br>
<br>
The Bundjalung nation of the Arakwal Australian Aboriginal people had been living along the coast of Byron Bay for more than 20,000 years when the cape was encountered in 1770 by Capt. James Cook, who named it for Commodore (later Admiral) John Byron, grandfather of the poet Lord Byron. Byron Bay was founded in 1860 as a timber port. It was declared a town in 1896 and a shire in 1906. Before coastal shipping declined, Byron Bay was the principal port between Newcastle (about 630km south) and Brisbane (140km north-northwest). Over the years, Byron Bay’s local economy underwent a dramatic evolution. <strong>16 ……….</strong> For roughly 20 years gold was painstakingly extracted from the black sand as “poor man’s diggings”, which yielded a measure of profit for most who undertook its mining but did not bestow a fortune on anyone. In the mid-1930s it was learned that the sand that had been discarded by the prospectors, contained the valuable minerals rutile and zircon, which became the focus of a sand-mining industry that flourished until the early 1970s.<br>
<br>
Byron—or the Bay, as locals call it—is evolving again. It’s still a magnet for backpackers and surfers. However, these days it also attracts cashed-up visitors, and entrepreneurs who boast about ‘board meetings’ on the water. <strong>17 ………. </strong>But its main selling points—a laid-back pace and beautiful beaches—are still just as appealing.<br>
<br>
To get there, we suggest you take the back road. There are two airports that service Byron Bay. The easiest option is to fly into Ballina Byron Gateway Airport (daily flights from Sydney, Melbourne and Newcastle) and book a transfer to Byron Bay. This will take you via the Coast Road, a scenic, 30-minute intro to the area that winds past windswept beaches, soft tea-tree forests, and cane fields before meandering into town through the lush back door of Broken Head. Alternatively, you’ll find more flight options at Gold Coast Airport, but a longer and less joy-sparking transfer via the freeway. On the upside, if you arrive this way you’ll get to see the famous “Cheer up, slow down, chill out” welcome sign, and the jaunty new silver lighthouse sculpture. Book ahead… Byron is busy year-round these days, so plan well ahead for accommodation. <strong>18 ……….</strong> If you’re on a budget, the recently revamped Byron Bay YHA hostel is a good, cheap, and centrally located option. The Bower’s beach-chic suites and circular pool will rate highly on social media feeds.<br>
Also, more than 17 percent of Byron’s housing is listed on holiday rental platforms like Airbnb, so you should have plenty to choose from.<br>
<br>
And plan your trip. Byron Bay is part of the greater Byron Shire. Byron Bay is small; the Shire is large. <strong>19 ………. </strong>Take The Byron at Byron Resort &amp; Spa, for instance—it sounds like it’s in the centre of Byron, but it’s actually in the suburb Suffolk Park, a 10-minute drive from town. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing—in fact, it can be a blessing to be able to retreat from the Byron bubble—just something to bear in mind when booking. Skip summer. Summer has northerly winds, week-long downpours, and throngs of tourists. The best time to visit is during autumn and winter (March to August), when the weather is great, the surf is at its best, and the crowds ease off (a little). From May to October you’ll also be able to spot humpback whales cruising past on their annual migration.<br>
<br>
Get up early and walk. It’s worth it to soak up the sunrise from Cape Byron, the most easterly point of Australia. You can save time and drive up to the historic lighthouse (there are limited parking spaces and entry is AUD$8). <strong>20 ……….</strong> It winds through rare littoral rainforest, past pristine beaches and across grass-covered cliffs to reach the stately 1901 lighthouse on the headland and sweeping views of the ocean. The full loop is 3.7km and takes around two hours to complete, but don’t be tempted to take the shortcut down the road on the way back—the second half of the track along Tallow Ridge is equally special.</p>

When you’ve had your fill of history, culture and man-made wonders, sometimes sun, sea and sand are all you need. Desert islands like Fiji and Maui top the bucket lists of many a traveller, with all the ingredients for the perfect exotic holiday: tropical climates, swaying palms and blissful white-sand beaches. Closer to home, the Canary Island of Fuerteventura and Vis in Croatia make getting away from it all as easy as pie. Whether you're after some serious escapism or want to marvel at mother nature, Lucy McGuire picks some of the most exotic places to travel in the world. Her number one pick is Maui, Hawaii. With a legendary surf scene and golden crescent beaches that span more than 193km, there are attractions everywhere you turn in Hawaii. Maui, known as "the Valley Isle", is a favourite for its misty peaks, gorgeous sunsets and bamboo forests. Relax on Kaanapali Beach or see the red sands at Kaihalulu – it’s like no other beach in the world. Maui is a tropical wonderland, laced with tremendous trails and hiking routes. Do the 5-hour Waterfall and Rainforest Hike to take in a range of breathtaking 10–40m-high waterfalls. You'll have the chance to swim in natural pools, enjoy a fresh picnic lunch and learn all about the culture, flora and fauna of the area from your experienced naturalist guide.<br>
<br>
<strong>Extract B</strong><br>
<br>
With approximately 85 million bed nights in 2019, London was the most popular European city destination in the ECM benchmarking report. International visitors to London had continually increased over the past decade. In second place was London’s competitor, Paris. The French capital accounted for around 52 million bed nights. But London is not necessarily the most attractive city. In the hospitality industry, a bed night measures the occupancy of one person (assigned to one bed) for one night. While London ranked first in terms of bed nights, the United Kingdom received a Travel &amp; Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI) score of 5.2 out of 7.0 in 2019, taking only the fourth place on the list. The TTCI takes into consideration factors such as a country's infrastructure and its policy and enabling conditions. Comparatively, Spain ranked first on the TTCI, but its capital city Madrid ranked only at sixth place in terms of bed nights, with approximately 21 million in 2019 and an increase in bed nights of 4.3 percent over the previous year.<br>

Just hours after Prime Minister, Scott Morrison announced on October 1 that he would soon reopen Australia’s international border, Madhu Tamilarasan was online booking a flight to London. “The law still doesn’t allow me to actually leave but I’ve taken a punt to book a ridiculously expensive flight,” she says. She hasn’t seen her parents for three and a half years.<br>

Australia closed its border in March 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic started its race around the globe. Just 1.1 million passengers flew in or out of the country in the 2021 financial year, compared to 42 million in 2019, government data shows. But what’s it going to be like to travel overseas again? Where can we go? And what should you take?<br>
<br>
Businessman, Thornton, travelled to Europe earlier this year for business, carrying a “wad of paper” to get through border checks. The experience was not as hard as he expected, but it was time-consuming. “It’s going to be a lot of forms, a lot of box-ticking and a lot of checking,” he says. He had to arrive for his Eurostar train ride from London to Lille, for example, two hours before departure rather than 45 minutes in pre-COVID times. “There’s just a lot more rigour in terms of checking at passport control and immigration,” Thornton says.<br>

Getting out to see the world is a fantastic opportunity for you to explore and learn more about other cultures. However, it is important for authorities to screen for pests, diseases and weeds which may have travelled with you. To help protect our agricultural industries, unique environment and the health of all Australians, the department assesses all incoming air and sea travellers and screens baggage using X-ray machines, detector dogs and physical inspection. Unsure? Just declare it. You must declare certain food, plant material (including wooden articles) and animal products on your Incoming Passenger Card. Anything you declare will be assessed by a biosecurity officer, who will determine the risk associated with the goods and whether an inspection is required. If you are unsure, just declare it. Depending on the risk, you may be required to pay for the goods to be treated (e.g. fumigation or gamma irradiation), pay to export the goods from Australia or give up your goods for destruction. You will not face a penalty if you declare all goods, even if they are not allowed into Australia.<br>

When you’ve had your fill of history, culture and man-made wonders, sometimes sun, sea and sand are all you need. Desert islands like Fiji and Maui top the bucket lists of many a traveller, with all the ingredients for the perfect exotic holiday: tropical climates, swaying palms and blissful white-sand beaches. Closer to home, the Canary Island of Fuerteventura and Vis in Croatia make getting away from it all as easy as pie. Whether you're after some serious escapism or want to marvel at mother nature, Lucy McGuire picks some of the most exotic places to travel in the world. Her number one pick is Maui, Hawaii. With a legendary surf scene and golden crescent beaches that span more than 193km, there are attractions everywhere you turn in Hawaii. Maui, known as "the Valley Isle", is a favourite for its misty peaks, gorgeous sunsets and bamboo forests. Relax on Kaanapali Beach or see the red sands at Kaihalulu – it’s like no other beach in the world. Maui is a tropical wonderland, laced with tremendous trails and hiking routes. Do the 5-hour Waterfall and Rainforest Hike to take in a range of breathtaking 10–40m-high waterfalls. You'll have the chance to swim in natural pools, enjoy a fresh picnic lunch and learn all about the culture, flora and fauna of the area from your experienced naturalist guide.<br>

With approximately 85 million bed nights in 2019, London was the most popular European city destination in the ECM benchmarking report. International visitors to London had continually increased over the past decade. In second place was London’s competitor, Paris. The French capital accounted for around 52 million bed nights. But London is not necessarily the most attractive city. In the hospitality industry, a bed night measures the occupancy of one person (assigned to one bed) for one night. While London ranked first in terms of bed nights, the United Kingdom received a Travel &amp; Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI) score of 5.2 out of 7.0 in 2019, taking only the fourth place on the list.

        <p><em>Read the four extracts below on the theme of international travel.</em><br><br><br><strong>Extract A</strong><br><br>
When you’ve had your fill of history, culture and man-made wonders, sometimes sun, sea and sand are all you need. Desert islands like Fiji and Maui top the bucket lists of many a traveller, with all the ingredients for the perfect exotic holiday: tropical climates, swaying palms and blissful white-sand beaches. Closer to home, the Canary Island of Fuerteventura and Vis in Croatia make getting away from it all as easy as pie. Whether you're after some serious escapism or want to marvel at mother nature, Lucy McGuire picks some of the most exotic places to travel in the world. Her number one pick is Maui, Hawaii. With a legendary surf scene and golden crescent beaches that span more than 193km, there are attractions everywhere you turn in Hawaii. Maui, known as "the Valley Isle", is a favourite for its misty peaks, gorgeous sunsets and bamboo forests. Relax on Kaanapali Beach or see the red sands at Kaihalulu – it’s like no other beach in the world. Maui is a tropical wonderland, laced with tremendous trails and hiking routes. Do the 5-hour Waterfall and Rainforest Hike to take in a range of breathtaking 10–40m-high waterfalls. You'll have the chance to swim in natural pools, enjoy a fresh picnic lunch and learn all about the culture, flora and fauna of the area from your experienced naturalist guide.<br>

<strong>Extract B</strong><br>

With approximately 85 million bed nights in 2019, London was the most popular European city destination in the ECM benchmarking report. International visitors to London had continually increased over the past decade. In second place was London’s competitor, Paris. The French capital accounted for around 52 million bed nights. But London is not necessarily the most attractive city. In the hospitality industry, a bed night measures the occupancy of one person (assigned to one bed) for one night. While London ranked first in terms of bed nights, the United Kingdom received a Travel &amp; Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI) score of 5.2 out of 7.0 in 2019, taking only the fourth place on the list. The TTCI takes into consideration factors such as a country's infrastructure and its policy and enabling conditions. Comparatively, Spain ranked first on the TTCI, but its capital city Madrid ranked only at sixth place in terms of bed nights, with approximately 21 million in 2019 and an increase in bed nights of 4.3 percent over the previous year.<br>

Just hours after Prime Minister, Scott Morrison announced on October 1 that he would soon reopen Australia’s international border, Madhu Tamilarasan was online booking a flight to London. “The law still doesn’t allow me to actually leave but I’ve taken a punt to book a ridiculously expensive flight,” she says. She hasn’t seen her parents for three and a half years.<br>
<br>
Australia closed its border in March 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic started its race around the globe. Just 1.1 million passengers flew in or out of the country in the 2021 financial year, compared to 42 million in 2019, government data shows. But what’s it going to be like to travel overseas again? Where can we go? And what should you take?<br>
<br>
Businessman, Thornton, travelled to Europe earlier this year for business, carrying a “wad of paper” to get through border checks. The experience was not as hard as he expected, but it was time-consuming. “It’s going to be a lot of forms, a lot of box-ticking and a lot of checking,” he says. He had to arrive for his Eurostar train ride from London to Lille, for example, two hours before departure rather than 45 minutes in pre-COVID times. “There’s just a lot more rigour in terms of checking at passport control and immigration,” Thornton says.<br>

Getting out to see the world is a fantastic opportunity for you to explore and learn more about other cultures. However, it is important for authorities to screen for pests, diseases and weeds which may have travelled with you. To help protect our agricultural industries, unique environment and the health of all Australians, the department assesses all incoming air and sea travellers and screens baggage using X-ray machines, detector dogs and physical inspection. Unsure? Just declare it. You must declare certain food, plant material (including wooden articles) and animal products on your Incoming Passenger Card. Anything you declare will be assessed by a biosecurity officer, who will determine the risk associated with the goods and whether an inspection is required. If you are unsure, just declare it. Depending on the risk, you may be required to pay for the goods to be treated (e.g. fumigation or gamma irradiation), pay to export the goods from Australia or give up your goods for destruction. You will not face a penalty if you declare all goods, even if they are not allowed into Australia.<br>

But London is not necessarily the most attractive city. In the hospitality industry, a bed night measures the occupancy of one person (assigned to one bed) for one night. While London ranked first in terms of bed nights, the United Kingdom received a Travel &amp; Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI) score of 5.2 out of 7.0 in 2019, taking only the fourth place on the list. The TTCI takes into consideration factors such as a country's infrastructure and its policy and enabling conditions. Comparatively, Spain ranked first on the TTCI, but its capital city Madrid ranked only at sixth place in terms of bed nights, with approximately 21 million in 2019 and an increase in bed nights of 4.3 percent over the previous year.<br>

Just hours after Prime Minister, Scott Morrison announced on October 1 that he would soon reopen Australia’s international border, Madhu Tamilarasan was online booking a flight to London. “The law still doesn’t allow me to actually leave but I’ve taken a punt to book a ridiculously expensive flight,” she says. She hasn’t seen her parents for three and a half years.<br>
<br>
Australia closed its border in March 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic started its race around the globe. Just 1.1 million passengers flew in or out of the country in the 2021 financial year, compared to 42 million in 2019, government data shows. But what’s it going to be like to travel overseas again? Where can we go? And what should you take?<br>
<br>
Businessman, Thornton, travelled to Europe earlier this year for business, carrying a “wad of paper” to get through border checks. The experience was not as hard as he expected, but it was time-consuming. “It’s going to be a lot of forms, a lot of box-ticking and a lot of checking,” he says. He had to arrive for his Eurostar train ride from London to Lille, for example, two hours before departure rather than 45 minutes in pre-COVID times. “There’s just a lot more rigour in terms of checking at passport control and immigration,” Thornton says.<br>

Getting out to see the world is a fantastic opportunity for you to explore and learn more about other cultures. However, it is important for authorities to screen for pests, diseases and weeds which may have travelled with you. To help protect our agricultural industries, unique environment and the health of all Australians, the department assesses all incoming air and sea travellers and screens baggage using X-ray machines, detector dogs and physical inspection. Unsure? Just declare it. You must declare certain food, plant material (including wooden articles) and animal products on your Incoming Passenger Card. Anything you declare will be assessed by a biosecurity officer, who will determine the risk associated with the goods and whether an inspection is required. If you are unsure, just declare it. Depending on the risk, you may be required to pay for the goods to be treated (e.g. fumigation or gamma irradiation), pay to export the goods from Australia or give up your goods for destruction. You will not face a penalty if you declare all goods, even if they are not allowed into Australia.<br>

<strong>Tarzan of the Apes&nbsp;</strong><br>
<br>
by Edgar Burroughs<br>
<br>
<em>[Lord and Lady Greystoke (Clayton and Alice) of England had been shipwrecked along a section of African coast covered by jungle.]</em><br>
<br>
The brilliant birds and the little monkeys had become accustomed to their new acquaintances, and as they had evidently never seen human beings before, they presently, after their first fright had worn off, approached closer and closer, impelled by that strange curiosity which dominates the wild creatures of the forest and the jungle and the plain, so that within the first month several of the birds had gone so far as even to accept morsels of food from the friendly hands of Clayton and Alice.<br>
<br>
One afternoon, while Clayton was working upon an addition to their cabin, for he contemplated building several more rooms, a number of their grotesque little friends came shrieking and scolding through the trees from the direction of the ridge. Ever as they fled they cast fearful glances back of them, and finally they stopped near Clayton jabbering excitedly to him as though to warn him of approaching danger.<br>
<br>
At last he saw it, the thing the little monkeys so feared—the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>man-brute</strong></span> of which Clayton had caught occasional fleeting glimpses. It was approaching through the jungle in a semi-erect position, now and then placing the backs of its closed fists upon the ground—a great anthropoid gorilla ape, and, as it advanced, it emitted deep guttural growls and an occasional low barking sound.<br>
<br>
Clayton was at some distance from the cabin, having come to fell a particularly perfect tree for his building operations. Grown careless from months of continued safety, during which time he had seen no dangerous animals during the daylight hours, he had left his rifles and revolvers all within the little cabin, and now that he saw the great ape crashing through the underbrush directly toward him, and from a direction which practically cut him off from escape, he felt a vague little shiver play up and down his spine.<br>
<br>
He knew that, armed only with an axe, his chances with this ferocious monster were small indeed—and Alice; O God, he thought, what will become of Alice?<br>
<br>
There was yet a slight chance of reaching the cabin. He turned and ran toward it, shouting an alarm to his wife to run in and close the great door in case the ape cut off his retreat.<br>
<br>
Lady Greystoke had been sitting a little way from the cabin, and when she heard his cry she looked up to see the ape springing with almost incredible swiftness, for so large and awkward an animal, in an effort to head off Clayton. With a low cry she sprang toward the cabin, and, as she entered, gave a backward glance which filled her soul with terror, for
<div>the brute had intercepted her husband, who now stood at bay grasping his axe with both hands ready to swing it upon the infuriated animal when he should make his final charge.<br>
<br>
"Close and bolt the door, Alice," cried Clayton. "I can finish this fellow with my axe."<br>
<br>
But he knew he was facing a horrible death, and so did she.<br>
<br>
The ape was a great bull, weighing probably three hundred pounds. His nasty, close-set eyes gleamed hatred from beneath his shaggy brows, while his great canine fangs were bared in a horrid snarl as he paused a moment before his prey.<br>
<br>
Over the brute's shoulder Clayton could see the doorway of his cabin, not twenty paces distant, and a great wave of horror and fear swept over him as he saw his young wife emerge, armed with one of his rifles.<br>
<br>
She had always been afraid of firearms, and would never touch them, but now she rushed toward the ape with the fearlessness of a lioness protecting its young.<br>
<br>
"Back, Alice," shouted Clayton, "For God's sake, go back."

<strong>Tarzan of the Apes&nbsp;</strong><br>

<strong>Tarzan of the Apes&nbsp;</strong><br>
<br>
by Edgar Burroughs<br>
<br>
<em>[Lord and Lady Greystoke (Clayton and Alice) of England had been shipwrecked along a section of African coast covered by jungle.]</em><br>
<br>
The brilliant birds and the little monkeys had become accustomed to their new acquaintances, and as they had evidently never seen human beings before, they presently, after their first fright had worn off, approached closer and closer, impelled by that strange curiosity which dominates the wild creatures of the forest and the jungle and the plain, so that within the first month several of the birds had gone so far as even to accept morsels of food from the friendly hands of Clayton and Alice.<br>
<br>
One afternoon, while Clayton was working upon an addition to their cabin, for he contemplated building several more rooms, a number of their grotesque little friends came shrieking and scolding through the trees from the direction of the ridge. Ever as they fled they cast fearful glances back of them, and finally they stopped near Clayton jabbering excitedly to him as though to warn him of approaching danger.<br>
<br>
At last he saw it, the thing the little monkeys so feared—the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>man-brute</strong></span> of which Clayton had caught occasional fleeting glimpses. It was approaching through the jungle in a semi-erect position, now and then placing the backs of its closed fists upon the ground—a great anthropoid gorilla ape, and, as it advanced, it emitted deep guttural growls and an occasional low barking sound.<br>
<br>
Clayton was at some distance from the cabin, having come to fell a particularly perfect tree for his building operations. Grown careless from months of continued safety, during which time he had seen no dangerous animals during the daylight hours, he had left his rifles and revolvers all within the little cabin, and now that he saw the great ape crashing through the underbrush directly toward him, and from a direction which practically cut him off from escape, he felt a vague little shiver play up and down his spine.<br>
<br>
He knew that, armed only with an axe, his chances with this ferocious monster were small indeed—and Alice; O God, he thought, what will become of Alice?<br>
<br>
There was yet a slight chance of reaching the cabin. He turned and ran toward it, shouting an alarm to his wife to run in and close the great door in case the ape cut off his retreat.<br>
<br>
Lady Greystoke had been sitting a little way from the cabin, and when she heard his cry she looked up to see the ape springing with almost incredible swiftness, for so large and awkward an animal, in an effort to head off Clayton. With a low cry she sprang toward the cabin, and, as she entered, gave a backward glance which filled her soul with terror, for
<div>the brute had intercepted her husband, who now stood at bay grasping his axe with both hands ready to swing it upon the infuriated animal when he should make his final charge.<br>
<br>
"Close and bolt the door, Alice," cried Clayton. "I can finish this fellow with my axe."<br>
<br>
But he knew he was facing a horrible death, and so did she.<br>
<br>
The ape was a great bull, weighing probably three hundred pounds. His nasty, close-set eyes gleamed hatred from beneath his shaggy brows, while his great canine fangs were bared in a horrid snarl as he paused a moment before his prey.<br>
<br>
Over the brute's shoulder Clayton could see the doorway of his cabin, not twenty paces distant, and a great wave of horror and fear swept over him as he saw his young wife emerge, armed with one of his rifles.<br>
<br>
She had always been afraid of firearms, and would never touch them, but now she rushed toward the ape with the fearlessness of a lioness protecting its young.<br>
<br>
"Back, Alice," shouted Clayton, "For God's sake, go back."

<strong>Tarzan of the Apes&nbsp;</strong><br>
<br>
by Edgar Burroughs<br>
<br>
<em>[Lord and Lady Greystoke (Clayton and Alice) of England had been shipwrecked along a section of African coast covered by jungle.]</em><br>
<br>
The brilliant birds and the little monkeys had become accustomed to their new acquaintances, and as they had evidently never seen human beings before, they presently, after their first fright had worn off, approached closer and closer, impelled by that strange curiosity which dominates the wild creatures of the forest and the jungle and the plain, so that within the first month several of the birds had gone so far as even to accept morsels of food from the friendly hands of Clayton and Alice.<br>
<br>
One afternoon, while Clayton was working upon an addition to their cabin, for he contemplated building several more rooms, a number of their grotesque little friends came shrieking and scolding through the trees from the direction of the ridge. Ever as they fled they cast fearful glances back of them, and finally they stopped near Clayton jabbering excitedly to him as though to warn him of approaching danger.<br>
<br>
At last he saw it, the thing the little monkeys so feared—the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>man-brute</strong></span> of which Clayton had caught occasional fleeting glimpses. It was approaching through the jungle in a semi-erect position, now and then placing the backs of its closed fists upon the ground—a great anthropoid gorilla ape, and, as it advanced, it emitted deep guttural growls and an occasional low barking sound.<br>
<br>
Clayton was at some distance from the cabin, having come to fell a particularly perfect tree for his building operations. Grown careless from months of continued safety, during which time he had seen no dangerous animals during the daylight hours, he had left his rifles and revolvers all within the little cabin, and now that he saw the great ape crashing through the underbrush directly toward him, and from a direction which practically cut him off from escape, he felt a vague little shiver play up and down his spine.<br>
<br>
He knew that, armed only with an axe, his chances with this ferocious monster were small indeed—and Alice; O God, he thought, what will become of Alice?<br>
<br>
There was yet a slight chance of reaching the cabin. He turned and ran toward it, shouting an alarm to his wife to run in and close the great door in case the ape cut off his retreat.<br>
<br>
Lady Greystoke had been sitting a little way from the cabin, and when she heard his cry she looked up to see the ape springing with almost incredible swiftness, for so large and awkward an animal, in an effort to head off Clayton. With a low cry she sprang toward the cabin, and, as she entered, gave a backward glance which filled her soul with terror, for
<div>the brute had intercepted her husband, who now stood at bay grasping his axe with both hands ready to swing it upon the infuriated animal when he should make his final charge.<br>
<br>
"Close and bolt the door, Alice," cried Clayton. "I can finish this fellow with my axe."<br>
<br>
But he knew he was facing a horrible death, and so did she.<br>
<br>
The ape was a great bull, weighing probably three hundred pounds. His nasty, close-set eyes gleamed hatred from beneath his shaggy brows, while his great canine fangs were bared in a horrid snarl as he paused a moment before his prey.<br>
<br>
Over the brute's shoulder Clayton could see the doorway of his cabin, not twenty paces distant, and a great wave of horror and fear swept over him as he saw his young wife emerge, armed with one of his rifles.<br>
<br>
She had always been afraid of firearms, and would never touch them, but now she rushed toward the ape with the fearlessness of a lioness protecting its young.<br>
<br>
"Back, Alice," shouted Clayton, "For God's sake, go back."

We have one mother, good brother; it is Her laughter<br>
That sends you now snorting and plunging like red flood-water<br>
To earth again.</p>
