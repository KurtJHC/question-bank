          <strong>Extract A : <em>After January </em>by Nick Earls</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On the eighteenth, we go to Bribie. We take the surf skis from under the house and load them in your car and set off from Golden Beach, over the drifting sandbars and the oystered outcrops of rock and the deep dark band of the water of the passage. We pull the skis up onto a narrow beach and walk until we find a path.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I remember walking here years ago, having paddled here the first time on the ski, setting out by myself from the other side of the water. Taking several summers and then weeks to decide I might get to Bribie and back, weeks to find enough confidence. And when I landed it was as though I had reached another country, one that had not been visited for a long time. And I found something in the mud, sticking out of the mud like an old Roman sword, and I walked through the mud to get to it, not taking my eyes off it in case it would disappear, in case I wasn’t seeing it at all. I imagined taking hold of this old blunt blade and drawing the sword from the mud and carrying it back on the ski, taking care of it across the deep engulfing waters of the passage and the sand-bottomed shallows. Walking from the water, the sword in my hand, telling my mother I think the Romans were there, on Bribie.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And it didn’t disappear and I took it in both hands and the mud gave it to me with a shlock and closed over the hole with ooze and the hilt of the sword was the skull of a pelican, the blade held its beak. I washed it with care at the edge of the water and took it home anyway, all the time wishing it was something else.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I found a pelican’s skull just near here once, I tell you. Sticking up out of the mud.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We follow the track among trees and I wonder if it was cut in 1943. Or if the tracks from the war are long gone and grown over, and people walk new tracks between new trees, and the tracks move like the sandbars in the passage, following lines of least resistance. Closing over with growth, opening up with death again, a bush dying, a tree dying and drying and falling in the harsh salt sand. I can hear the beach ahead of us.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The path leads us to a concrete slab, and the sand comes over one corner of it in a slow wave. And there are holes like square-cut wounds where metal posts have rusted away, orange stains around the edges, the last of the metal crusting in some of them like scabs. There is glass across the concrete, the smashed glass of stubbies thrown hard against it, brown beer glass scattered across the slab. we stop and look at this, as though something might happen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“It’s the fort, isn’t it?” you say. “Part of the fort.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Probably.</p>

          <strong>Extract B : <em>The Voyage of the Beagle</em> by Charles Darwin</strong>

        <p>
          <em>Sailing across the Pacific, the Beagle caught sight of the Heads of Sydney Harbour in January of the new year.&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>JANUARY 12<sup>th</sup>, 1836 – Early in the morning a light air carried us towards the entrance of Port Jackson. Instead of beholding a verdant country, interspersed with fine houses, a straight line of yellowish cliff brought to our minds the coast of Patagonia. A solitary lighthouse, built of white stone, alone told us that we were near a great and populous city. Having entered the harbour, it appears fine and spacious, with cliff-formed shores of horizontally stratified sandstone. The nearly level country is covered with thin scrubby trees, bespeaking the curse of sterility. Proceeding further inland, the country improves: beautiful villas and nice cottages are here and there scattered along the beach. In the distance stone houses, two and three stories high, and windmills standing on the edge of a bank, pointed out to us the neighbourhood of the capital of Australia.</p>
        <p>At last we anchored within Sydney Cove. We found the little basin occupied by many large ships, and surrounded by warehouses. In the evening I walked through the town, and returned full of admiration at the whole scene. It is a most magnificent testimony to the power of the British nation. Here, in a less promising country, scores of years have done many more times more than an equal number of centuries have effected in South America. My first feeling was to congratulate myself that I was born an Englishman. Upon seeing more of the town afterwards, perhaps my admiration fell a little; but yet it is a fine town. The streets are regular, broad, clean, and kept in excellent order; the houses are of a good size, and the shops well furnished. It may be faithfully compared to the large suburbs which stretch out from London and a few other great towns in England; but not even near London or Birmingham is there an appearance of such rapid growth. The number of large houses and other buildings just finished was truly surprising; nevertheless, everyone complained of the high rents and difficulty in procuring a house. Coming from South America, where in the towns every man of property is known, no one thing surprised me more than not being able to ascertain at once to whom this or that carriage belonged.</p>

          <strong>Extract A : <em>After January </em>by Nick Earls</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On the eighteenth, we go to Bribie. We take the surf skis from under the house and load them in your car and set off from Golden Beach, over the drifting sandbars and the oystered outcrops of rock and the deep dark band of the water of the passage. We pull the skis up onto a narrow beach and walk until we find a path.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I remember walking here years ago, having paddled here the first time on the ski, setting out by myself from the other side of the water. Taking several summers and then weeks to decide I might get to Bribie and back, weeks to find enough confidence. And when I landed it was as though I had reached another country, one that had not been visited for a long time. And I found something in the mud, sticking out of the mud like an old Roman sword, and I walked through the mud to get to it, not taking my eyes off it in case it would disappear, in case I wasn’t seeing it at all. I imagined taking hold of this old blunt blade and drawing the sword from the mud and carrying it back on the ski, taking care of it across the deep engulfing waters of the passage and the sand-bottomed shallows. Walking from the water, the sword in my hand, telling my mother I think the Romans were there, on Bribie.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And it didn’t disappear and I took it in both hands and the mud gave it to me with a shlock and closed over the hole with ooze and the hilt of the sword was the skull of a pelican, the blade held its beak. I washed it with care at the edge of the water and took it home anyway, all the time wishing it was something else.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I found a pelican’s skull just near here once, I tell you. Sticking up out of the mud.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We follow the track among trees and I wonder if it was cut in 1943. Or if the tracks from the war are long gone and grown over, and people walk new tracks between new trees, and the tracks move like the sandbars in the passage, following lines of least resistance. Closing over with growth, opening up with death again, a bush dying, a tree dying and drying and falling in the harsh salt sand. I can hear the beach ahead of us.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The path leads us to a concrete slab, and the sand comes over one corner of it in a slow wave. And there are holes like square-cut wounds where metal posts have rusted away, orange stains around the edges, the last of the metal crusting in some of them like scabs. There is glass across the concrete, the smashed glass of stubbies thrown hard against it, brown beer glass scattered across the slab. we stop and look at this, as though something might happen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“It’s the fort, isn’t it?” you say. “Part of the fort.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Probably.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>JANUARY 12<sup>th</sup>, 1836 – Early in the morning a light air carried us towards the entrance of Port Jackson. Instead of beholding a verdant country, interspersed with fine houses, a straight line of yellowish cliff brought to our minds the coast of Patagonia. A solitary lighthouse, built of white stone, alone told us that we were near a great and populous city. Having entered the harbour, it appears fine and spacious, with cliff-formed shores of horizontally stratified sandstone. The nearly level country is covered with thin scrubby trees, bespeaking the curse of sterility. Proceeding further inland, the country improves: beautiful villas and nice cottages are here and there scattered along the beach. In the distance stone houses, two and three stories high, and windmills standing on the edge of a bank, pointed out to us the neighbourhood of the capital of Australia.</p>
        <p>At last we anchored within Sydney Cove. We found the little basin occupied by many large ships, and surrounded by warehouses. In the evening I walked through the town, and returned full of admiration at the whole scene. It is a most magnificent testimony to the power of the British nation. Here, in a less promising country, scores of years have done many more times more than an equal number of centuries have effected in South America. My first feeling was to congratulate myself that I was born an Englishman. Upon seeing more of the town afterwards, perhaps my admiration fell a little; but yet it is a fine town. The streets are regular, broad, clean, and kept in excellent order; the houses are of a good size, and the shops well furnished. It may be faithfully compared to the large suburbs which stretch out from London and a few other great towns in England; but not even near London or Birmingham is there an appearance of such rapid growth. The number of large houses and other buildings just finished was truly surprising; nevertheless, everyone complained of the high rents and difficulty in procuring a house. Coming from South America, where in the towns every man of property is known, no one thing surprised me more than not being able to ascertain at once to whom this or that carriage belonged.</p>

          <strong>GLIDING THROUGH THE DEEP</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Deep in the ocean 200 kilometres off the coast of Western Australia, a sleek shape glides through the water, its half-metre-long fins steering it through the current. For more than 100 days it has roamed the ocean alone, breaking the surface every four to five hours before diving again into the unknown deep.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>21 …………. </strong>Instead, it is one of the most potent research tools in Australia’s Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) arsenal—an autonomous underwater glider.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>22 ………….</strong> The glider moves by pumping in and then expelling sea water. Water going in causes the glider to descend and its expulsion propels the glider up again and forward.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>More than 15 gliders in the IMOS fleet gather data on water temperature, salinity, depth, chlorophyll and dissolved oxygen, transmitting the findings electronically to IMOS during their regular surface stops.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Initially this might sound like something of a novelty, but the practical value of these autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is hard to overestimate. Whereas previously getting accurate readings would have entailed expensive and time-consuming ship-based oceanic observations, today, IMOS is able to dispatch its fleet of AUVs to remote locations in the Coral Sea or Southern Ocean for a fraction of the cost. <strong>23………….</strong> Zigzagging up and down utilising ocean currents, they gather information according to pre-programmed instructions which can be changed remotely when the AUV surfaces to transmit data.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With an operational life span of around six months between maintenance stops, the gliders can be launched and recovered cheaply and quickly from small two-person boats, avoiding costly support and logistics procedures. <strong>24 ………….</strong> The data collected makes a valuable contribution to the world weather communications network. Although they are only about two metres long, these little craft are surprisingly robust, with the capacity to dive to around 1000 metres and travel great distances.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One AUV, similar to those in the IMOS fleet, has demonstrated just how economical underwater gliders really are. <strong>25 ………….</strong></p>

          <strong>GLIDING THROUGH THE DEEP</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Deep in the ocean 200 kilometres off the coast of Western Australia, a sleek shape glides through the water, its half-metre-long fins steering it through the current. For more than 100 days it has roamed the ocean alone, breaking the surface every four to five hours before diving again into the unknown deep.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>21 …………. </strong>Instead, it is one of the most potent research tools in Australia’s Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) arsenal—an autonomous underwater glider.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>22 ………….</strong> The glider moves by pumping in and then expelling sea water. Water going in causes the glider to descend and its expulsion propels the glider up again and forward.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>More than 15 gliders in the IMOS fleet gather data on water temperature, salinity, depth, chlorophyll and dissolved oxygen, transmitting the findings electronically to IMOS during their regular surface stops.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Initially this might sound like something of a novelty, but the practical value of these autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is hard to overestimate. Whereas previously getting accurate readings would have entailed expensive and time-consuming ship-based oceanic observations, today, IMOS is able to dispatch its fleet of AUVs to remote locations in the Coral Sea or Southern Ocean for a fraction of the cost. <strong>23………….</strong> Zigzagging up and down utilising ocean currents, they gather information according to pre-programmed instructions which can be changed remotely when the AUV surfaces to transmit data.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With an operational life span of around six months between maintenance stops, the gliders can be launched and recovered cheaply and quickly from small two-person boats, avoiding costly support and logistics procedures. <strong>24 ………….</strong> The data collected makes a valuable contribution to the world weather communications network. Although they are only about two metres long, these little craft are surprisingly robust, with the capacity to dive to around 1000 metres and travel great distances.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One AUV, similar to those in the IMOS fleet, has demonstrated just how economical underwater gliders really are. <strong>25 ………….</strong></p>

            </p>
            <p>Weather had taken its toll on this school house. The paint, once a light shade of green, had faded into a sickly yellow. In some parts the paint was non-existent, peeled away to reveal the horizontal planks, which had undergone their own suffering. The window panes dated the home, that thick glass a testament to how older buildings were created to last. Those windows somehow added a touch of strength to the pathetic house. At the front of the house the porch awning looked to be leaning, its crooked shadow cutting across a wreath that added character to the door, even in its dead state. Overall, it may be old and aged, but the weathered school house still stood in the field coloured by autumn.</p>

            <p>Once upon a time the garden had been tended, with children running around, squealing with ecstasy. The paint had once seemed new. A man, presumably, had wiped sweat off his forehead while admiring his work. Did he get it right? His wife might have given him a loving nod of appreciation and squeezed his cheek. Then kissed him and gazed at the house before them where they would live until the day they died. That day came long ago.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The children left following their parent's passing. A modest house in the outskirts of nowhere was a thing of the past. Theirs was a generation with a thirst for the city. The grass grew, the children grew and only the house remained as small as ever.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The house would inevitably fall apart, and no one would know.</p>

            <p>You know those old, abandoned houses you see in zombie movies? This wasn't one of them, but it certainly wanted to be when it grew up. It was off to a good start as well. Worn away paint, rickety looking supports, open windows that looked exactly the right sort to make a lot of noise on a stormy night, while the roof leaks and the floorboards creak.</p>
            <p>It wasn't raining today at least, which was lucky. The land around the house was starting to be reclaimed by the wild, and I didn't care for coming out here at low light, when I'd probably trip on something, scratch my arm and get eaten by something wild knowing my luck. Nor was the house entirely abandoned, I noticed. The windows where clean, and fresh-looking curtains hung inside them.</p>

            <p>The house looked like it was dropped from a bi plane. So out of place surely it must have been put here by accident. No sidewalks, no driveways, no light posts. Not even a busted mailbox to suggest its connection to the outside world. The faded paint job was as dull as the dusty windows staring out at the constantly young forest in the distance. Miraculously the garland on the door was still in one piece. I almost felt bad for it. The dying leaves and flowers on it would never be able to find a resting place in the earth. Like the house, it had only this withered death of wear and tear to look forward to.</p>

            <p>Weather had taken its toll on this school house. The paint, once a light shade of green, had faded into a sickly yellow. In some parts the paint was non-existent, peeled away to reveal the horizontal planks, which had undergone their own suffering. The window panes dated the home, that thick glass a testament to how older buildings were created to last. Those windows somehow added a touch of strength to the pathetic house. At the front of the house the porch awning looked to be leaning, its crooked shadow cutting across a wreath that added character to the door, even in its dead state. Overall, it may be old and aged, but the weathered school house still stood in the field coloured by autumn.</p>

            <p>The house looked like it was dropped from a bi plane. So out of place surely it must have been put here by accident. No sidewalks, no driveways, no light posts. Not even a busted mailbox to suggest its connection to the outside world. The faded paint job was as dull as the dusty windows staring out at the constantly young forest in the distance. Miraculously the garland on the door was still in one piece. I almost felt bad for it. The dying leaves and flowers on it would never be able to find a resting place in the earth. Like the house, it had only this withered death of wear and tear to look forward to.</p>

            <p>Weather had taken its toll on this school house. The paint, once a light shade of green, had faded into a sickly yellow. In some parts the paint was non-existent, peeled away to reveal the horizontal planks, which had undergone their own suffering. The window panes dated the home, that thick glass a testament to how older buildings were created to last. Those windows somehow added a touch of strength to the pathetic house. At the front of the house the porch awning looked to be leaning, its crooked shadow cutting across a wreath that added character to the door, even in its dead state. Overall, it may be old and aged, but the weathered school house still stood in the field coloured by autumn.</p>

            <p>Once upon a time the garden had been tended, with children running around, squealing with ecstasy. The paint had once seemed new. A man, presumably, had wiped sweat off his forehead while admiring his work. Did he get it right? His wife might have given him a loving nod of appreciation and squeezed his cheek. Then kissed him and gazed at the house before them where they would live until the day they died. That day came long ago.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The children left following their parent's passing. A modest house in the outskirts of nowhere was a thing of the past. Theirs was a generation with a thirst for the city. The grass grew, the children grew and only the house remained as small as ever.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The house would inevitably fall apart, and no one would know.</p>

            <p>You know those old, abandoned houses you see in zombie movies? This wasn't one of them, but it certainly wanted to be when it grew up. It was off to a good start as well. Worn away paint, rickety looking supports, open windows that looked exactly the right sort to make a lot of noise on a stormy night, while the roof leaks and the floorboards creak.</p>
            <p>It wasn't raining today at least, which was lucky. The land around the house was starting to be reclaimed by the wild, and I didn't care for coming out here at low light, when I'd probably trip on something, scratch my arm and get eaten by something wild knowing my luck. Nor was the house entirely abandoned, I noticed. The windows where clean, and fresh-looking curtains hung inside them.</p>
