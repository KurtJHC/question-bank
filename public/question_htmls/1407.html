        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Nomads of the North&nbsp;</strong><br><em>by James Oliver Curwood&nbsp;</em><br><br><em><strong>[Neewa, the black bear cub has been captured by a hunter who killed his mother the day before.]</strong></em><br><br>
It was the cub who first saw the man-beast, and for a brief space before the pup roused himself Neewa's shining eyes were fixed on the strange enemy who had so utterly changed his world for him. Exhaustion had made him sleep through the long hours of that first night of captivity, and in sleep he had forgotten many things. But now it all came back to him as he cringed deeper into his shelter under the root, and so softly that only Miki heard him as he whimpered for his mother.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was the whimper that roused Miki, the hunter’s dog. Slowly, he untangled himself from the ball into which he had rolled, stretched his long and overgrown legs, and yawned so loudly that the sound reached Challoner's ears. The man turned and saw two pairs of eyes fixed upon him from the sheltered hollow under the root. The pup's one good ear and the other that was half gone stood up alertly, as he greeted his master with the boundless good cheer of an irrepressible comradeship. Challoner's face, wet with the drizzle of the gray skies and bronzed by the wind and storm of fourteen months in the north land, lighted up with a responsive grin, and <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Miki wriggled forth weaving and twisting himself</strong></span> into grotesque contortions expressive of happiness at being thus directly smiled at by his master.</p>
        <p>With all the room under the root left to him, Neewa pulled himself back until only his round head was showing, and from this fortress of temporary safety his bright little eyes glared forth at his mother's murderer.</p>
        <p>Vividly, the tragedy of yesterday was before him again—the warm, sun-filled creek bottom in which he and Noozak, his mother, were hunting a breakfast of crawfish when the manbeast came; the crash of strange thunder, their flight into the timber and the end of it all when his mother turned to confront their enemy. And yet it was not the death of his mother that remained with him most poignantly this morning. It was the memory of his own terrific fight with the white man, and his struggle afterward in the black and suffocating depths of the bag in which Challoner had brought him to his camp. Even now, Challoner was looking at the scratches on his hands. He advanced a few steps, and grinned down at Neewa, just as he had grinned good-humouredly at Miki, the angular pup.</p>
        <p>Neewa's little eyes blazed.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"I told you last night that I was sorry," said Challoner, speaking as if to one of his own kind.</p>
        <p>In several ways Challoner was unusual, an out-of-the-ordinary type in the northland. He believed, for instance, in a certain specific psychology of the animal mind, and had proven to his own satisfaction that animals treated and conversed with in a matter-of-fact human way frequently developed an understanding which he, in his unscientific way, called reason.</p>
        <p>"I told you I was sorry," he repeated, squatting on his heels within a yard of the root from under which Neewa's eyes were glaring at him, "And I am. I'm sorry I killed your mother. But we had to have meat and fat. Besides, Miki and I are going to make it up to you. We're going to take you along with us down to the Girl, and if you don't learn to love her, you're the meanest, lowest-down little cuss in all creation and don't deserve a mother. You and Miki are going to be brothers. His mother is dead, too — plum starved to death, which is worse than dying with a bullet in your lung. And I found Miki just as I found you, hugging up close to her an' crying as if there wasn't any world left for him. So, cheer up, and give us your paw. Let's shake!"</p>
        <p>Challoner held out his hand. Neewa was as motionless as a stone. A few moments before he would have snarled and bared his teeth. But now he was dead still. This was by all odds the strangest beast he had ever seen. Yesterday it had not harmed him, except to put him into the bag. And now it did not offer to harm him. More than that, the talk it made was not unpleasant, or threatening. His eyes took in Miki. The pup had squeezed himself squarely between Challoner's knees and was looking at him in a puzzled, questioning sort of way, as if to ask: "Why don't you come out from under that root and help get breakfast?"</p>

        <p>"I told you I was sorry," he repeated, squatting on his heels within a yard of the root from under which Neewa's eyes were glaring at him, "And I am. I'm sorry I killed your mother. But we had to have meat and fat. Besides, Miki and I are going to make it up to you. We're going to take you along with us down to the Girl, and if you don't learn to love her, you're the meanest, lowest-down little cuss in all creation and don't deserve a mother. You and Miki are going to be brothers. His mother is dead, too — plum starved to death, which is worse than dying with a bullet in your lung. And I found Miki just as I found you, hugging up close to her an' crying as if there wasn't any world left for him. So, cheer up, and give us your paw. Let's shake!"</p>
        <p>Challoner held out his hand. Neewa was as motionless as a stone. A few moments before he would have snarled and bared his teeth. But now he was dead still. This was by all odds the strangest beast he had ever seen. Yesterday it had not harmed him, except to put him into the bag. And now it did not offer to harm him. More than that, the talk it made was not unpleasant, or threatening. His eyes took in Miki. The pup had squeezed himself squarely between Challoner's knees and was looking at him in a puzzled, questioning sort of way, as if to ask: "Why don't you come out from under that root and help get breakfast?"</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Nomads of the North&nbsp;</strong><br><em>by James Oliver Curwood&nbsp;</em><br><br><em><strong>[Neewa, the black bear cub has been captured by a hunter who killed his mother the day before.]</strong></em><br><br>
It was the cub who first saw the man-beast, and for a brief space before the pup roused himself Neewa's shining eyes were fixed on the strange enemy who had so utterly changed his world for him. Exhaustion had made him sleep through the long hours of that first night of captivity, and in sleep he had forgotten many things. But now it all came back to him as he cringed deeper into his shelter under the root, and so softly that only Miki heard him as he whimpered for his mother.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was the whimper that roused Miki, the hunter’s dog. Slowly, he untangled himself from the ball into which he had rolled, stretched his long and overgrown legs, and yawned so loudly that the sound reached Challoner's ears. The man turned and saw two pairs of eyes fixed upon him from the sheltered hollow under the root. The pup's one good ear and the other that was half gone stood up alertly, as he greeted his master with the boundless good cheer of an irrepressible comradeship. Challoner's face, wet with the drizzle of the gray skies and bronzed by the wind and storm of fourteen months in the north land, lighted up with a responsive grin, and <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Miki wriggled forth weaving and twisting himself</strong></span> into grotesque contortions expressive of happiness at being thus directly smiled at by his master.</p>
        <p>With all the room under the root left to him, Neewa pulled himself back until only his round head was showing, and from this fortress of temporary safety his bright little eyes glared forth at his mother's murderer.</p>
        <p>Vividly, the tragedy of yesterday was before him again—the warm, sun-filled creek bottom in which he and Noozak, his mother, were hunting a breakfast of crawfish when the manbeast came; the crash of strange thunder, their flight into the timber and the end of it all when his mother turned to confront their enemy. And yet it was not the death of his mother that remained with him most poignantly this morning. It was the memory of his own terrific fight with the white man, and his struggle afterward in the black and suffocating depths of the bag in which Challoner had brought him to his camp. Even now, Challoner was looking at the scratches on his hands. He advanced a few steps, and grinned down at Neewa, just as he had grinned good-humouredly at Miki, the angular pup.</p>
        <p>Neewa's little eyes blazed.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"I told you last night that I was sorry," said Challoner, speaking as if to one of his own kind.</p>
        <p>In several ways Challoner was unusual, an out-of-the-ordinary type in the northland. He believed, for instance, in a certain specific psychology of the animal mind, and had proven to his own satisfaction that animals treated and conversed with in a matter-of-fact human way frequently developed an understanding which he, in his unscientific way, called reason.</p>

        <p><strong>Chocolate’s Sweet History:</strong>&nbsp;From Elite Treat to Food for the Masses&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mankind’s love affair with chocolate stretches back more than five millennia. Produced from tropical cacao trees native to the rainforests of Central and South America, chocolate was first considered “food of the gods”, and later, a delicacy for the elite.&nbsp;<strong>15 ……….&nbsp;</strong>Archaeologists discovered early traces of cacao in pottery used by the ancient MayoChinchipe culture 5,300 years ago in the upper Amazon. Chocolate played an important political, spiritual and economic role in ancient Mesoamerican civilisations, which ground roasted cacao beans into a paste to brew a frothy chocolate drink. Ancient Mesoamericans believed chocolate was an energy booster with mystical and medicinal qualities. The Mayans, who considered cacao a gift from the gods, used chocolate for sacred ceremonies and funeral offerings.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As people of the Aztec empire spread, others began to prize cacao. Since they couldn’t grow it in the dry highlands of central Mexico, they traded with the Mayans for the beans. Chocolate arrived in Europe in the 1500s, brought by Spanish friars and conquistadors who had travelled to the Americas. Although the Spanish sweetened the bitter drink with cane sugar and cinnamon, one thing remained unchanged:&nbsp;<strong>16 ……….&nbsp;</strong>It was an expensive import sipped by royal lips, and affordable only to Spanish elites. Chocolate’s popularity then spread to other European courts, where aristocrats consumed it as a magic elixir with health benefits. To quench their growing thirst for chocolate, European powers established colonial plantations in equatorial regions around the world to grow cacao and sugar. When diseases depleted the labour pool, African slaves were imported to work to maintain chocolate production.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>17 ……….&nbsp;</strong>Attributed to Dutch chemist, Coenraad Johannes van Houten, the cocoa press squeezed the fatty butter from roasted cacao beans, leaving behind a dry cake that could be pulverised into a fine powder and be mixed with liquids and other ingredients, poured into moulds, and solidified into easily digestible chocolate. The cocoa press ushered in the modern era of chocolate by enabling it to be used as a confectionary with the resulting drop in production costs making chocolate much more affordable.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In 1847, British company J. S. Fry &amp; Sons created the first edible chocolate bar from cocoa butter, cocoa powder and sugar. Rival chocolatier, Cadbury’s, followed suit soon after and in 1854 earned a royal warrant as purveyors of chocolate to Queen Victoria. It was in Switzerland that chocolate production took one of its greatest leaps forward. In the 1870s, Swiss chocolatier Daniel Peter utilised a powdered milk developed several years earlier by his neighbour, Henri Nestlé to produce the first milk chocolate bar. The pair eventually formed the Nestlé Company. Eventually, Swiss chocolatier, Rodolphe Lindt invented the&nbsp;conching machine in 1879.&nbsp;<strong>18 ……….&nbsp;</strong>This allowed for the mass production of smooth, creamy milk chocolate.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the United States, Milton Hershey pioneered the assembly-line production of milk chocolate. Hershey bought farmland in rural Pennsylvania and built an entire factory town devoted to chocolate.&nbsp;<strong>19 ……….&nbsp;</strong>Chocolate bars soared in popularity during the 1920’s. By the end of the decade, more than 40,000 different candy bars were being made in the U.S., according to Susan Benjamin, candy historian.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>From its roots more than 5,000 years ago, chocolate has become a big business. According to research by Statista, retail sales of chocolate worldwide in 2016 totalled nearly $100 billion. This included almost $25 billion in the United States alone.<strong>&nbsp;20 ……….&nbsp;</strong>Africa is now the source of more than two-thirds of worldwide cocoa production.&nbsp;</p>

Although the Spanish sweetened the bitter drink with cane sugar and cinnamon, one thing remained unchanged:&nbsp;<strong>16 ……….&nbsp;</strong>It was an expensive import sipped by royal lips, and affordable only to Spanish elites. Chocolate’s popularity then spread to other European courts, where aristocrats consumed it as a magic elixir with health benefits. To quench their growing thirst for chocolate, European powers established colonial plantations in equatorial regions around the world to grow cacao and sugar. When diseases depleted the labour pool, African slaves were imported to work to maintain chocolate production.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>17 ……….&nbsp;</strong>Attributed to Dutch chemist, Coenraad Johannes van Houten, the cocoa press squeezed the fatty butter from roasted cacao beans, leaving behind a dry cake that could be pulverised into a fine powder and be mixed with liquids and other ingredients, poured into moulds, and solidified into easily digestible chocolate. The cocoa press ushered in the modern era of chocolate by enabling it to be used as a confectionary with the resulting drop in production costs making chocolate much more affordable.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In 1847, British company J. S. Fry &amp; Sons created the first edible chocolate bar from cocoa butter, cocoa powder and sugar. Rival chocolatier, Cadbury’s, followed suit soon after and in 1854 earned a royal warrant as purveyors of chocolate to Queen Victoria. It was in Switzerland that chocolate production took one of its greatest leaps forward. In the 1870s, Swiss chocolatier Daniel Peter utilised a powdered milk developed several years earlier by his neighbour, Henri Nestlé to produce the first milk chocolate bar. The pair eventually formed the Nestlé Company. Eventually, Swiss chocolatier, Rodolphe Lindt invented the&nbsp;conching machine in 1879.&nbsp;<strong>18 ……….&nbsp;</strong>This allowed for the mass production of smooth, creamy milk chocolate.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the United States, Milton Hershey pioneered the assembly-line production of milk chocolate. Hershey bought farmland in rural Pennsylvania and built an entire factory town devoted to chocolate.&nbsp;<strong>19 ……….&nbsp;</strong>Chocolate bars soared in popularity during the 1920’s. By the end of the decade, more than 40,000 different candy bars were being made in the U.S., according to Susan Benjamin, candy historian.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>From its roots more than 5,000 years ago, chocolate has become a big business. According to research by Statista, retail sales of chocolate worldwide in 2016 totalled nearly $100 billion. This included almost $25 billion in the United States alone.<strong>&nbsp;20 ……….&nbsp;</strong>Africa is now the source of more than two-thirds of worldwide cocoa production.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>Chocolate’s Sweet History:</strong>&nbsp;From Elite Treat to Food for the Masses&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mankind’s love affair with chocolate stretches back more than five millennia. Produced from tropical cacao trees native to the rainforests of Central and South America, chocolate was first considered “food of the gods”, and later, a delicacy for the elite.&nbsp;<strong>15 ……….&nbsp;</strong>Archaeologists discovered early traces of cacao in pottery used by the ancient MayoChinchipe culture 5,300 years ago in the upper Amazon. Chocolate played an important political, spiritual and economic role in ancient Mesoamerican civilisations, which ground roasted cacao beans into a paste to brew a frothy chocolate drink. Ancient Mesoamericans believed chocolate was an energy booster with mystical and medicinal qualities. The Mayans, who considered cacao a gift from the gods, used chocolate for sacred ceremonies and funeral offerings.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As people of the Aztec empire spread, others began to prize cacao. Since they couldn’t grow it in the dry highlands of central Mexico, they traded with the Mayans for the beans.

Chocolate’s popularity then spread to other European courts, where aristocrats consumed it as a magic elixir with health benefits. To quench their growing thirst for chocolate, European powers established colonial plantations in equatorial regions around the world to grow cacao and sugar. When diseases depleted the labour pool, African slaves were imported to work to maintain chocolate production.</p>

        <p><strong>Chocolate’s Sweet History:</strong>&nbsp;From Elite Treat to Food for the Masses&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mankind’s love affair with chocolate stretches back more than five millennia. Produced from tropical cacao trees native to the rainforests of Central and South America, chocolate was first considered “food of the gods”, and later, a delicacy for the elite.&nbsp;<strong>15 ……….&nbsp;</strong>Archaeologists discovered early traces of cacao in pottery used by the ancient MayoChinchipe culture 5,300 years ago in the upper Amazon. Chocolate played an important political, spiritual and economic role in ancient Mesoamerican civilisations, which ground roasted cacao beans into a paste to brew a frothy chocolate drink. Ancient Mesoamericans believed chocolate was an energy booster with mystical and medicinal qualities. The Mayans, who considered cacao a gift from the gods, used chocolate for sacred ceremonies and funeral offerings.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As people of the Aztec empire spread, others began to prize cacao. Since they couldn’t grow it in the dry highlands of central Mexico, they traded with the Mayans for the beans. Chocolate arrived in Europe in the 1500s, brought by Spanish friars and conquistadors who had travelled to the Americas. Although the Spanish sweetened the bitter drink with cane sugar and cinnamon, one thing remained unchanged:&nbsp;<strong>16 ……….&nbsp;</strong>It was an expensive import sipped by royal lips, and affordable only to Spanish elites. Chocolate’s popularity then spread to other European courts, where aristocrats consumed it as a magic elixir with health benefits. To quench their growing thirst for chocolate, European powers established colonial plantations in equatorial regions around the world to grow cacao and sugar. When diseases depleted the labour pool, African slaves were imported to work to maintain chocolate production.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>17 ……….&nbsp;</strong>Attributed to Dutch chemist, Coenraad Johannes van Houten, the cocoa press squeezed the fatty butter from roasted cacao beans, leaving behind a dry cake that could be pulverised into a fine powder and be mixed with liquids and other ingredients, poured into moulds, and solidified into easily digestible chocolate. The cocoa press ushered in the modern era of chocolate by enabling it to be used as a confectionary with the resulting drop in production costs making chocolate much more affordable.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In 1847, British company J. S. Fry &amp; Sons created the first edible chocolate bar from cocoa butter, cocoa powder and sugar. Rival chocolatier, Cadbury’s, followed suit soon after and in 1854 earned a royal warrant as purveyors of chocolate to Queen Victoria. It was in Switzerland that chocolate production took one of its greatest leaps forward. In the 1870s, Swiss chocolatier Daniel Peter utilised a powdered milk developed several years earlier by his neighbour, Henri Nestlé to produce the first milk chocolate bar. The pair eventually formed the Nestlé Company. Eventually, Swiss chocolatier, Rodolphe Lindt invented the&nbsp;conching machine in 1879.&nbsp;<strong>18 ……….&nbsp;</strong>This allowed for the mass production of smooth, creamy milk chocolate.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the United States, Milton Hershey pioneered the assembly-line production of milk chocolate. Hershey bought farmland in rural Pennsylvania and built an entire factory town devoted to chocolate.&nbsp;<strong>19 ……….&nbsp;</strong>Chocolate bars soared in popularity during the 1920’s. By the end of the decade, more than 40,000 different candy bars were being made in the U.S., according to Susan Benjamin, candy historian.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>From its roots more than 5,000 years ago, chocolate has become a big business. According to research by Statista, retail sales of chocolate worldwide in 2016 totalled nearly $100 billion. This included almost $25 billion in the United States alone.<strong>&nbsp;20 ……….&nbsp;</strong>Africa is now the source of more than two-thirds of worldwide cocoa production.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>Chocolate’s Sweet History:</strong>&nbsp;From Elite Treat to Food for the Masses&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mankind’s love affair with chocolate stretches back more than five millennia. Produced from tropical cacao trees native to the rainforests of Central and South America, chocolate was first considered “food of the gods”, and later, a delicacy for the elite.&nbsp;<strong>15 ……….&nbsp;</strong>Archaeologists discovered early traces of cacao in pottery used by the ancient MayoChinchipe culture 5,300 years ago in the upper Amazon. Chocolate played an important political, spiritual and economic role in ancient Mesoamerican civilisations, which ground roasted cacao beans into a paste to brew a frothy chocolate drink. Ancient Mesoamericans believed chocolate was an energy booster with mystical and medicinal qualities. The Mayans, who considered cacao a gift from the gods, used chocolate for sacred ceremonies and funeral offerings.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As people of the Aztec empire spread, others began to prize cacao. Since they couldn’t grow it in the dry highlands of central Mexico, they traded with the Mayans for the beans. Chocolate arrived in Europe in the 1500s, brought by Spanish friars and conquistadors who had travelled to the Americas. Although the Spanish sweetened the bitter drink with cane sugar and cinnamon, one thing remained unchanged:&nbsp;<strong>16 ……….&nbsp;</strong>It was an expensive import sipped by royal lips, and affordable only to Spanish elites. Chocolate’s popularity then spread to other European courts, where aristocrats consumed it as a magic elixir with health benefits. To quench their growing thirst for chocolate, European powers established colonial plantations in equatorial regions around the world to grow cacao and sugar. When diseases depleted the labour pool, African slaves were imported to work to maintain chocolate production.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>17 ……….&nbsp;</strong>Attributed to Dutch chemist, Coenraad Johannes van Houten, the cocoa press squeezed the fatty butter from roasted cacao beans, leaving behind a dry cake that could be pulverised into a fine powder and be mixed with liquids and other ingredients, poured into moulds, and solidified into easily digestible chocolate. The cocoa press ushered in the modern era of chocolate by enabling it to be used as a confectionary with the resulting drop in production costs making chocolate much more affordable.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In 1847, British company J. S. Fry &amp; Sons created the first edible chocolate bar from cocoa butter, cocoa powder and sugar. Rival chocolatier, Cadbury’s, followed suit soon after and in 1854 earned a royal warrant as purveyors of chocolate to Queen Victoria. It was in Switzerland that chocolate production took one of its greatest leaps forward. In the 1870s, Swiss chocolatier Daniel Peter utilised a powdered milk developed several years earlier by his neighbour, Henri Nestlé to produce the first milk chocolate bar. The pair eventually formed the Nestlé Company. Eventually, Swiss chocolatier, Rodolphe Lindt invented the&nbsp;conching machine in 1879.&nbsp;<strong>18 ……….&nbsp;</strong>This allowed for the mass production of smooth, creamy milk chocolate.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the United States, Milton Hershey pioneered the assembly-line production of milk chocolate. Hershey bought farmland in rural Pennsylvania and built an entire factory town devoted to chocolate.&nbsp;<strong>19 ……….&nbsp;</strong>Chocolate bars soared in popularity during the 1920’s. By the end of the decade, more than 40,000 different candy bars were being made in the U.S., according to Susan Benjamin, candy historian.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>From its roots more than 5,000 years ago, chocolate has become a big business. According to research by Statista, retail sales of chocolate worldwide in 2016 totalled nearly $100 billion. This included almost $25 billion in the United States alone.<strong>&nbsp;20 ……….&nbsp;</strong>Africa is now the source of more than two-thirds of worldwide cocoa production.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A&nbsp;</strong>^}<br>
Michelangelo was a sculptor, painter and architect widely considered to be one of the greatest artists of the Renaissance — and arguably of all time. His work demonstrated a blend of psychological insight, physical realism and intensity never seen before.<br>
<br>
Michelangelo needed very little sleep and was usually so drawn up in his work that he would spend weeks in the same clothes and shoes. His servant reported that when Michelangelo did take off his shoes, the skin on his feet would peel off like a snake’s.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Michelangelo was a highly focused artist, but his creativity wasn’t something he took for granted. He wrote, “Critique by creating.” Michelangelo felt that he could respond to others by doing a better job than they could.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Being creative means solving a problem in a new way. It means changing your perspective.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Being creative means taking risks and ignoring doubt and facing fears. It means breaking with routine and doing something different for the sake of doing something different. It means mapping out a thousand different routes to reach one destination. It means challenging yourself every day by applying extensive thought processes in many scenarios.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Being creative means searching for inspiration in even the most mundane places. It means you’re asking stupid questions. It means creating without critiquing.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Being creative means you know how to find the similarities and differences between two completely random ideas. Being creative means you’re thinking.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
How did songwriters John Lennon and Paul McCartney make music magic together? On the surface, it seems simple — they covered for each other's deficits and created outlets for each other's strengths. Paul's melodic sunshine smoothed out John's bluesy growls, while John's soulful depth gave stability to Paul and kept him from floating away.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But images of completion and balance miss an essential energy between Lennon and McCartney — the potential energy of creative partnerships that they, as much as any pair in history, exemplify and illustrate. We tend to think of them in terms of arithmetic: Two people added together yield magnificence. This is the idea of partnership as chocolate and peanut butter — tasty, obvious, easy. But Lennon and McCartney were more like an oyster and a grain of sand. Their power together didn't derive simply from individual ingredients but from a dynamic of constant mutual influence.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Creative writing, a form of artistic expression, draws on the imagination to convey meaning through the use of imagery, narrative, and drama. This is in contrast with analytic or pragmatic forms of writing.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
This genre includes poetry, fiction (novels, short stories), scripts, screenplays and creative non-fiction. You should be able to recognise an author’s written voice the way you recognise a person’s spoken voice.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
In creative writing, one goal is to develop your written voice. Character development is the art of imagining and portraying characters in enough detail that they seem real both to the author and the audience.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Consider the narrator’s perspective on the characters and occurrences in the piece of writing. Whose voice is telling the story? Most fiction is written in first person, an eyewitness account, or in third person, where the narrator describes things that happened to other people.<br>

Michelangelo was a sculptor, painter and architect widely considered to be one of the greatest artists of the Renaissance — and arguably of all time. His work demonstrated a blend of psychological insight, physical realism and intensity never seen before.<br>
<br>
Michelangelo needed very little sleep and was usually so drawn up in his work that he would spend weeks in the same clothes and shoes. His servant reported that when Michelangelo did take off his shoes, the skin on his feet would peel off like a snake’s.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Michelangelo was a highly focused artist, but his creativity wasn’t something he took for granted. He wrote, “Critique by creating.” Michelangelo felt that he could respond to others by doing a better job than they could.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Being creative means solving a problem in a new way. It means changing your perspective.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Being creative means taking risks and ignoring doubt and facing fears. It means breaking with routine and doing something different for the sake of doing something different. It means mapping out a thousand different routes to reach one destination. It means challenging yourself every day by applying extensive thought processes in many scenarios.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Being creative means searching for inspiration in even the most mundane places. It means you’re asking stupid questions. It means creating without critiquing.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Being creative means you know how to find the similarities and differences between two completely random ideas. Being creative means you’re thinking.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
How did songwriters John Lennon and Paul McCartney make music magic together? On the surface, it seems simple — they covered for each other's deficits and created outlets for each other's strengths. Paul's melodic sunshine smoothed out John's bluesy growls, while John's soulful depth gave stability to Paul and kept him from floating away.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But images of completion and balance miss an essential energy between Lennon and McCartney — the potential energy of creative partnerships that they, as much as any pair in history, exemplify and illustrate. We tend to think of them in terms of arithmetic: Two people added together yield magnificence. This is the idea of partnership as chocolate and peanut butter — tasty, obvious, easy. But Lennon and McCartney were more like an oyster and a grain of sand. Their power together didn't derive simply from individual ingredients but from a dynamic of constant mutual influence.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Creative writing, a form of artistic expression, draws on the imagination to convey meaning through the use of imagery, narrative, and drama. This is in contrast with analytic or pragmatic forms of writing.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
This genre includes poetry, fiction (novels, short stories), scripts, screenplays and creative non-fiction. You should be able to recognise an author’s written voice the way you recognise a person’s spoken voice.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
In creative writing, one goal is to develop your written voice. Character development is the art of imagining and portraying characters in enough detail that they seem real both to the author and the audience.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Consider the narrator’s perspective on the characters and occurrences in the piece of writing. Whose voice is telling the story? Most fiction is written in first person, an eyewitness account, or in third person, where the narrator describes things that happened to other people.<br>
