It was beautiful spring weather, but neither dogs nor humans were aware of it. Each day the sun rose earlier and set later. It was dawn by three in the morning, and twilight lingered till nine at night. The whole long day was a blaze of sunshine. The ghostly winter silence had given way to the great spring murmur of awakening life. This murmur arose from all the land, fraught with the joy of living. It came from the things that lived and moved again, things which had been as dead and which had not moved during the long months of frost. The sap was rising in the pines. The willows and aspens were bursting out in young buds. Shrubs and vines were putting on fresh garbs of green. Crickets sang in the nights, and in the days all manner of creeping, crawling things rustled forth into the sun. Partridges and woodpeckers were booming and knocking in the forest. Squirrels were chattering, birds singing, and overhead honked the wild-fowl driving up from the south in cunning wedges that split the air.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>From every hill slope came the trickle of running water, the music of unseen fountains. All things were thawing, bending, snapping.&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline"><strong>The Yukon was straining to break loose the ice that bound it down</strong></span>. It ate away from beneath; the sun ate from above. Air-holes formed, f issures sprang and spread apart, while thin sections of ice fell through bodily into the river. And amid all this bursting, rending, throbbing of awakening life, under the blazing sun and through the soft-sighing breezes, like wayfarers to death, staggered the two men, the woman, and the huskies.</p>
        <p>With the dogs falling, Mercedes weeping and riding, Hal swearing innocuously, and Charles’s eyes wistfully watering, they staggered into John Thornton’s camp at the mouth of White River. When they halted, the dogs dropped down as though they had all been struck dead. Mercedes dried her eyes and looked at John Thornton. Charles sat down on a log to rest. He sat down very slowly and painstakingly what of his great stiffness. Hal did the talking. John Thornton was whittling the last touches on an axe-handle he had made from a stick of birch. He whittled and listened, gave monosyllabic replies, and, when it was asked, terse advice. He knew the breed, and he gave his advice in the certainty that it would not be followed.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“They told us up above that the bottom was dropping out of the trail and that the best thing for us to do was to lay over,” Hal said in response to Thornton’s warning to take no more chances on the rotten ice. “They told us we couldn’t make White River, and here we are.” This last with a sneering ring of triumph in it.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“And they told you true,” John Thornton answered. “The bottom’s likely to drop out at any moment. Only fools, with the blind luck of fools, could have made it. I tell you straight, I wouldn’t risk my carcass on that ice for all the gold in Alaska.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“That’s because you’re not a fool, I suppose,” said Hal. “All the same, we’ll go on to Dawson.”&nbsp;He uncoiled his whip. “Get up there, Buck! Hi! Get up there! Mush on!”</p>
        <p>Thornton went on whittling. It was idle, he knew, to get between a fool and his folly; while two or three fools more or less would not alter the scheme of things.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But the team did not get up at the command. It had long since passed into the stage where blows were required to rouse it. The whip flashed out, here and there, on its merciless errands. John Thornton compressed his lips. Sol-leks was the first to crawl to his feet. Teek followed. Joe came next, yelping with pain. Pike made painful efforts. Twice he fell over, when half up, and on the third attempt managed to rise. Buck made no effort. He lay quietly where he had fallen. The lash bit into him again and again, but he neither whined nor struggled. Several times Thornton started, as though to speak, but changed his mind. A moisture came into his eyes, and, as the whipping continued, he arose and walked irresolutely up and down.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the extract below then answer the questions.</em><br><br>
It was beautiful spring weather, but neither dogs nor humans were aware of it. Each day the sun rose earlier and set later. It was dawn by three in the morning, and twilight lingered till nine at night. The whole long day was a blaze of sunshine. The ghostly winter silence had given way to the great spring murmur of awakening life. This murmur arose from all the land, fraught with the joy of living. It came from the things that lived and moved again, things which had been as dead and which had not moved during the long months of frost. The sap was rising in the pines. The willows and aspens were bursting out in young buds. Shrubs and vines were putting on fresh garbs of green. Crickets sang in the nights, and in the days all manner of creeping, crawling things rustled forth into the sun. Partridges and woodpeckers were booming and knocking in the forest. Squirrels were chattering, birds singing, and overhead honked the wild-fowl driving up from the south in cunning wedges that split the air.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>From every hill slope came the trickle of running water, the music of unseen fountains. All things were thawing, bending, snapping.&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline"><strong>The Yukon was straining to break loose the ice that bound it down</strong></span>. It ate away from beneath; the sun ate from above. Air-holes formed, f issures sprang and spread apart, while thin sections of ice fell through bodily into the river. And amid all this bursting, rending, throbbing of awakening life, under the blazing sun and through the soft-sighing breezes, like wayfarers to death, staggered the two men, the woman, and the huskies.</p>
        <p>With the dogs falling, Mercedes weeping and riding, Hal swearing innocuously, and Charles’s eyes wistfully watering, they staggered into John Thornton’s camp at the mouth of White River. When they halted, the dogs dropped down as though they had all been struck dead. Mercedes dried her eyes and looked at John Thornton. Charles sat down on a log to rest. He sat down very slowly and painstakingly what of his great stiffness. Hal did the talking. John Thornton was whittling the last touches on an axe-handle he had made from a stick of birch. He whittled and listened, gave monosyllabic replies, and, when it was asked, terse advice. He knew the breed, and he gave his advice in the certainty that it would not be followed.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“They told us up above that the bottom was dropping out of the trail and that the best thing for us to do was to lay over,” Hal said in response to Thornton’s warning to take no more chances on the rotten ice. “They told us we couldn’t make White River, and here we are.” This last with a sneering ring of triumph in it.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“And they told you true,” John Thornton answered. “The bottom’s likely to drop out at any moment. Only fools, with the blind luck of fools, could have made it. I tell you straight, I wouldn’t risk my carcass on that ice for all the gold in Alaska.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“That’s because you’re not a fool, I suppose,” said Hal. “All the same, we’ll go on to Dawson.”&nbsp;He uncoiled his whip. “Get up there, Buck! Hi! Get up there! Mush on!”</p>
        <p>Thornton went on whittling. It was idle, he knew, to get between a fool and his folly; while two or three fools more or less would not alter the scheme of things.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But the team did not get up at the command. It had long since passed into the stage where blows were required to rouse it. The whip flashed out, here and there, on its merciless errands. John Thornton compressed his lips. Sol-leks was the first to crawl to his feet. Teek followed. Joe came next, yelping with pain. Pike made painful efforts. Twice he fell over, when half up, and on the third attempt managed to rise. Buck made no effort. He lay quietly where he had fallen. The lash bit into him again and again, but he neither whined nor struggled. Several times Thornton started, as though to speak, but changed his mind. A moisture came into his eyes, and, as the whipping continued, he arose and walked irresolutely up and down.&nbsp;</p>

Where the acorn tumbles down,<br>
Where the ash tree sheds its berry,<br>
With your fur so soft and brown,<br>
With your eye so round and merry,<br>
Scarcely moving the long grass,<br>
Field mouse, I can see you pass.<br>
Little thing, in what dark den,<br>
Lie you all the winter sleeping?<br>
Till warm weather comes again,<br>
Then once more I see you peeping<br>
Round about the tall tree roots,<br>
Nibbling at their fallen fruits.<br>
Field mouse, field mouse, do not go,<br>
Where the farmer stacks his treasure,<br>
Find the nut that falls below,<br>
Eat the acorn at your pleasure,<br>
But you must not steal the grain<br>
He has stacked with so much pain.<br>
Make your hole where mosses spring,<br>
Underneath the tall oak’s shadow,<br>
Pretty, quiet harmless thing,<br>
Play about the sunny meadow.<br>
Keep away from corn and house,<br>
None will harm you, little mouse.</p>

Where the acorn tumbles down,<br>
Where the ash tree sheds its berry,<br>
With your fur so soft and brown,<br>
With your eye so round and merry,<br>
Scarcely moving the long grass,<br>
Field mouse, I can see you pass.<br>
Little thing, in what dark den,<br>
Lie you all the winter sleeping?<br>
Till warm weather comes again,<br>
Then once more I see you peeping<br>
Round about the tall tree roots,<br>
Nibbling at their fallen fruits.<br>
Field mouse, field mouse, do not go,<br>
Where the farmer stacks his treasure,<br>
Find the nut that falls below,<br>
Eat the acorn at your pleasure,<br>
But you must not steal the grain<br>
He has stacked with so much pain.<br>
Make your hole where mosses spring,<br>
Underneath the tall oak’s shadow,<br>
Pretty, quiet harmless thing,<br>
Play about the sunny meadow.<br>
Keep away from corn and house,<br>
None will harm you, little mouse.</p>

<br>
In modern society, electricity is as important as water. This means that the security and quality of the electricity supply cannot be compromised. We are therefore facing a double challenge: we must change the energy mix to include a large number of inconstant renewables, while maintaining a very high level of available electricity for all types of use. Finding a balance between differences in electricity production and consumption, as well as taking into account recent advances in energy storage technology, requires adapting both transmission and distribution electric grids. Energy storage, which is essential to meet the high electricity demand, can come from stationary batteries but also from electric vehicles (EVs) with vehicle to-grid capacity, for example. The idea is to get EVs to charge during off-peak hours, such as at night, and then to supply extra stored energy to the grid during peak usage.<br>

Thomas Edison was called a ‘wizard’ because of his many important inventions. He created more than 1,000 devices on his own or with others. His best-known inventions include the phonograph (record player), the lightbulb, and the motion-picture projector. Thomas Alva Edison was born on February 11, 1847, in Milan, Ohio. He experienced hearing loss at an early age. He was an imaginative and curious child. He did poorly in school, though, perhaps because he could not hear his teacher. His mother then educated him at home. When Thomas was a teenager, he became a telegraph operator. Telegraphy was one of the nation’s most important communication systems at the time. Thomas was good at sending and receiving messages in Morse code. He loved tinkering with telegraphic instruments, and he developed several improvements for them. By early 1869, he had quit his telegraphy job to become a full-time inventor. Edison worked hard with scientists and other partners to finish projects. He built research laboratories at Menlo Park and West Orange, New Jersey. Eventually, Edison created companies that produced and sold the successful inventions.<br>

<br>
People have a long history of using the force of water flowing in streams and rivers to produce mechanical energy. Hydropower was one of the first sources of energy used for electricity generation, and until 2019, hydropower was the leading source of total annual U.S. renewable electricity generation. Because the source of hydroelectric power is water, hydroelectric power plants are usually located on or near a water source. The volume of the water flow and the change in elevation – often referred to as the ‘head’ – from one point to another determine the amount of energy that is available in the moving water. In general, the greater the water flow and the higher the head, the more electricity a hydropower plant can produce. At hydropower plants, water flows through a pipe or penstock, and turns the blades in a turbine, that powers a generator to ultimately produce electricity.&nbsp;<br>

Morning broke hot and humid over New York on July 13, 1977, at the outset of what became one of the longest heatwaves in the city’s history. At 8:37 p.m. in neighbouring Westchester County, lightning struck two high-voltage lines at a major power plant. Two more major lines on the Con Edison power system, which serviced eight million people in the greater New York metropolitan area, were struck at 8:56 p.m. Over the course of an hour, a cascade of power outages throughout the system led to its total collapse. By 9:40 p.m., all five boroughs of the city were plunged into darkness. The economic and social frustrations that had steadily been building, boiled over. Widespread looting, unrest and arson broke out in the poorest neighbourhoods. Over the next 24 hours, 1,600 stores were damaged, more than 1,000 fires were reported, and more than 3,700 people were arrested. Economic damages reached well into the hundreds of millions of dollars. By the time day dawned on July 15, the city’s system was back online, and New York’s residents tried to resume the rhythms of daily life amid broken glass and embers.<br>
<br>
But they sensed, already, that their city had been drastically changed by the night the lights went out.<br>

And then, suddenly, without warning, uttering a cry that was inarticulate and more like the cry of an animal, John Thornton sprang upon the man who wielded the club. Hal was hurled backward, as though struck by a falling tree. Mercedes screamed. Charles looked on wistfully, wiped his watery eyes, but did not get up because of his stiffness.</p>
        <p>John Thornton stood over Buck, struggling to control himself, oo convulsed with rage to speak.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“If you strike that dog again, I’ll kill you,” he at last managed to say in a choking voice.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“It’s my dog,” Hal replied, wiping the blood from his mouth as he came back. “Get out of my way, or I’ll fix you. I’m going to Dawson.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Thornton stood between him and Buck, and evinced no intention of getting out of the way. Hal drew his long hunting-knife. Mercedes screamed, cried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria. Thornton rapped Hal’s knuckles with the axe-handle, knocking the knife to the ground. He rapped his knuckles again as he tried to pick it up. Then he stooped, picked it up himself, and with two strokes cut Buck’s traces.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Hal had no fight left in him. Besides, <span class="txt-underline"><strong>his hands were full with his sister</strong></span>, or his arms, rather; while Buck was too near dead to be of further use in hauling the sled. A few minutes later they pulled out from the bank and down the river. Buck heard them go and raised his head to see, Pike was leading, Sol-leks was at the wheel, and between were Joe and Teek. They were limping and staggering. Mercedes was riding the loaded sled. Hal guided at the gee-pole, and Charles stumbled along in the rear.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As Buck watched them, Thornton knelt beside him and with rough, kindly hands searched for broken bones. By the time his search had disclosed nothing more than many bruises and a state of terrible starvation, the sled was a quarter of a mile away. Dog and man watched it crawling along over the ice. Suddenly, they saw its back end drop down, as into a rut, and the gee-pole, with Hal clinging to it, jerk into the air. Mercedes’s scream came to their ears. They saw Charles turn and make one step to run back, and then a whole section of ice give way and dogs and humans disappear. A yawning hole was all that was to be seen. The bottom had dropped out of the trail.</p>
        <p>John Thornton and Buck looked at each other.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“You poor devil,” said John Thornton, and Buck licked his hand.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When John Thornton froze his feet in the previous December his partners had made him comfortable and left him to get well, going on themselves up the river to get out a raft of saw-logs for Dawson. He was still limping slightly at the time he rescued Buck, but with the continued warm weather even the slight limp left him. And here, lying by the river bank through the long spring days, watching the running water, listening lazily to the songs of birds and the hum of nature, Buck slowly won back his strength.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A rest comes very good after one has travelled three thousand miles, and it must be confessed that Buck waxed lazy as his wounds healed, his muscles swelled out, and the flesh came back to cover his bones. For that matter, they were all loafing,—Buck, John Thornton, and Skeet and Nig,—waiting for the raft to come that was to carry them down to Dawson. Skeet was a little Irish setter who early made friends with Buck, who, in a dying condition, was unable to resent her first advances. She had the doctor trait which some dogs possess; and as a mother cat washes her kittens, so she washed and cleansed Buck’s wounds. Regularly, each morning after he had finished his breakfast, she performed her self-appointed task, till he came to look for her ministrations as much as he did for Thornton’s. Nig, equally friendly, though less demonstrative, was a huge black dog, half bloodhound and half deerhound, with eyes that laughed and a boundless good nature.</p>

And then, suddenly, without warning, uttering a cry that was inarticulate and more like the cry of an animal, John Thornton sprang upon the man who wielded the club. Hal was hurled backward, as though struck by a falling tree. Mercedes screamed. Charles looked on wistfully, wiped his watery eyes, but did not get up because of his stiffness.</p>
        <p>John Thornton stood over Buck, struggling to control himself, oo convulsed with rage to speak.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“If you strike that dog again, I’ll kill you,” he at last managed to say in a choking voice.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“It’s my dog,” Hal replied, wiping the blood from his mouth as he came back. “Get out of my way, or I’ll fix you. I’m going to Dawson.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Thornton stood between him and Buck, and evinced no intention of getting out of the way. Hal drew his long hunting-knife. Mercedes screamed, cried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria. Thornton rapped Hal’s knuckles with the axe-handle, knocking the knife to the ground. He rapped his knuckles again as he tried to pick it up. Then he stooped, picked it up himself, and with two strokes cut Buck’s traces.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Hal had no fight left in him. Besides, <span class="txt-underline"><strong>his hands were full with his sister</strong></span>, or his arms, rather; while Buck was too near dead to be of further use in hauling the sled. A few minutes later they pulled out from the bank and down the river. Buck heard them go and raised his head to see, Pike was leading, Sol-leks was at the wheel, and between were Joe and Teek. They were limping and staggering. Mercedes was riding the loaded sled. Hal guided at the gee-pole, and Charles stumbled along in the rear.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As Buck watched them, Thornton knelt beside him and with rough, kindly hands searched for broken bones. By the time his search had disclosed nothing more than many bruises and a state of terrible starvation, the sled was a quarter of a mile away. Dog and man watched it crawling along over the ice. Suddenly, they saw its back end drop down, as into a rut, and the gee-pole, with Hal clinging to it, jerk into the air. Mercedes’s scream came to their ears. They saw Charles turn and make one step to run back, and then a whole section of ice give way and dogs and humans disappear. A yawning hole was all that was to be seen. The bottom had dropped out of the trail.</p>
        <p>John Thornton and Buck looked at each other.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“You poor devil,” said John Thornton, and Buck licked his hand.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When John Thornton froze his feet in the previous December his partners had made him comfortable and left him to get well, going on themselves up the river to get out a raft of saw-logs for Dawson. He was still limping slightly at the time he rescued Buck, but with the continued warm weather even the slight limp left him. And here, lying by the river bank through the long spring days, watching the running water, listening lazily to the songs of birds and the hum of nature, Buck slowly won back his strength.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A rest comes very good after one has travelled three thousand miles, and it must be confessed that Buck waxed lazy as his wounds healed, his muscles swelled out, and the flesh came back to cover his bones. For that matter, they were all loafing,—Buck, John Thornton, and Skeet and Nig,—waiting for the raft to come that was to carry them down to Dawson. Skeet was a little Irish setter who early made friends with Buck, who, in a dying condition, was unable to resent her first advances. She had the doctor trait which some dogs possess; and as a mother cat washes her kittens, so she washed and cleansed Buck’s wounds. Regularly, each morning after he had finished his breakfast, she performed her self-appointed task, till he came to look for her ministrations as much as he did for Thornton’s. Nig, equally friendly, though less demonstrative, was a huge black dog, half bloodhound and half deerhound, with eyes that laughed and a boundless good nature.</p>

And then, suddenly, without warning, uttering a cry that was inarticulate and more like the cry of an animal, John Thornton sprang upon the man who wielded the club. Hal was hurled backward, as though struck by a falling tree. Mercedes screamed. Charles looked on wistfully, wiped his watery eyes, but did not get up because of his stiffness.</p>
        <p>John Thornton stood over Buck, struggling to control himself, oo convulsed with rage to speak.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“If you strike that dog again, I’ll kill you,” he at last managed to say in a choking voice.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“It’s my dog,” Hal replied, wiping the blood from his mouth as he came back. “Get out of my way, or I’ll fix you. I’m going to Dawson.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Thornton stood between him and Buck, and evinced no intention of getting out of the way. Hal drew his long hunting-knife. Mercedes screamed, cried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria. Thornton rapped Hal’s knuckles with the axe-handle, knocking the knife to the ground. He rapped his knuckles again as he tried to pick it up. Then he stooped, picked it up himself, and with two strokes cut Buck’s traces.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Hal had no fight left in him. Besides, <span class="txt-underline"><strong>his hands were full with his sister</strong></span>, or his arms, rather; while Buck was too near dead to be of further use in hauling the sled. A few minutes later they pulled out from the bank and down the river. Buck heard them go and raised his head to see, Pike was leading, Sol-leks was at the wheel, and between were Joe and Teek. They were limping and staggering. Mercedes was riding the loaded sled. Hal guided at the gee-pole, and Charles stumbled along in the rear.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As Buck watched them, Thornton knelt beside him and with rough, kindly hands searched for broken bones. By the time his search had disclosed nothing more than many bruises and a state of terrible starvation, the sled was a quarter of a mile away. Dog and man watched it crawling along over the ice. Suddenly, they saw its back end drop down, as into a rut, and the gee-pole, with Hal clinging to it, jerk into the air. Mercedes’s scream came to their ears. They saw Charles turn and make one step to run back, and then a whole section of ice give way and dogs and humans disappear. A yawning hole was all that was to be seen. The bottom had dropped out of the trail.</p>
        <p>John Thornton and Buck looked at each other.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“You poor devil,” said John Thornton, and Buck licked his hand.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When John Thornton froze his feet in the previous December his partners had made him comfortable and left him to get well, going on themselves up the river to get out a raft of saw-logs for Dawson. He was still limping slightly at the time he rescued Buck, but with the continued warm weather even the slight limp left him. And here, lying by the river bank through the long spring days, watching the running water, listening lazily to the songs of birds and the hum of nature, Buck slowly won back his strength.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A rest comes very good after one has travelled three thousand miles, and it must be confessed that Buck waxed lazy as his wounds healed, his muscles swelled out, and the flesh came back to cover his bones. For that matter, they were all loafing,—Buck, John Thornton, and Skeet and Nig,—waiting for the raft to come that was to carry them down to Dawson. Skeet was a little Irish setter who early made friends with Buck, who, in a dying condition, was unable to resent her first advances. She had the doctor trait which some dogs possess; and as a mother cat washes her kittens, so she washed and cleansed Buck’s wounds. Regularly, each morning after he had finished his breakfast, she performed her self-appointed task, till he came to look for her ministrations as much as he did for Thornton’s. Nig, equally friendly, though less demonstrative, was a huge black dog, half bloodhound and half deerhound, with eyes that laughed and a boundless good nature.</p>

And then, suddenly, without warning, uttering a cry that was inarticulate and more like the cry of an animal, John Thornton sprang upon the man who wielded the club. Hal was hurled backward, as though struck by a falling tree. Mercedes screamed. Charles looked on wistfully, wiped his watery eyes, but did not get up because of his stiffness.</p>
        <p>John Thornton stood over Buck, struggling to control himself, oo convulsed with rage to speak.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“If you strike that dog again, I’ll kill you,” he at last managed to say in a choking voice.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“It’s my dog,” Hal replied, wiping the blood from his mouth as he came back. “Get out of my way, or I’ll fix you. I’m going to Dawson.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Thornton stood between him and Buck, and evinced no intention of getting out of the way. Hal drew his long hunting-knife. Mercedes screamed, cried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria. Thornton rapped Hal’s knuckles with the axe-handle, knocking the knife to the ground. He rapped his knuckles again as he tried to pick it up. Then he stooped, picked it up himself, and with two strokes cut Buck’s traces.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Hal had no fight left in him. Besides, <span class="txt-underline"><strong>his hands were full with his sister</strong></span>, or his arms, rather; while Buck was too near dead to be of further use in hauling the sled. A few minutes later they pulled out from the bank and down the river. Buck heard them go and raised his head to see, Pike was leading, Sol-leks was at the wheel, and between were Joe and Teek. They were limping and staggering. Mercedes was riding the loaded sled. Hal guided at the gee-pole, and Charles stumbled along in the rear.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As Buck watched them, Thornton knelt beside him and with rough, kindly hands searched for broken bones. By the time his search had disclosed nothing more than many bruises and a state of terrible starvation, the sled was a quarter of a mile away. Dog and man watched it crawling along over the ice. Suddenly, they saw its back end drop down, as into a rut, and the gee-pole, with Hal clinging to it, jerk into the air. Mercedes’s scream came to their ears. They saw Charles turn and make one step to run back, and then a whole section of ice give way and dogs and humans disappear. A yawning hole was all that was to be seen. The bottom had dropped out of the trail.</p>
        <p>John Thornton and Buck looked at each other.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“You poor devil,” said John Thornton, and Buck licked his hand.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When John Thornton froze his feet in the previous December his partners had made him comfortable and left him to get well, going on themselves up the river to get out a raft of saw-logs for Dawson. He was still limping slightly at the time he rescued Buck, but with the continued warm weather even the slight limp left him. And here, lying by the river bank through the long spring days, watching the running water, listening lazily to the songs of birds and the hum of nature, Buck slowly won back his strength.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A rest comes very good after one has travelled three thousand miles, and it must be confessed that Buck waxed lazy as his wounds healed, his muscles swelled out, and the flesh came back to cover his bones. For that matter, they were all loafing,—Buck, John Thornton, and Skeet and Nig,—waiting for the raft to come that was to carry them down to Dawson. Skeet was a little Irish setter who early made friends with Buck, who, in a dying condition, was unable to resent her first advances. She had the doctor trait which some dogs possess; and as a mother cat washes her kittens, so she washed and cleansed Buck’s wounds. Regularly, each morning after he had finished his breakfast, she performed her self-appointed task, till he came to look for her ministrations as much as he did for Thornton’s. Nig, equally friendly, though less demonstrative, was a huge black dog, half bloodhound and half deerhound, with eyes that laughed and a boundless good nature.</p>

Across the lonely beach we flit,<br>
One little sandpiper and I,<br>
And fast I gather, but by bit,<br>
The scattered driftwood bleached and dry.<br>
The wild waves reach their hands for it,<br>
The wild wind raves, the tide runs high,<br>
As up and down the beach we flit,<br>
One little sandpiper and I.</p>
        <p>Above our heads the sullen clouds<br>
Scud, black and swift, across the sky:<br>
Like silent ghosts in misty shrouds<br>
Stand out the white light-houses high.<br>
Almost as far as eye can reach<br>
I see the close-reefed vessels fly,<br>
As fast we flit along the beach,<br>
One little sandpiper and I.</p>
        <p>I watch him as he skims along,<br>
Uttering his sweet and mournful cry;<br>
He starts not at my fitful song,<br>
Nor flash of fluttering drapery.<br>
He has no thought of any wrong,<br>
He scans me with a fearless eye;<br>
Stanch friends are we, well tried and strong,<br>
The little sandpiper and I.<br>
Comrade, where wilt thou be to-night,<br>
When the loosed storm breaks furiously?<br>
My drift-wood fire will burn so bright!<br>
To what warm shelter canst thou fly?<br>
I do not fear for thee, though wroth<br>
The tempest rushes through the sky;<br>
For are we not God’s children both,<br>
Thou, little sandpiper, and I?</p>

Across the lonely beach we flit,<br>
One little sandpiper and I,<br>
And fast I gather, but by bit,<br>
The scattered driftwood bleached and dry.<br>
The wild waves reach their hands for it,<br>
The wild wind raves, the tide runs high,<br>
As up and down the beach we flit,<br>
One little sandpiper and I.</p>
        <p>Above our heads the sullen clouds<br>
Scud, black and swift, across the sky:<br>
Like silent ghosts in misty shrouds<br>
Stand out the white light-houses high.<br>
Almost as far as eye can reach<br>
I see the close-reefed vessels fly,<br>
As fast we flit along the beach,<br>
One little sandpiper and I.</p>
        <p>I watch him as he skims along,<br>
Uttering his sweet and mournful cry;<br>
He starts not at my fitful song,<br>
Nor flash of fluttering drapery.<br>
He has no thought of any wrong,<br>
He scans me with a fearless eye;<br>
Stanch friends are we, well tried and strong,<br>
The little sandpiper and I.<br>
Comrade, where wilt thou be to-night,<br>
When the loosed storm breaks furiously?<br>
My drift-wood fire will burn so bright!<br>
To what warm shelter canst thou fly?<br>
I do not fear for thee, though wroth<br>
The tempest rushes through the sky;<br>
For are we not God’s children both,<br>
Thou, little sandpiper, and I?</p>

Comrade, where wilt thou be to-night,<br>
When the loosed storm breaks furiously?<br>
My drift-wood fire will burn so bright!<br>
To what warm shelter canst thou fly?<br>
I do not fear for thee, though wroth<br>
The tempest rushes through the sky;<br>
For are we not God’s children both,<br>
Thou, little sandpiper, and I?</p>

Nuclear energy is derived from the nucleus of atoms through two primary processes: nuclear fusion, where atomic nuclei are fused together, and nuclear fission, where nuclei are split apart. In nuclear power plants, the latter process is employed to generate electricity, particularly using the radioactive element uranium. Uranium, formed when the Earth was created, is a naturally occurring but non-renewable resource found in various rocks. <strong>(A)</strong>&nbsp;……………&nbsp; By splitting uranium atoms, substantial amounts of energy are released, which is harnessed to produce electricity, underscoring the importance of nuclear energy in the global power landscape.</p>
        <p>Nuclear reactors are central to the functioning of nuclear power plants. These reactors manage nuclear chain reactions to produce heat through fission. <strong>(B)&nbsp;</strong>.……………&nbsp; With over 400 reactors worldwide, including 93 in the United States, nuclear energy remains a significant source of reliable and carbon-free electricity. The reactors utilize uranium fuel, which is processed into ceramic pellets and enclosed in metal tubes called fuel rods. These rods are grouped into fuel assemblies within the reactor core, where they interact to sustain the fission process, generating the heat needed for electricity production.</p>
        <p>The operational mechanisms of nuclear reactors involve intricate systems designed to manage the fission process safely and efficiently. Fuel rods within the reactor vessel are immersed in water, which serves as both a coolant and a moderator to control the reaction rate. <strong>(C)</strong> ……………&nbsp; The heat generated by fission converts water into steam, which drives turbines to produce electricity. This method ensures a steady supply of carbon-free energy, highlighting the efficiency and environmental benefits of nuclear power.</p>
        <p>In the United States, all commercial nuclear reactors are light-water reactors, which use normal water as a coolant and neutron moderator. There are two main types: pressurized-water reactors (PWRs) and boiling water reactors (BWRs). PWRs, making up over 65% of U.S. reactors, maintain water under high pressure to prevent boiling within the reactor core. The heated water is circulated through a heat exchanger to create steam from a secondary water source, which then drives turbines. BWRs, comprising about a third of U.S. reactors, produce steam directly within the reactor vessel, which is then used to generate electricity. <strong>(D)&nbsp;</strong>.……………&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The debate over nuclear energy continues in various parts of the world, including Australia. Sixteen-year-old William Shackel is actively campaigning to lift Australia’s ban on nuclear energy, arguing it is a cleaner and more efficient alternative to coal amidst the current energy and climate crisis. Shackel’s campaign, Nuclear For Australia, aims to promote nuclear energy as a viable solution for the country’s energy needs. <strong>(E)</strong> ……………&nbsp; Despite Australia’s ban on nuclear power since 1998, proponents like Shackel see a significant opportunity for change.</p>
        <p>Historical incidents like the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 have left a lasting impact on public perception of nuclear energy. The catastrophic explosion and meltdown at the Chernobyl Power Station in Ukraine resulted in severe radioactive fallout, affecting countless lives and leading to a long-standing exclusion zone around the site. A protective shelter now covers the reactor to prevent further radiation leakage. The incident remains a stark reminder of the risks associated with nuclear power. <strong>(F)</strong> ……………&nbsp; Despite these concerns, advancements in reactor technology and safety measures continue to shape the future of nuclear energy as a critical component of the global energy mix.</p>

A stream forms when water collects from an area and gradually flows downhill in a continuous motion. As streams connect, they gradually grow larger and at some point, become large enough to be called a river. Rivers are important habitats for many water-dependent animals and plants, such as fish, waterbirds, frogs, turtles, and platypuses. Rivers allow water to flow and connect with habitats such as wetlands, pools, lagoons, swamps, and floodplain pools. Rivers can be connected to groundwater, both receiving water from underground and helping to replenish groundwater aquifers. Rivers and streams are vital sources of water for both humans and the environment. Many plants and animals rely on healthy rivers for habitat, food, and breeding, making it crucial that we manage water resources in a way that supports them. Rivers and streams are also an important part of First Nations culture. First Nations people rely on river water to carry out cultural traditions such as fishing, hunting, ceremonies, and to maintain a connection to Country.<br>

River calculations have confirmed that Australia’s longest single river is the River Murray at 2,508 kilometres. However, if the longest tributaries of the Darling River, the Culgoa, Balonne and Condamine, are taken into account, its total length increases to 2,740 kilometres, making it Australia’s longest waterway. Almost 2,000 km is navigable, making it the third longest navigable river on the planet, with only the Amazon and Nile rivers ahead of it. The Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) spans more than 1 million square kilometres, making up a whopping 14 per cent of the total area of Australia. The MDB produces 54 per cent of Australia’s apples and 95 per cent of its oranges. The River Murray provides water to about 1.5 million households, as well as farms and other businesses along its length. It also has its own flag. While the actual origins of the flag are a bit murky, it’s been in use since the 1850s. These days, three different versions of the flag are used by businesses and paddle steamers at various points along the river.<br>

In the USA, steamboats played a major role in the 19th-century development of the Mississippi River and its tributaries, facilitating the large-scale transport of passengers and freight both up and down the river. Using steam power, riverboats were developed during that time, which could navigate in shallow waters as well as upriver against strong currents. After the development of railroads, passenger traffic gradually switched to this faster form of transportation, but steamboats continued to serve Mississippi River commerce into the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. A small number of steamboats are still used for tourist excursions in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.&nbsp;<br>

I read an interesting article not long ago about fish that swim upstream. The main reason salmon, for example, swim upstream is to ensure the survival of their offspring. Salmon are born in freshwater rivers, spend most of their adult lives in the ocean, and then return to the place they were born to lay their eggs. As young salmon hatch in their home stream, they learn the smell of it. As they migrate downstream and into the ocean, they may memorise certain scents along the way. But even after being away for many years, when the salmon return to their birthplace as adults, they will use those smells to ‘test the waters’ and find their home stream. Some studies have shown that salmon use the Earth’s magnetic field to guide their migration. Salmon swim upstream to ensure the survival of their offspring. Similarly, in leadership, there will be times, more often than not, when you will need to swim upstream for your survival and success. This will be difficult, but you have to swim upstream to grow. Only dead fish go with the flow. If you want to succeed, you have to fight the currents of negativity and conformity.&nbsp;<br>

And then, suddenly, without warning, uttering a cry that was inarticulate and more like the cry of an animal, John Thornton sprang upon the man who wielded the club. Hal was hurled backward, as though struck by a falling tree. Mercedes screamed. Charles looked on wistfully, wiped his watery eyes, but did not get up because of his stiffness.</p>
        <p>John Thornton stood over Buck, struggling to control himself, oo convulsed with rage to speak.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“If you strike that dog again, I’ll kill you,” he at last managed to say in a choking voice.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“It’s my dog,” Hal replied, wiping the blood from his mouth as he came back. “Get out of my way, or I’ll fix you. I’m going to Dawson.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Thornton stood between him and Buck, and evinced no intention of getting out of the way. Hal drew his long hunting-knife. Mercedes screamed, cried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria. Thornton rapped Hal’s knuckles with the axe-handle, knocking the knife to the ground. He rapped his knuckles again as he tried to pick it up. Then he stooped, picked it up himself, and with two strokes cut Buck’s traces.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Hal had no fight left in him. Besides, <span class="txt-underline"><strong>his hands were full with his sister</strong></span>, or his arms, rather; while Buck was too near dead to be of further use in hauling the sled. A few minutes later they pulled out from the bank and down the river. Buck heard them go and raised his head to see, Pike was leading, Sol-leks was at the wheel, and between were Joe and Teek. They were limping and staggering. Mercedes was riding the loaded sled. Hal guided at the gee-pole, and Charles stumbled along in the rear.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As Buck watched them, Thornton knelt beside him and with rough, kindly hands searched for broken bones. By the time his search had disclosed nothing more than many bruises and a state of terrible starvation, the sled was a quarter of a mile away. Dog and man watched it crawling along over the ice. Suddenly, they saw its back end drop down, as into a rut, and the gee-pole, with Hal clinging to it, jerk into the air. Mercedes’s scream came to their ears. They saw Charles turn and make one step to run back, and then a whole section of ice give way and dogs and humans disappear. A yawning hole was all that was to be seen. The bottom had dropped out of the trail.</p>
        <p>John Thornton and Buck looked at each other.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“You poor devil,” said John Thornton, and Buck licked his hand.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When John Thornton froze his feet in the previous December his partners had made him comfortable and left him to get well, going on themselves up the river to get out a raft of saw-logs for Dawson. He was still limping slightly at the time he rescued Buck, but with the continued warm weather even the slight limp left him. And here, lying by the river bank through the long spring days, watching the running water, listening lazily to the songs of birds and the hum of nature, Buck slowly won back his strength.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A rest comes very good after one has travelled three thousand miles, and it must be confessed that Buck waxed lazy as his wounds healed, his muscles swelled out, and the flesh came back to cover his bones. For that matter, they were all loafing,—Buck, John Thornton, and Skeet and Nig,—waiting for the raft to come that was to carry them down to Dawson. Skeet was a little Irish setter who early made friends with Buck, who, in a dying condition, was unable to resent her first advances. She had the doctor trait which some dogs possess; and as a mother cat washes her kittens, so she washed and cleansed Buck’s wounds. Regularly, each morning after he had finished his breakfast, she performed her self-appointed task, till he came to look for her ministrations as much as he did for Thornton’s. Nig, equally friendly, though less demonstrative, was a huge black dog, half bloodhound and half deerhound, with eyes that laughed and a boundless good nature.</p>
