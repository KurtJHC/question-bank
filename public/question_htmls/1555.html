          <strong>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</strong>
        </p>
        <p>by Mark Twain</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I had shut the door too. Then I turned around and there he was. I used to be scared of him all the time, he tanned me so much. I reckoned I was scared now, too; but in a minute I see I was mistaken—that is, after the first jolt, as you may say, when my breath sort of hitched, he being so unexpected; but right away after I see I warn’t scared of him worth bothering about.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; He was most fifty, and he looked it. His hair was long and tangled and greasy, and hung down, and you could see his eyes shining through like he was behind vines. It was all black, no gray; so was his long, mixed-up whiskers. There warn’t no colour in his face, where his face showed; it was white; not like another man’s white, but a white to make a body sick, a white to make a body’s flesh crawl—a tree-toad white, a fish-belly white. As for his clothes— just rags, that was all. He had one ankle resting on t’other knee; the boot on that foot was busted, and two of his toes stuck through, and he worked them now and then. His hat was laying on the floor—an old black slouch with the top caved in, like a lid.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I stood a-looking at him; he set there a-looking at me, with his chair tilted back a little. I set the candle down. I noticed the window was up; so he had clumb in by the shed. He kept a-looking me all over. By and by he says:</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; “Starchy clothes—very. You think you’re a good deal of a big-bug, don’t you?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; “Maybe I am, maybe I ain’t,” I says.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Don’t you give me none o’ your lip,” says he. “You’ve put on considerable many frills since I been away. I’ll take you down a peg before I get done with you. You’re educated, too, they say—can read and write. You think you’re better’n your father, now, don’t you, because he can’t? I’ll take it out of you. Who told you you might meddle with such hifalut’n foolishness, hey?—who told you you could?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; “The widow Douglas. She told me.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; “The widow, hey?—and who told the widow she could put in her shovel about a thing that ain’t none of her business?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; “Nobody never told her.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; “Well, I’ll learn her how to meddle. And looky here—you drop that school, you hear? I’ll learn people to bring up a boy to put on airs over his own father and let on to be better’n what he is. You lemme catch you fooling around that school again, you hear? Your mother couldn’t read, and she couldn’t write, nuther, before she died. None of the family couldn’t before they died. I can’t; and here you’re a-swelling yourself up like this. I ain’t the man to stand it—you hear? Say, lemme hear you read.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I took up a book and begun something about General Washington and the wars. When I’d read about a half a minute, he fetched the book a whack with his hand and knocked it across the house. He says:</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s so. You can do it. I had my doubts when you told me. Now looky here; you stop that putting on frills. I won’t have it. I’ll lay for you, my smarty; and if I catch you about that school I’ll tan you good. First you know you’ll get religion, too. I never see such a son.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and a boy, and says:</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“What’s this?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s something they give me for learning my lessons good.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He tore it up, and says:</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“I’ll give you something better—I’ll give you a cowhide.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He set there a-mumbling and a-growling a minute, and then he says:</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Ain’t you a sweet-scented dandy, though? A bed; and bedclothes; and a look’n’-glass; and a piece of carpet on the floor—and your own father got to sleep with the hogs in the tanyard. I never see such a son. I bet I’ll take some o’ these frills out o’ you before I’m done with you. Why, there ain’t no end to your airs—they say you’re rich. Hey?—how’s that?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“They lie—that’s how.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Looky here—mind how you talk to me; I’m a-standing about all I can stand now—so don’t gimme no sass. I’ve been in town two days, and I hain’t heard nothing but about you bein’ rich. I heard about it away down the river, too. That’s why I come. You git me that money to-morrow—I want it.”</p>

<strong>Sea-Fever</strong><br>
<br>
I must go down to the seas again, <strong><span class="txt-underline">to the lonely sea and the sky</span></strong>,<br>
And all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by,<br>
And the wheel's kick and the wind's song and the white sail's shaking,<br>
And a grey mist on the sea's face, and a gray dawn breaking.<br>
<br>
I must go down to the seas again, for the call of the running tide<br>
Is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied;<br>
And all I ask is a windy day with the white clouds flying,<br>
And the flung spray and the blown spume, and the sea-gulls crying.<br>
<br>
I must go down to the seas again, to the vagrant gypsy life,<br>
To the gull's way and the whale's way where t<strong><span class="txt-underline">he wind's like a whetted knife</span></strong>;<br>
And all I ask is a merry yarn from a laughing fellow-rover<br>
And quiet sleep and a sweet dream when the long trick's over.</div>

          <strong>Mt Vesuvius</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mount Vesuvius is an active volcano in southern Italy. Rising above the Bay of Naples, the volcano is situated on the plain of Campania, about 11 kilometres from the city of Naples. Its fiery eruptions have claimed a high toll in lives and property through the centuries. <strong>15 ..........</strong> There are industrial towns along the bay, and small agricultural centres thrive on the northern slopes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mount Vesuvius stands about 1,280 metres high, but its height changes after each major eruption. The mountain originated some 200,000 years ago and for a time had only one peak. Now a high, semicircular ridge known as Mount Somma partly surrounds the main cone of Vesuvius and has a slope of its own, beginning at about 600 metres and climbing to 1,132 metres. The area between the ridge and the cone is known as Valle del Gigante, or Giant’s Valley. <strong>16 ..........</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Volcanic ash has made the soil of Vesuvius very fertile, and the lower slopes are covered with vineyards and orchards. Up the mountain from the farmlands, the volcano’s slopes are cloaked with thickets of oak and chestnut trees. <strong>17 ..........</strong> However, on the higher western side the chestnut groves give way to small shrubs on plateau areas at an altitude of 610 metres. Still higher, the surface of the great cone is almost bare.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>18 ..........</strong> Readings far above 540 °C are common. Rising temperatures are one indicator of forthcoming eruptions.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The most famous eruption of Vesuvius occurred in AD 79, when lava and ashes buried the towns of Pompeii, Herculaneum, and Stabiae. Excavations have uncovered parts of the cities. Since that disaster, nearly 50 eruptions of varying intensity have been reported. An eruption in 1631 buried villages and blew ashes as far as 240 kilometres. <strong>19 ..........</strong> More than 3,000 were killed. Another great upheaval in 1794 destroyed the village of Torre del Greco for the fourth time.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>20 .......... </strong>In this type of eruption, large volumes of gases boil out of gas-rich magma and generate enormous, nearly continuous jetting blasts. The blasts rip apart the core of the magma column. The volcano’s fierce turbulence has caused many changes in the mountain’s shape and height. In 1906, an eruption killed hundreds of people and reduced the volcano’s height by several hundred feet. In 1944, another powerful surge raised the height by about 150 metres and widened the top crater threefold to its present width.</p>

          <strong>Mt Vesuvius</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mount Vesuvius is an active volcano in southern Italy. Rising above the Bay of Naples, the volcano is situated on the plain of Campania, about 11 kilometres from the city of Naples. Its fiery eruptions have claimed a high toll in lives and property through the centuries. <strong>15 ..........</strong> There are industrial towns along the bay, and small agricultural centres thrive on the northern slopes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mount Vesuvius stands about 1,280 metres high, but its height changes after each major eruption. The mountain originated some 200,000 years ago and for a time had only one peak. Now a high, semicircular ridge known as Mount Somma partly surrounds the main cone of Vesuvius and has a slope of its own, beginning at about 600 metres and climbing to 1,132 metres. The area between the ridge and the cone is known as Valle del Gigante, or Giant’s Valley. <strong>16 ..........</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Volcanic ash has made the soil of Vesuvius very fertile, and the lower slopes are covered with vineyards and orchards. Up the mountain from the farmlands, the volcano’s slopes are cloaked with thickets of oak and chestnut trees. <strong>17 ..........</strong> However, on the higher western side the chestnut groves give way to small shrubs on plateau areas at an altitude of 610 metres. Still higher, the surface of the great cone is almost bare.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>18 ..........</strong> Readings far above 540 °C are common. Rising temperatures are one indicator of forthcoming eruptions.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The most famous eruption of Vesuvius occurred in AD 79, when lava and ashes buried the towns of Pompeii, Herculaneum, and Stabiae. Excavations have uncovered parts of the cities. Since that disaster, nearly 50 eruptions of varying intensity have been reported. An eruption in 1631 buried villages and blew ashes as far as 240 kilometres. <strong>19 ..........</strong> More than 3,000 were killed. Another great upheaval in 1794 destroyed the village of Torre del Greco for the fourth time.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>20 .......... </strong>In this type of eruption, large volumes of gases boil out of gas-rich magma and generate enormous, nearly continuous jetting blasts. The blasts rip apart the core of the magma column. The volcano’s fierce turbulence has caused many changes in the mountain’s shape and height. In 1906, an eruption killed hundreds of people and reduced the volcano’s height by several hundred feet. In 1944, another powerful surge raised the height by about 150 metres and widened the top crater threefold to its present width.</p>

          <strong>Mt Vesuvius</strong>

Now a high, semicircular ridge known as Mount Somma partly surrounds the main cone of Vesuvius and has a slope of its own, beginning at about 600 metres and climbing to 1,132 metres.

          <strong>Mt Vesuvius</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mount Vesuvius is an active volcano in southern Italy. Rising above the Bay of Naples, the volcano is situated on the plain of Campania, about 11 kilometres from the city of Naples. Its fiery eruptions have claimed a high toll in lives and property through the centuries. <strong>15 ..........</strong> There are industrial towns along the bay, and small agricultural centres thrive on the northern slopes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mount Vesuvius stands about 1,280 metres high, but its height changes after each major eruption. The mountain originated some 200,000 years ago and for a time had only one peak. Now a high, semicircular ridge known as Mount Somma partly surrounds the main cone of Vesuvius and has a slope of its own, beginning at about 600 metres and climbing to 1,132 metres. The area between the ridge and the cone is known as Valle del Gigante, or Giant’s Valley. <strong>16 ..........</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Volcanic ash has made the soil of Vesuvius very fertile, and the lower slopes are covered with vineyards and orchards. Up the mountain from the farmlands, the volcano’s slopes are cloaked with thickets of oak and chestnut trees. <strong>17 ..........</strong> However, on the higher western side the chestnut groves give way to small shrubs on plateau areas at an altitude of 610 metres. Still higher, the surface of the great cone is almost bare.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>18 ..........</strong> Readings far above 540 °C are common. Rising temperatures are one indicator of forthcoming eruptions.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The most famous eruption of Vesuvius occurred in AD 79, when lava and ashes buried the towns of Pompeii, Herculaneum, and Stabiae. Excavations have uncovered parts of the cities. Since that disaster, nearly 50 eruptions of varying intensity have been reported. An eruption in 1631 buried villages and blew ashes as far as 240 kilometres. <strong>19 ..........</strong> More than 3,000 were killed. Another great upheaval in 1794 destroyed the village of Torre del Greco for the fourth time.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>20 .......... </strong>In this type of eruption, large volumes of gases boil out of gas-rich magma and generate enormous, nearly continuous jetting blasts. The blasts rip apart the core of the magma column. The volcano’s fierce turbulence has caused many changes in the mountain’s shape and height. In 1906, an eruption killed hundreds of people and reduced the volcano’s height by several hundred feet. In 1944, another powerful surge raised the height by about 150 metres and widened the top crater threefold to its present width.</p>

          <strong>Mt Vesuvius</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mount Vesuvius is an active volcano in southern Italy. Rising above the Bay of Naples, the volcano is situated on the plain of Campania, about 11 kilometres from the city of Naples.

        <p>Mount Vesuvius stands about 1,280 metres high, but its height changes after each major eruption. The mountain originated some 200,000 years ago and for a time had only one peak. Now a high, semicircular ridge known as Mount Somma partly surrounds the main cone of Vesuvius and has a slope of its own, beginning at about 600 metres and climbing to 1,132 metres. The area between the ridge and the cone is known as Valle del Gigante, or Giant’s Valley. <strong>16 ..........</strong></p>

          <strong>Mt Vesuvius</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mount Vesuvius is an active volcano in southern Italy. Rising above the Bay of Naples, the volcano is situated on the plain of Campania, about 11 kilometres from the city of Naples. Its fiery eruptions have claimed a high toll in lives and property through the centuries. <strong>15 ..........</strong> There are industrial towns along the bay, and small agricultural centres thrive on the northern slopes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mount Vesuvius stands about 1,280 metres high, but its height changes after each major eruption. The mountain originated some 200,000 years ago and for a time had only one peak. Now a high, semicircular ridge known as Mount Somma partly surrounds the main cone of Vesuvius and has a slope of its own, beginning at about 600 metres and climbing to 1,132 metres. The area between the ridge and the cone is known as Valle del Gigante, or Giant’s Valley. <strong>16 ..........</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Volcanic ash has made the soil of Vesuvius very fertile, and the lower slopes are covered with vineyards and orchards. Up the mountain from the farmlands, the volcano’s slopes are cloaked with thickets of oak and chestnut trees. <strong>17 ..........</strong> However, on the higher western side the chestnut groves give way to small shrubs on plateau areas at an altitude of 610 metres. Still higher, the surface of the great cone is almost bare.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>18 ..........</strong> Readings far above 540 °C are common. Rising temperatures are one indicator of forthcoming eruptions.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The most famous eruption of Vesuvius occurred in AD 79, when lava and ashes buried the towns of Pompeii, Herculaneum, and Stabiae. Excavations have uncovered parts of the cities. Since that disaster, nearly 50 eruptions of varying intensity have been reported. An eruption in 1631 buried villages and blew ashes as far as 240 kilometres. <strong>19 ..........</strong> More than 3,000 were killed. Another great upheaval in 1794 destroyed the village of Torre del Greco for the fourth time.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>20 .......... </strong>In this type of eruption, large volumes of gases boil out of gas-rich magma and generate enormous, nearly continuous jetting blasts. The blasts rip apart the core of the magma column. The volcano’s fierce turbulence has caused many changes in the mountain’s shape and height. In 1906, an eruption killed hundreds of people and reduced the volcano’s height by several hundred feet. In 1944, another powerful surge raised the height by about 150 metres and widened the top crater threefold to its present width.</p>

Skull Island is a fictional island located in the south Pacific Ocean west of Indonesia and is the home of King Kong in the original 1933 King Kong, its 1976 and 2005 remakes, and the 2017 film Kong: Skull Island. Film producer, Carl Denham received a strange map marking the location of a mysterious uncharted island located west of Indonesia.<br>
<br>
Determined to explore the island and shoot his next picture there, Denham assembled a film crew and left for the island from New York on board the Venture. After months of sea travel, the Venture came upon the island, which was shrouded in fog and marked by a gigantic mountain on the centre of the island shaped like a human skull. Denham and his crew came ashore on the island and discovered a massive wall surrounding a native village. The crew entered the village and witnessed the natives performing a ritual, preparing to sacrifice a woman to their god, "Kong". The native chief, after seeing Denham's leading lady Ann Darrow, offered to trade several of his tribe's women for her.<br>
<br>
Denham refused, angering the natives. The crew returned to the Venture, which was anchored off the coast of the island. During the night, a group of natives used canoes to approach the ship and abduct Ann. The natives brought Ann back to their village and tied her onto a pedestal located outside of the wall. Eventually, a gigantic gorilla, the natives' god Kong, emerged from the jungle and grabbed Ann, carrying her off back into the jungle.<br>

Atlantis is a legendary island in the Atlantic Ocean, lying west of the Strait of Gibraltar. The principal sources for the legend are two of ancient Greek, Plato’s writings, <em>Timaeus</em> and <em>Critias</em>. In the former, Plato describes how Egyptian priests, in conversation with the Athenian lawgiver Solon, described Atlantis as an island larger than Asia Minor and Libya combined, and situated just beyond the Pillars of Hercules (the Strait of Gibraltar). About 9,000 years before the birth of Solon, the priests said, Atlantis was a rich island whose powerful princes conquered many of the lands of the Mediterranean until they were finally defeated by the Athenians and the latter’s allies. The Atlantians eventually became wicked and impious, and their island was swallowed up by the sea, as a result of earthquakes.<br>

The novel, ‘Island of Adventure’ was written by the famous author, Enid Blyton. Philip and Dinah Mannering and their new friends Jack and Lucy-Ann Trent — along with Jack's irrepressible talking parrot, Kiki — are spending their summer holiday at Craggy-Tops, an ancient, half-ruined house by the sea. Before long, they are drawn to the mysterious Isle of Gloom in the distance and are determined to find a way to get there and explore it. But gradually it becomes apparent that the island may not be as deserted as it's supposed to be. Who is signaling from the island to the mainland at night? What is going on in the abandoned copper mines beneath the island? And what does the friendly, yet enigmatic Bill Smugs know about it all? The four children find themselves caught up in an adventure more thrilling — and dangerous — than they could have imagined.<br>

There are a handful of places around the world that are largely untouched or uninhabited. Unexplored areas around the world also include small islands, such as Pitcairn Island off of New Zealand, and Palmerston Island in the South Pacific. Pitcairn Island is located 3,300 miles from New Zealand, and no plane or helicopter has ever landed there. It requires a hefty 32-hour yacht ride to get to the remote island of Pitcairn from Auckland, New Zealand, and apparently, no plane or helicopter has ever landed there. The island is known as a British Overseas Territory, and its government is situated in New Zealand. It's also considered to be one of the least-populated territories in the world, with about 50 residents in 2018. A photographer who has visited the island previously told Insider that when Pitcairn's inhabitants need medical attention, they must go to New Zealand or Fiji, and sometimes are unable to return to Pitcairn for weeks or even months.<br>

Skull Island is a fictional island located in the south Pacific Ocean west of Indonesia and is the home of King Kong in the original 1933 King Kong, its 1976 and 2005 remakes, and the 2017 film Kong: Skull Island. Film producer, Carl Denham received a strange map marking the location of a mysterious uncharted island located west of Indonesia.<br>
<br>
Determined to explore the island and shoot his next picture there, Denham assembled a film crew and left for the island from New York on board the Venture. After months of sea travel, the Venture came upon the island, which was shrouded in fog and marked by a gigantic mountain on the centre of the island shaped like a human skull. Denham and his crew came ashore on the island and discovered a massive wall surrounding a native village. The crew entered the village and witnessed the natives performing a ritual, preparing to sacrifice a woman to their god, "Kong". The native chief, after seeing Denham's leading lady Ann Darrow, offered to trade several of his tribe's women for her.<br>
<br>
Denham refused, angering the natives. The crew returned to the Venture, which was anchored off the coast of the island. During the night, a group of natives used canoes to approach the ship and abduct Ann. The natives brought Ann back to their village and tied her onto a pedestal located outside of the wall. Eventually, a gigantic gorilla, the natives' god Kong, emerged from the jungle and grabbed Ann, carrying her off back into the jungle.<br>

Atlantis is a legendary island in the Atlantic Ocean, lying west of the Strait of Gibraltar. The principal sources for the legend are two of ancient Greek, Plato’s writings,&nbsp;Timaeus&nbsp;and&nbsp;Critias. In the former, Plato describes how Egyptian priests, in conversation with the Athenian lawgiver Solon, described Atlantis as an island larger than Asia Minor and Libya combined, and situated just beyond the Pillars of Hercules (the Strait of Gibraltar). About 9,000 years before the birth of Solon, the priests said, Atlantis was a rich island whose powerful princes conquered many of the lands of the Mediterranean until they were finally defeated by the Athenians and the latter’s allies. The Atlantians eventually became wicked and impious, and their island was swallowed up by the sea, as a result of earthquakes.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
The novel, ‘Island of Adventure’ was written by the famous author, Enid Blyton. Philip and Dinah Mannering and their new friends Jack and Lucy-Ann Trent — along with Jack's irrepressible talking parrot, Kiki — are spending their summer holiday at Craggy-Tops, an ancient, half-ruined house by the sea. Before long, they are drawn to the mysterious Isle of Gloom in the distance and are determined to find a way to get there and explore it. But gradually it becomes apparent that the island may not be as deserted as it's supposed to be. Who is signaling from the island to the mainland at night? What is going on in the abandoned copper mines beneath the island? And what does the friendly, yet enigmatic Bill Smugs know about it all? The four children find themselves caught up in an adventure more thrilling — and dangerous — than they could have imagined.<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
There are a handful of places around the world that are largely untouched or uninhabited. Unexplored areas around the world also include small islands, such as Pitcairn Island off of New Zealand, and Palmerston Island in the South Pacific. Pitcairn Island is located 3,300 miles from New Zealand, and no plane or helicopter has ever landed there. It requires a hefty 32-hour yacht ride to get to the remote island of Pitcairn from Auckland, New Zealand, and apparently, no plane or helicopter has ever landed there. The island is known as a British Overseas Territory, and its government is situated in New Zealand. It's also considered to be one of the least-populated territories in the world, with about 50 residents in 2018. A photographer who has visited the island previously told Insider that when Pitcairn's inhabitants need medical attention, they must go to New Zealand or Fiji, and sometimes are unable to return to Pitcairn for weeks or even months.<br>

Eventually, a gigantic gorilla, the natives' god Kong, emerged from the jungle and grabbed Ann, carrying her off back into the jungle.<br>

Atlantis is a legendary island in the Atlantic Ocean, lying west of the Strait of Gibraltar. The principal sources for the legend are two of ancient Greek, Plato’s writings,&nbsp;Timaeus&nbsp;and&nbsp;Critias. In the former, Plato describes how Egyptian priests, in conversation with the Athenian lawgiver Solon, described Atlantis as an island larger than Asia Minor and Libya combined, and situated just beyond the Pillars of Hercules (the Strait of Gibraltar). About 9,000 years before the birth of Solon, the priests said, Atlantis was a rich island whose powerful princes conquered many of the lands of the Mediterranean until they were finally defeated by the Athenians and the latter’s allies. The Atlantians eventually became wicked and impious, and their island was swallowed up by the sea, as a result of earthquakes.<br>

The novel, ‘Island of Adventure’ was written by the famous author, Enid Blyton. Philip and Dinah Mannering and their new friends Jack and Lucy-Ann Trent — along with Jack's irrepressible talking parrot, Kiki — are spending their summer holiday at Craggy-Tops, an ancient, half-ruined house by the sea. Before long, they are drawn to the mysterious Isle of Gloom in the distance and are determined to find a way to get there and explore it. But gradually it becomes apparent that the island may not be as deserted as it's supposed to be. Who is signaling from the island to the mainland at night? What is going on in the abandoned copper mines beneath the island? And what does the friendly, yet enigmatic Bill Smugs know about it all? The four children find themselves caught up in an adventure more thrilling — and dangerous — than they could have imagined.<br>

There are a handful of places around the world that are largely untouched or uninhabited. Unexplored areas around the world also include small islands, such as Pitcairn Island off of New Zealand, and Palmerston Island in the South Pacific. Pitcairn Island is located 3,300 miles from New Zealand, and no plane or helicopter has ever landed there. It requires a hefty 32-hour yacht ride to get to the remote island of Pitcairn from Auckland, New Zealand, and apparently, no plane or helicopter has ever landed there. The island is known as a British Overseas Territory, and its government is situated in New Zealand. It's also considered to be one of the least-populated territories in the world, with about 50 residents in 2018. A photographer who has visited the island previously told Insider that when Pitcairn's inhabitants need medical attention, they must go to New Zealand or Fiji, and sometimes are unable to return to Pitcairn for weeks or even months.<br>
