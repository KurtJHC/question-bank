        <p><em>The story below comes from a book about the pioneer childhood of an adventurous young girl, Caddie Woodlawn. Read the story and answer the questions that follow.</em><br><br>
from <strong>Caddie Woodlawn</strong></p>
        <p>
          <em>by Carol Ryrie Brink</em>
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caddie’s wandering feet took her upstairs to the attic. Here were old boxes from Boston, and a beautiful round-topped trunk, lined with coloured paper, with pictures of smiling children decorating the various compartments. And on a low shelf was a row of clocks, waiting for Father’s expert hand to mend them. The attic was drafty, but, near the head of the stairs, a big brick chimney came up from the kitchen, and there it was warm. Caddie drew some of the boxes over to the chimney and sat with her back against it, while she looked through them. Most of the things she had seen often enough. There were too many people in the family to allow old things to accumulate,<sup>1</sup> unused. Only two things which she found puzzled and surprised Caddie. She found them in the bottom of one of the boxes, and she knew that she had never seen them before. They were a pair of little red breeches<sup>2</sup> and a pair of small, wooden-soled clogs. Surely they had never belonged either to Warren or to Tom. For some time they puzzled and excited her. Then she put them neatly away in the box, resolved to ask Mother about them as soon as she went downstairs.</li>
          <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now she turned her attention to the clocks. They had been at the back of her mind all the time. She had been reserving them as a sort of final treat, as she often did with the things she liked best. She picked them up, one by one, and shook them to see if they would start ticking. Among the others stood the circuit rider’s<sup>3</sup> clock. Caddie remembered what he had said—it was the “face of a dead friend.” Surely it would soon be time for the circuit rider to return, and Father had not yet started work upon the clock. How dreadful it would be, if the circuit rider should return and find his clock unmended! Caddie turned the clock thoughtfully in her hands. She had seen Father mend so many of them! Of course, they were not all alike inside, but she knew how the little screws came out and how the back came off, and then inside you saw all of the fascinating wheels and gimcracks.<sup>4</sup> Why shouldn’t she mend it herself ? She was sure that she could. She sat down with her back against the chimney and began to loosen the screws.</li>
          <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was more of a task than she had supposed. But Father’s tools were there on the shelf, and she found a screw driver of just the size she needed. The back came off, revealing the wheels and springs. Caddie knew enough about clocks to see what was the matter. The circuit rider had wound his clock too tightly, and in some way the spring had caught so that it could not unwind as it should have done. Caddie looked it over carefully. Then she began to loosen the screws which held it in place. She had to loosen several before she found the right ones. Time slipped away unheeded, she was so deeply absorbed in the clock. Her cheeks were flushed and her face, bent low over her work, was curtained by her dangling curls.</li>
          <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And then at last she loosened the right screw! Whizz! bang! the spring flew out with a whirr and hit the low ceiling. Screws and cog wheels flew in every direction. It was like an explosion. The circuit rider’s clock had suddenly flown to pieces! Caddie uttered a cry of despair and looked wildly about her. What would Father say?</li>
          <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was a low chuckle from the stairway. Caddie followed the sound with startled eyes. Standing on one of the lower steps, so that his eyes were just above the level of the attic floor, stood her father. How long he had been watching her, she had no idea.</li>
          <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Father,” she wailed, “it went to pieces! The circuit rider’s clock!” Her father leaned against the wall of the staircase and laughed. Caddie had almost never seen him laugh so hard. She, herself, did not know whether to laugh or cry.</li>
          <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Father,” she repeated, “it went to pieces!”</li>
          <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Still laughing, Mr. Woodlawn came up the stairs.</li>
          <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Let’s pick up the pieces,” he said. “We’re going to put that clock together, Caddie. I’ve been needing a partner in my clock business for a long time. I don’t know why I never thought of you before!”</li>
          <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“A partner!” gasped Caddie. She began to race about the attic, picking up screws and springs. “A real partner?”</li>
          <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“If you do well,” said her father. “Clara is too busy with Mother, and Tom hasn’t the patience nor the inclination. Yes, Caddie, I believe you’ll be my partner.”</li>
          <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Together they sat on the attic floor and put the circuit rider’s clock in order. Mr. Woodlawn explained and demonstrated, while Caddie’s eager fingers did the work. Together they cleaned and oiled the parts and made the nice adjustments that were required. By the time the work was finished, it was growing dark in the attic.</li>
          <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Now take that down and show your mother, Caddie,” said Mr. Woodlawn. Together they marched downstairs, one as proud as the other, and Caddie set the circuit rider’s clock in the middle of the dining-room table.</li>
          <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“So you mended Mr. Tanner’s clock, did you, Johnny?” said Mrs. Woodlawn carelessly.</li>
          <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“No, not this time,” said her husband, with a twinkle in his eye. “Caddie did it.”</li>
          <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Caddie did it?” Mrs. Woodlawn and Clara and the children, who had just come in from school, crowded around to see.</li>
          <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“It runs,” marveled Tom, and Warren uttered an admiring “Golly!”</li>
          <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The circuit rider’s clock no longer looked like the “face of a dead friend.” It appeared to be very much alive and spoke up with a cheerful tick.</li>
          <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Caddie never forgot the lesson she had learned that day in the attic. Wherever she was, all through her long and busy life, clocks ticked about her pleasantly, and, if they didn’t, she knew the reason why.</li>

          <strong>YOGA AND YOU</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>from Yoga for Teens by Thia Luby<br>
<br>
If you want people to admire your inner strength and beauty and enjoy being with you—</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>If you’d like to be stronger, more flexible, toned, and healthy—</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>If you’d like to feel more peaceful and happier—</em>
        </p>
        <p><em>Give yoga a try.</em><br><br>
1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoga is a discipline and a science—but also a fun way to exercise your body and your mind. Some yoga poses are held statue-like, while others are very active and involve jumping movements. Doing statue-like poses will build concentration skills, physical strength, and flexibility that will help you in school or at work. The more active poses will build strong muscles for endurance and better performance in sports and other activities. When you learn how to breathe deeper and slower by practicing yoga breathing exercises, you’ll feel calm and relaxed. Breathing exercises will also help you sleep better and wake up in a better mood, ready to face another day with good energy and a smile.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can practice yoga poses by yourself, with a friend, or with a group of friends. You can practice any time of the day or evening, outdoors on the grass, or in a spacious room indoors, and you never need anything but your own body. You will be amazed at how strong you can become by practicing yoga often, and your friends will be impressed by what you can teach them.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s important to start with the Basic Poses to begin building the strength, flexibility, and endurance that more advanced yoga requires. After you become stronger, you can begin to learn the more difficult poses. . . .</p>
        <p>
          <strong>What You Need to Know About Yoga</strong>
        </p>
        <p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many forms of yoga and yogic meditation are described in the ancient writings of India, where yoga was developed over 5,000 years ago, but in this book we will focus mainly on the form known as hatha yoga. This type of yoga is a complete system of poses, movements, breathing, relaxation, and concentration that promotes total health and well-being—mental, physical, and spiritual. People who do hatha yoga regularly can quickly increase their physical strength, flexibility, and coordination; clear energy blocks; and develop greater mental clarity, focus, and concentration—qualities essential for success in all areas of life.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoga poses tone the internal organs of the body while toning muscles, keeping the muscular structure strong, and improving circulation. When you hold a pose, the circulation of blood bathes a particular area of the body to rejuvenate<sup>1</sup> glands and cells, and to calm nerves.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoga practice focuses strongly on the brain and the spinal cord, the two principal centers of the body’s nervous system. While some yoga poses are designed for energizing the body, others are aimed specifically at calming and focusing the mind. Keeping the nerves calm and healthy is very important to maintaining a healthy mind and body. A nervous state or negative emotions like anger can have harmful physical or mental effects if these emotions and mental states occur often or last a long time. The deep breathing methods and calming poses learned in yoga ease nervous tension and help to keep your brain and nervous system working well. At the same time they help you calm your emotions and redirect energy into constructive channels.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yogic breathing exercises produce life energy, or <em>prana</em>, which circulates through hundreds of energy channels (called <em>nadis</em>) throughout the body and clears blocked energy. The creators of yoga discovered seven energy centers, called <em>chakras</em>, running along the spine. Chakras absorb prana and send it along the energy channels to the blood, nervous system, and glands.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of the seven chakras affects specific glands, areas, and functions of the body. Each chakra activates a particular kind of energy that impacts our emotional, mental, and spiritual selves. If a particular part of your body feels “tight,” uneasy, achy, or painful, a yoga pose can be selected to move more blood and energy into that area. With yoga poses, chakras are stimulated and energy blocks are released so that the physical stress or emotional upset can heal. Practicing yoga poses keeps the energy channels clear and the chakras open, resulting in a healthy, balanced state. . .</p>
        <p>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A person who practices yoga faithfully will eventually lose self-consciousness about his or her body and can begin to “let go of ego.” According to yoga philosophy, at this point the body is considered a fit vehicle for the soul. Although the form of yoga you will learn in this book does not involve spiritual meditations, practicing yoga poses that are calming to your body and spirit will allow you to experience a calm, peaceful, meditative state. As you continue to practice yoga, a quiet mind will emerge spontaneously and naturally. As you learn to focus your mind while holding a yoga pose, you will also improve your concentration and learning skills, and find it easier to maintain a positive mental attitude.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoga offers a different approach to strengthening and moving the body than sports and other types of physical activity. It gives you a chance to listen to your own body’s needs by tuning in and learning which parts need direct attention for healing or strengthening. Instead of exerting energy to the point where your body feels exhausted, in doing yoga you will feel increased energy as you focus inward on proper alignment<sup>2</sup> of the body while holding a pose.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many yoga poses were inspired by animals and insects. Observing them to learn their secrets of staying strong and healthy, the creators of yoga developed a series of poses that focus on the special qualities and abilities of different animals and insects—their strength, agility, poise, or determination. Being aware of these life forms and their qualities helps you use your powers of visualization to strengthen your practice of yoga. Some of the classical poses in this book have been renamed to make them easier to visualize. . . .</p>
        <p>12&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you practice yoga, you will notice that you become much more aware of your body. You will feel more alive and energized, and aware of how all the parts of your body are made to work together, in harmony. You will stand taller and be more poised, presenting a positive self-image to the world.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoga teaches balance of mind, body, and spirit. It is a discipline that promotes selfawareness and a strong sense of self, without overinflating the ego. Yoga is part of a system that, for centuries, has been used to build character and compassion, and is a basis for learning unconditional love of oneself and others. . . .</p>

          <strong>What You Need to Know About Yoga</strong>
        </p>
        <p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many forms of yoga and yogic meditation are described in the ancient writings of India, where yoga was developed over 5,000 years ago, but in this book we will focus mainly on the form known as hatha yoga. This type of yoga is a complete system of poses, movements, breathing, relaxation, and concentration that promotes total health and well-being—mental, physical, and spiritual. People who do hatha yoga regularly can quickly increase their physical strength, flexibility, and coordination; clear energy blocks; and develop greater mental clarity, focus, and concentration—qualities essential for success in all areas of life.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoga poses tone the internal organs of the body while toning muscles, keeping the muscular structure strong, and improving circulation. When you hold a pose, the circulation of blood bathes a particular area of the body to rejuvenate<sup>1</sup> glands and cells, and to calm nerves.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoga practice focuses strongly on the brain and the spinal cord, the two principal centers of the body’s nervous system. While some yoga poses are designed for energizing the body, others are aimed specifically at calming and focusing the mind. Keeping the nerves calm and healthy is very important to maintaining a healthy mind and body. A nervous state or negative emotions like anger can have harmful physical or mental effects if these emotions and mental states occur often or last a long time. The deep breathing methods and calming poses learned in yoga ease nervous tension and help to keep your brain and nervous system working well. At the same time they help you calm your emotions and redirect energy into constructive channels.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yogic breathing exercises produce life energy, or <em>prana</em>, which circulates through hundreds of energy channels (called <em>nadis</em>) throughout the body and clears blocked energy. The creators of yoga discovered seven energy centers, called <em>chakras</em>, running along the spine. Chakras absorb prana and send it along the energy channels to the blood, nervous system, and glands.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of the seven chakras affects specific glands, areas, and functions of the body. Each chakra activates a particular kind of energy that impacts our emotional, mental, and spiritual selves. If a particular part of your body feels “tight,” uneasy, achy, or painful, a yoga pose can be selected to move more blood and energy into that area. With yoga poses, chakras are stimulated and energy blocks are released so that the physical stress or emotional upset can heal. Practicing yoga poses keeps the energy channels clear and the chakras open, resulting in a healthy, balanced state. . .</p>
        <p>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A person who practices yoga faithfully will eventually lose self-consciousness about his or her body and can begin to “let go of ego.” According to yoga philosophy, at this point the body is considered a fit vehicle for the soul. Although the form of yoga you will learn in this book does not involve spiritual meditations, practicing yoga poses that are calming to your body and spirit will allow you to experience a calm, peaceful, meditative state. As you continue to practice yoga, a quiet mind will emerge spontaneously and naturally.

It gives you a chance to listen to your own body’s needs by tuning in and learning which parts need direct attention for healing or strengthening. Instead of exerting energy to the point where your body feels exhausted, in doing yoga you will feel increased energy as you focus inward on proper alignment<sup>2</sup> of the body while holding a pose.</p>

You will feel more alive and energized, and aware of how all the parts of your body are made to work together, in harmony. You will stand taller and be more poised, presenting a positive self-image to the world.</p>

          <strong>YOGA AND YOU</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>from Yoga for Teens by Thia Luby<br>
<br>
If you want people to admire your inner strength and beauty and enjoy being with you—</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>If you’d like to be stronger, more flexible, toned, and healthy—</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>If you’d like to feel more peaceful and happier—</em>
        </p>
        <p><em>Give yoga a try.</em><br><br>
1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoga is a discipline and a science—but also a fun way to exercise your body and your mind. Some yoga poses are held statue-like, while others are very active and involve jumping movements. Doing statue-like poses will build concentration skills, physical strength, and flexibility that will help you in school or at work. The more active poses will build strong muscles for endurance and better performance in sports and other activities. When you learn how to breathe deeper and slower by practicing yoga breathing exercises, you’ll feel calm and relaxed. Breathing exercises will also help you sleep better and wake up in a better mood, ready to face another day with good energy and a smile.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can practice yoga poses by yourself, with a friend, or with a group of friends. You can practice any time of the day or evening, outdoors on the grass, or in a spacious room indoors, and you never need anything but your own body. You will be amazed at how strong you can become by practicing yoga often, and your friends will be impressed by what you can teach them.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s important to start with the Basic Poses to begin building the strength, flexibility, and endurance that more advanced yoga requires. After you become stronger, you can begin to learn the more difficult poses. . . .</p>
        <p>
          <strong>What You Need to Know About Yoga</strong>
        </p>
        <p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many forms of yoga and yogic meditation are described in the ancient writings of India, where yoga was developed over 5,000 years ago, but in this book we will focus mainly on the form known as hatha yoga. This type of yoga is a complete system of poses, movements, breathing, relaxation, and concentration that promotes total health and well-being—mental, physical, and spiritual. People who do hatha yoga regularly can quickly increase their physical strength, flexibility, and coordination; clear energy blocks; and develop greater mental clarity, focus, and concentration—qualities essential for success in all areas of life.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoga poses tone the internal organs of the body while toning muscles, keeping the muscular structure strong, and improving circulation. When you hold a pose, the circulation of blood bathes a particular area of the body to rejuvenate<sup>1</sup> glands and cells, and to calm nerves.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoga practice focuses strongly on the brain and the spinal cord, the two principal centers of the body’s nervous system. While some yoga poses are designed for energizing the body, others are aimed specifically at calming and focusing the mind. Keeping the nerves calm and healthy is very important to maintaining a healthy mind and body. A nervous state or negative emotions like anger can have harmful physical or mental effects if these emotions and mental states occur often or last a long time. The deep breathing methods and calming poses learned in yoga ease nervous tension and help to keep your brain and nervous system working well. At the same time they help you calm your emotions and redirect energy into constructive channels.</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="70%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/db0yrhgnb/image/upload/v1767493736/nhp5q4tiv8lewaw8pejq.png" alt="SCHTT07_ACER_RC_06">


        </p>
        <p>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yogic breathing exercises produce life energy, or <em>prana</em>, which circulates through hundreds of energy channels (called <em>nadis</em>) throughout the body and clears blocked energy. The creators of yoga discovered seven energy centers, called <em>chakras</em>, running along the spine. Chakras absorb prana and send it along the energy channels to the blood, nervous system, and glands.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of the seven chakras affects specific glands, areas, and functions of the body. Each chakra activates a particular kind of energy that impacts our emotional, mental, and spiritual selves. If a particular part of your body feels “tight,” uneasy, achy, or painful, a yoga pose can be selected to move more blood and energy into that area. With yoga poses, chakras are stimulated and energy blocks are released so that the physical stress or emotional upset can heal. Practicing yoga poses keeps the energy channels clear and the chakras open, resulting in a healthy, balanced state. . .</p>
        <p>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A person who practices yoga faithfully will eventually lose self-consciousness about his or her body and can begin to “let go of ego.” According to yoga philosophy, at this point the body is considered a fit vehicle for the soul. Although the form of yoga you will learn in this book does not involve spiritual meditations, practicing yoga poses that are calming to your body and spirit will allow you to experience a calm, peaceful, meditative state. As you continue to practice yoga, a quiet mind will emerge spontaneously and naturally. As you learn to focus your mind while holding a yoga pose, you will also improve your concentration and learning skills, and find it easier to maintain a positive mental attitude.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoga offers a different approach to strengthening and moving the body than sports and other types of physical activity. It gives you a chance to listen to your own body’s needs by tuning in and learning which parts need direct attention for healing or strengthening. Instead of exerting energy to the point where your body feels exhausted, in doing yoga you will feel increased energy as you focus inward on proper alignment<sup>2</sup> of the body while holding a pose.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many yoga poses were inspired by animals and insects. Observing them to learn their secrets of staying strong and healthy, the creators of yoga developed a series of poses that focus on the special qualities and abilities of different animals and insects—their strength, agility, poise, or determination. Being aware of these life forms and their qualities helps you use your powers of visualization to strengthen your practice of yoga. Some of the classical poses in this book have been renamed to make them easier to visualize. . . .</p>
        <p>12&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you practice yoga, you will notice that you become much more aware of your body. You will feel more alive and energized, and aware of how all the parts of your body are made to work together, in harmony. You will stand taller and be more poised, presenting a positive self-image to the world.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoga teaches balance of mind, body, and spirit. It is a discipline that promotes selfawareness and a strong sense of self, without overinflating the ego. Yoga is part of a system that, for centuries, has been used to build character and compassion, and is a basis for learning unconditional love of oneself and others. . . .</p>

A nervous state or negative emotions like anger can have harmful physical or mental effects if these emotions and mental states occur often or last a long time. The deep breathing methods and calming poses learned in yoga ease nervous tension and help to keep your brain and nervous system working well. At the same time they help you calm your emotions and redirect energy into constructive channels.</p>

        <p>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yogic breathing exercises produce life energy, or <em>prana</em>, which circulates through hundreds of energy channels (called <em>nadis</em>) throughout the body and clears blocked energy. The creators of yoga discovered seven energy centers, called <em>chakras</em>, running along the spine. Chakras absorb prana and send it along the energy channels to the blood, nervous system, and glands.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of the seven chakras affects specific glands, areas, and functions of the body. Each chakra activates a particular kind of energy that impacts our emotional, mental, and spiritual selves. If a particular part of your body feels “tight,” uneasy, achy, or painful, a yoga pose can be selected to move more blood and energy into that area. With yoga poses, chakras are stimulated and energy blocks are released so that the physical stress or emotional upset can heal. Practicing yoga poses keeps the energy channels clear and the chakras open, resulting in a healthy, balanced state. . .</p>
        <p>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A person who practices yoga faithfully will eventually lose self-consciousness about his or her body and can begin to “let go of ego.” According to yoga philosophy, at this point the body is considered a fit vehicle for the soul. Although the form of yoga you will learn in this book does not involve spiritual meditations, practicing yoga poses that are calming to your body and spirit will allow you to experience a calm, peaceful, meditative state. As you continue to practice yoga, a quiet mind will emerge spontaneously and naturally. As you learn to focus your mind while holding a yoga pose, you will also improve your concentration and learning skills, and find it easier to maintain a positive mental attitude.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoga offers a different approach to strengthening and moving the body than sports and other types of physical activity. It gives you a chance to listen to your own body’s needs by tuning in and learning which parts need direct attention for healing or strengthening. Instead of exerting energy to the point where your body feels exhausted, in doing yoga you will feel increased energy as you focus inward on proper alignment<sup>2</sup> of the body while holding a pose.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many yoga poses were inspired by animals and insects. Observing them to learn their secrets of staying strong and healthy, the creators of yoga developed a series of poses that focus on the special qualities and abilities of different animals and insects—their strength, agility, poise, or determination. Being aware of these life forms and their qualities helps you use your powers of visualization to strengthen your practice of yoga. Some of the classical poses in this book have been renamed to make them easier to visualize. . . .</p>
        <p>12&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you practice yoga, you will notice that you become much more aware of your body. You will feel more alive and energized, and aware of how all the parts of your body are made to work together, in harmony. You will stand taller and be more poised, presenting a positive self-image to the world.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoga teaches balance of mind, body, and spirit. It is a discipline that promotes selfawareness and a strong sense of self, without overinflating the ego. Yoga is part of a system that, for centuries, has been used to build character and compassion, and is a basis for learning unconditional love of oneself and others. . . .</p>

          <strong>YOGA AND YOU</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>from Yoga for Teens by Thia Luby<br>
<br>
If you want people to admire your inner strength and beauty and enjoy being with you—</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>If you’d like to be stronger, more flexible, toned, and healthy—</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>If you’d like to feel more peaceful and happier—</em>
        </p>
        <p><em>Give yoga a try.</em><br><br>
1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoga is a discipline and a science—but also a fun way to exercise your body and your mind. Some yoga poses are held statue-like, while others are very active and involve jumping movements. Doing statue-like poses will build concentration skills, physical strength, and flexibility that will help you in school or at work. The more active poses will build strong muscles for endurance and better performance in sports and other activities. When you learn how to breathe deeper and slower by practicing yoga breathing exercises, you’ll feel calm and relaxed. Breathing exercises will also help you sleep better and wake up in a better mood, ready to face another day with good energy and a smile.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can practice yoga poses by yourself, with a friend, or with a group of friends. You can practice any time of the day or evening, outdoors on the grass, or in a spacious room indoors, and you never need anything but your own body. You will be amazed at how strong you can become by practicing yoga often, and your friends will be impressed by what you can teach them.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s important to start with the Basic Poses to begin building the strength, flexibility, and endurance that more advanced yoga requires. After you become stronger, you can begin to learn the more difficult poses. . . .</p>
        <p>
          <strong>What You Need to Know About Yoga</strong>
        </p>
        <p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many forms of yoga and yogic meditation are described in the ancient writings of India, where yoga was developed over 5,000 years ago, but in this book we will focus mainly on the form known as hatha yoga. This type of yoga is a complete system of poses, movements, breathing, relaxation, and concentration that promotes total health and well-being—mental, physical, and spiritual. People who do hatha yoga regularly can quickly increase their physical strength, flexibility, and coordination; clear energy blocks; and develop greater mental clarity, focus, and concentration—qualities essential for success in all areas of life.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoga poses tone the internal organs of the body while toning muscles, keeping the muscular structure strong, and improving circulation. When you hold a pose, the circulation of blood bathes a particular area of the body to rejuvenate<sup>1</sup> glands and cells, and to calm nerves.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoga practice focuses strongly on the brain and the spinal cord, the two principal centers of the body’s nervous system. While some yoga poses are designed for energizing the body, others are aimed specifically at calming and focusing the mind. Keeping the nerves calm and healthy is very important to maintaining a healthy mind and body. A nervous state or negative emotions like anger can have harmful physical or mental effects if these emotions and mental states occur often or last a long time. The deep breathing methods and calming poses learned in yoga ease nervous tension and help to keep your brain and nervous system working well. At the same time they help you calm your emotions and redirect energy into constructive channels.</p>

          <strong>The Friends You Can’t Choose</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>How to build better relationships with your siblings and understand what makes them tick</em><br><br>
1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chester poked his head into his older sister’s room.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Hi, Denise,” he said.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Chester, get out!” Denise screamed. “I told you never to come into my room again. What part of your pea-sized brain finds that hard to understand?”</p>
        <p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Gee,” Chester sighed. “What’s your problem?”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What sane person would scream at her brother just for saying “hello”? Every time Denise gets a minute to herself, Chester shows up. Even though she’s told him to leave her alone, he listens to her phone conversations and tells her secrets at the dinner table. To Denise, Chester’s more of a bother than a brother.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What you get in a sibling (brother or sister) is pretty much the luck of the draw. You have no control over who your brothers and sisters are; you’re simply stuck with what you’ve got. You may be one of the lucky ones who has “sibs” who are your best friends. Then again, you may not be so lucky.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why are relationships with siblings such a big deal? Because you live with these people day in and day out. Learning to get along with them can help you learn about yourself. You also learn how to get along in the other relationships you’ll have in life. Here are some common roles siblings play. Chances are you’ll recognize your sibs in these descriptions.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Roles Siblings Play</strong>
        </p>
        <p>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • <strong>Pests</strong>—Chester illustrates this role perfectly. What Denise can’t see because of her anger is that Chester really admires his older sister. He’s always around because the dull, everyday details of her life are interesting to him. He likes being near her.</p>
        <p>9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • <strong>Protectors</strong>—It’s common for sibs to protect each other. If Denise saw some kids calling Chester names, you can bet she’d forget what a pest he is and run to his rescue. This is normal, says Celia Anita Decker, author of Children: The Early Years. She says that sibs protect each other most often in four situations. They do it when “there is an age gap of three or more years, when siblings come from large families, when children are unsupervised outside, and when peers attack a younger sibling in a physical or verbal way.” Have you ever noticed that, while it seems OK for you to call your brother or sister a name, you sure don’t want anyone else doing it?</p>
        <p>10&nbsp;&nbsp; • <strong>Rivals</strong>—Some siblings compete with each other for Mom’s or Dad’s attention and praise, often without even knowing it. Helen Gum Westlake and Donald G. Westlake, authors of Relationships and Family Living, explain that rivalry is greatest when the children are between 18 and 36 months apart in age. If you start to feel jealous of a sibling who gets better grades than you or is a better athlete, that’s because rivalry and envy feed off each other. One leads to the other. But there is good news. “Children normally lose their obvious symptoms of jealousy as they grow older and become absorbed in interests outside their family,” write the Westlakes.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp;&nbsp; • <strong>Fighters</strong>—Sibs don’t have to be rivals to fight. Some sibs fight intensely about everything—from sharing space to borrowing clothes or using the bathroom. If your home is a battleground, your entire family would appreciate it if you and your sib could declare a truce. Setting up fair rules and respecting each other’s needs can help end wars on the home front.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp;&nbsp; • <strong>Friends</strong>—Sibling friendships make the fighting, rivalry, and annoyances worthwhile. Even siblings who claim to despise each other can grow to be best friends. Sibs are natural playmates, and each time you set goals (for work or fun) and make them happen, you build family ties. No other friends know you better or care more for your welfare.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>How to Win the Sibling Game</strong>
        </p>
        <p>13&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sibling can be friend, foe, or a little of both. If you play the game right, though, you’ll learn how to get along with your sibs before it’s time to move out of the house.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Rule 1: Respect your opponent</strong>. Earn points by showing your sibs a little respect. Remember, to earn it for yourself you must also give it. So, respect each other’s property, privacy, space, and needs. Be sure to talk to, instead of yell at, each other at least once each day.</p>
        <p>15 &nbsp; <strong>Rule 2: Set the rules</strong>. Decide what bugs you, then set ground rules. If it’s privacy you crave, create a “Knock before entering” or “Keep out of my closet” rule. Once you set the rules, follow them and play fair. You may want to ask your parents to act as mediators and help you set up these rules.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Rule 3: Give a little, get a little</strong>. Do your sibs think your stuff is theirs simply because you share the same last name? You can protect your possessions by letting sibs use some of them—and declaring the important ones “off-limits.”</p>
        <p>17&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Rule 4: Know what to hold on to</strong>. When something is important to you, find a way to save it. For example, how can you get the privacy you need? Maybe you can take an unused attic or basement and make it your own. Another idea: Talk to your sibs about dividing your room into “privacy zones.” Feeling satisfied about what matters most to you can make you more patient in other areas.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Rule 5: Know when to give in</strong>. Sometimes giving in to small arguments can help you settle the big ones more peacefully. If you and a sib are arguing over something small, give in and move on.</p>
        <p>19 &nbsp;<strong> Rule 6: When you win, don’t brag. Keep your attitude fair and friendly</strong>. This will show sibs you respect them and value your family ties.</p>
        <p>20&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sibling relationships aren’t always easy. But, in the end, there is usually a big payoff. A bond between sibs can last a lifetime, often getting stronger as years go by. When you think about it, it’s the longest relationship you will ever have— from the very beginning of your life to the end. Wouldn’t it be nice to make it a great one?&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Brothers and Sisters</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The Friends You Can’t Choose</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>How to build better relationships with your siblings and understand what makes them tick</em><br><br>
1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chester poked his head into his older sister’s room.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Hi, Denise,” he said.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Chester, get out!” Denise screamed. “I told you never to come into my room again. What part of your pea-sized brain finds that hard to understand?”</p>
        <p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Gee,” Chester sighed. “What’s your problem?”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What sane person would scream at her brother just for saying “hello”? Every time Denise gets a minute to herself, Chester shows up. Even though she’s told him to leave her alone, he listens to her phone conversations and tells her secrets at the dinner table. To Denise, Chester’s more of a bother than a brother.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What you get in a sibling (brother or sister) is pretty much the luck of the draw. You have no control over who your brothers and sisters are; you’re simply stuck with what you’ve got. You may be one of the lucky ones who has “sibs” who are your best friends. Then again, you may not be so lucky.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why are relationships with siblings such a big deal? Because you live with these people day in and day out. Learning to get along with them can help you learn about yourself. You also learn how to get along in the other relationships you’ll have in life. Here are some common roles siblings play. Chances are you’ll recognize your sibs in these descriptions.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Roles Siblings Play</strong>
        </p>
        <p>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • <strong>Pests</strong>—Chester illustrates this role perfectly. What Denise can’t see because of her anger is that Chester really admires his older sister. He’s always around because the dull, everyday details of her life are interesting to him. He likes being near her.</p>
        <p>9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • <strong>Protectors</strong>—It’s common for sibs to protect each other. If Denise saw some kids calling Chester names, you can bet she’d forget what a pest he is and run to his rescue. This is normal, says Celia Anita Decker, author of Children: The Early Years. She says that sibs protect each other most often in four situations. They do it when “there is an age gap of three or more years, when siblings come from large families, when children are unsupervised outside, and when peers attack a younger sibling in a physical or verbal way.” Have you ever noticed that, while it seems OK for you to call your brother or sister a name, you sure don’t want anyone else doing it?</p>
        <p>10&nbsp;&nbsp; • <strong>Rivals</strong>—Some siblings compete with each other for Mom’s or Dad’s attention and praise, often without even knowing it. Helen Gum Westlake and Donald G. Westlake, authors of Relationships and Family Living, explain that rivalry is greatest when the children are between 18 and 36 months apart in age. If you start to feel jealous of a sibling who gets better grades than you or is a better athlete, that’s because rivalry and envy feed off each other. One leads to the other. But there is good news. “Children normally lose their obvious symptoms of jealousy as they grow older and become absorbed in interests outside their family,” write the Westlakes.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp;&nbsp; • <strong>Fighters</strong>—Sibs don’t have to be rivals to fight. Some sibs fight intensely about everything—from sharing space to borrowing clothes or using the bathroom. If your home is a battleground, your entire family would appreciate it if you and your sib could declare a truce. Setting up fair rules and respecting each other’s needs can help end wars on the home front.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp;&nbsp; • <strong>Friends</strong>—Sibling friendships make the fighting, rivalry, and annoyances worthwhile. Even siblings who claim to despise each other can grow to be best friends. Sibs are natural playmates, and each time you set goals (for work or fun) and make them happen, you build family ties. No other friends know you better or care more for your welfare.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>How to Win the Sibling Game</strong>
        </p>
        <p>13&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sibling can be friend, foe, or a little of both. If you play the game right, though, you’ll learn how to get along with your sibs before it’s time to move out of the house.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Rule 1: Respect your opponent</strong>. Earn points by showing your sibs a little respect. Remember, to earn it for yourself you must also give it. So, respect each other’s property, privacy, space, and needs. Be sure to talk to, instead of yell at, each other at least once each day.</p>
        <p>15 &nbsp; <strong>Rule 2: Set the rules</strong>. Decide what bugs you, then set ground rules. If it’s privacy you crave, create a “Knock before entering” or “Keep out of my closet” rule. Once you set the rules, follow them and play fair. You may want to ask your parents to act as mediators and help you set up these rules.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Rule 3: Give a little, get a little</strong>. Do your sibs think your stuff is theirs simply because you share the same last name? You can protect your possessions by letting sibs use some of them—and declaring the important ones “off-limits.”</p>
        <p>17&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Rule 4: Know what to hold on to</strong>. When something is important to you, find a way to save it. For example, how can you get the privacy you need? Maybe you can take an unused attic or basement and make it your own. Another idea: Talk to your sibs about dividing your room into “privacy zones.” Feeling satisfied about what matters most to you can make you more patient in other areas.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Rule 5: Know when to give in</strong>. Sometimes giving in to small arguments can help you settle the big ones more peacefully. If you and a sib are arguing over something small, give in and move on.</p>
        <p>19 &nbsp;<strong> Rule 6: When you win, don’t brag. Keep your attitude fair and friendly</strong>. This will show sibs you respect them and value your family ties.</p>
        <p>20&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sibling relationships aren’t always easy. But, in the end, there is usually a big payoff. A bond between sibs can last a lifetime, often getting stronger as years go by. When you think about it, it’s the longest relationship you will ever have— from the very beginning of your life to the end. Wouldn’t it be nice to make it a great one?&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Brothers and Sisters</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The Friends You Can’t Choose</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>How to build better relationships with your siblings and understand what makes them tick</em><br><br>
1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chester poked his head into his older sister’s room.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Hi, Denise,” he said.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Chester, get out!” Denise screamed. “I told you never to come into my room again. What part of your pea-sized brain finds that hard to understand?”</p>
        <p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Gee,” Chester sighed. “What’s your problem?”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What sane person would scream at her brother just for saying “hello”? Every time Denise gets a minute to herself, Chester shows up. Even though she’s told him to leave her alone, he listens to her phone conversations and tells her secrets at the dinner table. To Denise, Chester’s more of a bother than a brother.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What you get in a sibling (brother or sister) is pretty much the luck of the draw. You have no control over who your brothers and sisters are; you’re simply stuck with what you’ve got. You may be one of the lucky ones who has “sibs” who are your best friends. Then again, you may not be so lucky.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why are relationships with siblings such a big deal? Because you live with these people day in and day out. Learning to get along with them can help you learn about yourself. You also learn how to get along in the other relationships you’ll have in life. Here are some common roles siblings play. Chances are you’ll recognize your sibs in these descriptions.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Roles Siblings Play</strong>
        </p>
        <p>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • <strong>Pests</strong>—Chester illustrates this role perfectly. What Denise can’t see because of her anger is that Chester really admires his older sister. He’s always around because the dull, everyday details of her life are interesting to him. He likes being near her.</p>
        <p>9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • <strong>Protectors</strong>—It’s common for sibs to protect each other. If Denise saw some kids calling Chester names, you can bet she’d forget what a pest he is and run to his rescue. This is normal, says Celia Anita Decker, author of Children: The Early Years. She says that sibs protect each other most often in four situations. They do it when “there is an age gap of three or more years, when siblings come from large families, when children are unsupervised outside, and when peers attack a younger sibling in a physical or verbal way.” Have you ever noticed that, while it seems OK for you to call your brother or sister a name, you sure don’t want anyone else doing it?</p>
        <p>10&nbsp;&nbsp; • <strong>Rivals</strong>—Some siblings compete with each other for Mom’s or Dad’s attention and praise, often without even knowing it. Helen Gum Westlake and Donald G. Westlake, authors of Relationships and Family Living, explain that rivalry is greatest when the children are between 18 and 36 months apart in age. If you start to feel jealous of a sibling who gets better grades than you or is a better athlete, that’s because rivalry and envy feed off each other. One leads to the other. But there is good news. “Children normally lose their obvious symptoms of jealousy as they grow older and become absorbed in interests outside their family,” write the Westlakes.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp;&nbsp; • <strong>Fighters</strong>—Sibs don’t have to be rivals to fight. Some sibs fight intensely about everything—from sharing space to borrowing clothes or using the bathroom. If your home is a battleground, your entire family would appreciate it if you and your sib could declare a truce. Setting up fair rules and respecting each other’s needs can help end wars on the home front.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp;&nbsp; • <strong>Friends</strong>—Sibling friendships make the fighting, rivalry, and annoyances worthwhile. Even siblings who claim to despise each other can grow to be best friends. Sibs are natural playmates, and each time you set goals (for work or fun) and make them happen, you build family ties. No other friends know you better or care more for your welfare.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>How to Win the Sibling Game</strong>
        </p>
        <p>13&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sibling can be friend, foe, or a little of both. If you play the game right, though, you’ll learn how to get along with your sibs before it’s time to move out of the house.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Rule 1: Respect your opponent</strong>. Earn points by showing your sibs a little respect. Remember, to earn it for yourself you must also give it. So, respect each other’s property, privacy, space, and needs. Be sure to talk to, instead of yell at, each other at least once each day.</p>
        <p>15 &nbsp; <strong>Rule 2: Set the rules</strong>. Decide what bugs you, then set ground rules. If it’s privacy you crave, create a “Knock before entering” or “Keep out of my closet” rule. Once you set the rules, follow them and play fair. You may want to ask your parents to act as mediators and help you set up these rules.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Rule 3: Give a little, get a little</strong>. Do your sibs think your stuff is theirs simply because you share the same last name? You can protect your possessions by letting sibs use some of them—and declaring the important ones “off-limits.”</p>
        <p>17&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Rule 4: Know what to hold on to</strong>. When something is important to you, find a way to save it. For example, how can you get the privacy you need? Maybe you can take an unused attic or basement and make it your own. Another idea: Talk to your sibs about dividing your room into “privacy zones.” Feeling satisfied about what matters most to you can make you more patient in other areas.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Rule 5: Know when to give in</strong>. Sometimes giving in to small arguments can help you settle the big ones more peacefully. If you and a sib are arguing over something small, give in and move on.</p>
        <p>19 &nbsp;<strong> Rule 6: When you win, don’t brag. Keep your attitude fair and friendly</strong>. This will show sibs you respect them and value your family ties.</p>
        <p>20&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sibling relationships aren’t always easy. But, in the end, there is usually a big payoff. A bond between sibs can last a lifetime, often getting stronger as years go by. When you think about it, it’s the longest relationship you will ever have— from the very beginning of your life to the end. Wouldn’t it be nice to make it a great one?&nbsp;</p>

        <p>16&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Rule 3: Give a little, get a little</strong>. Do your sibs think your stuff is theirs simply because you share the same last name? You can protect your possessions by letting sibs use some of them—and declaring the important ones “off-limits.”</p>
        <p>17&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Rule 4: Know what to hold on to</strong>. When something is important to you, find a way to save it. For example, how can you get the privacy you need? Maybe you can take an unused attic or basement and make it your own. Another idea: Talk to your sibs about dividing your room into “privacy zones.” Feeling satisfied about what matters most to you can make you more patient in other areas.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Rule 5: Know when to give in</strong>. Sometimes giving in to small arguments can help you settle the big ones more peacefully. If you and a sib are arguing over something small, give in and move on.</p>
        <p>19 &nbsp;<strong> Rule 6: When you win, don’t brag. Keep your attitude fair and friendly</strong>. This will show sibs you respect them and value your family ties.</p>
        <p>20&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sibling relationships aren’t always easy. But, in the end, there is usually a big payoff. A bond between sibs can last a lifetime, often getting stronger as years go by. When you think about it, it’s the longest relationship you will ever have— from the very beginning of your life to the end. Wouldn’t it be nice to make it a great one?&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Brothers and Sisters</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The Friends You Can’t Choose</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>How to build better relationships with your siblings and understand what makes them tick</em><br><br>
1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chester poked his head into his older sister’s room.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Hi, Denise,” he said.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Chester, get out!” Denise screamed. “I told you never to come into my room again. What part of your pea-sized brain finds that hard to understand?”</p>
        <p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Gee,” Chester sighed. “What’s your problem?”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What sane person would scream at her brother just for saying “hello”? Every time Denise gets a minute to herself, Chester shows up. Even though she’s told him to leave her alone, he listens to her phone conversations and tells her secrets at the dinner table. To Denise, Chester’s more of a bother than a brother.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What you get in a sibling (brother or sister) is pretty much the luck of the draw. You have no control over who your brothers and sisters are; you’re simply stuck with what you’ve got. You may be one of the lucky ones who has “sibs” who are your best friends. Then again, you may not be so lucky.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why are relationships with siblings such a big deal? Because you live with these people day in and day out. Learning to get along with them can help you learn about yourself. You also learn how to get along in the other relationships you’ll have in life. Here are some common roles siblings play. Chances are you’ll recognize your sibs in these descriptions.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Roles Siblings Play</strong>
        </p>
        <p>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • <strong>Pests</strong>—Chester illustrates this role perfectly. What Denise can’t see because of her anger is that Chester really admires his older sister. He’s always around because the dull, everyday details of her life are interesting to him. He likes being near her.</p>
        <p>9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • <strong>Protectors</strong>—It’s common for sibs to protect each other. If Denise saw some kids calling Chester names, you can bet she’d forget what a pest he is and run to his rescue. This is normal, says Celia Anita Decker, author of Children: The Early Years. She says that sibs protect each other most often in four situations. They do it when “there is an age gap of three or more years, when siblings come from large families, when children are unsupervised outside, and when peers attack a younger sibling in a physical or verbal way.” Have you ever noticed that, while it seems OK for you to call your brother or sister a name, you sure don’t want anyone else doing it?</p>
        <p>10&nbsp;&nbsp; • <strong>Rivals</strong>—Some siblings compete with each other for Mom’s or Dad’s attention and praise, often without even knowing it. Helen Gum Westlake and Donald G. Westlake, authors of Relationships and Family Living, explain that rivalry is greatest when the children are between 18 and 36 months apart in age. If you start to feel jealous of a sibling who gets better grades than you or is a better athlete, that’s because rivalry and envy feed off each other. One leads to the other. But there is good news. “Children normally lose their obvious symptoms of jealousy as they grow older and become absorbed in interests outside their family,” write the Westlakes.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp;&nbsp; • <strong>Fighters</strong>—Sibs don’t have to be rivals to fight. Some sibs fight intensely about everything—from sharing space to borrowing clothes or using the bathroom. If your home is a battleground, your entire family would appreciate it if you and your sib could declare a truce. Setting up fair rules and respecting each other’s needs can help end wars on the home front.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp;&nbsp; • <strong>Friends</strong>—Sibling friendships make the fighting, rivalry, and annoyances worthwhile. Even siblings who claim to despise each other can grow to be best friends. Sibs are natural playmates, and each time you set goals (for work or fun) and make them happen, you build family ties. No other friends know you better or care more for your welfare.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>How to Win the Sibling Game</strong>
        </p>
        <p>13&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sibling can be friend, foe, or a little of both. If you play the game right, though, you’ll learn how to get along with your sibs before it’s time to move out of the house.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Rule 1: Respect your opponent</strong>. Earn points by showing your sibs a little respect. Remember, to earn it for yourself you must also give it. So, respect each other’s property, privacy, space, and needs. Be sure to talk to, instead of yell at, each other at least once each day.</p>
        <p>15 &nbsp; <strong>Rule 2: Set the rules</strong>. Decide what bugs you, then set ground rules. If it’s privacy you crave, create a “Knock before entering” or “Keep out of my closet” rule. Once you set the rules, follow them and play fair. You may want to ask your parents to act as mediators and help you set up these rules.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Rule 3: Give a little, get a little</strong>. Do your sibs think your stuff is theirs simply because you share the same last name? You can protect your possessions by letting sibs use some of them—and declaring the important ones “off-limits.”</p>
        <p>17&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Rule 4: Know what to hold on to</strong>. When something is important to you, find a way to save it. For example, how can you get the privacy you need? Maybe you can take an unused attic or basement and make it your own. Another idea: Talk to your sibs about dividing your room into “privacy zones.” Feeling satisfied about what matters most to you can make you more patient in other areas.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Rule 5: Know when to give in</strong>. Sometimes giving in to small arguments can help you settle the big ones more peacefully. If you and a sib are arguing over something small, give in and move on.</p>
        <p>19 &nbsp;<strong> Rule 6: When you win, don’t brag. Keep your attitude fair and friendly</strong>. This will show sibs you respect them and value your family ties.</p>
        <p>20&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sibling relationships aren’t always easy. But, in the end, there is usually a big payoff. A bond between sibs can last a lifetime, often getting stronger as years go by. When you think about it, it’s the longest relationship you will ever have— from the very beginning of your life to the end. Wouldn’t it be nice to make it a great one?&nbsp;</p>
