          <strong>Chapter 9</strong>
        </p>
        <p>He positioned his spark nest - as he thought of it- at the base of the rock, used his thumb to make a small depression in the middle, and slammed the back of the hatchet down across the black rock. A cloud of sparks rained down, most of them missing the nest, but some, perhaps thirty or so, hit in the depression and of those six or seven found fuel and grew, smouldered and caused the bark to take on the red glow.</p>
        <p>Then they went out.</p>
        <p>Close - he was close. He repositioned the nest, made a new and smaller dent with his thumb, and struck again. More sparks, a slight glow then nothing.</p>
        <p>It’s me, he thought. I’m doing something wrong. I do not know this-a cave dweller would have had a fire by now, a Cro-Magnon man would have a fire by now but I don’t know this. I don’t know how to make a fire.</p>
        <p>Maybe not enough sparks. He settled the nest in place once more and hit the rock with a series of blows, as fast as he could. The sparks poured like a golden waterfall. At first they seemed to take, there were several, many sparks that found life and took briefly, but they all died.</p>
        <p>Starved.</p>
        <p>He leaned back They are like me. They are starving. It wasn’t quantity, there were plenty of sparks, but they needed more.</p>
        <p>I would kill, he thought suddenly, for a book of matches. Just one book. Just one match. I would kill.</p>
        <p>What makes fire? He thought back to school. To all those science classes. Had he ever learned what made a fire? Did a teacher ever stand up there and say, “This is what makes a fire. . . “ He shook his head, tried to focus his thoughts.</p>
        <p>What did it take? You have to have fuel, he thought-and he had that. The bark was fuel. Oxygen-there had to be air. He needed to add air. He had to fan on it, blow on it.</p>
        <p>He made the nest ready again, held the hatchet backward, tensed, and struck four quick blows. Sparks came down and he leaned forward as fast as he could and blew.</p>
        <p>Too hard. There was a bright, almost intense glow, then it was gone. He had blown it out. Another set of strikes, more sparks. He leaned and blew, but gently this time, holding back and aiming the stream of air from his mouth to hit the brightest spot. Five or six sparks had fallen in a tight mass of bark hair and Brian centred his efforts there.</p>
        <p>The sparks grew with his gentle breath. The red glow moved from the sparks themselves into the bark, moved and grew and became worms, glowing red worms that crawled up the bark hairs and caught other threads of bark and grew until there was a pocket of red as big as a quarter, a $owing red coal of heat. And when he ran out of breath and paused to inhale, the red ball suddenly burst into flame.</p>
        <p>“Fire!” He yelled. “I’ve got fire! I’ve got it, I’ve got it, I’ve got it . . . “</p>
        <p>But the flames were thick and oily and burning fast, consuming the ball of bark as fast as if it were gasoline. He had to feed the flames, keep them going. Stoking as fast as he could he carefully placed the dried grass and wood pieces he had tried at first on top of the bark and was gratified to see them take.</p>
        <p>But they would go fast. He needed more, and more. He could not let the flames go out. He ran from the shelter to the pines and started breaking off the low, dead smdl limbs. These he threw in the shelter, went back for more, threw those in, and squatted to break and feed the hungry flames. When the small wood was going well he went out and found larger wood and did not relax until that was going. Then he leaned back against the wood brace of his door opening and smiled.</p>
        <p>I have a friend, he thought-I have a friend now. A hungry friend, but a good one.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I have a friend named fire.</p>
        <p>“Hello, fire... “</p>
        <p>The curve of the rock back made an almost perfect drawing flue that carried the smoke up through the cracks of the roof but held the heat. If he kept the fire small it would be perfect and would keep anything like the porcupine from coming through the door again.</p>

The red glow moved from the sparks themselves into the bark, moved and grew and became worms, glowing red worms that crawled up the bark hairs and caught other threads of bark and grew until there was a pocket of red as big as a quarter, a $owing red coal of heat. And when he ran out of breath and paused to inhale, the red ball suddenly burst into flame.</p>
        <p>“Fire!” He yelled. “I’ve got fire! I’ve got it, I’ve got it, I’ve got it . . . “</p>
        <p>But the flames were thick and oily and burning fast, consuming the ball of bark as fast as if it were gasoline. He had to feed the flames, keep them going. Stoking as fast as he could he carefully placed the dried grass and wood pieces he had tried at first on top of the bark and was gratified to see them take.</p>
        <p>But they would go fast. He needed more, and more. He could not let the flames go out. He ran from the shelter to the pines and started breaking off the low, dead smdl limbs. These he threw in the shelter, went back for more, threw those in, and squatted to break and feed the hungry flames. When the small wood was going well he went out and found larger wood and did not relax until that was going. Then he leaned back against the wood brace of his door opening and smiled.</p>
        <p>I have a friend, he thought-I have a friend now. A hungry friend, but a good one.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I have a friend named fire.</p>
        <p>“Hello, fire... “</p>
        <p>The curve of the rock back made an almost perfect drawing flue that carried the smoke up through the cracks of the roof but held the heat. If he kept the fire small it would be perfect and would keep anything like the porcupine from coming through the door again.</p>

        <p>He positioned his spark nest - as he thought of it- at the base of the rock, used his thumb to make a small depression in the middle, and slammed the back of the hatchet down across the black rock. A cloud of sparks rained down, most of them missing the nest, but some, perhaps thirty or so, hit in the depression and of those six or seven found fuel and grew, smouldered and caused the bark to take on the red glow.</p>
        <p>Then they went out.</p>
        <p>Close - he was close. He repositioned the nest, made a new and smaller dent with his thumb, and struck again. More sparks, a slight glow then nothing.</p>
        <p>It’s me, he thought. I’m doing something wrong. I do not know this-a cave dweller would have had a fire by now, a Cro-Magnon man would have a fire by now but I don’t know this. I don’t know how to make a fire.</p>
        <p>Maybe not enough sparks. He settled the nest in place once more and hit the rock with a series of blows, as fast as he could. The sparks poured like a golden waterfall. At first they seemed to take, there were several, many sparks that found life and took briefly, but they all died.</p>
        <p>Starved.</p>
        <p>He leaned back They are like me. They are starving. It wasn’t quantity, there were plenty of sparks, but they needed more.</p>
        <p>I would kill, he thought suddenly, for a book of matches. Just one book. Just one match. I would kill.</p>
        <p>What makes fire? He thought back to school. To all those science classes. Had he ever learned what made a fire? Did a teacher ever stand up there and say, “This is what makes a fire. . . “ He shook his head, tried to focus his thoughts.</p>
        <p>What did it take? You have to have fuel, he thought-and he had that. The bark was fuel. Oxygen-there had to be air. He needed to add air. He had to fan on it, blow on it.</p>
        <p>He made the nest ready again, held the hatchet backward, tensed, and struck four quick blows. Sparks came down and he leaned forward as fast as he could and blew.</p>
        <p>Too hard. There was a bright, almost intense glow, then it was gone. He had blown it out. Another set of strikes, more sparks. He leaned and blew, but gently this time, holding back and aiming the stream of air from his mouth to hit the brightest spot. Five or six sparks had fallen in a tight mass of bark hair and Brian centred his efforts there.</p>
        <p>The sparks grew with his gentle breath. The red glow moved from the sparks themselves into the bark, moved and grew and became worms, glowing red worms that crawled up the bark hairs and caught other threads of bark and grew until there was a pocket of red as big as a quarter, a $owing red coal of heat.

          <strong>Chapter 12</strong>
        </p>
        <p>He saw some young birch, and they were springy, but they lacked snap somehow, as did the willows. Not enough whip-back Halfway up the lake, just as he started to step over a log, he was absolutely terrified by an explosion under his feet. Something like a feathered bomb blew up and away in flurry of leaves and thunder.</p>
        <p>It frightened him so badly that he fell back and down and then it was gone, leaving only an image in his mind. A bird, it had been, about the size of a very small chicken only with a fantail and stubby wings that slammed against its body and made loud noise.</p>
        <p>Noise there and gone. He got up and brushed himself off. The bird had been speckled, brown and grey, and it must not be very smart because Brian’s foot had been nearly on it before it flew. Half a second more and he would have stepped on it. And caught it, he thought, and eaten it. He might be able to catch one, or spear one. Maybe, he thought, maybe it tasted like chicken. Maybe he could catch one or spear one and it probably did taste just like chicken. Just like chicken when his mother baked it in the oven with garlic and salt and it turned golden brown and crackled....</p>
        <p>He shook his head to drive the picture out and moved down to the shore. There was a tree there with long branches that seemed straight and when he pulled on one of them and let go it had an almost vicious snap to it. He picked one of the limbs that seemed right and began chopping where the limb joined the tree. The wood was hard and he didn’t want to cause it to split so he took his time, took small chips and concentrated so hard that at first he didn’t hear it.</p>
        <p>A persistent whine, like the insects only more steady with an edge of a roar to it, was in his ears and he chopped and cut and was thinking of a bow, how he would make a bow, how it would be when he shaped it with the hatchet and still the sound did not cut through until the limb was nearly off the tree and the whine was inside his head and he knew it then.</p>
        <p>A plane! It was a motor, far off but seeming to get louder. They were coming for him! He threw down the limb and his spear and, holding the hatchet, he started to run for camp. He had to get fire up on the bluff and signal them, get fire and smoke up. He put all of his life into his legs, jumped logs and moved through brush like a light ghost, swivelling and running, his lungs filling and blowing and now the sound was louder, coming in his direction. If not right at him, at least closer.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He could see it all in his mind now, the picture, the way it would be. He would get the fire going and the plane would see the smoke and circle, circle once, then again, and waggle its wings. It would be a float plane and it would land on the water and come across the lake and the pilot would be amazed that he was alive after all these days.</p>
        <p>AII this he saw as he ran for the camp and the fire. They would take him from here and this night, this very night, he would sit with his father and eat and tell him all the things. He could see it now. Oh, yes, all as he ran in the sun, his legs liquid springs.</p>
        <p>He got to the camp still hearing the whine of the engine, and one stick of wood still had good flame. He dove inside and grabbed the wood and ran around the edge of the ridge, scrambled up like a cat and blew and nearly had the flame feeding, growing when the sound moved away.</p>
        <p>It was abrupt, as if the plane had turned. He shielded the sun from his eyes and tried to see it, tried to make the plane become real in his eyes. But the trees were so high, so thick and now the sound was still fainter. He kneeled again to the flames and blew and added grass and chips and the flames fed and grew and in moments he had a bonfire as high as his head but the sound was gone now.</p>
        <p>Look back, he thought, Iook back and see the smoke now and turn, please turn.</p>
        <p>“Look back” he whispered, feeling all the pictures fade, seeing his father’s face fade like the sound, like lost dreams, like an end to hope. “Oh, turn now and come back look back and see the smoke and turn for me....”</p>
        <p>But it kept moving away until he could not hear it even in his imagination, in his soul. Gone. He stood on the bluff over the lake, his face cooking in the roaring bonfire, watching the clouds of ash and smoke going into the sky and thought - no, more than thought - he knew then that he would not get out of this place. Not now, not ever.<br>

          <strong>Chapter 12</strong>
        </p>
        <p>He saw some young birch, and they were springy, but they lacked snap somehow, as did the willows. Not enough whip-back Halfway up the lake, just as he started to step over a log, he was absolutely terrified by an explosion under his feet. Something like a feathered bomb blew up and away in flurry of leaves and thunder.</p>
        <p>It frightened him so badly that he fell back and down and then it was gone, leaving only an image in his mind. A bird, it had been, about the size of a very small chicken only with a fantail and stubby wings that slammed against its body and made loud noise.</p>
        <p>Noise there and gone. He got up and brushed himself off. The bird had been speckled, brown and grey, and it must not be very smart because Brian’s foot had been nearly on it before it flew. Half a second more and he would have stepped on it. And caught it, he thought, and eaten it. He might be able to catch one, or spear one. Maybe, he thought, maybe it tasted like chicken. Maybe he could catch one or spear one and it probably did taste just like chicken. Just like chicken when his mother baked it in the oven with garlic and salt and it turned golden brown and crackled....</p>
        <p>He shook his head to drive the picture out and moved down to the shore. There was a tree there with long branches that seemed straight and when he pulled on one of them and let go it had an almost vicious snap to it. He picked one of the limbs that seemed right and began chopping where the limb joined the tree. The wood was hard and he didn’t want to cause it to split so he took his time, took small chips and concentrated so hard that at first he didn’t hear it.</p>
        <p>A persistent whine, like the insects only more steady with an edge of a roar to it, was in his ears and he chopped and cut and was thinking of a bow, how he would make a bow, how it would be when he shaped it with the hatchet and still the sound did not cut through until the limb was nearly off the tree and the whine was inside his head and he knew it then.</p>
        <p>A plane! It was a motor, far off but seeming to get louder. They were coming for him! He threw down the limb and his spear and, holding the hatchet, he started to run for camp. He had to get fire up on the bluff and signal them, get fire and smoke up. He put all of his life into his legs, jumped logs and moved through brush like a light ghost, swivelling and running, his lungs filling and blowing and now the sound was louder, coming in his direction. If not right at him, at least closer.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He could see it all in his mind now, the picture, the way it would be. He would get the fire going and the plane would see the smoke and circle, circle once, then again, and waggle its wings. It would be a float plane and it would land on the water and come across the lake and the pilot would be amazed that he was alive after all these days.</p>
        <p>AII this he saw as he ran for the camp and the fire. They would take him from here and this night, this very night, he would sit with his father and eat and tell him all the things. He could see it now. Oh, yes, all as he ran in the sun, his legs liquid springs.</p>
        <p>He got to the camp still hearing the whine of the engine, and one stick of wood still had good flame. He dove inside and grabbed the wood and ran around the edge of the ridge, scrambled up like a cat and blew and nearly had the flame feeding, growing when the sound moved away.</p>
        <p>It was abrupt, as if the plane had turned. He shielded the sun from his eyes and tried to see it, tried to make the plane become real in his eyes. But the trees were so high, so thick and now the sound was still fainter. He kneeled again to the flames and blew and added grass and chips and the flames fed and grew and in moments he had a bonfire as high as his head but the sound was gone now.</p>
        <p>Look back, he thought, Iook back and see the smoke now and turn, please turn.</p>
        <p>“Look back” he whispered, feeling all the pictures fade, seeing his father’s face fade like the sound, like lost dreams, like an end to hope. “Oh, turn now and come back look back and see the smoke and turn for me....”</p>
        <p>But it kept moving away until he could not hear it even in his imagination, in his soul. Gone. He stood on the bluff over the lake, his face cooking in the roaring bonfire, watching the clouds of ash and smoke going into the sky and thought - no, more than thought - he knew then that he would not get out of this place. Not now, not ever.<br>

          <strong>Chapter 12</strong>
        </p>
        <p>He saw some young birch, and they were springy, but they lacked snap somehow, as did the willows. Not enough whip-back Halfway up the lake, just as he started to step over a log, he was absolutely terrified by an explosion under his feet. Something like a feathered bomb blew up and away in flurry of leaves and thunder.</p>
        <p>It frightened him so badly that he fell back and down and then it was gone, leaving only an image in his mind. A bird, it had been, about the size of a very small chicken only with a fantail and stubby wings that slammed against its body and made loud noise.</p>
        <p>Noise there and gone. He got up and brushed himself off. The bird had been speckled, brown and grey, and it must not be very smart because Brian’s foot had been nearly on it before it flew. Half a second more and he would have stepped on it. And caught it, he thought, and eaten it. He might be able to catch one, or spear one. Maybe, he thought, maybe it tasted like chicken. Maybe he could catch one or spear one and it probably did taste just like chicken. Just like chicken when his mother baked it in the oven with garlic and salt and it turned golden brown and crackled....</p>
        <p>He shook his head to drive the picture out and moved down to the shore. There was a tree there with long branches that seemed straight and when he pulled on one of them and let go it had an almost vicious snap to it. He picked one of the limbs that seemed right and began chopping where the limb joined the tree. The wood was hard and he didn’t want to cause it to split so he took his time, took small chips and concentrated so hard that at first he didn’t hear it.</p>
        <p>A persistent whine, like the insects only more steady with an edge of a roar to it, was in his ears and he chopped and cut and was thinking of a bow, how he would make a bow, how it would be when he shaped it with the hatchet and still the sound did not cut through until the limb was nearly off the tree and the whine was inside his head and he knew it then.</p>
        <p>A plane! It was a motor, far off but seeming to get louder. They were coming for him! He threw down the limb and his spear and, holding the hatchet, he started to run for camp. He had to get fire up on the bluff and signal them, get fire and smoke up. He put all of his life into his legs, jumped logs and moved through brush like a light ghost, swivelling and running, his lungs filling and blowing and now the sound was louder, coming in his direction. If not right at him, at least closer.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He could see it all in his mind now, the picture, the way it would be. He would get the fire going and the plane would see the smoke and circle, circle once, then again, and waggle its wings. It would be a float plane and it would land on the water and come across the lake and the pilot would be amazed that he was alive after all these days.</p>
        <p>AII this he saw as he ran for the camp and the fire. They would take him from here and this night, this very night, he would sit with his father and eat and tell him all the things. He could see it now. Oh, yes, all as he ran in the sun, his legs liquid springs.</p>
        <p>He got to the camp still hearing the whine of the engine, and one stick of wood still had good flame. He dove inside and grabbed the wood and ran around the edge of the ridge, scrambled up like a cat and blew and nearly had the flame feeding, growing when the sound moved away.</p>
        <p>It was abrupt, as if the plane had turned. He shielded the sun from his eyes and tried to see it, tried to make the plane become real in his eyes. But the trees were so high, so thick and now the sound was still fainter. He kneeled again to the flames and blew and added grass and chips and the flames fed and grew and in moments he had a bonfire as high as his head but the sound was gone now.</p>
        <p>Look back, he thought, Iook back and see the smoke now and turn, please turn.</p>
        <p>“Look back” he whispered, feeling all the pictures fade, seeing his father’s face fade like the sound, like lost dreams, like an end to hope. “Oh, turn now and come back look back and see the smoke and turn for me....”</p>
        <p>But it kept moving away until he could not hear it even in his imagination, in his soul. Gone. He stood on the bluff over the lake, his face cooking in the roaring bonfire, watching the clouds of ash and smoke going into the sky and thought - no, more than thought - he knew then that he would not get out of this place. Not now, not ever.<br>

          <strong>Chapter 16</strong>
        </p>
        <p>There had been many First Days. First Arrow Day - when he had used thread from his tattered old piece of windbreaker and some pitch from a stump to put slivers of feather on a dry willow shaft and make an arrow that would fly correctly. Not accurately-he never got redly good with it-but fly correctly so that if a rabbit or a foolbird sat in one place long enough, close enough, and he had enough arrows, he could hit it.</p>
        <p>That brought First Rabbit Day-when he killed one of the large rabbits with an arrow and skinned it as he had the first bird, cooked it the same to find the meat as good-not as rich as the bird, but still good - and there were strips of fat on the back of the rabbit that cooked into the meat to make it richer.</p>
        <p>Now he went back and forth between rabbits and foolbirds when he could, filling in with fish in the middle. Always hungry. I am always hungry, but I can do it now, I can get food and I know I can get food and it makes me more. I know what I can do.</p>
        <p>He moved closer to the lake to a stand of nut brush. These were thick bushes with little stickler pods that held green nuts-nuts that he thought he mlght be able to eat but they weren’t ripe yet. He was out for a foolbird and they liked to hide in the base of the thick part of the nut brush, back in where the stems were close together and provided cover.</p>
        <p>In the second clump he saw a bird, moved close to it, paused when the head feathers came up and it made a sound like a cricket-a sign of alarm just before it flew-then moved closer when the feathers went down and the bird relaxed. He did this four times, never looking at the bird directly, moving toward it at an angle so that it seemed he was moving off to the side-he had perfected this method after many attempts and it worked so well that he had actually caught one with his bare hands - until he was standing less than three feet from the bird, which was frozen in a hiding attitude in the brush.</p>
        <p>The bird held for him and he put an arrow to the bow, one of the feathered arrows, not a fish arrow and drew and released. It was a clean miss and he took another arrow out of the cloth pouch, at his belt, which he’d made from a piece of his windbreaker sleeve, tied at one end to make a bottom.</p>
        <p>The foolbird sat still for him and he did not look directly at it until he drew the second arrow and aimed and released and missed again This time the bird jerked a bit and the arrow stuck next to it so close it almost brushed its breast. Brian only had two more arrows and he debated moving slowly to change the spear over to his right hand and use that to kill the bird. One more shot, he decided, he would try it again. He slowly brought another arrow out, put it on the string, and aimed and released and this time saw the flurry of feathers that meant he had made a hit.</p>
        <p>The bird had been struck off-centre and was flopping around wildly. Brian jumped on it and grabbed it and slammed it 4gainst the ground once, sharply, to kill it. Then he stood and retrieved his arrows and made sure they were dl right and went down to the lake to wash the blood off his hands. He kneeled at the water’s edge and put the dead bird and his weapons down and dipped his hands into the water.</p>
        <p>It was very nearly the last act of his life. Later he would not know why he started to turn -some smell or sound. A tiny brushing sound. But something caught his ear or nose and he began to turn, and had his head half around, when he saw a brown wall of fur detach itself from the forest to his rear and come down on him like a runaway truck. He just had time to see that it was a moose - he knew them from pictures but did not know, could not guess how large they were - when it hit him. It was a cow and she had no horns, but she took him in the left side of the back with her forehead, took him and threw him out into the water and then came after him to finish the job.</p>
        <p>He had another half-second to fill his lungs with air and she was on him again, using her head to drive him down into the mud of the bottom. Insane, he thought. Just that, the word, insane. Mud filled his eyes, his ears, the horn boss on the moose drove him deeper and deeper into the bottom mulch and suddenly it was over and he felt alone.</p>
        <p>He sputtered to the surface, sucking air and fighting panic, and when he wiped the mud and water out of his eyes and cleared them he saw the cow standing sideways to him, not ten feet away, calmly chewing on a lily pad root. She didn’t appear to even see him, or didn’t seem to care about him, and Brian turned carefully and began to swim-crawl out of the water.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As soon as he moved, the hair on her back went up and she charged him again, using her head and front hooves this time, slamming him back and down into the water, on his back this time, and he screamed the air out of his lungs and hammered on her head with his fists and filled his throat with water and she left again. Once more he came to the surface. But he was hurt now, hurt inside, hurt in his ribs and he stayed hunched over, pretended to be dead. She was standing again, eating. Brian studied her out of one eye, looking to the bank with the other, wondering how seriously he was injured, wondering if she would let him go this time.</p>
        <p>Insane.</p>

          <strong>Chapter 16</strong>
        </p>
        <p>There had been many First Days. First Arrow Day - when he had used thread from his tattered old piece of windbreaker and some pitch from a stump to put slivers of feather on a dry willow shaft and make an arrow that would fly correctly. Not accurately-he never got redly good with it-but fly correctly so that if a rabbit or a foolbird sat in one place long enough, close enough, and he had enough arrows, he could hit it.</p>
        <p>That brought First Rabbit Day-when he killed one of the large rabbits with an arrow and skinned it as he had the first bird, cooked it the same to find the meat as good-not as rich as the bird, but still good - and there were strips of fat on the back of the rabbit that cooked into the meat to make it richer.</p>
        <p>Now he went back and forth between rabbits and foolbirds when he could, filling in with fish in the middle. Always hungry. I am always hungry, but I can do it now, I can get food and I know I can get food and it makes me more. I know what I can do.</p>
        <p>He moved closer to the lake to a stand of nut brush. These were thick bushes with little stickler pods that held green nuts-nuts that he thought he mlght be able to eat but they weren’t ripe yet. He was out for a foolbird and they liked to hide in the base of the thick part of the nut brush, back in where the stems were close together and provided cover.</p>
        <p>In the second clump he saw a bird, moved close to it, paused when the head feathers came up and it made a sound like a cricket-a sign of alarm just before it flew-then moved closer when the feathers went down and the bird relaxed. He did this four times, never looking at the bird directly, moving toward it at an angle so that it seemed he was moving off to the side-he had perfected this method after many attempts and it worked so well that he had actually caught one with his bare hands - until he was standing less than three feet from the bird, which was frozen in a hiding attitude in the brush.</p>
        <p>The bird held for him and he put an arrow to the bow, one of the feathered arrows, not a fish arrow and drew and released. It was a clean miss and he took another arrow out of the cloth pouch, at his belt, which he’d made from a piece of his windbreaker sleeve, tied at one end to make a bottom.</p>
        <p>The foolbird sat still for him and he did not look directly at it until he drew the second arrow and aimed and released and missed again This time the bird jerked a bit and the arrow stuck next to it so close it almost brushed its breast. Brian only had two more arrows and he debated moving slowly to change the spear over to his right hand and use that to kill the bird. One more shot, he decided, he would try it again. He slowly brought another arrow out, put it on the string, and aimed and released and this time saw the flurry of feathers that meant he had made a hit.</p>

Then he stood and retrieved his arrows and made sure they were dl right and went down to the lake to wash the blood off his hands.

But something caught his ear or nose and he began to turn, and had his head half around, when he saw a brown wall of fur detach itself from the forest to his rear and come down on him like a runaway truck.

        <p>As soon as he moved, the hair on her back went up and she charged him again, using her head and front hooves this time, slamming him back and down into the water, on his back this time, and he screamed the air out of his lungs and hammered on her head with his fists and filled his throat with water and she left again. Once more he came to the surface. But he was hurt now, hurt inside, hurt in his ribs and he stayed hunched over, pretended to be dead. She was standing again, eating. Brian studied her out of one eye, looking to the bank with the other, wondering how seriously he was injured, wondering if she would let him go this time.</p>

          <strong>Chapter 16</strong>
        </p>
        <p>There had been many First Days. First Arrow Day - when he had used thread from his tattered old piece of windbreaker and some pitch from a stump to put slivers of feather on a dry willow shaft and make an arrow that would fly correctly. Not accurately-he never got redly good with it-but fly correctly so that if a rabbit or a foolbird sat in one place long enough, close enough, and he had enough arrows, he could hit it.</p>
        <p>That brought First Rabbit Day-when he killed one of the large rabbits with an arrow and skinned it as he had the first bird, cooked it the same to find the meat as good-not as rich as the bird, but still good - and there were strips of fat on the back of the rabbit that cooked into the meat to make it richer.</p>
        <p>Now he went back and forth between rabbits and foolbirds when he could, filling in with fish in the middle. Always hungry. I am always hungry, but I can do it now, I can get food and I know I can get food and it makes me more. I know what I can do.</p>
        <p>He moved closer to the lake to a stand of nut brush. These were thick bushes with little stickler pods that held green nuts-nuts that he thought he mlght be able to eat but they weren’t ripe yet. He was out for a foolbird and they liked to hide in the base of the thick part of the nut brush, back in where the stems were close together and provided cover.</p>
        <p>In the second clump he saw a bird, moved close to it, paused when the head feathers came up and it made a sound like a cricket-a sign of alarm just before it flew-then moved closer when the feathers went down and the bird relaxed. He did this four times, never looking at the bird directly, moving toward it at an angle so that it seemed he was moving off to the side-he had perfected this method after many attempts and it worked so well that he had actually caught one with his bare hands - until he was standing less than three feet from the bird, which was frozen in a hiding attitude in the brush.</p>
        <p>The bird held for him and he put an arrow to the bow, one of the feathered arrows, not a fish arrow and drew and released. It was a clean miss and he took another arrow out of the cloth pouch, at his belt, which he’d made from a piece of his windbreaker sleeve, tied at one end to make a bottom.</p>
        <p>The foolbird sat still for him and he did not look directly at it until he drew the second arrow and aimed and released and missed again This time the bird jerked a bit and the arrow stuck next to it so close it almost brushed its breast. Brian only had two more arrows and he debated moving slowly to change the spear over to his right hand and use that to kill the bird. One more shot, he decided, he would try it again. He slowly brought another arrow out, put it on the string, and aimed and released and this time saw the flurry of feathers that meant he had made a hit.</p>
        <p>The bird had been struck off-centre and was flopping around wildly. Brian jumped on it and grabbed it and slammed it 4gainst the ground once, sharply, to kill it. Then he stood and retrieved his arrows and made sure they were dl right and went down to the lake to wash the blood off his hands. He kneeled at the water’s edge and put the dead bird and his weapons down and dipped his hands into the water.</p>
        <p>It was very nearly the last act of his life. Later he would not know why he started to turn -some smell or sound. A tiny brushing sound. But something caught his ear or nose and he began to turn, and had his head half around, when he saw a brown wall of fur detach itself from the forest to his rear and come down on him like a runaway truck. He just had time to see that it was a moose - he knew them from pictures but did not know, could not guess how large they were - when it hit him. It was a cow and she had no horns, but she took him in the left side of the back with her forehead, took him and threw him out into the water and then came after him to finish the job.</p>
        <p>He had another half-second to fill his lungs with air and she was on him again, using her head to drive him down into the mud of the bottom. Insane, he thought. Just that, the word, insane. Mud filled his eyes, his ears, the horn boss on the moose drove him deeper and deeper into the bottom mulch and suddenly it was over and he felt alone.</p>
        <p>He sputtered to the surface, sucking air and fighting panic, and when he wiped the mud and water out of his eyes and cleared them he saw the cow standing sideways to him, not ten feet away, calmly chewing on a lily pad root. She didn’t appear to even see him, or didn’t seem to care about him, and Brian turned carefully and began to swim-crawl out of the water.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Chapter 16</strong>
        </p>
        <p>There had been many First Days. First Arrow Day - when he had used thread from his tattered old piece of windbreaker and some pitch from a stump to put slivers of feather on a dry willow shaft and make an arrow that would fly correctly. Not accurately-he never got redly good with it-but fly correctly so that if a rabbit or a foolbird sat in one place long enough, close enough, and he had enough arrows, he could hit it.</p>
        <p>That brought First Rabbit Day-when he killed one of the large rabbits with an arrow and skinned it as he had the first bird, cooked it the same to find the meat as good-not as rich as the bird, but still good - and there were strips of fat on the back of the rabbit that cooked into the meat to make it richer.</p>
        <p>Now he went back and forth between rabbits and foolbirds when he could, filling in with fish in the middle. Always hungry. I am always hungry, but I can do it now, I can get food and I know I can get food and it makes me more. I know what I can do.</p>
        <p>He moved closer to the lake to a stand of nut brush. These were thick bushes with little stickler pods that held green nuts-nuts that he thought he mlght be able to eat but they weren’t ripe yet. He was out for a foolbird and they liked to hide in the base of the thick part of the nut brush, back in where the stems were close together and provided cover.</p>
        <p>In the second clump he saw a bird, moved close to it, paused when the head feathers came up and it made a sound like a cricket-a sign of alarm just before it flew-then moved closer when the feathers went down and the bird relaxed. He did this four times, never looking at the bird directly, moving toward it at an angle so that it seemed he was moving off to the side-he had perfected this method after many attempts and it worked so well that he had actually caught one with his bare hands - until he was standing less than three feet from the bird, which was frozen in a hiding attitude in the brush.</p>
        <p>The bird held for him and he put an arrow to the bow, one of the feathered arrows, not a fish arrow and drew and released. It was a clean miss and he took another arrow out of the cloth pouch, at his belt, which he’d made from a piece of his windbreaker sleeve, tied at one end to make a bottom.</p>
        <p>The foolbird sat still for him and he did not look directly at it until he drew the second arrow and aimed and released and missed again This time the bird jerked a bit and the arrow stuck next to it so close it almost brushed its breast. Brian only had two more arrows and he debated moving slowly to change the spear over to his right hand and use that to kill the bird. One more shot, he decided, he would try it again. He slowly brought another arrow out, put it on the string, and aimed and released and this time saw the flurry of feathers that meant he had made a hit.</p>
        <p>The bird had been struck off-centre and was flopping around wildly. Brian jumped on it and grabbed it and slammed it 4gainst the ground once, sharply, to kill it. Then he stood and retrieved his arrows and made sure they were dl right and went down to the lake to wash the blood off his hands. He kneeled at the water’s edge and put the dead bird and his weapons down and dipped his hands into the water.</p>
        <p>It was very nearly the last act of his life. Later he would not know why he started to turn -some smell or sound. A tiny brushing sound. But something caught his ear or nose and he began to turn, and had his head half around, when he saw a brown wall of fur detach itself from the forest to his rear and come down on him like a runaway truck. He just had time to see that it was a moose - he knew them from pictures but did not know, could not guess how large they were - when it hit him. It was a cow and she had no horns, but she took him in the left side of the back with her forehead, took him and threw him out into the water and then came after him to finish the job.</p>
        <p>He had another half-second to fill his lungs with air and she was on him again, using her head to drive him down into the mud of the bottom. Insane, he thought. Just that, the word, insane. Mud filled his eyes, his ears, the horn boss on the moose drove him deeper and deeper into the bottom mulch and suddenly it was over and he felt alone.</p>
        <p>He sputtered to the surface, sucking air and fighting panic, and when he wiped the mud and water out of his eyes and cleared them he saw the cow standing sideways to him, not ten feet away, calmly chewing on a lily pad root. She didn’t appear to even see him, or didn’t seem to care about him, and Brian turned carefully and began to swim-crawl out of the water.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As soon as he moved, the hair on her back went up and she charged him again, using her head and front hooves this time, slamming him back and down into the water, on his back this time, and he screamed the air out of his lungs and hammered on her head with his fists and filled his throat with water and she left again. Once more he came to the surface. But he was hurt now, hurt inside, hurt in his ribs and he stayed hunched over, pretended to be dead. She was standing again, eating. Brian studied her out of one eye, looking to the bank with the other, wondering how seriously he was injured, wondering if she would let him go this time.</p>
        <p>Insane.</p>

          <strong>Chapter 18 - 19</strong>
        </p>
        <p>He held back for a moment, uncomfortable with the thought of getting inside the plane. What if the tail settled back to the bottom and he got caught and couldn’t get out? It was a horrible thought. But then he reconsidered. The thing had been up now for two days, plus a bit, and he had been hammering and climbing on it and it hadn’t gone back down. It seemed pretty solid. He eeled in through the cables and formers, wiggling and pulling until he was inside the tail with his head clear of the surface of the water and his legs down on the angled floor. When he was ready, he took a deep breath and pushed down along the floor with his legs, feeling for some kind of fabric or cloth – anything - with his bare feet. He touched nothing but the floor plates.<br>
Up, a new breath, then he reached down to formers underwater and pulled himself beneath the water, his legs pushing down and down almost to the backs of the front seats and finally, on the left side of the plane, he thought he felt his foot hit cloth or canvas.</p>
        <p>Up for more air, deep breathing, then one more grab at the formers and pushing as hard as he could he jammed his feet down and he hit it again, definitely canvas or heavy nylon, and this time when he pushed his foot he thought he felt something inside it; something hard. It had to be the bag. Driven forward by the crash, it was jammed into the backs of the seats and caught on something. He tried to reach for it and pull but didn’t have the air left and went up for more.</p>
        <p>Lungs filled in great gulps, he shot down again, pulling on the formers until he was almost there, then wheeling down head first he grabbed at the cloth. It was the survival bag. He pulled and tore at it to loosen it and just as it broke free and his heart leaped to feel it rise he looked up, above the bag. In the light coming through the side window, the pale green light from the water, he saw the pilot’s head only it wasn’t the pilot’s head any longer.</p>
        <p>The fish. He’d never really thought of it, but the fish - the fish he had been eating all this time had to eat, too. They had been at the pilot all this time, almost two months, nibbling and chewing and all that remained was the not quite cleaned skull and when he looked up it wobbled loosely.</p>
        <p>Too much. Too much. His mind screamed in horror and he slammed back and was sick in the water, sick so that he choked on it and tried to breathe water and could have ended there, ended with the pilot where it almost ended when they first arrived except that his legs jerked. It was instinctive, fear more than anything else, fear of what he had seen.</p>
        <p>But they jerked and pushed and he was headed up when they jerked and he shot to the surface, still inside the birdcage of formers and cables. His head slammed into a bracket as he cleared and he reached up to grab it and was free, in the air, hanging up in the tail.</p>
        <p>He hung that way for several minutes, choking and heaving and gasping for air, fighting to clear the picture of the pilot from his mind. It went slowly; he knew it would never completely leave but he looked to the shore and there were trees and birds, the sun was getting low and golden over his shelter and when he stopped coughing, he could hear the gentle sounds of evening, the peace sounds, the bird sounds and the breeze in the trees.</p>
        <p>The peace finally came to him and he settled his breathing. He was still a long way from being finished-had a lot of work to do. The bag was floating next to him but he had to get it out of the plane and onto the raft, then back to shore. … It seemed to take forever and when at last his feet hit bottom and he could push against the mud and slide the raft into the shore weeds to bump against the bank he was so weak he couldn’t stand, had to crawl; so tired he didn’t even notice the mosquitos that tore into him like a grey, angry cloud. He had done it. That’s all he could think now. He had done it. …</p>
        <p>Treasure. Unbelievable riches. He could not believe the contents of the survival pack The night before he was so numb with exhaustion he couldn’t do anything but sleep. All day in the water had tired him so much that, in the end, he had fallen asleep sifting against his shelter wall, oblivious even to the mosquitos, to the night, to anything. But with false gray dawn he had awakened instantly and began to dig in the pack - to find amazing, wonderful things.<br>
There was a sleeping bag - which he hung to dry over his shelter roof on the outside ---and a foam sleeping pad. An aluminium cook set with four little pots and two frying pans; it actually even had a fork and knife and spoon. A waterproof container with matches and two small butane lighters. A sheath knife with a compass in the handle. As if a compass would help him, he thought, smiling. A first-aid kit with bandages and tubes of antiseptic paste and small scissors. A cap that said Cessna across the front in large letters. Why a cap? he wondered. It was adjustable and he put it on immediately. A fishing kit with four coils of line, a dozen small lures, and hooks and sinkers.</p>
        <p>Incredible wealth. It was like all the holidays in the world, all the birthdays there were. He sat in the sun by the doorway where he had dropped the night before and pulled the presents - as he thought of them - out one at a time to examine them, tum them in the light, touch them and feel them with his hands and eyes.</p>

          <strong>Chapter 18 - 19</strong>
        </p>
        <p>He held back for a moment, uncomfortable with the thought of getting inside the plane. What if the tail settled back to the bottom and he got caught and couldn’t get out? It was a horrible thought. But then he reconsidered. The thing had been up now for two days, plus a bit, and he had been hammering and climbing on it and it hadn’t gone back down. It seemed pretty solid. He eeled in through the cables and formers, wiggling and pulling until he was inside the tail with his head clear of the surface of the water and his legs down on the angled floor. When he was ready, he took a deep breath and pushed down along the floor with his legs, feeling for some kind of fabric or cloth – anything - with his bare feet. He touched nothing but the floor plates.<br>
Up, a new breath, then he reached down to formers underwater and pulled himself beneath the water, his legs pushing down and down almost to the backs of the front seats and finally, on the left side of the plane, he thought he felt his foot hit cloth or canvas.</p>
        <p>Up for more air, deep breathing, then one more grab at the formers and pushing as hard as he could he jammed his feet down and he hit it again, definitely canvas or heavy nylon, and this time when he pushed his foot he thought he felt something inside it; something hard. It had to be the bag. Driven forward by the crash, it was jammed into the backs of the seats and caught on something. He tried to reach for it and pull but didn’t have the air left and went up for more.</p>
        <p>Lungs filled in great gulps, he shot down again, pulling on the formers until he was almost there, then wheeling down head first he grabbed at the cloth. It was the survival bag. He pulled and tore at it to loosen it and just as it broke free and his heart leaped to feel it rise he looked up, above the bag. In the light coming through the side window, the pale green light from the water, he saw the pilot’s head only it wasn’t the pilot’s head any longer.</p>
        <p>The fish. He’d never really thought of it, but the fish - the fish he had been eating all this time had to eat, too. They had been at the pilot all this time, almost two months, nibbling and chewing and all that remained was the not quite cleaned skull and when he looked up it wobbled loosely.</p>
        <p>Too much. Too much. His mind screamed in horror and he slammed back and was sick in the water, sick so that he choked on it and tried to breathe water and could have ended there, ended with the pilot where it almost ended when they first arrived except that his legs jerked. It was instinctive, fear more than anything else, fear of what he had seen.</p>
        <p>But they jerked and pushed and he was headed up when they jerked and he shot to the surface, still inside the birdcage of formers and cables. His head slammed into a bracket as he cleared and he reached up to grab it and was free, in the air, hanging up in the tail.</p>
        <p>He hung that way for several minutes, choking and heaving and gasping for air, fighting to clear the picture of the pilot from his mind. It went slowly; he knew it would never completely leave but he looked to the shore and there were trees and birds, the sun was getting low and golden over his shelter and when he stopped coughing, he could hear the gentle sounds of evening, the peace sounds, the bird sounds and the breeze in the trees.</p>
        <p>The peace finally came to him and he settled his breathing. He was still a long way from being finished-had a lot of work to do. The bag was floating next to him but he had to get it out of the plane and onto the raft, then back to shore. … It seemed to take forever and when at last his feet hit bottom and he could push against the mud and slide the raft into the shore weeds to bump against the bank he was so weak he couldn’t stand, had to crawl; so tired he didn’t even notice the mosquitos that tore into him like a grey, angry cloud. He had done it. That’s all he could think now. He had done it. …</p>
        <p>Treasure. Unbelievable riches. He could not believe the contents of the survival pack The night before he was so numb with exhaustion he couldn’t do anything but sleep. All day in the water had tired him so much that, in the end, he had fallen asleep sifting against his shelter wall, oblivious even to the mosquitos, to the night, to anything. But with false gray dawn he had awakened instantly and began to dig in the pack - to find amazing, wonderful things.<br>
There was a sleeping bag - which he hung to dry over his shelter roof on the outside ---and a foam sleeping pad. An aluminium cook set with four little pots and two frying pans; it actually even had a fork and knife and spoon. A waterproof container with matches and two small butane lighters. A sheath knife with a compass in the handle. As if a compass would help him, he thought, smiling. A first-aid kit with bandages and tubes of antiseptic paste and small scissors. A cap that said Cessna across the front in large letters. Why a cap? he wondered. It was adjustable and he put it on immediately. A fishing kit with four coils of line, a dozen small lures, and hooks and sinkers.</p>
        <p>Incredible wealth. It was like all the holidays in the world, all the birthdays there were. He sat in the sun by the doorway where he had dropped the night before and pulled the presents - as he thought of them - out one at a time to examine them, tum them in the light, touch them and feel them with his hands and eyes.</p>

          <strong>Chapter 18 - 19</strong>
        </p>
        <p>He held back for a moment, uncomfortable with the thought of getting inside the plane. What if the tail settled back to the bottom and he got caught and couldn’t get out? It was a horrible thought. But then he reconsidered. The thing had been up now for two days, plus a bit, and he had been hammering and climbing on it and it hadn’t gone back down. It seemed pretty solid. He eeled in through the cables and formers, wiggling and pulling until he was inside the tail with his head clear of the surface of the water and his legs down on the angled floor. When he was ready, he took a deep breath and pushed down along the floor with his legs, feeling for some kind of fabric or cloth – anything - with his bare feet. He touched nothing but the floor plates.<br>
Up, a new breath, then he reached down to formers underwater and pulled himself beneath the water, his legs pushing down and down almost to the backs of the front seats and finally, on the left side of the plane, he thought he felt his foot hit cloth or canvas.</p>
        <p>Up for more air, deep breathing, then one more grab at the formers and pushing as hard as he could he jammed his feet down and he hit it again, definitely canvas or heavy nylon, and this time when he pushed his foot he thought he felt something inside it; something hard. It had to be the bag. Driven forward by the crash, it was jammed into the backs of the seats and caught on something. He tried to reach for it and pull but didn’t have the air left and went up for more.</p>
        <p>Lungs filled in great gulps, he shot down again, pulling on the formers until he was almost there, then wheeling down head first he grabbed at the cloth. It was the survival bag. He pulled and tore at it to loosen it and just as it broke free and his heart leaped to feel it rise he looked up, above the bag. In the light coming through the side window, the pale green light from the water, he saw the pilot’s head only it wasn’t the pilot’s head any longer.</p>
        <p>The fish. He’d never really thought of it, but the fish - the fish he had been eating all this time had to eat, too. They had been at the pilot all this time, almost two months, nibbling and chewing and all that remained was the not quite cleaned skull and when he looked up it wobbled loosely.</p>
        <p>Too much. Too much. His mind screamed in horror and he slammed back and was sick in the water, sick so that he choked on it and tried to breathe water and could have ended there, ended with the pilot where it almost ended when they first arrived except that his legs jerked. It was instinctive, fear more than anything else, fear of what he had seen.</p>
        <p>But they jerked and pushed and he was headed up when they jerked and he shot to the surface, still inside the birdcage of formers and cables. His head slammed into a bracket as he cleared and he reached up to grab it and was free, in the air, hanging up in the tail.</p>
        <p>He hung that way for several minutes, choking and heaving and gasping for air, fighting to clear the picture of the pilot from his mind. It went slowly; he knew it would never completely leave but he looked to the shore and there were trees and birds, the sun was getting low and golden over his shelter and when he stopped coughing, he could hear the gentle sounds of evening, the peace sounds, the bird sounds and the breeze in the trees.</p>
        <p>The peace finally came to him and he settled his breathing. He was still a long way from being finished-had a lot of work to do. The bag was floating next to him but he had to get it out of the plane and onto the raft, then back to shore. … It seemed to take forever and when at last his feet hit bottom and he could push against the mud and slide the raft into the shore weeds to bump against the bank he was so weak he couldn’t stand, had to crawl; so tired he didn’t even notice the mosquitos that tore into him like a grey, angry cloud. He had done it. That’s all he could think now. He had done it. …</p>
        <p>Treasure. Unbelievable riches. He could not believe the contents of the survival pack The night before he was so numb with exhaustion he couldn’t do anything but sleep. All day in the water had tired him so much that, in the end, he had fallen asleep sifting against his shelter wall, oblivious even to the mosquitos, to the night, to anything. But with false gray dawn he had awakened instantly and began to dig in the pack - to find amazing, wonderful things.<br>
There was a sleeping bag - which he hung to dry over his shelter roof on the outside ---and a foam sleeping pad. An aluminium cook set with four little pots and two frying pans; it actually even had a fork and knife and spoon. A waterproof container with matches and two small butane lighters. A sheath knife with a compass in the handle. As if a compass would help him, he thought, smiling. A first-aid kit with bandages and tubes of antiseptic paste and small scissors. A cap that said Cessna across the front in large letters. Why a cap? he wondered. It was adjustable and he put it on immediately. A fishing kit with four coils of line, a dozen small lures, and hooks and sinkers.</p>
        <p>Incredible wealth. It was like all the holidays in the world, all the birthdays there were. He sat in the sun by the doorway where he had dropped the night before and pulled the presents - as he thought of them - out one at a time to examine them, tum them in the light, touch them and feel them with his hands and eyes.</p>

          <strong>Chapter 18 - 19</strong>
        </p>
        <p>He held back for a moment, uncomfortable with the thought of getting inside the plane. What if the tail settled back to the bottom and he got caught and couldn’t get out? It was a horrible thought. But then he reconsidered. The thing had been up now for two days, plus a bit, and he had been hammering and climbing on it and it hadn’t gone back down. It seemed pretty solid. He eeled in through the cables and formers, wiggling and pulling until he was inside the tail with his head clear of the surface of the water and his legs down on the angled floor. When he was ready, he took a deep breath and pushed down along the floor with his legs, feeling for some kind of fabric or cloth – anything - with his bare feet. He touched nothing but the floor plates.<br>
Up, a new breath, then he reached down to formers underwater and pulled himself beneath the water, his legs pushing down and down almost to the backs of the front seats and finally, on the left side of the plane, he thought he felt his foot hit cloth or canvas.</p>
        <p>Up for more air, deep breathing, then one more grab at the formers and pushing as hard as he could he jammed his feet down and he hit it again, definitely canvas or heavy nylon, and this time when he pushed his foot he thought he felt something inside it; something hard. It had to be the bag. Driven forward by the crash, it was jammed into the backs of the seats and caught on something. He tried to reach for it and pull but didn’t have the air left and went up for more.</p>
        <p>Lungs filled in great gulps, he shot down again, pulling on the formers until he was almost there, then wheeling down head first he grabbed at the cloth. It was the survival bag. He pulled and tore at it to loosen it and just as it broke free and his heart leaped to feel it rise he looked up, above the bag. In the light coming through the side window, the pale green light from the water, he saw the pilot’s head only it wasn’t the pilot’s head any longer.</p>
        <p>The fish. He’d never really thought of it, but the fish - the fish he had been eating all this time had to eat, too. They had been at the pilot all this time, almost two months, nibbling and chewing and all that remained was the not quite cleaned skull and when he looked up it wobbled loosely.</p>
        <p>Too much. Too much. His mind screamed in horror and he slammed back and was sick in the water, sick so that he choked on it and tried to breathe water and could have ended there, ended with the pilot where it almost ended when they first arrived except that his legs jerked. It was instinctive, fear more than anything else, fear of what he had seen.</p>
        <p>But they jerked and pushed and he was headed up when they jerked and he shot to the surface, still inside the birdcage of formers and cables. His head slammed into a bracket as he cleared and he reached up to grab it and was free, in the air, hanging up in the tail.</p>
        <p>He hung that way for several minutes, choking and heaving and gasping for air, fighting to clear the picture of the pilot from his mind. It went slowly; he knew it would never completely leave but he looked to the shore and there were trees and birds, the sun was getting low and golden over his shelter and when he stopped coughing, he could hear the gentle sounds of evening, the peace sounds, the bird sounds and the breeze in the trees.</p>
        <p>The peace finally came to him and he settled his breathing. He was still a long way from being finished-had a lot of work to do. The bag was floating next to him but he had to get it out of the plane and onto the raft, then back to shore. … It seemed to take forever and when at last his feet hit bottom and he could push against the mud and slide the raft into the shore weeds to bump against the bank he was so weak he couldn’t stand, had to crawl; so tired he didn’t even notice the mosquitos that tore into him like a grey, angry cloud. He had done it. That’s all he could think now. He had done it. …</p>
        <p>Treasure. Unbelievable riches. He could not believe the contents of the survival pack The night before he was so numb with exhaustion he couldn’t do anything but sleep. All day in the water had tired him so much that, in the end, he had fallen asleep sifting against his shelter wall, oblivious even to the mosquitos, to the night, to anything. But with false gray dawn he had awakened instantly and began to dig in the pack - to find amazing, wonderful things.<br>
There was a sleeping bag - which he hung to dry over his shelter roof on the outside ---and a foam sleeping pad. An aluminium cook set with four little pots and two frying pans; it actually even had a fork and knife and spoon. A waterproof container with matches and two small butane lighters. A sheath knife with a compass in the handle. As if a compass would help him, he thought, smiling. A first-aid kit with bandages and tubes of antiseptic paste and small scissors. A cap that said Cessna across the front in large letters. Why a cap? he wondered. It was adjustable and he put it on immediately. A fishing kit with four coils of line, a dozen small lures, and hooks and sinkers.</p>
        <p>Incredible wealth. It was like all the holidays in the world, all the birthdays there were. He sat in the sun by the doorway where he had dropped the night before and pulled the presents - as he thought of them - out one at a time to examine them, tum them in the light, touch them and feel them with his hands and eyes.</p>

NOAA renews program to bring Southern Resident orca population back from decline</p>
        <p>The Southern Residents were chosen to be part of the Species in the Spotlight program to rescue the population from near "certain" extinction. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) renewed an initiative aiming to stabilise the Southern Resident Killer Whale population living in the Puget Sound. NOAA started the Species in the Spotlight program to provide targeted, immediate efforts to halt the decline and stabilise populations of the Southern Resident orcas and several other species thought to be headed for extinction in the United States.</p>
        <p><strong>1&nbsp;</strong>………. The Southern Resident whales are considered to be a recovery priority by NOAA, which means their "extinction is almost certain in the immediate future because of rapid population decline or habitat destruction, and because of conflicts with construction, development, or economic activity," according to NOAA's plan.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One of the major threats facing Southern Resident orcas is insufficient prey. <strong>2</strong> ………. The whales are also exposed to high levels of contaminants and are impacted by ships and noise pollution that affects their behavior and makes it harder for them to find and capture prey, according to the organization. NOAA reported the trajectory of the Southern Residents' population is still declining, even with the addition of three new calves born since the summer census count in 2020.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The next phase of NOAA's program will include protecting orcas from harmful vessel impacts, targeting conservation efforts of the orcas' prey, improving knowledge about the current health of Southern Resident Killer Whales. <strong>3</strong> ……….</p>
        <p>More positive news is that Orca ‘celebrities’ Tl’uk and Chainsaw were among 56 total killer whales spotted in the Salish Sea over Easter weekend. Naturalists had a whale of a time over the Easter weekend spotting four different pods of Bigg's killer whales in the Salish Sea, including two orcas known for their standout appearance. <strong>4</strong> ………. In all, the Pacific Whale Watch Association reported seeing 56 orcas over the weekend.</p>
        <p>Among a group travelling up Haro Strait, which is the boundary waters between the U.S. and Canada, was a Bigg’s killer whale named “Chainsaw.” <strong>5</strong> ………. Bigg’s killer whale “Chainsaw” swims with his pod in the Salish Sea.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Another high-profile orca spotted over the weekend was a transient whale known for its distinctive grey and white coloration. Researchers nicknamed the orca “Tl’uk,” which translates to “moon” in the language of the Indigenous Coast Salish people, because of his lunar-like grayish-white color.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"It's a pretty fabulous day out there whenever we see whales, but to have multiple groups including two ‘celebrities’ (Tl’uk and Chainsaw) in the neighbourhood is an extra special treat," said Val Shore, a professional naturalist and photographer with Eagle Wing Whale &amp; Wildlife Tours of Victoria. <strong>6</strong> ……….</p>
        <p>The Bigg’s killer whale population was 349 in 2018 and has been growing around 4% each year through the 2010s, according to researchers. The Pacific Whale Watch Association said over 200 Bigg’s killer whales are spotted in the Salish Sea each year</p>

I remember seeing her face and falling in love. Those deep blue eyes. A clean coat, all black. Except for one spot, just below her left eye. It was as though she had a black eye, but it was white. And she had the cutest meow.<br>
<br>
I remember staring into her eyes just as she stared back at me. I told the man that I wanted this kitten. No other would suffice. This kitten, named Jess, she would be mine. I will be hers.<br>
<br>
I remember taking her home. She was purring so loudly, I could hardly hear the radio in the background. She loved having her chin rubbed. Her eyes were closed as her tail swayed back and forth.<br>
<br>
I remember watching her jump out of my arms onto the floor. She began walking around. Her new home was one big puzzle. She was going to piece it all together. She started in the living room, made her way to the kitchen, through the halls, and soon she found my room. Her room.<br>
<br>
I remember the next 14 years with Jess. We did everything together. She was my best friend. I never felt alone. I always had her when no one else was available. I was sad to leave her when I went to college. They wouldn't allow pets in the dorms. But I was ready to see her during Thanksgiving break.<br>
<br>
I remember that call. I didn't move for several minutes. My mum kept asking if I was okay. Of course I wasn't. Jess wasn't okay. Our stupid neighbour let his son drive without a license. He ran over Jess. The vet wasn't sure if she'd make it.<br>
<br>
I remember driving home. That long drive home. It took everything in me not to cry the entire time. I couldn't deal with this. My best friend, gone. I didn't even get to say goodbye.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
At the time, it felt as if I were opening my eyes for the very first time; I felt as if it were the very first moment of my life.<br>
<br>
Our existence, our lives, they are the culmination of our memories and of experiences. They teach us how to behave around others, who to trust and who to avoid. How to get ready for the day, how to deal with hurt, how to drown in bliss.<br>
<br>
They are the infinite files tucked away in our minds, instruction manuals for life; so imagine waking from that deep place and finding that the warehouse with all those files suddenly lay barren.<br>
<br>
What would you do? I would simply scratch my head and flip the switch that drowns the place in darkness, never to be of use again. But when it came to life, I didn't have that luxury.<br>
<br>
When I awoke upon the soft cushion that was my bed, I was lost. I instinctively rummaged the recesses of my mind, trying to find any sign, any remnant of something that could help me. I knew something was missing, the sudden absence leaving me unnerved, a hollow pit left where my memories once were. I almost felt as if I could stick a hand inside and rummage around an abandoned skull. Yet still I searched, hoping that at the very least, I could find a shadow of what I once had, of who I once was.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
The first day I flew, it is such a crystalline memory. I can close my eyes and relive the moment I left the earth. The clench, fear, panic as my hands slipped from the bar, and the relief, wonder, joy as when I just kept going up.<br>
<br>
I was twelve, and it was the third day of a cub scout summer camp. My mum had been busy that morning. She just had time to bag me a sandwich, hand me a tube of sunscreen, and drop me off at the scout leader’s house. I put on the sunscreen as I sat on the front porch and waited for the leader’s son to be ready. Soon, we were off.<br>
<br>
At the camp, I bolted out of the car to find my friend, Patrick. He was already on the playground. I don't remember what we did before we got to the monkey bars. The monkey bars were my favourite. For days I had been trying to convince him to join me on the high bar. I don't know how tall it was, but it was up there. I would scramble onto the chest high sand box and leap off the edge to grab hold of the bar. I was good. My parents had sent me to some gymnastics classes and I could spin and whip circles around the bar. I felt big up there, taunting my friend to join me. I was a bit of a show-off. On that morning of the third day, I was once again telling him how safe and easy it was. "Watch me," I said as I climbed onto the sandbox. I lept, grabbed hold of the bar and swung. Instantly, I knew something was wrong. Too late I realised what was wrong. The first two days my mother had put my sunscreen on, and I had never thought of how slick the cream would be. How the greasiness of it would linger on my hands.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Thumbing through the dusty scrapbook, I zero in on a Polaroid of my grandmother, pruning the roses in her garden. I caught her at just the right time - a gloved hand blocking the sunlight from her eyes and only her smile visible beneath the shadow, a few pink roses lay beside her on the ground, and everything warm and bright.<br>
<br>
Tears come to my eyes as I remember her wake, the smell of fresh-cut roses in bouquets around her coffin, the pink lipstick she wore to the grave. I sat beside my mother in the front row, holding her hand while she soaked through every new tissue with her tears. I consoled her and snuggled into her side as person after person stepped up to the podium to speak, to sing, to cry, to grieve, to remember, to pray. At last, the minister walked up and smiled.<br>
<br>
​“Ginny was one of the best women.”<br>
<br>
And I was gone. I ripped my hand out of my mother’s, I raced to the door, and I pushed past attendants and family members. I held my breath as I darted into the bathroom and locked the door behind me.&nbsp;<br>
