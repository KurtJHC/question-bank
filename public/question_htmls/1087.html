        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>The Sound of the Shell&nbsp;</strong><br><em>by William Golding, ‘Lord of the Flies’</em><br><br>
The boy with fair hair lowered himself down the last few feet of rock and began to pick his way toward the lagoon. Though he had taken off his school sweater and trailed it now from one hand, his grey shirt stuck to him and his hair was plastered to his forehead. All round him where the long scar smashed into <span class="txt-underline"><strong>the jungle was a bath of heat</strong></span>. He was clambering heavily among the creepers and broken trunks when a bird, a vision of red and yellow, flashed upwards with a witch-like cry; and this cry was echoed by another.</p>
        <p>“Hi!” it said. “Wait a minute!” The undergrowth at the side of the scar was shaken and a multitude of raindrops fell pattering.</p>
        <p>“Wait a minute,” the voice said. “I got caught up.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fair boy stopped and <span class="txt-underline"><strong>jerked his stockings up</strong></span> with an automatic gesture that made the jungle seem for a moment like the Home Counties. The voice spoke again.</p>
        <p>“I can’t hardly move with all these creeper things.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The owner of the voice came backing out of the undergrowth so that twigs scratched on a greasy wind-breaker. The naked crooks of his knees were plump, caught and scratched by thorns. He bent down, removed the thorns carefully, and turned around. He was shorter than the fair boy and very fat. He came forward, searching out safe lodgments for his feet, and then looked up through thick spectacles. “Where’s the man with the megaphone?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fair boy shook his head. “This is an island. At least I think it’s an island. That’s a reef out in the sea. Perhaps there aren’t any grownups anywhere.”</p>
        <p>The fat boy looked startled. “There was that pilot. But he wasn’t in the passenger cabin, he was up in front.” The fair boy was peering at the reef through screwed-up eyes. “All them other kids,” the fat boy went on. “Some of them must have got out. They must have, mustn’t they?”</p>
        <p>The fair boy began to pick his way as casually as possible toward the water. He tried to be offhand and not too obviously uninterested, but the fat boy hurried after him. “Aren’t there any grownups at all?”</p>
        <p>“I don’t think so.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fair boy said this solemnly; but then the delight of a realised ambition overcame him. In the middle of the scar he stood on his head and grinned at the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>reversed</strong></span> fat boy. “No grownups!”</p>
        <p>The fat boy thought for a moment. “That pilot.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fair boy allowed his feet to come down and sat on the steamy earth. “He must have flown off after he dropped us. He couldn’t land here. Not in a place with wheels.”</p>
        <p>“We was attacked!”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“He’ll be back all right.”</p>
        <p>The fat boy shook his head. “<span class="txt-underline"><strong>When we was coming down I looked through one of them windows</strong></span>. I saw the other part of the plane. There were flames coming out of it.” He looked up and down the scar. “And this is what the cabin done.”</p>
        <p>The fair boy reached out and touched the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>jagged end of a trunk</strong></span>. For a moment he looked interested. “What happened to it?” he asked. “Where’s it got to now?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“That storm dragged it out to sea. It wasn’t half dangerous with all them tree trunks falling.” The shore was fledged with palm trees. These stood or leaned or reclined against the light and their green feathers were a hundred feet up in the air. The ground beneath them was a bank covered with coarse grass, torn everywhere by the upheavals of fallen trees, scattered with decaying coconuts and palm saplings. Behind this was the darkness of the forest proper and the open space of the scar.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>The Sound of the Shell&nbsp;</strong><br><em>by William Golding, ‘Lord of the Flies’</em><br><br>
The boy with fair hair lowered himself down the last few feet of rock and began to pick his way toward the lagoon. Though he had taken off his school sweater and trailed it now from one hand, his grey shirt stuck to him and his hair was plastered to his forehead. All round him where the long scar smashed into <span class="txt-underline"><strong>the jungle was a bath of heat</strong></span>. He was clambering heavily among the creepers and broken trunks when a bird, a vision of red and yellow, flashed upwards with a witch-like cry; and this cry was echoed by another.</p>
        <p>“Hi!” it said. “Wait a minute!” The undergrowth at the side of the scar was shaken and a multitude of raindrops fell pattering.</p>
        <p>“Wait a minute,” the voice said. “I got caught up.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fair boy stopped and <span class="txt-underline"><strong>jerked his stockings up</strong></span> with an automatic gesture that made the jungle seem for a moment like the Home Counties. The voice spoke again.</p>
        <p>“I can’t hardly move with all these creeper things.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The owner of the voice came backing out of the undergrowth so that twigs scratched on a greasy wind-breaker. The naked crooks of his knees were plump, caught and scratched by thorns. He bent down, removed the thorns carefully, and turned around. He was shorter than the fair boy and very fat. He came forward, searching out safe lodgments for his feet, and then looked up through thick spectacles. “Where’s the man with the megaphone?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fair boy shook his head. “This is an island. At least I think it’s an island. That’s a reef out in the sea. Perhaps there aren’t any grownups anywhere.”</p>
        <p>The fat boy looked startled. “There was that pilot. But he wasn’t in the passenger cabin, he was up in front.” The fair boy was peering at the reef through screwed-up eyes. “All them other kids,” the fat boy went on. “Some of them must have got out. They must have, mustn’t they?”</p>
        <p>The fair boy began to pick his way as casually as possible toward the water. He tried to be offhand and not too obviously uninterested, but the fat boy hurried after him. “Aren’t there any grownups at all?”</p>
        <p>“I don’t think so.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fair boy said this solemnly; but then the delight of a realised ambition overcame him. In the middle of the scar he stood on his head and grinned at the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>reversed</strong></span> fat boy. “No grownups!”</p>
        <p>The fat boy thought for a moment. “That pilot.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fair boy allowed his feet to come down and sat on the steamy earth. “He must have flown off after he dropped us. He couldn’t land here. Not in a place with wheels.”</p>
        <p>“We was attacked!”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“He’ll be back all right.”</p>
        <p>The fat boy shook his head. “<span class="txt-underline"><strong>When we was coming down I looked through one of them windows</strong></span>. I saw the other part of the plane. There were flames coming out of it.” He looked up and down the scar. “And this is what the cabin done.”</p>
        <p>The fair boy reached out and touched the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>jagged end of a trunk</strong></span>. For a moment he looked interested. “What happened to it?” he asked. “Where’s it got to now?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“That storm dragged it out to sea. It wasn’t half dangerous with all them tree trunks falling.” The shore was fledged with palm trees. These stood or leaned or reclined against the light and their green feathers were a hundred feet up in the air. The ground beneath them was a bank covered with coarse grass, torn everywhere by the upheavals of fallen trees, scattered with decaying coconuts and palm saplings. Behind this was the darkness of the forest proper and the open space of the scar.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>The Sound of the Shell&nbsp;</strong><br>
by William Golding, ‘Lord of the Flies’<br>
<br>
The boy with fair hair lowered himself down the last few feet of rock and began to pick his way toward the lagoon. Though he had taken off his school sweater and trailed it now from one hand, his grey shirt stuck to him and his hair was plastered to his forehead. All round him where the long scar smashed into <span class="txt-underline"><strong>the jungle was a bath of heat</strong></span>. He was clambering heavily among the creepers and broken trunks when a bird, a vision of red and yellow, flashed upwards with a witch-like cry; and this cry was echoed by another.</p>
        <p>“Hi!” it said. “Wait a minute!” The undergrowth at the side of the scar was shaken and a multitude of raindrops fell pattering.</p>
        <p>“Wait a minute,” the voice said. “I got caught up.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fair boy stopped and <span class="txt-underline"><strong>jerked his stockings up</strong></span> with an automatic gesture that made the jungle seem for a moment like the Home Counties. The voice spoke again.</p>
        <p>“I can’t hardly move with all these creeper things.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The owner of the voice came backing out of the undergrowth so that twigs scratched on a greasy wind-breaker. The naked crooks of his knees were plump, caught and scratched by thorns. He bent down, removed the thorns carefully, and turned around. He was shorter than the fair boy and very fat. He came forward, searching out safe lodgments for his feet, and then looked up through thick spectacles. “Where’s the man with the megaphone?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fair boy shook his head. “This is an island. At least I think it’s an island. That’s a reef out in the sea. Perhaps there aren’t any grownups anywhere.”</p>
        <p>The fat boy looked startled. “There was that pilot. But he wasn’t in the passenger cabin, he was up in front.” The fair boy was peering at the reef through screwed-up eyes. “All them other kids,” the fat boy went on. “Some of them must have got out. They must have, mustn’t they?”</p>
        <p>The fair boy began to pick his way as casually as possible toward the water. He tried to be offhand and not too obviously uninterested, but the fat boy hurried after him. “Aren’t there any grownups at all?”</p>
        <p>“I don’t think so.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fair boy said this solemnly; but then the delight of a realised ambition overcame him. In the middle of the scar he stood on his head and grinned at the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>reversed</strong></span> fat boy. “No grownups!”</p>
        <p>The fat boy thought for a moment. “That pilot.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fair boy allowed his feet to come down and sat on the steamy earth. “He must have flown off after he dropped us. He couldn’t land here. Not in a place with wheels.”</p>
        <p>“We was attacked!”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“He’ll be back all right.”</p>
        <p>The fat boy shook his head. “<span class="txt-underline"><strong>When we was coming down I looked through one of them windows</strong></span>. I saw the other part of the plane. There were flames coming out of it.” He looked up and down the scar. “And this is what the cabin done.”</p>
        <p>The fair boy reached out and touched the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>jagged end of a trunk</strong></span>. For a moment he looked interested. “What happened to it?” he asked. “Where’s it got to now?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“That storm dragged it out to sea. It wasn’t half dangerous with all them tree trunks falling.” The shore was fledged with palm trees. These stood or leaned or reclined against the light and their green feathers were a hundred feet up in the air. The ground beneath them was a bank covered with coarse grass, torn everywhere by the upheavals of fallen trees, scattered with decaying coconuts and palm saplings. Behind this was the darkness of the forest proper and the open space of the scar.</p>

        <p>“I can’t hardly move with all these creeper things.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The owner of the voice came backing out of the undergrowth so that twigs scratched on a greasy wind-breaker. The naked crooks of his knees were plump, caught and scratched by thorns. He bent down, removed the thorns carefully, and turned around. He was shorter than the fair boy and very fat. He came forward, searching out safe lodgments for his feet, and then looked up through thick spectacles. “Where’s the man with the megaphone?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fair boy shook his head. “This is an island. At least I think it’s an island. That’s a reef out in the sea. Perhaps there aren’t any grownups anywhere.”</p>
        <p>The fat boy looked startled. “There was that pilot. But he wasn’t in the passenger cabin, he was up in front.” The fair boy was peering at the reef through screwed-up eyes. “All them other kids,” the fat boy went on. “Some of them must have got out. They must have, mustn’t they?”</p>
        <p>The fair boy began to pick his way as casually as possible toward the water. He tried to be offhand and not too obviously uninterested, but the fat boy hurried after him. “Aren’t there any grownups at all?”</p>
        <p>“I don’t think so.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fair boy said this solemnly; but then the delight of a realised ambition overcame him. In the middle of the scar he stood on his head and grinned at the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>reversed</strong></span> fat boy. “No grownups!”</p>
        <p>The fat boy thought for a moment. “That pilot.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fair boy allowed his feet to come down and sat on the steamy earth. “He must have flown off after he dropped us. He couldn’t land here. Not in a place with wheels.”</p>
        <p>“We was attacked!”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“He’ll be back all right.”</p>
        <p>The fat boy shook his head. “<span class="txt-underline"><strong>When we was coming down I looked through one of them windows</strong></span>. I saw the other part of the plane. There were flames coming out of it.” He looked up and down the scar. “And this is what the cabin done.”</p>
        <p>The fair boy reached out and touched the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>jagged end of a trunk</strong></span>. For a moment he looked interested. “What happened to it?” he asked. “Where’s it got to now?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“That storm dragged it out to sea. It wasn’t half dangerous with all them tree trunks falling.” The shore was fledged with palm trees. These stood or leaned or reclined against the light and their green feathers were a hundred feet up in the air. The ground beneath them was a bank covered with coarse grass, torn everywhere by the upheavals of fallen trees, scattered with decaying coconuts and palm saplings. Behind this was the darkness of the forest proper and the open space of the scar.</p>

The boy with fair hair lowered himself down the last few feet of rock and began to pick his way toward the lagoon. Though he had taken off his school sweater and trailed it now from one hand, his grey shirt stuck to him and his hair was plastered to his forehead. All round him where the long scar smashed into <span class="txt-underline"><strong>the jungle was a bath of heat</strong></span>. He was clambering heavily among the creepers and broken trunks when a bird, a vision of red and yellow, flashed upwards with a witch-like cry; and this cry was echoed by another.</p>
        <p>“Hi!” it said. “Wait a minute!” The undergrowth at the side of the scar was shaken and a multitude of raindrops fell pattering.</p>
        <p>“Wait a minute,” the voice said. “I got caught up.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fair boy stopped and <span class="txt-underline"><strong>jerked his stockings up</strong></span> with an automatic gesture that made the jungle seem for a moment like the Home Counties. The voice spoke again.</p>
