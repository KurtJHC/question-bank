            <p>I think just about every parent thinks their children are special. And all children are special - I truly believe that. I used to just think that was something people said, but the more I have lived, I see how every single child has something special to offer this world. They don’t all get a chance to show it or use it, but if they are encouraged in what is their special talent, or personality trait, or interest, they will be able to shine. My older son has perfect pitch in music. My middle son understood computers from the age of 2. My daughter knows any song she has heard by heart after hearing it once. My daughter is severely autistic, and both my sons have had their own challenges in life. Being special doesn’t mean you are better than anyone else or should feel superior. But I think it is part of the job of a parent to recognise what is special about their kids.</p>

            <p>I am in Grade 5 at a school near Adarani Tea Garden in Tripura in India. One day when Baba (my father) came home from work, he asked if I had completed my homework. He got very angry when I said I hadn’t. The next day, he took me to his workplace - the tea garden. Baba is a tea picker and spends the entire day in the garden, even if it rains or the sun is too hot. He said, “Look, Vishnu. If you don’t study hard enough, you will not get the&nbsp;right education. And if you don’t get the right education, you will not get a good job. If you don’t get a good job, you’ll have to work in the tea garden like I do. And trust me son, you’ll not love this job. If you are able to do what you love, you will never feel like it’s a burden.”&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>When I came back home, I thought about what Baba had said and started studying hard. And today I was announced as the best student of my class. I think now I will be able to do what I love to, and it won’t feel like a burden to me.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Once upon a time there was a King who had no child and wanted to choose a worthy successor to his throne after he passed away. He called all the young children in his kingdom to his palace one day and said: “I feel it is time for me to choose the next King. I am going to give each one of you one very special seed today. I want you all to go home, plant the seed, water it, nurture it, and come back here to me exactly one year from today with the plant you have grown from this one seed. Whoever grows the best plant will be the Crown Prince, the next King after me.” There was one small shy boy who was there that day and he, like the others, received a seed from the King.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>One year later the children all lined up with their pots. The King inspected all the pots and then escorted the small shy boy to the throne and said to everyone: “One year ago I gave all of you a seed. I told you to take the seed, plant it, water it, and bring it back to me today. But I gave you all boiled seeds that would not grow. Except this honest boy, you have all brought me beautiful plants with exotic flowers. I know you substituted another seed for the one I gave you. This boy was the only one with the sincerity to nurture the barren seed for one whole year with dedication, hope and perseverance and had the courage and honesty to bring me the desolate pot with my seed in it. Therefore, I select him as my Crown Prince to be the next King...!”&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Children need to know that courage isn’t about something magical that happens inside us to make us ‘not scared’. It’s about something magical that happens inside us to make us push through fear, self-doubt, anxiety, and do the things that feel hard or risky or frightening. Sometimes, courage only has to happen for seconds at a time – just long enough to be brave enough. There’s something else that kids need to know about courage – you don’t always see the effects of it straight away. Courage might mean being kind to the new kid in class, trying something new, speaking up for something they believe in. Often, these things don’t come with fireworks or applause. In fact, they rarely do. The differences they make can take time to reveal, but when actions are driven by courage, the differences those actions make will always be there, gently taking shape and changing their very important corners of the world in some way.</p>

  Dogs are extremely popular pets, but some people tend to think that they aren’t as convenient as cats because they can be a lot of hard work and aren’t as independent as cats. It’s true, some dogs need a large amount of attention and need to be walked regularly, especially large dogs but they can be very loyal and affectionate. Different breeds have different temperaments, so if you’re thinking about buying a puppy or dog, do some research and find a breed that you think would suit your personality and lifestyle.<br>
