“My life is very monotonous,” the fox said. “I hunt chickens; men hunt me. All the chickens are just alike, and all the men are just alike. And, in consequence, I am a little bored. But if you tame me, it will be as if the sun came to shine on my life. I shall know the sound of a step that will be different from all the others. Other steps send me hurrying back underneath the ground. Yours will call me, like music, out of my burrow. And then look: you see the grain f ields down yonder? I do not eat bread. Wheat is of no use to me. The wheat fields have nothing to say to me. And that is sad. But you have hair that is the colour of gold. Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me! The grain, which is also golden, will bring me back the thought of you. And I shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat . . .” The fox gazed at the little prince, for a long time.</p>
        <p>“Please--tame me!” he said.</p>
        <p>“I want to, very much,” the little prince replied. “But I have not much time. I have friends to discover, and a great many things to understand.”</p>
        <p>“One only understands the things that one tames,” said the fox. “Men have no more time to understand anything. They buy things already made at the shops. But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends any more. If you want a friend, tame me . . .”</p>
        <p>“What must I do, to tame you?” asked the little prince.</p>
        <p>“You must be very patient,” replied the fox. “First you will sit down at a little distance from me--like that--in the grass. I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing. Words are the source of misunderstandings. But you will sit a little closer to me, every day . . .” The next day the little prince came back.</p>
        <p>“It would have been better to come back at the same hour,” said the fox. “If, for example, you come at four o’clock in the afternoon, then at three o’clock I shall begin to be happy. I shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances. At four o’clock, I shall already be worrying and jumping about. I shall show you how happy I am! But if you come at just any time, I shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you . . . One must observe the proper rites . . .”</p>
        <p>“What is a rite?” asked the little prince.</p>
        <p>“Those also are actions too often neglected,” said the fox. “They are what make one day different from other days, one hour from other hours. There is a rite, for example, among my hunters. Every Thursday they dance with the village girls. So Thursday is a wonderful&nbsp;&nbsp;day for me! I can take a walk as far as the vineyards. But if the hunters danced at just any time, every day would be like every other day, and I should never have any vacation at all.” So the little prince tamed the fox. And when the hour of his departure drew near—</p>
        <p>“Ah,” said the fox, “I shall cry.”</p>
        <p>“It is your own fault,” said the little prince. “I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you . . .”</p>
        <p>“Yes, that is so,” said the fox.</p>
        <p>“But now you are going to cry!” said the little prince.</p>
        <p>“Yes, that is so,” said the fox.</p>
        <p>“Then it has done you no good at all!”</p>
        <p>“It has done me good,” said the fox, “<span class="txt-underline"><strong>because of the color of the wheat fields</strong></span>.” And then he added: “Go and look again at the roses. You will understand now that yours is unique in all the world. Then come back to say goodbye to me, and I will make you a present of a secret.” The little prince went away, to look again at the roses.</p>
        <p>“You are not at all like my rose,” he said. “As yet you are nothing. No one has tamed you, and you have tamed no one. You are like my fox when I first knew him. He was only a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But I have made him my friend, and now he is unique in all the world.” And the roses were very much embarrassed. “You are beautiful, but you are empty,” he went on. “One could not die for you. To be sure, an ordinary passer-by would think that my rose looked just like you--the rose that belongs to me. But in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses: because it is she that I have watered; because it is she that I have put under the glass globe; because it is she that I have sheltered behind the screen; because it is for her that I have killed the caterpillars (except the two or three that we saved to become butterflies); because it is she that I have listened to, when she grumbled, or boasted, or ever sometimes when she said nothing. Because she is my rose. And he went back to meet the fox.</p>
        <p>“Goodbye,” he said.</p>
        <p>“Goodbye,” said the fox. “And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.” “What is essential is invisible to the eye,” the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember. “It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.” “It is the time I have wasted for my rose--” said the little prince, so that he would be sure to remember.</p>
        <p>“Men have forgotten this truth,” said the fox. “But you must not forget it. You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed. You are responsible for your rose . . .”</p>
        <p>“I am responsible for my rose,” the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.</p>

But if you tame me, it will be as if the sun came to shine on my life. I shall know the sound of a step that will be different from all the others. Other steps send me hurrying back underneath the ground. Yours will call me, like music, out of my burrow. And then look: you see the grain f ields down yonder? I do not eat bread. Wheat is of no use to me. The wheat fields have nothing to say to me. And that is sad. But you have hair that is the colour of gold. Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me! The grain, which is also golden, will bring me back the thought of you. And I shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat . . .” The fox gazed at the little prince, for a long time.</p>
        <p>“Please--tame me!” he said.</p>
        <p>“I want to, very much,” the little prince replied. “But I have not much time. I have friends to discover, and a great many things to understand.”</p>
        <p>“One only understands the things that one tames,” said the fox. “Men have no more time to understand anything. They buy things already made at the shops. But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends any more. If you want a friend, tame me . . .”</p>
        <p>“What must I do, to tame you?” asked the little prince.</p>
        <p>“You must be very patient,” replied the fox. “First you will sit down at a little distance from me--like that--in the grass. I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing. Words are the source of misunderstandings. But you will sit a little closer to me, every day . . .” The next day the little prince came back.</p>
        <p>“It would have been better to come back at the same hour,” said the fox. “If, for example, you come at four o’clock in the afternoon, then at three o’clock I shall begin to be happy. I shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances. At four o’clock, I shall already be worrying and jumping about. I shall show you how happy I am! But if you come at just any time, I shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you . . . One must observe the proper rites . . .”</p>
        <p>“What is a rite?” asked the little prince.</p>
        <p>“Those also are actions too often neglected,” said the fox. “They are what make one day different from other days, one hour from other hours. There is a rite, for example, among my hunters. Every Thursday they dance with the village girls. So Thursday is a wonderful&nbsp;&nbsp;day for me! I can take a walk as far as the vineyards. But if the hunters danced at just any time, every day would be like every other day, and I should never have any vacation at all.” So the little prince tamed the fox. And when the hour of his departure drew near—</p>
        <p>“Ah,” said the fox, “I shall cry.”</p>
        <p>“It is your own fault,” said the little prince. “I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you . . .”</p>
        <p>“Yes, that is so,” said the fox.</p>
        <p>“But now you are going to cry!” said the little prince.</p>
        <p>“Yes, that is so,” said the fox.</p>
        <p>“Then it has done you no good at all!”</p>
        <p>“It has done me good,” said the fox, “<span class="txt-underline"><strong>because of the color of the wheat fields</strong></span>.” And then he added: “Go and look again at the roses. You will understand now that yours is unique in all the world. Then come back to say goodbye to me, and I will make you a present of a secret.” The little prince went away, to look again at the roses.</p>
        <p>“You are not at all like my rose,” he said. “As yet you are nothing. No one has tamed you, and you have tamed no one. You are like my fox when I first knew him. He was only a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But I have made him my friend, and now he is unique in all the world.” And the roses were very much embarrassed. “You are beautiful, but you are empty,” he went on. “One could not die for you. To be sure, an ordinary passer-by would think that my rose looked just like you--the rose that belongs to me. But in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses: because it is she that I have watered; because it is she that I have put under the glass globe; because it is she that I have sheltered behind the screen; because it is for her that I have killed the caterpillars (except the two or three that we saved to become butterflies); because it is she that I have listened to, when she grumbled, or boasted, or ever sometimes when she said nothing. Because she is my rose. And he went back to meet the fox.</p>
        <p>“Goodbye,” he said.</p>
        <p>“Goodbye,” said the fox. “And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.” “What is essential is invisible to the eye,” the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember. “It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.” “It is the time I have wasted for my rose--” said the little prince, so that he would be sure to remember.</p>
        <p>“Men have forgotten this truth,” said the fox. “But you must not forget it. You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed. You are responsible for your rose . . .”</p>
        <p>“I am responsible for my rose,” the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.</p>

        <p>“Please--tame me!” he said.</p>
        <p>“I want to, very much,” the little prince replied. “But I have not much time. I have friends to discover, and a great many things to understand.”</p>
        <p>“One only understands the things that one tames,” said the fox. “Men have no more time to understand anything. They buy things already made at the shops. But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends any more. If you want a friend, tame me . . .”</p>
        <p>“What must I do, to tame you?” asked the little prince.</p>
        <p>“You must be very patient,” replied the fox. “First you will sit down at a little distance from me--like that--in the grass. I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing. Words are the source of misunderstandings. But you will sit a little closer to me, every day . . .” The next day the little prince came back.</p>
        <p>“It would have been better to come back at the same hour,” said the fox. “If, for example, you come at four o’clock in the afternoon, then at three o’clock I shall begin to be happy. I shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances. At four o’clock, I shall already be worrying and jumping about. I shall show you how happy I am! But if you come at just any time, I shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you . . . One must observe the proper rites . . .”</p>
        <p>“What is a rite?” asked the little prince.</p>
        <p>“Those also are actions too often neglected,” said the fox. “They are what make one day different from other days, one hour from other hours. There is a rite, for example, among my hunters. Every Thursday they dance with the village girls. So Thursday is a wonderful&nbsp;&nbsp;day for me! I can take a walk as far as the vineyards. But if the hunters danced at just any time, every day would be like every other day, and I should never have any vacation at all.” So the little prince tamed the fox. And when the hour of his departure drew near—</p>
        <p>“Ah,” said the fox, “I shall cry.”</p>
        <p>“It is your own fault,” said the little prince. “I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you . . .”</p>
        <p>“Yes, that is so,” said the fox.</p>
        <p>“But now you are going to cry!” said the little prince.</p>
        <p>“Yes, that is so,” said the fox.</p>
        <p>“Then it has done you no good at all!”</p>
        <p>“It has done me good,” said the fox, “<span class="txt-underline"><strong>because of the color of the wheat fields</strong></span>.” And then he added: “Go and look again at the roses. You will understand now that yours is unique in all the world. Then come back to say goodbye to me, and I will make you a present of a secret.” The little prince went away, to look again at the roses.</p>
        <p>“You are not at all like my rose,” he said. “As yet you are nothing. No one has tamed you, and you have tamed no one. You are like my fox when I first knew him. He was only a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But I have made him my friend, and now he is unique in all the world.” And the roses were very much embarrassed. “You are beautiful, but you are empty,” he went on. “One could not die for you. To be sure, an ordinary passer-by would think that my rose looked just like you--the rose that belongs to me. But in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses: because it is she that I have watered; because it is she that I have put under the glass globe; because it is she that I have sheltered behind the screen; because it is for her that I have killed the caterpillars (except the two or three that we saved to become butterflies); because it is she that I have listened to, when she grumbled, or boasted, or ever sometimes when she said nothing. Because she is my rose. And he went back to meet the fox.</p>
        <p>“Goodbye,” he said.</p>
        <p>“Goodbye,” said the fox. “And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.” “What is essential is invisible to the eye,” the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember. “It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.” “It is the time I have wasted for my rose--” said the little prince, so that he would be sure to remember.</p>
        <p>“Men have forgotten this truth,” said the fox. “But you must not forget it. You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed. You are responsible for your rose . . .”</p>
        <p>“I am responsible for my rose,” the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.</p>

And I’ll protect it now.<br>
‘Twas my forefather’s hand<br>
That placed it near his cot;<br>

Oh, spare that agèd oak<br>
Now towering to the skies!<br>
When but an idle boy,<br>
I sought its grateful shade;<br>
In all their gushing joy<br>
Here, too, my sisters played.<br>
My mother kissed me here;<br>
My father pressed my hand-<br>
Forgive this foolish tear,<br>
But let that old oak stand.</p>
        <p>My heart-strings round thee cling,<br>
Close as your bark, old friend!<br>
Here shall the wild-bird sing,<br>
And still your branches bend.<br>
Old tree! the storm still brave!<br>
And, woodman, leave the spot;<br>
While I’ve a hand to save,<br>
Your ax shall harm it not.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>

Woodman, spare that tree!<br>
Touch not a single bough!<br>
In youth it sheltered me,<br>
And I’ll protect it now.<br>
‘Twas my forefather’s hand<br>
That placed it near his cot;<br>
There, woodman, let it stand,<br>
Your ax shall harm it not.</p>
        <p>That old familiar tree,<br>
Whose glory and renown<br>
Are spread o’er land and sea-<br>
And would you hew it down?<br>
Woodman, forbear your stroke!<br>
Cut not its earth-bound ties;<br>
Oh, spare that agèd oak<br>
Now towering to the skies!<br>
When but an idle boy,<br>
I sought its grateful shade;<br>
In all their gushing joy<br>
Here, too, my sisters played.<br>
My mother kissed me here;<br>
My father pressed my hand-<br>
Forgive this foolish tear,<br>
But let that old oak stand.</p>
        <p>My heart-strings round thee cling,<br>
Close as your bark, old friend!<br>
Here shall the wild-bird sing,<br>
And still your branches bend.<br>
Old tree! the storm still brave!<br>
And, woodman, leave the spot;<br>
While I’ve a hand to save,<br>
Your ax shall harm it not.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>

Woodman, spare that tree!<br>
Touch not a single bough!<br>
In youth it sheltered me,<br>
And I’ll protect it now.<br>
‘Twas my forefather’s hand<br>
That placed it near his cot;<br>
There, woodman, let it stand,<br>
Your ax shall harm it not.</p>
        <p>That old familiar tree,<br>
Whose glory and renown<br>
Are spread o’er land and sea-<br>
And would you hew it down?<br>
Woodman, forbear your stroke!<br>
Cut not its earth-bound ties;<br>
Oh, spare that agèd oak<br>
Now towering to the skies!<br>
When but an idle boy,<br>
I sought its grateful shade;<br>
In all their gushing joy<br>
Here, too, my sisters played.<br>
My mother kissed me here;<br>
My father pressed my hand-<br>
Forgive this foolish tear,<br>
But let that old oak stand.</p>
        <p>My heart-strings round thee cling,<br>
Close as your bark, old friend!<br>
Here shall the wild-bird sing,<br>
And still your branches bend.<br>
Old tree! the storm still brave!<br>
And, woodman, leave the spot;<br>
While I’ve a hand to save,<br>
Your ax shall harm it not.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>

        <p><strong>Read the text below. Six sentences have been removed from this text so that there are six gaps.</strong><br><br><strong>CHARLES PERKINS</strong><br><br>
Charles Perkins was a significant figure in the fight for Aboriginal rights in Australia. Born in Alice Springs in 1936 to an Arrernte mother and a Kalkadoon father, he grew up experiencing racial discrimination and segregation. A large part of his childhood was spent in a boys’ home in Adelaide, an experience that deeply influenced his later activism. Like many Aboriginal children placed in such institutions, Perkins faced harsh discipline and a strict environment designed to assimilate Indigenous children into white society. <strong>(A)&nbsp;</strong>.………… The emotional toll of such an upbringing was profound, leaving many Aboriginal children, including Perkins, struggling with identity and connection to their heritage.</p>
        <p>Despite these hardships, Perkins pursued education and became the first Aboriginal person to graduate from university in Australia. He attended the University of Sydney, where he studied anthropology and government. During his time there, he became increasingly involved in student politics and Aboriginal rights advocacy. Inspired by the civil rights movement in the United States, Perkins played a key role in organising the 1965 Freedom Ride, which exposed racial segregation in rural Australian towns. The group, made up of university students, travelled through New South Wales. <strong>(B)</strong> ………… The Freedom Ride brought national attention to the mistreatment of Aboriginal people and contributed to growing pressure for policy changes.</p>
        <p>Following his activism with the Freedom Ride, Perkins continued working towards Aboriginal rights, moving into public service. He became a senior official in the Office of Aboriginal Affairs and later the first Aboriginal person to be appointed as Secretary of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in 1981. In this role, he advocated for Indigenous land rights, economic development, and improved education. <strong>(C)</strong> ………. However, his determination helped bring attention to Indigenous issues at the highest levels of government.</p>
        <p>Perkins’ advocacy extended beyond government work. <strong>(D)</strong> ………… His ability to communicate effectively meant he was a well-known and sometimes controversial public f igure. He was unafraid to confront racism and fight for Aboriginal rights, earning both admiration and criticism. His leadership contributed to significant reforms and shifts in public opinion regarding Indigenous Australians. His work also paved the way for future&nbsp;&nbsp;generations of Aboriginal leaders to take on key roles in government and advocacy.</p>
        <p><strong>(E)</strong> ………… He was awarded an Order of Australia for his service, and his efforts were commemorated through scholarships, documentaries, and educational resources. Perkins’ influence extended beyond his own achievements, as his family, particularly his daughters Rachel and Hetti, continued his legacy through work in activism and the arts. His story remains an essential part of Australian history, symbolising resilience and the power of activism in achieving social change.</p>
        <p>Charles Perkins passed away in 2000, but his impact on Australian society endures. His efforts in education, public service, and activism played a crucial role in improving conditions for Aboriginal people and raising awareness of racial discrimination. <strong>(F)</strong> ……… As a result, he remains an inspirational figure in Australian history. His legacy continues to inspire new generations to advocate for Indigenous rights and social justice.</p>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of daydreaming. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Daydreaming often carries a negative connotation, with many viewing it as a sign of laziness or lack of focus. However, recent research suggests that allowing the mind to wander can enhance problem-solving abilities. When we daydream, our brains engage in a process called “autobiographical planning”, which helps us envision and work through future scenarios. This mental rehearsal can lead to more effective decision making and innovative solutions to complex problems. For instance, a study conducted&nbsp;&nbsp;at the University of British Columbia found that individuals who engaged in daydreaming performed better in tasks requiring imaginative thought. Therefore, rather than dismissing daydreaming as mere distraction, it may be beneficial to recognise its potential in fostering cognitive development and problem-solving skills.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of daydreaming. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
As a child, I often found myself gazing out of the classroom window, lost in a world of my own imagination. These daydreams transported me to fantastical places, offering a respite from the monotony of daily routines. While teachers and parents frequently admonished me for my wandering mind, I now realise that those moments of mental escape were crucial for my creative development. Engaging in daydreaming allowed me to explore new ideas and scenarios, fostering creative juices that have been invaluable in my adult life. It’s essential to recognise that, while staying focused is important, allowing ourselves the freedom to daydream can lead to unexpected insights and a richer inner life.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of daydreaming. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
While daydreaming can serve as a pleasant diversion, excessive indulgence may lead to negative consequences. Individuals who frequently lose themselves in elaborate fantasies might find it challenging to concentrate on tasks at hand, resulting in decreased productivity and potential academic or professional setbacks. Moreover, constant daydreaming can blur the lines between reality and imagination, leading to unrealistic expectations and dissatisfaction with one’s actual circumstances. It’s crucial to strike a balance, ensuring that while we allow our minds the freedom to wander, we remain grounded and attentive to our real-world responsibilities and relationships.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of daydreaming. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Society often undervalues daydreaming, dismissing it as a frivolous activity with no real purpose. However, this perception overlooks the significant role that daydreaming plays in fostering imagination and innovation. Many inventors and artists have attributed their groundbreaking ideas to moments when their minds were free to wander without constraint. For example, Albert Einstein famously conceived the theory of relativity during a daydream about riding a beam of light. Such instances highlight that daydreaming is not merely a passive pastime but a dynamic process that can lead to profound intellectual and creative breakthroughs.<br>
