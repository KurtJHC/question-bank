America’s “Secret Weapon”</strong><br><br>
Phoenix, Arizona—It was one of the most closely guarded secrets during World War II. U.S. military leaders considered it so valuable, they ordered the men who created it to keep it secret long after the war had ended. And keep it they did—even from their own families. Today the Navajo “code talkers” are no longer a secret. Some 400 Navajos who helped change the course of the war will be honored today when artist Doug Hyde’s sculpture Tribute to Navajo Code Talkers is dedicated. Recruited from the small<br>
towns and reservations of the Southwest, these Navajos outwitted Japan’s top cryptographers. The Navajo code was the only code the Japanese were never able to understand.<br>
<br>
In 1942 there were no wireless phones or satellites for communication. Scientists had not yet learned how to scramble voice messages. U.S. commanders had no choice but to send many orders by radio. Unfortunately radio signals were not secure. Anyone with the proper radio equipment could listen to them. This was a big problem at the start of World War II. Many Japanese soldiers had been educated in the United States and spoke English well. Their ability to understand U.S. radio communications gave them an advantage. In some cases they even pretended to be Americans and gave <span class="txt-underline">bogus</span> orders to trick U.S. soldiers.<br>
<br>
The only way to keep information secret was to send it in code. However, the&nbsp;Japanese were able to break U.S. codes almost as fast as the codes were created. The Japanese seemed to know in advance every move the United States made. An unbreakable code was desperately needed.<br>
<br>
Around this time Philip Johnston, an engineer from Los Angeles, read in the newspaper that the military was testing Native American languages as a way to protect radio communications. He immediately contacted the U.S.<br>
government and suggested using the Navajo language. The son of a missionary, Johnston had grown up around the Navajo. He thought their language would be perfect for this<br>
purpose. The unwritten language had no alphabet, and its unique structure was very complex. To anyone who hadn’t spent years learning it, the language was impossible to understand. In fact, Johnston was one of the few non-Navajos who could speak it.<br>
<br>
After a series of successful tests under mock battlefield conditions, the project&nbsp;was approved. Several weeks later a<br>
group of 29 Navajo men began&nbsp;creating the Navajo code. The code was not a simple translation of messages into Navajo. The government did not think that a translation would be safe enough. Instead, the Navajos created a special code from their language. Specific Navajo words were assigned to&nbsp;represent letters in the English alphabet. These letters corresponded to the first letter of the world's English&nbsp;translation. For example, the Navajo word for ant, Wol-la-chee, stood for the letter A. The word base translated into Navajo code was shush (B), wol-la-chee (A), dibeh (S), dzeh (E).<br>
<br>
Not every word in the code had to be spelled out letter by letter. Many common military words were given special Navajo names. For example, the Navajo word for “hummingbird” meant "fighter plane." As a further safeugard, nothing could ever be kept in written form. Each code talker had to memorize the entire code.<br>
<br>
The project was an instant success. The first group of code talkers was soon expanded. Eventually, more than 400 Navajo code talkers would assist in the war in the Pacific. They were&nbsp;considered so important that each was assigned a personal bodyguard. In addition, care was taken to make sure they were never captured. Some experts believe the Navajo code was the key to the U.S. victory. In fact, even after the war the government felt the code was too valuable to <span class="txt-underline">declassify</span>. The Navajo code and the Navajo code talkers<br>
remained a strictly guarded secret for more than 20 years.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
It wasn’t until 1968 that information about the heroic role of the Navajos became public. At that time U.S. soldiers were fighting again - this time in Vietnam. It was a conflict many Americans thought was wrong. During this period some people thought it wasn’t right to honor war heroes. This may be one reason it took another 20 years for the Tribute to Navajo Code Talkers to be built. However, this tribute, a large statue of a Navajo man, does more than recognize the contributions of the code talkers on the battlefield. It also honors the important&nbsp;part these heroes played in restoring peace. The figure in the sculpture holds a flute, an intrument traditionally&nbsp;used by many Native American groups to signal the end of war and the coming of peace. It is one message that the Navajo people hope will someday be understood by everyone.<br>

The word base translated into Navajo code was shush (B), wol-la-chee (A), dibeh (S), dzeh (E).<br>
<br>
Not every word in the code had to be spelled out letter by letter. Many common military words were given special Navajo names. For example, the Navajo word for “hummingbird” meant "fighter plane." As a further safeugard, nothing could ever be kept in written form. Each code talker had to memorize the entire code.<br>
<br>
The project was an instant success. The first group of code talkers was soon expanded. Eventually, more than 400 Navajo code talkers would assist in the war in the Pacific. They were&nbsp;considered so important that each was assigned a personal bodyguard. In addition, care was taken to make sure they were never captured. Some experts believe the Navajo code was the key to the U.S. victory. In fact, even after the war the government felt the code was too valuable to <span class="txt-underline">declassify</span>. The Navajo code and the Navajo code talkers<br>
remained a strictly guarded secret for more than 20 years.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
It wasn’t until 1968 that information about the heroic role of the Navajos became public. At that time U.S. soldiers were fighting again - this time in Vietnam. It was a conflict many Americans thought was wrong. During this period some people thought it wasn’t right to honor war heroes. This may be one reason it took another 20 years for the Tribute to Navajo Code Talkers to be built. However, this tribute, a large statue of a Navajo man, does more than recognize the contributions of the code talkers on the battlefield. It also honors the important&nbsp;part these heroes played in restoring peace. The figure in the sculpture holds a flute, an intrument traditionally&nbsp;used by many Native American groups to signal the end of war and the coming of peace. It is one message that the Navajo people hope will someday be understood by everyone.<br>

In 1933 Myron Scott, a reporter for the Dayton Daily News, saw three boys racing homemade, engineless cars down a hill on a local street. This sight inspired Scott to organize the Soap Box Derby, a coasting race for homemade race cars. Over the next several years, the All-American Soap Box Derby grew into a national event that continues to attract thousands of competitors from across the country.<br>
<br>
<strong>The All-American Soap Box Derby</strong><br>
<br>
<em>1</em> Cliff Hardesty felt his excitement building as he drank in his surroundings. He was actually here in Akron, Ohio, the home of the All-American Soap Box Derby. His eyes followed the long, smooth ribbon of the Derby Downs raceway. The 1,600-foot, cement-covered track was divided into three wide lanes. In just a few days, Cliff and his homemade car would be in one of those lanes, racing for the grand prize. Although there were more than 100 competitors in this year’s derby, only three boys could race at one time. The winner of each heat—as the three-person races were called—would go on to race the winners of other heats, until at last there was only one winner. Cliff didn’t dare dream that he would be that winner.<br>
<br>
<em>2</em> “This race sure has come a long way in the past six years,” a man sitting in the nearby bleachers remarked. “I was in the crowd at the very first soap box derby back in 1933. About 350 boys participated in that race. You should have seen the cars back then. Most of them were made from old crates or heavy sheets of tin. Some of them looked as if they were going to rattle apart.” He chuckled.<br>
<br>
<em>3</em> “In which lane did the winner race?” Cliff asked.<br>
<br>
<em>4</em> “Oh, this fancy track wasn’t used then. In fact, there was no track at all,” the man said. “The boys raced down a big hill. This track here was built just three years ago for the 1936 race.”<br>
<br>
<em>5</em> After chatting with t he man a little bit more, Cliff walked up the hill to the area called Topside, where all the homemade race cars were stored and inspected. He wanted to check on his car. His family had shipped it from his home in White Plains, New York, a few days earlier. Derby guidelines stated that cars had to arrive in time for race officials to look them over and make sure they were safe.<br>
<br>
<em>6</em> Cliff found his car and stood back for a moment, running his eyes over it. It was a beauty. Whether he won the race or not, he knew he had done a good job.<br>
<br>
<em>7</em> Just then a thin man in dark glasses with a clipboard under h is arm walked over to him. “Are you the boy w ho built this car?” The man looked down at his clipboard. “Cliff Hardesty?”<br>
<br>
<em>8</em> “Yes, sir,” Cliff answered with a smile.<br>
<br>
<em>9 </em>The man did not smile back. “Cliff, my name is Mr. Smith. I’ll be very candid with you. The truth is that your car concerns me. The regulations for this event state very clearly that every car entered in the All-American Soap Box Derby must have been built by the boy who will drive it. There can be no help from anyone else.”<br>
<br>
<em>10 </em>“Yes, sir,” Cliff said, still not certain what Mr. Smith was talking about.<br>
<br>
<em>11 </em>Mr. Smith sighed. “Cliff, your car is one of the best we’ve ever seen. Can you honestly expect us to believe that you built it all by yourself ? No one helped you?”<br>
<br>
<em>12 </em>Cliff’s face grew hot as he realized what Mr. Smith was implying. “No, sir. No one helped me. I did everything according to the rules.” He looked Mr. Smith straight in the eye, but his throat felt tight with fear. Was Mr. Smith saying he might not be allowed to race? Would he be <span class="txt-underline">disqualified</span> for building a good car? “Mr. Smith,” Cliff said firmly, “I built this car myself.”<br>
<br>
<em>13 </em>“I’m afraid you’re going to need to prove that,” Mr. Smith said. “We’ve set up a 12-member committee. We’ll ask you questions about how you built your car. We have to make sure that you’ve done everything the way you’re supposed to. If you can satisfy us that your car is legitimate, you can participate in the race.”<br>
<br>
<em>14 </em>Called in front of the committee, Cliff answered question after question about his work on the car. Somewhere in the room a clock ticked very slowly. Cliff watched the faces of the men who would decide his fate. Some of them were easy to read. Others might as well have been carved of stone. The questioning dragged on so long that Cliff began to feel dizzy. At last the committee told Cliff to get some sleep and report back in the morning.<br>
<br>
<em>15 </em>The next morning Cliff was taken to a garage. One of the committee members asked Cliff to reproduce part of his car while they watched. Feeling almost happy, Cliff picked up the tools that had been laid out for him. Finally he would be able to prove that he had built his car. He would demonstrate to the committee members that he had complied with the race requirements and had built his car without any help. He could feel the eyes of the committee members drilling holes in him as he thought about how to begin. Then he decided to pretend he was at home in his own workshop, and he began to work. Soon he was so involved in working on the car, he forgot all about the committee.<br>
<br>
<em>16 </em>After only half an hour, Mr. Smith called o ut, “O.K., Cliff. You can stop.”<br>
<br>
<em>17 </em>Cliff looked up in alarm, but then he relaxed when he saw the smile o n Mr. Smith’s face. “ You’re a very resourceful young man,” Mr. Smith said. “ We can all s ee that you’re building an even better car than the one you’ve entered in tomorrow’s race. Please accept my apologies for doubting you.”<br>
<br>
<em>18 </em>Cliff’s laugh burst from him like air escaping from a<br>
popped balloon. “That’s all right, sir,” he said. “But if you<br>
gentlemen will excuse me now, I need to take my car for a<br>
test run. I plan to win tomorrow’s race, and I want to be<br>
ready.”<br>
<br>
<em>19 </em>Relieved, Cliff eagerly prepared for his test run down the 1,600-foot-long track. He was finally free to do what he had come to Akron for—race his car. As he sped down the track, the car hurtled out of control. His car was wrecked, and Cliff had to be taken to the hospital. Race officials worked all afternoon and through the night to fix Cliff’s car in the hope that he would still be able to race. They didn’t want Cliff’s hard work to have been for nothing.<br>
<br>
<em>20 </em>The next day Cliff was released from the hospital. He was banged up but ready to participate in the race and grateful that his car had been repaired. The victory he achieved that day by winning the sixth annual All - American Soap Box Derby was proof of his talent and of the superiority of his car’s design.<br>

<em>11 </em>Mr. Smith sighed. “Cliff, your car is one of the best we’ve ever seen. Can you honestly expect us to believe that you built it all by yourself ? No one helped you?”<br>
<br>
<em>12 </em>Cliff’s face grew hot as he realized what Mr. Smith was implying. “No, sir. No one helped me. I did everything according to the rules.” He looked Mr. Smith straight in the eye, but his throat felt tight with fear. Was Mr. Smith saying he might not be allowed to race? Would he be <span class="txt-underline">disqualified</span> for building a good car? “Mr. Smith,” Cliff said firmly, “I built this car myself.”<br>
<br>
<em>13 </em>“I’m afraid you’re going to need to prove that,” Mr. Smith said. “We’ve set up a 12-member committee. We’ll ask you questions about how you built your car. We have to make sure that you’ve done everything the way you’re supposed to. If you can satisfy us that your car is legitimate, you can participate in the race.”<br>
<br>
<em>14 </em>Called in front of the committee, Cliff answered question after question about his work on the car. Somewhere in the room a clock ticked very slowly. Cliff watched the faces of the men who would decide his fate. Some of them were easy to read. Others might as well have been carved of stone. The questioning dragged on so long that Cliff began to feel dizzy. At last the committee told Cliff to get some sleep and report back in the morning.<br>
<br>
<em>15 </em>The next morning Cliff was taken to a garage. One of the committee members asked Cliff to reproduce part of his car while they watched. Feeling almost happy, Cliff picked up the tools that had been laid out for him. Finally he would be able to prove that he had built his car. He would demonstrate to the committee members that he had complied with the race requirements and had built his car without any help. He could feel the eyes of the committee members drilling holes in him as he thought about how to begin. Then he decided to pretend he was at home in his own workshop, and he began to work. Soon he was so involved in working on the car, he forgot all about the committee.<br>
<br>
<em>16 </em>After only half an hour, Mr. Smith called o ut, “O.K., Cliff. You can stop.”<br>
<br>
<em>17 </em>Cliff looked up in alarm, but then he relaxed when he saw the smile o n Mr. Smith’s face. “ You’re a very resourceful young man,” Mr. Smith said. “ We can all s ee that you’re building an even better car than the one you’ve entered in tomorrow’s race. Please accept my apologies for doubting you.”<br>
<br>
<em>18 </em>Cliff’s laugh burst from him like air escaping from a<br>
popped balloon. “That’s all right, sir,” he said. “But if you<br>
gentlemen will excuse me now, I need to take my car for a<br>
test run. I plan to win tomorrow’s race, and I want to be<br>
ready.”<br>
<br>
<em>19 </em>Relieved, Cliff eagerly prepared for his test run down the 1,600-foot-long track. He was finally free to do what he had come to Akron for—race his car. As he sped down the track, the car hurtled out of control. His car was wrecked, and Cliff had to be taken to the hospital. Race officials worked all afternoon and through the night to fix Cliff’s car in the hope that he would still be able to race. They didn’t want Cliff’s hard work to have been for nothing.<br>
<br>
<em>20 </em>The next day Cliff was released from the hospital. He was banged up but ready to participate in the race and grateful that his car had been repaired. The victory he achieved that day by winning the sixth annual All - American Soap Box Derby was proof of his talent and of the superiority of his car’s design.<br>

In 1933 Myron Scott, a reporter for the Dayton Daily News, saw three boys racing homemade, engineless cars down a hill on a local street. This sight inspired Scott to organize the Soap Box Derby, a coasting race for homemade race cars. Over the next several years, the All-American Soap Box Derby grew into a national event that continues to attract thousands of competitors from across the country.<br>
<br>
<strong>The All-American Soap Box Derby</strong><br>
<br>
<em>1</em> Cliff Hardesty felt his excitement building as he drank in his surroundings. He was actually here in Akron, Ohio, the home of the All-American Soap Box Derby. His eyes followed the long, smooth ribbon of the Derby Downs raceway. The 1,600-foot, cement-covered track was divided into three wide lanes. In just a few days, Cliff and his homemade car would be in one of those lanes, racing for the grand prize. Although there were more than 100 competitors in this year’s derby, only three boys could race at one time. The winner of each heat—as the three-person races were called—would go on to race the winners of other heats, until at last there was only one winner. Cliff didn’t dare dream that he would be that winner.<br>
<br>
<em>2</em> “This race sure has come a long way in the past six years,” a man sitting in the nearby bleachers remarked. “I was in the crowd at the very first soap box derby back in 1933. About 350 boys participated in that race. You should have seen the cars back then. Most of them were made from old crates or heavy sheets of tin. Some of them looked as if they were going to rattle apart.” He chuckled.<br>
<br>
<em>3</em> “In which lane did the winner race?” Cliff asked.<br>
<br>
<em>4</em> “Oh, this fancy track wasn’t used then. In fact, there was no track at all,” the man said. “The boys raced down a big hill. This track here was built just three years ago for the 1936 race.”<br>
<br>
<em>5</em> After chatting with t he man a little bit more, Cliff walked up the hill to the area called Topside, where all the homemade race cars were stored and inspected. He wanted to check on his car. His family had shipped it from his home in White Plains, New York, a few days earlier. Derby guidelines stated that cars had to arrive in time for race officials to look them over and make sure they were safe.<br>
<br>
<em>6</em> Cliff found his car and stood back for a moment, running his eyes over it. It was a beauty. Whether he won the race or not, he knew he had done a good job.<br>
<br>
<em>7</em> Just then a thin man in dark glasses with a clipboard under h is arm walked over to him. “Are you the boy w ho built this car?” The man looked down at his clipboard. “Cliff Hardesty?”<br>
<br>
<em>8</em> “Yes, sir,” Cliff answered with a smile.<br>
<br>
<em>9 </em>The man did not smile back. “Cliff, my name is Mr. Smith. I’ll be very candid with you. The truth is that your car concerns me. The regulations for this event state very clearly that every car entered in the All-American Soap Box Derby must have been built by the boy who will drive it. There can be no help from anyone else.”<br>
<br>
<em>10 </em>“Yes, sir,” Cliff said, still not certain what Mr. Smith was talking about.<br>
<br>
<em>11 </em>Mr. Smith sighed. “Cliff, your car is one of the best we’ve ever seen. Can you honestly expect us to believe that you built it all by yourself ? No one helped you?”<br>
<br>
<em>12 </em>Cliff’s face grew hot as he realized what Mr. Smith was implying. “No, sir. No one helped me. I did everything according to the rules.” He looked Mr. Smith straight in the eye, but his throat felt tight with fear. Was Mr. Smith saying he might not be allowed to race? Would he be <span class="txt-underline">disqualified</span> for building a good car? “Mr. Smith,” Cliff said firmly, “I built this car myself.”<br>
<br>
<em>13 </em>“I’m afraid you’re going to need to prove that,” Mr. Smith said. “We’ve set up a 12-member committee. We’ll ask you questions about how you built your car. We have to make sure that you’ve done everything the way you’re supposed to. If you can satisfy us that your car is legitimate, you can participate in the race.”<br>
<br>
<em>14 </em>Called in front of the committee, Cliff answered question after question about his work on the car. Somewhere in the room a clock ticked very slowly.

<em>17 </em>Cliff looked up in alarm, but then he relaxed when he saw the smile o n Mr. Smith’s face. “ You’re a very resourceful young man,” Mr. Smith said. “ We can all s ee that you’re building an even better car than the one you’ve entered in tomorrow’s race. Please accept my apologies for doubting you.”<br>
<br>
<em>18 </em>Cliff’s laugh burst from him like air escaping from a<br>
popped balloon. “That’s all right, sir,” he said. “But if you<br>

Derby guidelines stated that cars had to arrive in time for race officials to look them over and make sure they were safe.<br>
<br>
<em>6&nbsp;</em>Cliff found his car and stood back for a moment, running his eyes over it. It was a beauty. Whether he won the race or not, he knew he had done a good job.<br>
<br>
<em>7&nbsp;</em>Just then a thin man in dark glasses with a clipboard under h is arm walked over to him. “Are you the boy w ho built this car?” The man looked down at his clipboard. “Cliff Hardesty?”<br>
<br>
<em>8&nbsp;</em>“Yes, sir,” Cliff answered with a smile.<br>
<br>
<em>9&nbsp;</em>The man did not smile back. “Cliff, my name is Mr. Smith. I’ll be very candid with you. The truth is that your car concerns me. The regulations for this event state very clearly that every car entered in the All-American Soap Box Derby must have been built by the boy who will drive it. There can be no help from anyone else.”<br>
<br>
<em>10&nbsp;</em>“Yes, sir,” Cliff said, still not certain what Mr. Smith was talking about.<br>
<br>
<em>11&nbsp;</em>Mr. Smith sighed. “Cliff, your car is one of the best we’ve ever seen. Can you honestly expect us to believe that you built it all by yourself ? No one helped you?”<br>
<br>
<em>12&nbsp;</em>Cliff’s face grew hot as he realized what Mr. Smith was implying. “No, sir. No one helped me. I did everything according to the rules.” He looked Mr. Smith straight in the eye, but his throat felt tight with fear. Was Mr. Smith saying he might not be allowed to race? Would he be <span class="txt-underline">disqualified</span> for building a good car? “Mr. Smith,” Cliff said firmly, “I built this car myself.”<br>
<br>
<em>13&nbsp;</em>“I’m afraid you’re going to need to prove that,” Mr. Smith said. “We’ve set up a 12-member committee. We’ll ask you questions about how you built your car. We have to make sure that you’ve done everything the way you’re supposed to. If you can satisfy us that your car is legitimate, you can participate in the race.”<br>
<br>
<em>14&nbsp;</em>Called in front of the committee, Cliff answered question after question about his work on the car. Somewhere in the room a clock ticked very slowly. Cliff watched the faces of the men who would decide his fate. Some of them were easy to read. Others might as well have been carved of stone. The questioning dragged on so long that Cliff began to feel dizzy. At last the committee told Cliff to get some sleep and report back in the morning.<br>
<br>
<em>15&nbsp;</em>The next morning Cliff was taken to a garage. One of the committee members asked Cliff to reproduce part of his car while they watched. Feeling almost happy, Cliff picked up the tools that had been laid out for him. Finally he would be able to prove that he had built his car. He would demonstrate to the committee members that he had complied with the race requirements and had built his car without any help. He could feel the eyes of the committee members drilling holes in him as he thought about how to begin. Then he decided to pretend he was at home in his own workshop, and he began to work. Soon he was so involved in working on the car, he forgot all about the committee.<br>
<br>
<em>16&nbsp;</em>After only half an hour, Mr. Smith called o ut, “O.K., Cliff. You can stop.”<br>
<br>
<em>17&nbsp;</em>Cliff looked up in alarm, but then he relaxed when he saw the smile o n Mr. Smith’s face. “ You’re a very resourceful young man,” Mr. Smith said. “ We can all s ee that you’re building an even better car than the one you’ve entered in tomorrow’s race. Please accept my apologies for doubting you.”<br>
<br>
<em>18&nbsp;</em>Cliff’s laugh burst from him like air escaping from a<br>
popped balloon. “That’s all right, sir,” he said. “But if you<br>
gentlemen will excuse me now, I need to take my car for a<br>
test run. I plan to win tomorrow’s race, and I want to be<br>
ready.”<br>
<br>
<em>19&nbsp;</em>Relieved, Cliff eagerly prepared for his test run down the 1,600-foot-long track. He was finally free to do what he had come to Akron for—race his car. As he sped down the track, the car hurtled out of control. His car was wrecked, and Cliff had to be taken to the hospital. Race officials worked all afternoon and through the night to fix Cliff’s car in the hope that he would still be able to race. They didn’t want Cliff’s hard work to have been for nothing.<br>
<br>
<em>20&nbsp;</em>The next day Cliff was released from the hospital. He was banged up but ready to participate in the race and grateful that his car had been repaired. The victory he achieved that day by winning the sixth annual All - American Soap Box Derby was proof of his talent and of the superiority of his car’s design.<br>

In 1933 Myron Scott, a reporter for the Dayton Daily News, saw three boys racing homemade, engineless cars down a hill on a local street. This sight inspired Scott to organize the Soap Box Derby, a coasting race for homemade race cars. Over the next several years, the All-American Soap Box Derby grew into a national event that continues to attract thousands of competitors from across the country.<br>
<br>
<strong>The All-American Soap Box Derby</strong><br>
<br>
<em>1</em>&nbsp;Cliff Hardesty felt his excitement building as he drank in his surroundings. He was actually here in Akron, Ohio, the home of the All-American Soap Box Derby. His eyes followed the long, smooth ribbon of the Derby Downs raceway. The 1,600-foot, cement-covered track was divided into three wide lanes. In just a few days, Cliff and his homemade car would be in one of those lanes, racing for the grand prize. Although there were more than 100 competitors in this year’s derby, only three boys could race at one time. The winner of each heat—as the three-person races were called—would go on to race the winners of other heats, until at last there was only one winner. Cliff didn’t dare dream that he would be that winner.<br>
<br>
<em>2</em>&nbsp;“This race sure has come a long way in the past six years,” a man sitting in the nearby bleachers remarked. “I was in the crowd at the very first soap box derby back in 1933. About 350 boys participated in that race. You should have seen the cars back then. Most of them were made from old crates or heavy sheets of tin. Some of them looked as if they were going to rattle apart.” He chuckled.<br>
<br>
<em>3</em>&nbsp;“In which lane did the winner race?” Cliff asked.<br>
<br>
<em>4</em>&nbsp;“Oh, this fancy track wasn’t used then. In fact, there was no track at all,” the man said. “The boys raced down a big hill. This track here was built just three years ago for the 1936 race.”<br>
<br>
<em>5&nbsp;</em>After chatting with t he man a little bit more, Cliff walked up the hill to the area called Topside, where all the homemade race cars were stored and inspected. He wanted to check on his car. His family had shipped it from his home in White Plains, New York, a few days earlier. Derby guidelines stated that cars had to arrive in time for race officials to look them over and make sure they were safe.<br>
<br>
<em>6&nbsp;</em>Cliff found his car and stood back for a moment, running his eyes over it. It was a beauty. Whether he won the race or not, he knew he had done a good job.<br>
<br>
<em>7&nbsp;</em>Just then a thin man in dark glasses with a clipboard under h is arm walked over to him. “Are you the boy w ho built this car?” The man looked down at his clipboard. “Cliff Hardesty?”<br>
<br>
<em>8&nbsp;</em>“Yes, sir,” Cliff answered with a smile.<br>
<br>
<em>9&nbsp;</em>The man did not smile back. “Cliff, my name is Mr. Smith. I’ll be very candid with you. The truth is that your car concerns me. The regulations for this event state very clearly that every car entered in the All-American Soap Box Derby must have been built by the boy who will drive it. There can be no help from anyone else.”<br>
<br>
<em>10&nbsp;</em>“Yes, sir,” Cliff said, still not certain what Mr. Smith was talking about.<br>
<br>
<em>11&nbsp;</em>Mr. Smith sighed. “Cliff, your car is one of the best we’ve ever seen. Can you honestly expect us to believe that you built it all by yourself ? No one helped you?”<br>
<br>
<em>12&nbsp;</em>Cliff’s face grew hot as he realized what Mr. Smith was implying. “No, sir. No one helped me. I did everything according to the rules.” He looked Mr. Smith straight in the eye, but his throat felt tight with fear. Was Mr. Smith saying he might not be allowed to race? Would he be <span class="txt-underline">disqualified</span> for building a good car? “Mr. Smith,” Cliff said firmly, “I built this car myself.”<br>
<br>
<em>13&nbsp;</em>“I’m afraid you’re going to need to prove that,” Mr. Smith said. “We’ve set up a 12-member committee. We’ll ask you questions about how you built your car. We have to make sure that you’ve done everything the way you’re supposed to. If you can satisfy us that your car is legitimate, you can participate in the race.”<br>

Cliff watched the faces of the men who would decide his fate. Some of them were easy to read. Others might as well have been carved of stone. The questioning dragged on so long that Cliff began to feel dizzy. At last the committee told Cliff to get some sleep and report back in the morning.<br>
<br>
<em>15&nbsp;</em>The next morning Cliff was taken to a garage. One of the committee members asked Cliff to reproduce part of his car while they watched. Feeling almost happy, Cliff picked up the tools that had been laid out for him. Finally he would be able to prove that he had built his car. He would demonstrate to the committee members that he had complied with the race requirements and had built his car without any help. He could feel the eyes of the committee members drilling holes in him as he thought about how to begin. Then he decided to pretend he was at home in his own workshop, and he began to work. Soon he was so involved in working on the car, he forgot all about the committee.<br>
<br>
<em>16&nbsp;</em>After only half an hour, Mr. Smith called o ut, “O.K., Cliff. You can stop.”<br>
<br>
<em>17&nbsp;</em>Cliff looked up in alarm, but then he relaxed when he saw the smile o n Mr. Smith’s face. “ You’re a very resourceful young man,” Mr. Smith said. “ We can all s ee that you’re building an even better car than the one you’ve entered in tomorrow’s race. Please accept my apologies for doubting you.”<br>
<br>
<em>18&nbsp;</em>Cliff’s laugh burst from him like air escaping from a<br>
popped balloon. “That’s all right, sir,” he said. “But if you<br>

In just a few days, Cliff and his homemade car would be in one of those lanes, racing for the grand prize. Although there were more than 100 competitors in this year’s derby, only three boys could race at one time. The winner of each heat—as the three-person races were called—would go on to race the winners of other heats, until at last there was only one winner. Cliff didn’t dare dream that he would be that winner.<br>
<br>
<em>2</em>&nbsp;“This race sure has come a long way in the past six years,” a man sitting in the nearby bleachers remarked. “I was in the crowd at the very first soap box derby back in 1933. About 350 boys participated in that race. You should have seen the cars back then. Most of them were made from old crates or heavy sheets of tin. Some of them looked as if they were going to rattle apart.” He chuckled.<br>
<br>
<em>3</em>&nbsp;“In which lane did the winner race?” Cliff asked.<br>
<br>
<em>4</em>&nbsp;“Oh, this fancy track wasn’t used then. In fact, there was no track at all,” the man said. “The boys raced down a big hill. This track here was built just three years ago for the 1936 race.”<br>
<br>
<em>5&nbsp;</em>After chatting with t he man a little bit more, Cliff walked up the hill to the area called Topside, where all the homemade race cars were stored and inspected. He wanted to check on his car. His family had shipped it from his home in White Plains, New York, a few days earlier. Derby guidelines stated that cars had to arrive in time for race officials to look them over and make sure they were safe.<br>
<br>
<em>6&nbsp;</em>Cliff found his car and stood back for a moment, running his eyes over it. It was a beauty. Whether he won the race or not, he knew he had done a good job.<br>
<br>
<em>7&nbsp;</em>Just then a thin man in dark glasses with a clipboard under h is arm walked over to him. “Are you the boy w ho built this car?” The man looked down at his clipboard. “Cliff Hardesty?”<br>
<br>
<em>8&nbsp;</em>“Yes, sir,” Cliff answered with a smile.<br>
<br>
<em>9&nbsp;</em>The man did not smile back. “Cliff, my name is Mr. Smith. I’ll be very candid with you. The truth is that your car concerns me. The regulations for this event state very clearly that every car entered in the All-American Soap Box Derby must have been built by the boy who will drive it. There can be no help from anyone else.”<br>
<br>
<em>10&nbsp;</em>“Yes, sir,” Cliff said, still not certain what Mr. Smith was talking about.<br>
<br>
<em>11&nbsp;</em>Mr. Smith sighed. “Cliff, your car is one of the best we’ve ever seen. Can you honestly expect us to believe that you built it all by yourself ? No one helped you?”<br>
<br>
<em>12&nbsp;</em>Cliff’s face grew hot as he realized what Mr. Smith was implying. “No, sir. No one helped me. I did everything according to the rules.” He looked Mr. Smith straight in the eye, but his throat felt tight with fear. Was Mr. Smith saying he might not be allowed to race? Would he be <span class="txt-underline">disqualified</span> for building a good car? “Mr. Smith,” Cliff said firmly, “I built this car myself.”<br>
<br>
<em>13&nbsp;</em>“I’m afraid you’re going to need to prove that,” Mr. Smith said. “We’ve set up a 12-member committee. We’ll ask you questions about how you built your car. We have to make sure that you’ve done everything the way you’re supposed to. If you can satisfy us that your car is legitimate, you can participate in the race.”<br>
<br>
<em>14&nbsp;</em>Called in front of the committee, Cliff answered question after question about his work on the car. Somewhere in the room a clock ticked very slowly. Cliff watched the faces of the men who would decide his fate. Some of them were easy to read. Others might as well have been carved of stone. The questioning dragged on so long that Cliff began to feel dizzy. At last the committee told Cliff to get some sleep and report back in the morning.<br>
<br>
<em>15&nbsp;</em>The next morning Cliff was taken to a garage. One of the committee members asked Cliff to reproduce part of his car while they watched. Feeling almost happy, Cliff picked up the tools that had been laid out for him. Finally he would be able to prove that he had built his car. He would demonstrate to the committee members that he had complied with the race requirements and had built his car without any help. He could feel the eyes of the committee members drilling holes in him as he thought about how to begin. Then he decided to pretend he was at home in his own workshop, and he began to work. Soon he was so involved in working on the car, he forgot all about the committee.<br>
<br>
<em>16&nbsp;</em>After only half an hour, Mr. Smith called o ut, “O.K., Cliff. You can stop.”<br>
<br>
<em>17&nbsp;</em>Cliff looked up in alarm, but then he relaxed when he saw the smile o n Mr. Smith’s face. “ You’re a very resourceful young man,” Mr. Smith said. “ We can all s ee that you’re building an even better car than the one you’ve entered in tomorrow’s race. Please accept my apologies for doubting you.”<br>
<br>
<em>18&nbsp;</em>Cliff’s laugh burst from him like air escaping from a<br>
popped balloon. “That’s all right, sir,” he said. “But if you<br>
gentlemen will excuse me now, I need to take my car for a<br>
test run. I plan to win tomorrow’s race, and I want to be<br>
ready.”<br>
<br>
<em>19&nbsp;</em>Relieved, Cliff eagerly prepared for his test run down the 1,600-foot-long track. He was finally free to do what he had come to Akron for—race his car. As he sped down the track, the car hurtled out of control. His car was wrecked, and Cliff had to be taken to the hospital. Race officials worked all afternoon and through the night to fix Cliff’s car in the hope that he would still be able to race. They didn’t want Cliff’s hard work to have been for nothing.<br>
<br>
<em>20&nbsp;</em>The next day Cliff was released from the hospital. He was banged up but ready to participate in the race and grateful that his car had been repaired. The victory he achieved that day by winning the sixth annual All - American Soap Box Derby was proof of his talent and of the superiority of his car’s design.<br>

In 1933 Myron Scott, a reporter for the Dayton Daily News, saw three boys racing homemade, engineless cars down a hill on a local street. This sight inspired Scott to organize the Soap Box Derby, a coasting race for homemade race cars. Over the next several years, the All-American Soap Box Derby grew into a national event that continues to attract thousands of competitors from across the country.<br>
<br>
<strong>The All-American Soap Box Derby</strong><br>
<br>
<em>1</em>&nbsp;Cliff Hardesty felt his excitement building as he drank in his surroundings. He was actually here in Akron, Ohio, the home of the All-American Soap Box Derby. His eyes followed the long, smooth ribbon of the Derby Downs raceway. The 1,600-foot, cement-covered track was divided into three wide lanes. In just a few days, Cliff and his homemade car would be in one of those lanes, racing for the grand prize. Although there were more than 100 competitors in this year’s derby, only three boys could race at one time. The winner of each heat—as the three-person races were called—would go on to race the winners of other heats, until at last there was only one winner. Cliff didn’t dare dream that he would be that winner.<br>

About 350 boys participated in that race. You should have seen the cars back then. Most of them were made from old crates or heavy sheets of tin. Some of them looked as if they were going to rattle apart.” He chuckled.<br>

<br>
<em>5&nbsp;</em>After chatting with t he man a little bit more, Cliff walked up the hill to the area called Topside, where all the homemade race cars were stored and inspected. He wanted to check on his car. His family had shipped it from his home in White Plains, New York, a few days earlier.

In 1933 Myron Scott, a reporter for the Dayton Daily News, saw three boys racing homemade, engineless cars down a hill on a local street. This sight inspired Scott to organize the Soap Box Derby, a coasting race for homemade race cars. Over the next several years, the All-American Soap Box Derby grew into a national event that continues to attract thousands of competitors from across the country.<br>
<br>
<strong>The All-American Soap Box Derby</strong><br>
<br>
<em>1</em>&nbsp;Cliff Hardesty felt his excitement building as he drank in his surroundings. He was actually here in Akron, Ohio, the home of the All-American Soap Box Derby. His eyes followed the long, smooth ribbon of the Derby Downs raceway. The 1,600-foot, cement-covered track was divided into three wide lanes. In just a few days, Cliff and his homemade car would be in one of those lanes, racing for the grand prize. Although there were more than 100 competitors in this year’s derby, only three boys could race at one time. The winner of each heat—as the three-person races were called—would go on to race the winners of other heats, until at last there was only one winner. Cliff didn’t dare dream that he would be that winner.<br>
<br>
<em>2</em>&nbsp;“This race sure has come a long way in the past six years,” a man sitting in the nearby bleachers remarked. “I was in the crowd at the very first soap box derby back in 1933. About 350 boys participated in that race. You should have seen the cars back then. Most of them were made from old crates or heavy sheets of tin. Some of them looked as if they were going to rattle apart.” He chuckled.<br>
<br>
<em>3</em>&nbsp;“In which lane did the winner race?” Cliff asked.<br>
<br>
<em>4</em>&nbsp;“Oh, this fancy track wasn’t used then. In fact, there was no track at all,” the man said. “The boys raced down a big hill. This track here was built just three years ago for the 1936 race.”<br>
<br>
<em>5&nbsp;</em>After chatting with t he man a little bit more, Cliff walked up the hill to the area called Topside, where all the homemade race cars were stored and inspected. He wanted to check on his car. His family had shipped it from his home in White Plains, New York, a few days earlier. Derby guidelines stated that cars had to arrive in time for race officials to look them over and make sure they were safe.<br>
<br>
<em>6&nbsp;</em>Cliff found his car and stood back for a moment, running his eyes over it. It was a beauty. Whether he won the race or not, he knew he had done a good job.<br>
<br>
<em>7&nbsp;</em>Just then a thin man in dark glasses with a clipboard under h is arm walked over to him. “Are you the boy w ho built this car?” The man looked down at his clipboard. “Cliff Hardesty?”<br>
<br>
<em>8&nbsp;</em>“Yes, sir,” Cliff answered with a smile.<br>
<br>
<em>9&nbsp;</em>The man did not smile back. “Cliff, my name is Mr. Smith. I’ll be very candid with you. The truth is that your car concerns me. The regulations for this event state very clearly that every car entered in the All-American Soap Box Derby must have been built by the boy who will drive it. There can be no help from anyone else.”<br>
<br>
<em>10&nbsp;</em>“Yes, sir,” Cliff said, still not certain what Mr. Smith was talking about.<br>
<br>
<em>11&nbsp;</em>Mr. Smith sighed. “Cliff, your car is one of the best we’ve ever seen. Can you honestly expect us to believe that you built it all by yourself ? No one helped you?”<br>
<br>
<em>12&nbsp;</em>Cliff’s face grew hot as he realized what Mr. Smith was implying. “No, sir. No one helped me. I did everything according to the rules.” He looked Mr. Smith straight in the eye, but his throat felt tight with fear. Was Mr. Smith saying he might not be allowed to race? Would he be <span class="txt-underline">disqualified</span> for building a good car? “Mr. Smith,” Cliff said firmly, “I built this car myself.”<br>
<br>
<em>13&nbsp;</em>“I’m afraid you’re going to need to prove that,” Mr. Smith said. “We’ve set up a 12-member committee. We’ll ask you questions about how you built your car. We have to make sure that you’ve done everything the way you’re supposed to. If you can satisfy us that your car is legitimate, you can participate in the race.”<br>
<br>
<em>14&nbsp;</em>Called in front of the committee, Cliff answered question after question about his work on the car. Somewhere in the room a clock ticked very slowly. Cliff watched the faces of the men who would decide his fate. Some of them were easy to read. Others might as well have been carved of stone. The questioning dragged on so long that Cliff began to feel dizzy. At last the committee told Cliff to get some sleep and report back in the morning.<br>
<br>
<em>15&nbsp;</em>The next morning Cliff was taken to a garage. One of the committee members asked Cliff to reproduce part of his car while they watched. Feeling almost happy, Cliff picked up the tools that had been laid out for him. Finally he would be able to prove that he had built his car. He would demonstrate to the committee members that he had complied with the race requirements and had built his car without any help. He could feel the eyes of the committee members drilling holes in him as he thought about how to begin. Then he decided to pretend he was at home in his own workshop, and he began to work. Soon he was so involved in working on the car, he forgot all about the committee.<br>
<br>
<em>16&nbsp;</em>After only half an hour, Mr. Smith called o ut, “O.K., Cliff. You can stop.”<br>
<br>
<em>17&nbsp;</em>Cliff looked up in alarm, but then he relaxed when he saw the smile o n Mr. Smith’s face. “ You’re a very resourceful young man,” Mr. Smith said. “ We can all s ee that you’re building an even better car than the one you’ve entered in tomorrow’s race. Please accept my apologies for doubting you.”<br>
<br>
<em>18&nbsp;</em>Cliff’s laugh burst from him like air escaping from a<br>
popped balloon. “That’s all right, sir,” he said. “But if you<br>
gentlemen will excuse me now, I need to take my car for a<br>
test run. I plan to win tomorrow’s race, and I want to be<br>
ready.”<br>
<br>
<em>19&nbsp;</em>Relieved, Cliff eagerly prepared for his test run down the 1,600-foot-long track. He was finally free to do what he had come to Akron for—race his car. As he sped down the track, the car hurtled out of control. His car was wrecked, and Cliff had to be taken to the hospital. Race officials worked all afternoon and through the night to fix Cliff’s car in the hope that he would still be able to race. They didn’t want Cliff’s hard work to have been for nothing.<br>
<br>
<em>20&nbsp;</em>The next day Cliff was released from the hospital. He was banged up but ready to participate in the race and grateful that his car had been repaired. The victory he achieved that day by winning the sixth annual All - American Soap Box Derby was proof of his talent and of the superiority of his car’s design.<br>

In 1933 Myron Scott, a reporter for the Dayton Daily News, saw three boys racing homemade, engineless cars down a hill on a local street. This sight inspired Scott to organize the Soap Box Derby, a coasting race for homemade race cars. Over the next several years, the All-American Soap Box Derby grew into a national event that continues to attract thousands of competitors from across the country.<br>
<br>
<strong>The All-American Soap Box Derby</strong><br>
<br>
<em>1</em>&nbsp;Cliff Hardesty felt his excitement building as he drank in his surroundings. He was actually here in Akron, Ohio, the home of the All-American Soap Box Derby. His eyes followed the long, smooth ribbon of the Derby Downs raceway. The 1,600-foot, cement-covered track was divided into three wide lanes. In just a few days, Cliff and his homemade car would be in one of those lanes, racing for the grand prize. Although there were more than 100 competitors in this year’s derby, only three boys could race at one time. The winner of each heat—as the three-person races were called—would go on to race the winners of other heats, until at last there was only one winner. Cliff didn’t dare dream that he would be that winner.<br>
<br>
<em>2</em>&nbsp;“This race sure has come a long way in the past six years,” a man sitting in the nearby bleachers remarked. “I was in the crowd at the very first soap box derby back in 1933. About 350 boys participated in that race. You should have seen the cars back then. Most of them were made from old crates or heavy sheets of tin. Some of them looked as if they were going to rattle apart.” He chuckled.<br>
<br>
<em>3</em>&nbsp;“In which lane did the winner race?” Cliff asked.<br>
<br>
<em>4</em>&nbsp;“Oh, this fancy track wasn’t used then. In fact, there was no track at all,” the man said. “The boys raced down a big hill. This track here was built just three years ago for the 1936 race.”<br>
<br>
<em>5&nbsp;</em>After chatting with t he man a little bit more, Cliff walked up the hill to the area called Topside, where all the homemade race cars were stored and inspected. He wanted to check on his car. His family had shipped it from his home in White Plains, New York, a few days earlier. Derby guidelines stated that cars had to arrive in time for race officials to look them over and make sure they were safe.<br>
<br>
<em>6&nbsp;</em>Cliff found his car and stood back for a moment, running his eyes over it. It was a beauty. Whether he won the race or not, he knew he had done a good job.<br>
<br>
<em>7&nbsp;</em>Just then a thin man in dark glasses with a clipboard under h is arm walked over to him. “Are you the boy w ho built this car?” The man looked down at his clipboard. “Cliff Hardesty?”<br>
<br>
<em>8&nbsp;</em>“Yes, sir,” Cliff answered with a smile.<br>
<br>
<em>9&nbsp;</em>The man did not smile back. “Cliff, my name is Mr. Smith. I’ll be very candid with you. The truth is that your car concerns me. The regulations for this event state very clearly that every car entered in the All-American Soap Box Derby must have been built by the boy who will drive it. There can be no help from anyone else.”<br>
<br>
<em>10&nbsp;</em>“Yes, sir,” Cliff said, still not certain what Mr. Smith was talking about.<br>
<br>
<em>11&nbsp;</em>Mr. Smith sighed. “Cliff, your car is one of the best we’ve ever seen. Can you honestly expect us to believe that you built it all by yourself ? No one helped you?”<br>
<br>
<em>12&nbsp;</em>Cliff’s face grew hot as he realized what Mr. Smith was implying. “No, sir. No one helped me. I did everything according to the rules.” He looked Mr. Smith straight in the eye, but his throat felt tight with fear. Was Mr. Smith saying he might not be allowed to race? Would he be <span class="txt-underline">disqualified</span> for building a good car? “Mr. Smith,” Cliff said firmly, “I built this car myself.”<br>
<br>
<em>13&nbsp;</em>“I’m afraid you’re going to need to prove that,” Mr. Smith said. “We’ve set up a 12-member committee. We’ll ask you questions about how you built your car. We have to make sure that you’ve done everything the way you’re supposed to. If you can satisfy us that your car is legitimate, you can participate in the race.”<br>
<br>
<em>14&nbsp;</em>Called in front of the committee, Cliff answered question after question about his work on the car. Somewhere in the room a clock ticked very slowly. Cliff watched the faces of the men who would decide his fate. Some of them were easy to read. Others might as well have been carved of stone. The questioning dragged on so long that Cliff began to feel dizzy. At last the committee told Cliff to get some sleep and report back in the morning.<br>
<br>
<em>15&nbsp;</em>The next morning Cliff was taken to a garage. One of the committee members asked Cliff to reproduce part of his car while they watched. Feeling almost happy, Cliff picked up the tools that had been laid out for him. Finally he would be able to prove that he had built his car. He would demonstrate to the committee members that he had complied with the race requirements and had built his car without any help. He could feel the eyes of the committee members drilling holes in him as he thought about how to begin. Then he decided to pretend he was at home in his own workshop, and he began to work. Soon he was so involved in working on the car, he forgot all about the committee.<br>
<br>
<em>16&nbsp;</em>After only half an hour, Mr. Smith called o ut, “O.K., Cliff. You can stop.”<br>
<br>
<em>17&nbsp;</em>Cliff looked up in alarm, but then he relaxed when he saw the smile o n Mr. Smith’s face. “ You’re a very resourceful young man,” Mr. Smith said. “ We can all s ee that you’re building an even better car than the one you’ve entered in tomorrow’s race. Please accept my apologies for doubting you.”<br>
<br>
<em>18&nbsp;</em>Cliff’s laugh burst from him like air escaping from a<br>
popped balloon. “That’s all right, sir,” he said. “But if you<br>
gentlemen will excuse me now, I need to take my car for a<br>
test run. I plan to win tomorrow’s race, and I want to be<br>
ready.”<br>
<br>
<em>19&nbsp;</em>Relieved, Cliff eagerly prepared for his test run down the 1,600-foot-long track. He was finally free to do what he had come to Akron for—race his car. As he sped down the track, the car hurtled out of control. His car was wrecked, and Cliff had to be taken to the hospital. Race officials worked all afternoon and through the night to fix Cliff’s car in the hope that he would still be able to race. They didn’t want Cliff’s hard work to have been for nothing.<br>
<br>
<em>20&nbsp;</em>The next day Cliff was released from the hospital. He was banged up but ready to participate in the race and grateful that his car had been repaired. The victory he achieved that day by winning the sixth annual All - American Soap Box Derby was proof of his talent and of the superiority of his car’s design.<br>

In 1933 Myron Scott, a reporter for the Dayton Daily News, saw three boys racing homemade, engineless cars down a hill on a local street. This sight inspired Scott to organize the Soap Box Derby, a coasting race for homemade race cars. Over the next several years, the All-American Soap Box Derby grew into a national event that continues to attract thousands of competitors from across the country.<br>
<br>
<strong>The All-American Soap Box Derby</strong><br>
<br>
<em>1</em>&nbsp;Cliff Hardesty felt his excitement building as he drank in his surroundings. He was actually here in Akron, Ohio, the home of the All-American Soap Box Derby. His eyes followed the long, smooth ribbon of the Derby Downs raceway. The 1,600-foot, cement-covered track was divided into three wide lanes. In just a few days, Cliff and his homemade car would be in one of those lanes, racing for the grand prize. Although there were more than 100 competitors in this year’s derby, only three boys could race at one time. The winner of each heat—as the three-person races were called—would go on to race the winners of other heats, until at last there was only one winner. Cliff didn’t dare dream that he would be that winner.<br>
<br>
<em>2</em>&nbsp;“This race sure has come a long way in the past six years,” a man sitting in the nearby bleachers remarked. “I was in the crowd at the very first soap box derby back in 1933. About 350 boys participated in that race. You should have seen the cars back then. Most of them were made from old crates or heavy sheets of tin. Some of them looked as if they were going to rattle apart.” He chuckled.<br>
<br>
<em>3</em>&nbsp;“In which lane did the winner race?” Cliff asked.<br>
<br>
<em>4</em>&nbsp;“Oh, this fancy track wasn’t used then. In fact, there was no track at all,” the man said. “The boys raced down a big hill. This track here was built just three years ago for the 1936 race.”<br>
<br>
<em>5&nbsp;</em>After chatting with t he man a little bit more, Cliff walked up the hill to the area called Topside, where all the homemade race cars were stored and inspected. He wanted to check on his car. His family had shipped it from his home in White Plains, New York, a few days earlier. Derby guidelines stated that cars had to arrive in time for race officials to look them over and make sure they were safe.<br>
<br>
<em>6&nbsp;</em>Cliff found his car and stood back for a moment, running his eyes over it. It was a beauty. Whether he won the race or not, he knew he had done a good job.<br>
<br>
<em>7&nbsp;</em>Just then a thin man in dark glasses with a clipboard under h is arm walked over to him. “Are you the boy w ho built this car?” The man looked down at his clipboard. “Cliff Hardesty?”<br>
<br>
<em>8&nbsp;</em>“Yes, sir,” Cliff answered with a smile.<br>
<br>
<em>9&nbsp;</em>The man did not smile back. “Cliff, my name is Mr. Smith. I’ll be very candid with you. The truth is that your car concerns me. The regulations for this event state very clearly that every car entered in the All-American Soap Box Derby must have been built by the boy who will drive it. There can be no help from anyone else.”<br>
<br>
<em>10&nbsp;</em>“Yes, sir,” Cliff said, still not certain what Mr. Smith was talking about.<br>
<br>
<em>11&nbsp;</em>Mr. Smith sighed. “Cliff, your car is one of the best we’ve ever seen. Can you honestly expect us to believe that you built it all by yourself ? No one helped you?”<br>
<br>
<em>12&nbsp;</em>Cliff’s face grew hot as he realized what Mr. Smith was implying. “No, sir. No one helped me. I did everything according to the rules.” He looked Mr. Smith straight in the eye, but his throat felt tight with fear. Was Mr. Smith saying he might not be allowed to race? Would he be <span class="txt-underline">disqualified</span> for building a good car? “Mr. Smith,” Cliff said firmly, “I built this car myself.”<br>
<br>
<em>13&nbsp;</em>“I’m afraid you’re going to need to prove that,” Mr. Smith said. “We’ve set up a 12-member committee. We’ll ask you questions about how you built your car. We have to make sure that you’ve done everything the way you’re supposed to. If you can satisfy us that your car is legitimate, you can participate in the race.”<br>
<br>
<em>14&nbsp;</em>Called in front of the committee, Cliff answered question after question about his work on the car. Somewhere in the room a clock ticked very slowly. Cliff watched the faces of the men who would decide his fate. Some of them were easy to read. Others might as well have been carved of stone. The questioning dragged on so long that Cliff began to feel dizzy. At last the committee told Cliff to get some sleep and report back in the morning.<br>
<br>
<em>15&nbsp;</em>The next morning Cliff was taken to a garage. One of the committee members asked Cliff to reproduce part of his car while they watched. Feeling almost happy, Cliff picked up the tools that had been laid out for him. Finally he would be able to prove that he had built his car. He would demonstrate to the committee members that he had complied with the race requirements and had built his car without any help. He could feel the eyes of the committee members drilling holes in him as he thought about how to begin. Then he decided to pretend he was at home in his own workshop, and he began to work. Soon he was so involved in working on the car, he forgot all about the committee.<br>
<br>
<em>16&nbsp;</em>After only half an hour, Mr. Smith called o ut, “O.K., Cliff. You can stop.”<br>
<br>
<em>17&nbsp;</em>Cliff looked up in alarm, but then he relaxed when he saw the smile o n Mr. Smith’s face. “ You’re a very resourceful young man,” Mr. Smith said. “ We can all s ee that you’re building an even better car than the one you’ve entered in tomorrow’s race. Please accept my apologies for doubting you.”<br>
<br>
<em>18&nbsp;</em>Cliff’s laugh burst from him like air escaping from a<br>
popped balloon. “That’s all right, sir,” he said. “But if you<br>
gentlemen will excuse me now, I need to take my car for a<br>
test run. I plan to win tomorrow’s race, and I want to be<br>
ready.”<br>
<br>
<em>19&nbsp;</em>Relieved, Cliff eagerly prepared for his test run down the 1,600-foot-long track. He was finally free to do what he had come to Akron for—race his car. As he sped down the track, the car hurtled out of control. His car was wrecked, and Cliff had to be taken to the hospital. Race officials worked all afternoon and through the night to fix Cliff’s car in the hope that he would still be able to race. They didn’t want Cliff’s hard work to have been for nothing.<br>
<br>
<em>20&nbsp;</em>The next day Cliff was released from the hospital. He was banged up but ready to participate in the race and grateful that his car had been repaired. The victory he achieved that day by winning the sixth annual All - American Soap Box Derby was proof of his talent and of the superiority of his car’s design.<br>

In 1933 Myron Scott, a reporter for the Dayton Daily News, saw three boys racing homemade, engineless cars down a hill on a local street. This sight inspired Scott to organize the Soap Box Derby, a coasting race for homemade race cars. Over the next several years, the All-American Soap Box Derby grew into a national event that continues to attract thousands of competitors from across the country.<br>
<br>
<strong>The All-American Soap Box Derby</strong><br>
<br>
<em>1</em>&nbsp;Cliff Hardesty felt his excitement building as he drank in his surroundings. He was actually here in Akron, Ohio, the home of the All-American Soap Box Derby. His eyes followed the long, smooth ribbon of the Derby Downs raceway. The 1,600-foot, cement-covered track was divided into three wide lanes. In just a few days, Cliff and his homemade car would be in one of those lanes, racing for the grand prize. Although there were more than 100 competitors in this year’s derby, only three boys could race at one time. The winner of each heat—as the three-person races were called—would go on to race the winners of other heats, until at last there was only one winner. Cliff didn’t dare dream that he would be that winner.<br>
<br>
<em>2</em>&nbsp;“This race sure has come a long way in the past six years,” a man sitting in the nearby bleachers remarked. “I was in the crowd at the very first soap box derby back in 1933. About 350 boys participated in that race. You should have seen the cars back then. Most of them were made from old crates or heavy sheets of tin. Some of them looked as if they were going to rattle apart.” He chuckled.<br>
<br>
<em>3</em>&nbsp;“In which lane did the winner race?” Cliff asked.<br>
<br>
<em>4</em>&nbsp;“Oh, this fancy track wasn’t used then. In fact, there was no track at all,” the man said. “The boys raced down a big hill. This track here was built just three years ago for the 1936 race.”<br>
<br>
<em>5&nbsp;</em>After chatting with t he man a little bit more, Cliff walked up the hill to the area called Topside, where all the homemade race cars were stored and inspected. He wanted to check on his car. His family had shipped it from his home in White Plains, New York, a few days earlier. Derby guidelines stated that cars had to arrive in time for race officials to look them over and make sure they were safe.<br>
<br>
<em>6&nbsp;</em>Cliff found his car and stood back for a moment, running his eyes over it. It was a beauty. Whether he won the race or not, he knew he had done a good job.<br>
<br>
<em>7&nbsp;</em>Just then a thin man in dark glasses with a clipboard under h is arm walked over to him. “Are you the boy w ho built this car?” The man looked down at his clipboard. “Cliff Hardesty?”<br>
<br>
<em>8&nbsp;</em>“Yes, sir,” Cliff answered with a smile.<br>
<br>
<em>9&nbsp;</em>The man did not smile back. “Cliff, my name is Mr. Smith. I’ll be very candid with you. The truth is that your car concerns me. The regulations for this event state very clearly that every car entered in the All-American Soap Box Derby must have been built by the boy who will drive it. There can be no help from anyone else.”<br>
<br>
<em>10&nbsp;</em>“Yes, sir,” Cliff said, still not certain what Mr. Smith was talking about.<br>
<br>
<em>11&nbsp;</em>Mr. Smith sighed. “Cliff, your car is one of the best we’ve ever seen. Can you honestly expect us to believe that you built it all by yourself ? No one helped you?”<br>
<br>
<em>12&nbsp;</em>Cliff’s face grew hot as he realized what Mr. Smith was implying. “No, sir. No one helped me. I did everything according to the rules.” He looked Mr. Smith straight in the eye, but his throat felt tight with fear. Was Mr. Smith saying he might not be allowed to race? Would he be <span class="txt-underline">disqualified</span> for building a good car? “Mr. Smith,” Cliff said firmly, “I built this car myself.”<br>
<br>
<em>13&nbsp;</em>“I’m afraid you’re going to need to prove that,” Mr. Smith said. “We’ve set up a 12-member committee. We’ll ask you questions about how you built your car. We have to make sure that you’ve done everything the way you’re supposed to. If you can satisfy us that your car is legitimate, you can participate in the race.”<br>
<br>
<em>14&nbsp;</em>Called in front of the committee, Cliff answered question after question about his work on the car. Somewhere in the room a clock ticked very slowly. Cliff watched the faces of the men who would decide his fate. Some of them were easy to read. Others might as well have been carved of stone. The questioning dragged on so long that Cliff began to feel dizzy. At last the committee told Cliff to get some sleep and report back in the morning.<br>
<br>
<em>15&nbsp;</em>The next morning Cliff was taken to a garage. One of the committee members asked Cliff to reproduce part of his car while they watched. Feeling almost happy, Cliff picked up the tools that had been laid out for him. Finally he would be able to prove that he had built his car. He would demonstrate to the committee members that he had complied with the race requirements and had built his car without any help. He could feel the eyes of the committee members drilling holes in him as he thought about how to begin. Then he decided to pretend he was at home in his own workshop, and he began to work. Soon he was so involved in working on the car, he forgot all about the committee.<br>
<br>
<em>16&nbsp;</em>After only half an hour, Mr. Smith called o ut, “O.K., Cliff. You can stop.”<br>
<br>
<em>17&nbsp;</em>Cliff looked up in alarm, but then he relaxed when he saw the smile o n Mr. Smith’s face. “ You’re a very resourceful young man,” Mr. Smith said. “ We can all s ee that you’re building an even better car than the one you’ve entered in tomorrow’s race. Please accept my apologies for doubting you.”<br>
<br>
<em>18&nbsp;</em>Cliff’s laugh burst from him like air escaping from a<br>
popped balloon. “That’s all right, sir,” he said. “But if you<br>
gentlemen will excuse me now, I need to take my car for a<br>
test run. I plan to win tomorrow’s race, and I want to be<br>
ready.”<br>
<br>
<em>19&nbsp;</em>Relieved, Cliff eagerly prepared for his test run down the 1,600-foot-long track. He was finally free to do what he had come to Akron for—race his car. As he sped down the track, the car hurtled out of control. His car was wrecked, and Cliff had to be taken to the hospital. Race officials worked all afternoon and through the night to fix Cliff’s car in the hope that he would still be able to race. They didn’t want Cliff’s hard work to have been for nothing.<br>
<br>
<em>20&nbsp;</em>The next day Cliff was released from the hospital. He was banged up but ready to participate in the race and grateful that his car had been repaired. The victory he achieved that day by winning the sixth annual All - American Soap Box Derby was proof of his talent and of the superiority of his car’s design.<br>

Most&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;electricity we use comes from power stations. Inside a power station, water is boiled by burning coal, gas or oil, or by the energy from nuclear reactions. The steam from the boiling water turns turbines that power a huge dynamo called a generator. In the generator, an electromagnet turns inside a coil of wire. This creates electricity in the coil of wire.</p>

        <p>Claude Monet (1840–1926) was born in Paris, the son of a grocer, but was brought up in Le Havre in northern France. He showed talent for art as a teenager and was encouraged to paint outdoors by the landscape artist Eugène Boudin. Monet went to Paris to study under Charles Gabriel Gleyre. There, he met other artists including Auguste Renoir. Monet and Renoir often went on outdoor painting trips together and eventually won acclaim as the leading Impressionist painters.</p>
        <p>In the 1870s, Monet settled in a town near Paris called Argenteuil. He often invited his artist-friends there, including Manet, Sisley and Pissarro. In the 1880s, Monet based himself at a house in a village near Paris called Giverny, and went on several painting trips through France. He made many studies that focused on painting the same thing at different times of the day and in different seasons of the year, such as the cathedral in Rouen, haystacks and poplar trees. He also built a stunningly beautiful water garden at his home, with a Japanese bridge arching over a pond of water lilies and surrounded by willow trees. This garden became one of the main subjects of his painting for the rest of his life.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Information and History</strong>
        </p>
        <p>New Zealand is a fertile and mountainous group of islands in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. "It is a land uplifted high," wrote Abel&nbsp;Tasman, a Dutch navigator who was the first European to sight New Zealand, in 1642. Snowy peaks, fjord-scarred shores, and pastures dotted with sheep define this country.</p>
        <p>New Zealand, a parliamentary democracy modelled on that of the United Kingdom, has been a self-governing British dominion since 1907. It became a founding member of the British Commonwealth in 1926. One in three citizens – Kiwis – lives in or around the city of Auckland. Rugby clubs with names such as Canterbury and Wellington reveal a nation peopled mostly by descendants of British settlers. The indigenous Maori constitute about 14 percent of New Zealanders; recent immigrants – primarily from Samoa and Fiji – give Auckland one of the world's largest Polynesian populations.</p>
        <p>The export-driven country, whose chief trading partner used to be the United Kingdom, faltered in 1973 when Britain joined the European Union. The loss of preferential treatment prompted a search for new markets. Japan, Australia, and the U.S. now buy half of all exports, which include wool, mutton, lamb, beef, cheese, fish, and chemicals. New Zealand plays an active role in helping democratic nations and emerging Pacific island economies. It sent troops to East Timor when violence broke out in 1999, and it provided millions of dollars to the South Pacific island of Niue after it was devastated by a tropical cyclone in 2004. Niue and the Cook Islands enjoy a status of self-government in free association with New Zealand.</p>

          <strong>Information and History</strong>
        </p>
        <p>New Zealand is a fertile and mountainous group of islands in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. "It is a land uplifted high," wrote Abel&nbsp;Tasman, a Dutch navigator who was the first European to sight New Zealand, in 1642. Snowy peaks, fjord-scarred shores, and pastures dotted with sheep define this country.</p>
        <p>New Zealand, a parliamentary democracy modelled on that of the United Kingdom, has been a self-governing British dominion since 1907. It became a founding member of the British Commonwealth in 1926. One in three citizens – Kiwis – lives in or around the city of Auckland. Rugby clubs with names such as Canterbury and Wellington reveal a nation peopled mostly by descendants of British settlers. The indigenous Maori constitute about 14 percent of New Zealanders; recent immigrants – primarily from Samoa and Fiji – give Auckland one of the world's largest Polynesian populations.</p>
        <p>The export-driven country, whose chief trading partner used to be the United Kingdom, faltered in 1973 when Britain joined the European Union. The loss of preferential treatment prompted a search for new markets. Japan, Australia, and the U.S. now buy half of all exports, which include wool, mutton, lamb, beef, cheese, fish, and chemicals. New Zealand plays an active role in helping democratic nations and emerging Pacific island economies. It sent troops to East Timor when violence broke out in 1999, and it provided millions of dollars to the South Pacific island of Niue after it was devastated by a tropical cyclone in 2004. Niue and the Cook Islands enjoy a status of self-government in free association with New Zealand.</p>

Rugby clubs with names such as Canterbury and Wellington reveal a nation peopled mostly by descendants of British settlers. The indigenous Maori constitute about 14 percent of New Zealanders; recent immigrants – primarily from Samoa and Fiji – give Auckland one of the world's largest Polynesian populations.</p>
        <p>The export-driven country, whose chief trading partner used to be the United Kingdom, faltered in 1973 when Britain joined the European Union. The loss of preferential treatment prompted a search for new markets. Japan, Australia, and the U.S. now buy half of all exports, which include wool, mutton, lamb, beef, cheese, fish, and chemicals. New Zealand plays an active role in helping democratic nations and emerging Pacific island economies. It sent troops to East Timor when violence broke out in 1999, and it provided millions of dollars to the South Pacific island of Niue after it was devastated by a tropical cyclone in 2004. Niue and the Cook Islands enjoy a status of self-government in free association with New Zealand.</p>
