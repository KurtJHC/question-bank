        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some photographers capture artistic images from nature or create elegant portraits of people. Others are drawn to more unusual subjects. William Wegman belongs in the last category. For more than 30 years, he has photographed his beloved Weimaraner dogs, often posing them in human costumes. He is known all over the world for his dog portraits.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wegman grew up in Massachusetts and attended art school in the 1960s before becoming a professional artist. He began his career as a painter. Later he worked with other artists to create art and video pieces. During this time he also became interested in photography.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In 1970 Wegman acquired his first Weimaraner. He had promised his wife that they would get a dog. She wanted a short-haired dog, and someone had told them that Weimaraners made good pets. They saw an&nbsp;ad for Weimaraner puppies in the newspaper and went to look at them. When they arrived, however, there was only one left. Because of the way it looked—round, plump, and gray—Wegman wasn’t sure he wanted it. But his wife wanted the puppy. They agreed that a coin toss would decide. His wife won, and they took the puppy home with them.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Wegmans named the puppy Man Ray after a famous American painter and photographer. The dog kept barging into the art videos that Wegman was filming, so Wegman decided to let the dog be part of the art. He videotaped and photographed Man Ray for a dozen years. By the mid-1970s Wegman was drawing praise for his work.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Man Ray died in the early 1980s, and Wegman remained dogless for three years. One day in 1985 he happened to visit a litter of Weimaraner puppies. He fell in love with a female puppy and took her home. He named her Fay Ray. Eventually Wegman began photographing Fay Ray in costumes. The effects of the photographs were so <span class="txt-underline">intriguing</span> that the television program Sesame Street hired Wegman to create entertaining educational videos. When Fay Ray had a litter of puppies, Wegman began photographing them as well.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;About dressing the dogs, Wegman says, “I never treat it as a joke.” The dogs are in costume for only the few seconds that it takes to photograph them. Wegman will not do anything that makes them uncomfortable. The dogs perform willingly. Wegman understands the dogs well and knows what each dog will tolerate. “Every dog is an individual,” Wegman says. “Chundo doesn’t like to sit long but is the most eager to work. Chip doesn’t mind hats. Chundo does. Batty falls asleep while posing, with or without a costume.”</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unlike some people, who believe that dogs don’t think about much, Wegman believes dogs are “really teeming with their own thoughts.” He enjoys watching their behavior and “listening to them.”&nbsp;Wegman spends part of the year in New York and the rest of the year in a hunting lodge in western Maine with his wife and two children and, of course, the dogs.</p>

        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unlike some people, who believe that dogs don’t think about much, Wegman believes dogs are “really teeming with their own thoughts.” He enjoys watching their behavior and “listening to them.”&nbsp;Wegman spends part of the year in New York and the rest of the year in a hunting lodge in western Maine with his wife and two children and, of course, the dogs.</p>

        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You can’t imagine how much diligence, concentration, and sheer patience the work requires. Most people who have seen my photographs think it’s easy.

        </p>
        <p>
          <em>
            <strong>I’m sure it’s hard work, but you seem to enjoy it, judging from the photographs, especially the Cinderella series.</strong>
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Oh, yes! When I’m in the studio with Wegman, he gives me a lot of attention and praise. Sometimes the other dogs get jealous, but Wegman finds things for them to do, too. It’s fun to dress up and pretend to be someone else for a little while. I looked scary wearing the wig when I posed as Cinderella’s stepmother, don’t you think? Wegman isn’t satisfied with anything less than perfection. The lighting, the angles of my poses, the costumes—all the elements have to be just right for him. Wegman really knows what he’s doing.</p>
        <p>
          <em>
            <strong>How did Wegman find you?</strong>
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well, my siblings and I were sharing a crate—I was just a puppy then—when suddenly I looked up one day and this fellow with a round face and tousled hair was staring at me. “I like this cinnamon one” is what he said, I think. My then-owner reached into the crate, picked me up, and handed me to Wegman. As he held me up to his face so he could appreciate my beauty, I remember thinking to myself, “Why doesn’t this human comb his hair?” He looked a mess!</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Even so, I have to confess that I rather liked the man right off the bat. He is kind and slightly mischievous. When he began photographing me, it seemed like a game. In fact, it still does. In the early days I enjoyed surprising him with different expressions. I’ve overheard him telling others that I have a “chameleon quality.” I’m not sure what that means, but I like the sound of it. Perhaps it has something to do with my beauty or my professionalism.</p>
        <p>
          <em>
            <strong>Your children now model for Wegman. How do you feel about that?</strong>
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Just try to stop them from bounding into a picture! They adore being photographed. They think Wegman is wonderful, a lovable human uncle. He never makes fun of us while we work. And the love he has for us shows in every picture.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            <em>Are there any drawbacks to being a dog model?</em>
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well, for starters, I’ve practically been mobbed when trying to do some shopping at my local pet store. That’s certainly no fun. My fans are a bit overeager. Humans don’t always know how to express themselves. And some dogs are jealous of my career, so they can get snippy when they see me padding around town.</p>
        <p>
          <em>
            <strong>Will you continue your career with Wegman, or do you have plans for retirement?</strong>
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unlike human models, the career of a dog model can be quite long. We dogs hold on to our looks well. I can’t imagine retiring anytime soon.</p>

            <strong>I’m sure it’s hard work, but you seem to enjoy it, judging from the photographs, especially the Cinderella series.</strong>
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Oh, yes! When I’m in the studio with Wegman, he gives me a lot of attention and praise. Sometimes the other dogs get jealous, but Wegman finds things for them to do, too. It’s fun to dress up and pretend to be someone else for a little while. I looked scary wearing the wig when I posed as Cinderella’s stepmother, don’t you think? Wegman isn’t satisfied with anything less than perfection. The lighting, the angles of my poses, the costumes—all the elements have to be just right for him. Wegman really knows what he’s doing.</p>
        <p>
          <em>
            <strong>How did Wegman find you?</strong>
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well, my siblings and I were sharing a crate—I was just a puppy then—when suddenly I looked up one day and this fellow with a round face and tousled hair was staring at me. “I like this cinnamon one” is what he said, I think. My then-owner reached into the crate, picked me up, and handed me to Wegman. As he held me up to his face so he could appreciate my beauty, I remember thinking to myself, “Why doesn’t this human comb his hair?” He looked a mess!</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Even so, I have to confess that I rather liked the man right off the bat. He is kind and slightly mischievous. When he began photographing me, it seemed like a game. In fact, it still does. In the early days I enjoyed surprising him with different expressions. I’ve overheard him telling others that I have a “chameleon quality.” I’m not sure what that means, but I like the sound of it. Perhaps it has something to do with my beauty or my professionalism.</p>
        <p>
          <em>

My then-owner reached into the crate, picked me up, and handed me to Wegman. As he held me up to his face so he could appreciate my beauty, I remember thinking to myself, “Why doesn’t this human comb his hair?” He looked a mess!</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Even so, I have to confess that I rather liked the man right off the bat. He is kind and slightly mischievous. When he began photographing me, it seemed like a game. In fact, it still does. In the early days I enjoyed surprising him with different expressions. I’ve overheard him telling others that I have a “chameleon quality.” I’m not sure what that means, but I like the sound of it. Perhaps it has something to do with my beauty or my professionalism.</p>
        <p>
          <em>
            <strong>Your children now model for Wegman. How do you feel about that?</strong>
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Just try to stop them from bounding into a picture! They adore being photographed. They think Wegman is wonderful, a lovable human uncle. He never makes fun of us while we work. And the love he has for us shows in every picture.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            <em>Are there any drawbacks to being a dog model?</em>
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well, for starters, I’ve practically been mobbed when trying to do some shopping at my local pet store. That’s certainly no fun. My fans are a bit overeager. Humans don’t always know how to express themselves. And some dogs are jealous of my career, so they can get snippy when they see me padding around town.</p>
        <p>
          <em>
            <strong>Will you continue your career with Wegman, or do you have plans for retirement?</strong>
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unlike human models, the career of a dog model can be quite long. We dogs hold on to our looks well. I can’t imagine retiring anytime soon.</p>

          <strong>William Wegman</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some photographers capture artistic images from nature or create elegant portraits of people. Others are drawn to more unusual subjects. William Wegman belongs in the last category. For more than 30 years, he has photographed his beloved Weimaraner dogs, often posing them in human costumes. He is known all over the world for his dog portraits.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
                  <img width="88%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766022244/euqg5bfho5xvi8dsp3gk.png" alt="T3_Y5_CT_EN_01">


        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wegman grew up in Massachusetts and attended art school in the 1960s before becoming a professional artist. He began his career as a painter. Later he worked with other artists to create art and video pieces. During this time he also became interested in photography.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In 1970 Wegman acquired his first Weimaraner. He had promised his wife that they would get a dog. She wanted a short-haired dog, and someone had told them that Weimaraners made good pets. They saw an&nbsp;ad for Weimaraner puppies in the newspaper and went to look at them. When they arrived, however, there was only one left. Because of the way it looked—round, plump, and gray—Wegman wasn’t sure he wanted it. But his wife wanted the puppy. They agreed that a coin toss would decide. His wife won, and they took the puppy home with them.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Wegmans named the puppy Man Ray after a famous American painter and photographer. The dog kept barging into the art videos that Wegman was filming, so Wegman decided to let the dog be part of the art. He videotaped and photographed Man Ray for a dozen years. By the mid-1970s Wegman was drawing praise for his work.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Man Ray died in the early 1980s, and Wegman remained dogless for three years. One day in 1985 he happened to visit a litter of Weimaraner puppies. He fell in love with a female puppy and took her home. He named her Fay Ray. Eventually Wegman began photographing Fay Ray in costumes. The effects of the photographs were so&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">intriguing</span>&nbsp;that the television program Sesame Street hired Wegman to create entertaining educational videos. When Fay Ray had a litter of puppies, Wegman began photographing them as well.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;About dressing the dogs, Wegman says, “I never treat it as a joke.” The dogs are in costume for only the few seconds that it takes to photograph them. Wegman will not do anything that makes them uncomfortable. The dogs perform willingly. Wegman understands the dogs well and knows what each dog will tolerate. “Every dog is an individual,” Wegman says. “Chundo doesn’t like to sit long but is the most eager to work. Chip doesn’t mind hats. Chundo does. Batty falls asleep while posing, with or without a costume.”</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unlike some people, who believe that dogs don’t think about much, Wegman believes dogs are “really teeming with their own thoughts.” He enjoys watching their behavior and “listening to them.”&nbsp;Wegman spends part of the year in New York and the rest of the year in a hunting lodge in western Maine with his wife and two children and, of course, the dogs.</p>

          <em>Most of William Wegman’s dog models are totally uninterested in granting interviews. But reporter Patricia Johanson was lucky. In 1993 Fay Ray, one of Wegman’s most popular dog models, found time in her busy schedule to answer a few questions.</em>

            <strong>What’s it like to be a dog model?</strong>
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You can’t imagine how much diligence, concentration, and sheer patience the work requires. Most people who have seen my photographs think it’s easy. They think I just slip my paws into a ball gown or an overcoat, hop onto a chair, and—poof!—Wegman snaps the picture. I’ve even heard Wegman tell people how easy it all seems, but don’t be fooled by what he says.</p>

          <em>
            <strong>I’m sure it’s hard work, but you seem to enjoy it, judging from the photographs, especially the Cinderella series.</strong>
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Oh, yes! When I’m in the studio with Wegman, he gives me a lot of attention and praise. Sometimes the other dogs get jealous, but Wegman finds things for them to do, too. It’s fun to dress up and pretend to be someone else for a little while. I looked scary wearing the wig when I posed as Cinderella’s stepmother, don’t you think? Wegman isn’t satisfied with anything less than perfection. The lighting, the angles of my poses, the costumes—all the elements have to be just right for him. Wegman really knows what he’s doing.</p>

          <em>
            <strong>How did Wegman find you?</strong>

        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some photographers capture artistic images from nature or create elegant portraits of people. Others are drawn to more unusual subjects. William Wegman belongs in the last category. For more than 30 years, he has photographed his beloved Weimaraner dogs, often posing them in human costumes. He is known all over the world for his dog portraits.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wegman grew up in Massachusetts and attended art school in the 1960s before becoming a professional artist. He began his career as a painter. Later he worked with other artists to create art and video pieces. During this time he also became interested in photography.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In 1970 Wegman acquired his first Weimaraner. He had promised his wife that they would get a dog. She wanted a short-haired dog, and someone had told them that Weimaraners made good pets. They saw an&nbsp;ad for Weimaraner puppies in the newspaper and went to look at them. When they arrived, however, there was only one left. Because of the way it looked—round, plump, and gray—Wegman wasn’t sure he wanted it. But his wife wanted the puppy. They agreed that a coin toss would decide. His wife won, and they took the puppy home with them.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Wegmans named the puppy Man Ray after a famous American painter and photographer. The dog kept barging into the art videos that Wegman was filming, so Wegman decided to let the dog be part of the art. He videotaped and photographed Man Ray for a dozen years. By the mid-1970s Wegman was drawing praise for his work.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Man Ray died in the early 1980s, and Wegman remained dogless for three years. One day in 1985 he happened to visit a litter of Weimaraner puppies. He fell in love with a female puppy and took her home. He named her Fay Ray. Eventually Wegman began photographing Fay Ray in costumes. The effects of the photographs were so&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">intriguing</span>&nbsp;that the television program Sesame Street hired Wegman to create entertaining educational videos. When Fay Ray had a litter of puppies, Wegman began photographing them as well.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;About dressing the dogs, Wegman says, “I never treat it as a joke.” The dogs are in costume for only the few seconds that it takes to photograph them. Wegman will not do anything that makes them uncomfortable. The dogs perform willingly. Wegman understands the dogs well and knows what each dog will tolerate. “Every dog is an individual,” Wegman says. “Chundo doesn’t like to sit long but is the most eager to work. Chip doesn’t mind hats. Chundo does. Batty falls asleep while posing, with or without a costume.”</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unlike some people, who believe that dogs don’t think about much, Wegman believes dogs are “really teeming with their own thoughts.” He enjoys watching their behavior and “listening to them.”&nbsp;Wegman spends part of the year in New York and the rest of the year in a hunting lodge in western Maine with his wife and two children and, of course, the dogs.</p>

            <strong>What’s it like to be a dog model?</strong>

        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You can’t imagine how much diligence, concentration, and sheer patience the work requires. Most people who have seen my photographs think it’s easy. They think I just slip my paws into a ball gown or an overcoat, hop onto a chair, and—poof!—Wegman snaps the picture. I’ve even heard Wegman tell people how easy it all seems, but don’t be fooled by what he says.</p>

          <em>
            <strong>I’m sure it’s hard work, but you seem to enjoy it, judging from the photographs, especially the Cinderella series.</strong>
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Oh, yes! When I’m in the studio with Wegman, he gives me a lot of attention and praise. Sometimes the other dogs get jealous, but Wegman finds things for them to do, too. It’s fun to dress up and pretend to be someone else for a little while. I looked scary wearing the wig when I posed as Cinderella’s stepmother, don’t you think? Wegman isn’t satisfied with anything less than perfection. The lighting, the angles of my poses, the costumes—all the elements have to be just right for him. Wegman really knows what he’s doing.</p>
        <p>
          <em>
            <strong>How did Wegman find you?</strong>
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well, my siblings and I were sharing a crate—I was just a puppy then—when suddenly I looked up one day and this fellow with a round face and tousled hair was staring at me. “I like this cinnamon one” is what he said, I think. My then-owner reached into the crate, picked me up, and handed me to Wegman. As he held me up to his face so he could appreciate my beauty, I remember thinking to myself, “Why doesn’t this human comb his hair?” He looked a mess!</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Even so, I have to confess that I rather liked the man right off the bat. He is kind and slightly mischievous. When he began photographing me, it seemed like a game. In fact, it still does. In the early days I enjoyed surprising him with different expressions. I’ve overheard him telling others that I have a “chameleon quality.” I’m not sure what that means, but I like the sound of it. Perhaps it has something to do with my beauty or my professionalism.</p>
        <p>
          <em>
            <strong>Your children now model for Wegman. How do you feel about that?</strong>
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Just try to stop them from bounding into a picture! They adore being photographed. They think Wegman is wonderful, a lovable human uncle. He never makes fun of us while we work. And the love he has for us shows in every picture.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            <em>Are there any drawbacks to being a dog model?</em>
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well, for starters, I’ve practically been mobbed when trying to do some shopping at my local pet store. That’s certainly no fun. My fans are a bit overeager. Humans don’t always know how to express themselves. And some dogs are jealous of my career, so they can get snippy when they see me padding around town.</p>
        <p>
          <em>
            <strong>Will you continue your career with Wegman, or do you have plans for retirement?</strong>
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unlike human models, the career of a dog model can be quite long. We dogs hold on to our looks well. I can’t imagine retiring anytime soon.</p>

          </em>
        </p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Just try to stop them from bounding into a picture! They adore being photographed. They think Wegman is wonderful, a lovable human uncle. He never makes fun of us while we work. And the love he has for us shows in every picture.</p>

          <strong>
            <em>Are there any drawbacks to being a dog model?</em>
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well, for starters, I’ve practically been mobbed when trying to do some shopping at my local pet store. That’s certainly no fun. My fans are a bit overeager. Humans don’t always know how to express themselves. And some dogs are jealous of my career, so they can get snippy when they see me padding around town.</p>
        <p>
          <em>
            <strong>Will you continue your career with Wegman, or do you have plans for retirement?</strong>
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unlike human models, the career of a dog model can be quite long. We dogs hold on to our looks well. I can’t imagine retiring anytime soon.</p>

          <em>Segregation, or separation of people by race, was once a part of life in the United States. Professional baseball, public schools, buildings, and buses and trains were often segregated. The following is the story of Mamie Johnson, a young African American woman who fought for the chance to play baseball.</em>
        </p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Leave!” the large man with the cigar yelled. “Colored girls like you aren’t allowed to play in this league!”</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Seventeen-year-old Mamie Johnson couldn’t believe what the man was saying to her. For her entire life, all that she had thought about was baseball. Mamie had played in her grandmother’s yard when she was a young girl. When she was 10, she was selected to play on the all-white, all-male Police Athletic League team in Long Branch, New Jersey, after she demonstrated her pitching skills to the coach. When she moved to Washington, D.C., to live with her mother, she played in a city league that had excellent players. And today this man from the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League was telling her that she didn’t belong, without even letting her try out for the team!</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mamie reached down and picked up the ball she had been practicing with. She squeezed it as hard as she could, trying to hold back the tears. As she held the ball, she knew she had to throw it at least once. She knew the man would never change his mind, but she had to show him what he would be missing. She raised the ball up to her chest, kicked up her leg, pulled her arm back, and threw the ball as hard as she could toward home plate.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the ball landed beyond home plate, everyone’s eyes turned toward Mamie. She heard the whispers as she picked up her things. With her head held high, Mamie walked off the field and headed for the bus stop. She had been fighting battles like this all her life. People would tell her that girls weren’t supposed to play baseball. Then they would tell her that she shouldn’t play baseball with boys. Other people didn’t think she should play with white people.&nbsp;Some even taunted her about her small size. She was only five feet three inches tall and weighed less than 100 pounds. But Mamie surprised them, and she always proved them wrong.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although Mamie wasn’t given a chance to try out for the girl’s professional baseball league, she didn’t stop playing the game she loved. She spent just about every Sunday afternoon during spring and summer playing at Bannecker Field in Washington, D.C. The people who watched her play weren’t so critical. The baseball field was in the middle of an African American neighborhood. A university and a school were nearby, and there was a bakery so close by that freshly baked bread could be smelled from the field. When Mamie stepped up on the pitcher’s mound, she could see the U.S. Capitol.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One Sunday afternoon in 1953, Mamie’s friend Rita pointed at the stands and whispered, “That man in the suit has been at our games for the last three weeks. I wonder who he is.” Rita loved baseball as much as Mamie did. Rita had gone to the tryouts for the girl’s professional baseball league with Mamie two years ago, hoping to get a position on the team. Mamie wondered whether the man was a scout looking for new players for a professional team.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Let’s show him how well the girls can play with these guys,” Mamie said, smiling at Rita.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mamie ran onto the field and took her spot on the pitcher’s mound. She was feeling good, and her right arm felt strong. Even though Mamie was tiny, she didn’t feel small today. As the game began and she threw more and more pitches, she started to feel like a giant. Mamie struck out one batter after another and thought she was having her best game ever.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By the time the game was almost over, Mamie’s team was winning, but by only one run. Mamie looked at the last batter. She knew that he was just as determined to win the game as she was. Mamie could also feel the man in the suit watching her from the stands. She had to show them both what she could do. This batter was the best hitter on the team. He would try to hit a home run, and there were two runners on&nbsp;the bases. Mamie knew she had to strike him out. She took a deep breath and gripped the ball in her hand. Then she threw the first pitch right over the plate for a strike.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the batter got set again, Mamie thought about her next pitch. Staring at the tall batter, Mamie threw a ball that was level with his knees. He swung hard but missed, for a second strike.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“One more strike, and he’s out!” Mamie heard Rita yelling from behind her. “You can do it!”</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mamie tried to relax as she felt the eyes of the man in the suit watching her every move. She stepped back onto the pitcher’s mound and again waited for the batter to get ready. She didn’t have to wait for long, though. He stepped up to the plate and pointed at Mamie with the bat, trying to make her flinch. But that was the worst thing he could have done. Mamie remained calm. With all her might, she threw the ball and sent the batter a message—strike three!</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before Mamie knew it, she was surrounded by <span class="txt-underline">jubilant</span> teammates who jumped up and down and congratulated her. Then the man in the suit shook her hand and introduced himself. “I’m Bish Tyson,” he said. “Can you come try out for my team next week? I work for the Indianapolis Clowns, one of the best professional baseball teams in the Negro Leagues. I’d like to recruit you for the team.”</p>
        <p>
          <em>In 1953 Mamie “Peanut” Johnson (who was given her nickname because of her size) became the first woman to pitch in a professional baseball league for African American men. Known for her pitching style and precision, Mamie Johnson proved her ability to play alongside men.</em>

When Mamie stepped up on the pitcher’s mound, she could see the U.S. Capitol.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One Sunday afternoon in 1953, Mamie’s friend Rita pointed at the stands and whispered, “That man in the suit has been at our games for the last three weeks. I wonder who he is.” Rita loved baseball as much as Mamie did. Rita had gone to the tryouts for the girl’s professional baseball league with Mamie two years ago, hoping to get a position on the team. Mamie wondered whether the man was a scout looking for new players for a professional team.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Let’s show him how well the girls can play with these guys,” Mamie said, smiling at Rita.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mamie ran onto the field and took her spot on the pitcher’s mound. She was feeling good, and her right arm felt strong. Even though Mamie was tiny, she didn’t feel small today. As the game began and she threw more and more pitches, she started to feel like a giant. Mamie struck out one batter after another and thought she was having her best game ever.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By the time the game was almost over, Mamie’s team was winning, but by only one run. Mamie looked at the last batter. She knew that he was just as determined to win the game as she was. Mamie could also feel the man in the suit watching her from the stands. She had to show them both what she could do. This batter was the best hitter on the team. He would try to hit a home run, and there were two runners on&nbsp;the bases. Mamie knew she had to strike him out. She took a deep breath and gripped the ball in her hand. Then she threw the first pitch right over the plate for a strike.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the batter got set again, Mamie thought about her next pitch. Staring at the tall batter, Mamie threw a ball that was level with his knees. He swung hard but missed, for a second strike.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“One more strike, and he’s out!” Mamie heard Rita yelling from behind her. “You can do it!”</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mamie tried to relax as she felt the eyes of the man in the suit watching her every move. She stepped back onto the pitcher’s mound and again waited for the batter to get ready. She didn’t have to wait for long, though. He stepped up to the plate and pointed at Mamie with the bat, trying to make her flinch. But that was the worst thing he could have done. Mamie remained calm. With all her might, she threw the ball and sent the batter a message—strike three!</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before Mamie knew it, she was surrounded by <span class="txt-underline">jubilant</span> teammates who jumped up and down and congratulated her. Then the man in the suit shook her hand and introduced himself. “I’m Bish Tyson,” he said. “Can you come try out for my team next week? I work for the Indianapolis Clowns, one of the best professional baseball teams in the Negro Leagues. I’d like to recruit you for the team.”</p>

          <em>Segregation, or separation of people by race, was once a part of life in the United States. Professional baseball, public schools, buildings, and buses and trains were often segregated. The following is the story of Mamie Johnson, a young African American woman who fought for the chance to play baseball.</em>
        </p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Leave!” the large man with the cigar yelled. “Colored girls like you aren’t allowed to play in this league!”</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Seventeen-year-old Mamie Johnson couldn’t believe what the man was saying to her. For her entire life, all that she had thought about was baseball. Mamie had played in her grandmother’s yard when she was a young girl. When she was 10, she was selected to play on the all-white, all-male Police Athletic League team in Long Branch, New Jersey, after she demonstrated her pitching skills to the coach. When she moved to Washington, D.C., to live with her mother, she played in a city league that had excellent players. And today this man from the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League was telling her that she didn’t belong, without even letting her try out for the team!</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mamie reached down and picked up the ball she had been practicing with. She squeezed it as hard as she could, trying to hold back the tears. As she held the ball, she knew she had to throw it at least once. She knew the man would never change his mind, but she had to show him what he would be missing. She raised the ball up to her chest, kicked up her leg, pulled her arm back, and threw the ball as hard as she could toward home plate.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the ball landed beyond home plate, everyone’s eyes turned toward Mamie. She heard the whispers as she picked up her things. With her head held high, Mamie walked off the field and headed for the bus stop. She had been fighting battles like this all her life. People would tell her that girls weren’t supposed to play baseball. Then they would tell her that she shouldn’t play baseball with boys. Other people didn’t think she should play with white people.&nbsp;Some even taunted her about her small size. She was only five feet three inches tall and weighed less than 100 pounds. But Mamie surprised them, and she always proved them wrong.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although Mamie wasn’t given a chance to try out for the girl’s professional baseball league, she didn’t stop playing the game she loved. She spent just about every Sunday afternoon during spring and summer playing at Bannecker Field in Washington, D.C. The people who watched her play weren’t so critical. The baseball field was in the middle of an African American neighborhood. A university and a school were nearby, and there was a bakery so close by that freshly baked bread could be smelled from the field. When Mamie stepped up on the pitcher’s mound, she could see the U.S. Capitol.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One Sunday afternoon in 1953, Mamie’s friend Rita pointed at the stands and whispered, “That man in the suit has been at our games for the last three weeks. I wonder who he is.” Rita loved baseball as much as Mamie did. Rita had gone to the tryouts for the girl’s professional baseball league with Mamie two years ago, hoping to get a position on the team. Mamie wondered whether the man was a scout looking for new players for a professional team.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Let’s show him how well the girls can play with these guys,” Mamie said, smiling at Rita.</p>

Even though Mamie was tiny, she didn’t feel small today. As the game began and she threw more and more pitches, she started to feel like a giant. Mamie struck out one batter after another and thought she was having her best game ever.</p>

        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before Mamie knew it, she was surrounded by <span class="txt-underline">jubilant</span> teammates who jumped up and down and congratulated her. Then the man in the suit shook her hand and introduced himself. “I’m Bish Tyson,” he said. “Can you come try out for my team next week? I work for the Indianapolis Clowns, one of the best professional baseball teams in the Negro Leagues. I’d like to recruit you for the team.”</p>

When she moved to Washington, D.C., to live with her mother, she played in a city league that had excellent players. And today this man from the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League was telling her that she didn’t belong, without even letting her try out for the team!</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mamie reached down and picked up the ball she had been practicing with. She squeezed it as hard as she could, trying to hold back the tears. As she held the ball, she knew she had to throw it at least once. She knew the man would never change his mind, but she had to show him what he would be missing. She raised the ball up to her chest, kicked up her leg, pulled her arm back, and threw the ball as hard as she could toward home plate.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the ball landed beyond home plate, everyone’s eyes turned toward Mamie. She heard the whispers as she picked up her things. With her head held high, Mamie walked off the field and headed for the bus stop. She had been fighting battles like this all her life. People would tell her that girls weren’t supposed to play baseball. Then they would tell her that she shouldn’t play baseball with boys. Other people didn’t think she should play with white people.&nbsp;Some even taunted her about her small size. She was only five feet three inches tall and weighed less than 100 pounds. But Mamie surprised them, and she always proved them wrong.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although Mamie wasn’t given a chance to try out for the girl’s professional baseball league, she didn’t stop playing the game she loved. She spent just about every Sunday afternoon during spring and summer playing at Bannecker Field in Washington, D.C. The people who watched her play weren’t so critical. The baseball field was in the middle of an African American neighborhood. A university and a school were nearby, and there was a bakery so close by that freshly baked bread could be smelled from the field. When Mamie stepped up on the pitcher’s mound, she could see the U.S. Capitol.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One Sunday afternoon in 1953, Mamie’s friend Rita pointed at the stands and whispered, “That man in the suit has been at our games for the last three weeks. I wonder who he is.” Rita loved baseball as much as Mamie did. Rita had gone to the tryouts for the girl’s professional baseball league with Mamie two years ago, hoping to get a position on the team. Mamie wondered whether the man was a scout looking for new players for a professional team.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Let’s show him how well the girls can play with these guys,” Mamie said, smiling at Rita.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mamie ran onto the field and took her spot on the pitcher’s mound. She was feeling good, and her right arm felt strong. Even though Mamie was tiny, she didn’t feel small today. As the game began and she threw more and more pitches, she started to feel like a giant. Mamie struck out one batter after another and thought she was having her best game ever.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By the time the game was almost over, Mamie’s team was winning, but by only one run. Mamie looked at the last batter. She knew that he was just as determined to win the game as she was. Mamie could also feel the man in the suit watching her from the stands. She had to show them both what she could do. This batter was the best hitter on the team. He would try to hit a home run, and there were two runners on&nbsp;the bases. Mamie knew she had to strike him out. She took a deep breath and gripped the ball in her hand. Then she threw the first pitch right over the plate for a strike.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the batter got set again, Mamie thought about her next pitch. Staring at the tall batter, Mamie threw a ball that was level with his knees. He swung hard but missed, for a second strike.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“One more strike, and he’s out!” Mamie heard Rita yelling from behind her. “You can do it!”</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mamie tried to relax as she felt the eyes of the man in the suit watching her every move. She stepped back onto the pitcher’s mound and again waited for the batter to get ready. She didn’t have to wait for long, though. He stepped up to the plate and pointed at Mamie with the bat, trying to make her flinch. But that was the worst thing he could have done. Mamie remained calm. With all her might, she threw the ball and sent the batter a message—strike three!</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before Mamie knew it, she was surrounded by <span class="txt-underline">jubilant</span> teammates who jumped up and down and congratulated her. Then the man in the suit shook her hand and introduced himself. “I’m Bish Tyson,” he said. “Can you come try out for my team next week? I work for the Indianapolis Clowns, one of the best professional baseball teams in the Negro Leagues. I’d like to recruit you for the team.”</p>
        <p>

          <em>Segregation, or separation of people by race, was once a part of life in the United States. Professional baseball, public schools, buildings, and buses and trains were often segregated. The following is the story of Mamie Johnson, a young African American woman who fought for the chance to play baseball.</em>
        </p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Leave!” the large man with the cigar yelled. “Colored girls like you aren’t allowed to play in this league!”</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Seventeen-year-old Mamie Johnson couldn’t believe what the man was saying to her. For her entire life, all that she had thought about was baseball. Mamie had played in her grandmother’s yard when she was a young girl. When she was 10, she was selected to play on the all-white, all-male Police Athletic League team in Long Branch, New Jersey, after she demonstrated her pitching skills to the coach.

          <em>Segregation, or separation of people by race, was once a part of life in the United States. Professional baseball, public schools, buildings, and buses and trains were often segregated. The following is the story of Mamie Johnson, a young African American woman who fought for the chance to play baseball.</em>
        </p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Leave!” the large man with the cigar yelled. “Colored girls like you aren’t allowed to play in this league!”</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Seventeen-year-old Mamie Johnson couldn’t believe what the man was saying to her. For her entire life, all that she had thought about was baseball. Mamie had played in her grandmother’s yard when she was a young girl. When she was 10, she was selected to play on the all-white, all-male Police Athletic League team in Long Branch, New Jersey, after she demonstrated her pitching skills to the coach. When she moved to Washington, D.C., to live with her mother, she played in a city league that had excellent players. And today this man from the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League was telling her that she didn’t belong, without even letting her try out for the team!</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mamie reached down and picked up the ball she had been practicing with. She squeezed it as hard as she could, trying to hold back the tears. As she held the ball, she knew she had to throw it at least once. She knew the man would never change his mind, but she had to show him what he would be missing. She raised the ball up to her chest, kicked up her leg, pulled her arm back, and threw the ball as hard as she could toward home plate.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the ball landed beyond home plate, everyone’s eyes turned toward Mamie. She heard the whispers as she picked up her things. With her head held high, Mamie walked off the field and headed for the bus stop. She had been fighting battles like this all her life. People would tell her that girls weren’t supposed to play baseball. Then they would tell her that she shouldn’t play baseball with boys. Other people didn’t think she should play with white people.&nbsp;Some even taunted her about her small size. She was only five feet three inches tall and weighed less than 100 pounds. But Mamie surprised them, and she always proved them wrong.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although Mamie wasn’t given a chance to try out for the girl’s professional baseball league, she didn’t stop playing the game she loved. She spent just about every Sunday afternoon during spring and summer playing at Bannecker Field in Washington, D.C. The people who watched her play weren’t so critical. The baseball field was in the middle of an African American neighborhood. A university and a school were nearby, and there was a bakery so close by that freshly baked bread could be smelled from the field. When Mamie stepped up on the pitcher’s mound, she could see the U.S. Capitol.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One Sunday afternoon in 1953, Mamie’s friend Rita pointed at the stands and whispered, “That man in the suit has been at our games for the last three weeks. I wonder who he is.” Rita loved baseball as much as Mamie did. Rita had gone to the tryouts for the girl’s professional baseball league with Mamie two years ago, hoping to get a position on the team. Mamie wondered whether the man was a scout looking for new players for a professional team.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Let’s show him how well the girls can play with these guys,” Mamie said, smiling at Rita.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mamie ran onto the field and took her spot on the pitcher’s mound. She was feeling good, and her right arm felt strong. Even though Mamie was tiny, she didn’t feel small today. As the game began and she threw more and more pitches, she started to feel like a giant. Mamie struck out one batter after another and thought she was having her best game ever.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By the time the game was almost over, Mamie’s team was winning, but by only one run. Mamie looked at the last batter. She knew that he was just as determined to win the game as she was. Mamie could also feel the man in the suit watching her from the stands. She had to show them both what she could do. This batter was the best hitter on the team. He would try to hit a home run, and there were two runners on&nbsp;the bases. Mamie knew she had to strike him out. She took a deep breath and gripped the ball in her hand. Then she threw the first pitch right over the plate for a strike.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the batter got set again, Mamie thought about her next pitch. Staring at the tall batter, Mamie threw a ball that was level with his knees. He swung hard but missed, for a second strike.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“One more strike, and he’s out!” Mamie heard Rita yelling from behind her. “You can do it!”</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mamie tried to relax as she felt the eyes of the man in the suit watching her every move. She stepped back onto the pitcher’s mound and again waited for the batter to get ready. She didn’t have to wait for long, though. He stepped up to the plate and pointed at Mamie with the bat, trying to make her flinch. But that was the worst thing he could have done. Mamie remained calm. With all her might, she threw the ball and sent the batter a message—strike three!</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before Mamie knew it, she was surrounded by <span class="txt-underline">jubilant</span> teammates who jumped up and down and congratulated her. Then the man in the suit shook her hand and introduced himself. “I’m Bish Tyson,” he said. “Can you come try out for my team next week? I work for the Indianapolis Clowns, one of the best professional baseball teams in the Negro Leagues. I’d like to recruit you for the team.”</p>
        <p>

          <strong>Striking Out the Guys</strong>

          <em>Segregation, or separation of people by race, was once a part of life in the United States. Professional baseball, public schools, buildings, and buses and trains were often segregated. The following is the story of Mamie Johnson, a young African American woman who fought for the chance to play baseball.</em>
        </p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Leave!” the large man with the cigar yelled. “Colored girls like you aren’t allowed to play in this league!”</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Seventeen-year-old Mamie Johnson couldn’t believe what the man was saying to her. For her entire life, all that she had thought about was baseball. Mamie had played in her grandmother’s yard when she was a young girl. When she was 10, she was selected to play on the all-white, all-male Police Athletic League team in Long Branch, New Jersey, after she demonstrated her pitching skills to the coach. When she moved to Washington, D.C., to live with her mother, she played in a city league that had excellent players. And today this man from the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League was telling her that she didn’t belong, without even letting her try out for the team!</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mamie reached down and picked up the ball she had been practicing with. She squeezed it as hard as she could, trying to hold back the tears. As she held the ball, she knew she had to throw it at least once. She knew the man would never change his mind, but she had to show him what he would be missing. She raised the ball up to her chest, kicked up her leg, pulled her arm back, and threw the ball as hard as she could toward home plate.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the ball landed beyond home plate, everyone’s eyes turned toward Mamie. She heard the whispers as she picked up her things. With her head held high, Mamie walked off the field and headed for the bus stop. She had been fighting battles like this all her life. People would tell her that girls weren’t supposed to play baseball. Then they would tell her that she shouldn’t play baseball with boys. Other people didn’t think she should play with white people.&nbsp;Some even taunted her about her small size. She was only five feet three inches tall and weighed less than 100 pounds. But Mamie surprised them, and she always proved them wrong.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although Mamie wasn’t given a chance to try out for the girl’s professional baseball league, she didn’t stop playing the game she loved. She spent just about every Sunday afternoon during spring and summer playing at Bannecker Field in Washington, D.C. The people who watched her play weren’t so critical. The baseball field was in the middle of an African American neighborhood. A university and a school were nearby, and there was a bakery so close by that freshly baked bread could be smelled from the field. When Mamie stepped up on the pitcher’s mound, she could see the U.S. Capitol.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One Sunday afternoon in 1953, Mamie’s friend Rita pointed at the stands and whispered, “That man in the suit has been at our games for the last three weeks. I wonder who he is.” Rita loved baseball as much as Mamie did. Rita had gone to the tryouts for the girl’s professional baseball league with Mamie two years ago, hoping to get a position on the team. Mamie wondered whether the man was a scout looking for new players for a professional team.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Let’s show him how well the girls can play with these guys,” Mamie said, smiling at Rita.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mamie ran onto the field and took her spot on the pitcher’s mound. She was feeling good, and her right arm felt strong. Even though Mamie was tiny, she didn’t feel small today. As the game began and she threw more and more pitches, she started to feel like a giant. Mamie struck out one batter after another and thought she was having her best game ever.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By the time the game was almost over, Mamie’s team was winning, but by only one run. Mamie looked at the last batter. She knew that he was just as determined to win the game as she was. Mamie could also feel the man in the suit watching her from the stands. She had to show them both what she could do. This batter was the best hitter on the team. He would try to hit a home run, and there were two runners on&nbsp;the bases. Mamie knew she had to strike him out. She took a deep breath and gripped the ball in her hand. Then she threw the first pitch right over the plate for a strike.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the batter got set again, Mamie thought about her next pitch. Staring at the tall batter, Mamie threw a ball that was level with his knees. He swung hard but missed, for a second strike.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“One more strike, and he’s out!” Mamie heard Rita yelling from behind her. “You can do it!”</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mamie tried to relax as she felt the eyes of the man in the suit watching her every move. She stepped back onto the pitcher’s mound and again waited for the batter to get ready. She didn’t have to wait for long, though. He stepped up to the plate and pointed at Mamie with the bat, trying to make her flinch. But that was the worst thing he could have done. Mamie remained calm. With all her might, she threw the ball and sent the batter a message—strike three!</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before Mamie knew it, she was surrounded by <span class="txt-underline">jubilant</span> teammates who jumped up and down and congratulated her. Then the man in the suit shook her hand and introduced himself. “I’m Bish Tyson,” he said. “Can you come try out for my team next week? I work for the Indianapolis Clowns, one of the best professional baseball teams in the Negro Leagues. I’d like to recruit you for the team.”</p>
        <p>
          <em>In 1953 Mamie “Peanut” Johnson (who was given her nickname because of her size) became the first woman to pitch in a professional baseball league for African American men. Known for her pitching style and precision, Mamie Johnson proved her ability to play alongside men.</em>

          <strong>Striking Out the Guys</strong>
        </p>

          <em>Segregation, or separation of people by race, was once a part of life in the United States. Professional baseball, public schools, buildings, and buses and trains were often segregated. The following is the story of Mamie Johnson, a young African American woman who fought for the chance to play baseball.</em>
        </p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Leave!” the large man with the cigar yelled. “Colored girls like you aren’t allowed to play in this league!”</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Seventeen-year-old Mamie Johnson couldn’t believe what the man was saying to her. For her entire life, all that she had thought about was baseball. Mamie had played in her grandmother’s yard when she was a young girl. When she was 10, she was selected to play on the all-white, all-male Police Athletic League team in Long Branch, New Jersey, after she demonstrated her pitching skills to the coach. When she moved to Washington, D.C., to live with her mother, she played in a city league that had excellent players. And today this man from the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League was telling her that she didn’t belong, without even letting her try out for the team!</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mamie reached down and picked up the ball she had been practicing with. She squeezed it as hard as she could, trying to hold back the tears. As she held the ball, she knew she had to throw it at least once. She knew the man would never change his mind, but she had to show him what he would be missing. She raised the ball up to her chest, kicked up her leg, pulled her arm back, and threw the ball as hard as she could toward home plate.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the ball landed beyond home plate, everyone’s eyes turned toward Mamie. She heard the whispers as she picked up her things. With her head held high, Mamie walked off the field and headed for the bus stop. She had been fighting battles like this all her life. People would tell her that girls weren’t supposed to play baseball. Then they would tell her that she shouldn’t play baseball with boys. Other people didn’t think she should play with white people.&nbsp;Some even taunted her about her small size. She was only five feet three inches tall and weighed less than 100 pounds. But Mamie surprised them, and she always proved them wrong.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although Mamie wasn’t given a chance to try out for the girl’s professional baseball league, she didn’t stop playing the game she loved. She spent just about every Sunday afternoon during spring and summer playing at Bannecker Field in Washington, D.C. The people who watched her play weren’t so critical. The baseball field was in the middle of an African American neighborhood. A university and a school were nearby, and there was a bakery so close by that freshly baked bread could be smelled from the field. When Mamie stepped up on the pitcher’s mound, she could see the U.S. Capitol.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One Sunday afternoon in 1953, Mamie’s friend Rita pointed at the stands and whispered, “That man in the suit has been at our games for the last three weeks. I wonder who he is.” Rita loved baseball as much as Mamie did. Rita had gone to the tryouts for the girl’s professional baseball league with Mamie two years ago, hoping to get a position on the team. Mamie wondered whether the man was a scout looking for new players for a professional team.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Let’s show him how well the girls can play with these guys,” Mamie said, smiling at Rita.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mamie ran onto the field and took her spot on the pitcher’s mound. She was feeling good, and her right arm felt strong. Even though Mamie was tiny, she didn’t feel small today. As the game began and she threw more and more pitches, she started to feel like a giant. Mamie struck out one batter after another and thought she was having her best game ever.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By the time the game was almost over, Mamie’s team was winning, but by only one run. Mamie looked at the last batter. She knew that he was just as determined to win the game as she was. Mamie could also feel the man in the suit watching her from the stands. She had to show them both what she could do. This batter was the best hitter on the team. He would try to hit a home run, and there were two runners on&nbsp;the bases. Mamie knew she had to strike him out. She took a deep breath and gripped the ball in her hand. Then she threw the first pitch right over the plate for a strike.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the batter got set again, Mamie thought about her next pitch. Staring at the tall batter, Mamie threw a ball that was level with his knees. He swung hard but missed, for a second strike.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“One more strike, and he’s out!” Mamie heard Rita yelling from behind her. “You can do it!”</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mamie tried to relax as she felt the eyes of the man in the suit watching her every move. She stepped back onto the pitcher’s mound and again waited for the batter to get ready. She didn’t have to wait for long, though. He stepped up to the plate and pointed at Mamie with the bat, trying to make her flinch. But that was the worst thing he could have done. Mamie remained calm. With all her might, she threw the ball and sent the batter a message—strike three!</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before Mamie knew it, she was surrounded by <span class="txt-underline">jubilant</span> teammates who jumped up and down and congratulated her. Then the man in the suit shook her hand and introduced himself. “I’m Bish Tyson,” he said. “Can you come try out for my team next week? I work for the Indianapolis Clowns, one of the best professional baseball teams in the Negro Leagues. I’d like to recruit you for the team.”</p>
        <p>
          <em>In 1953 Mamie “Peanut” Johnson (who was given her nickname because of her size) became the first woman to pitch in a professional baseball league for African American men. Known for her pitching style and precision, Mamie Johnson proved her ability to play alongside men.</em>

          <strong>Striking Out the Guys</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <br>
          <em>Segregation, or separation of people by race, was once a part of life in the United States. Professional baseball, public schools, buildings, and buses and trains were often segregated. The following is the story of Mamie Johnson, a young African American woman who fought for the chance to play baseball.</em>
        </p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Leave!” the large man with the cigar yelled. “Colored girls like you aren’t allowed to play in this league!”</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Seventeen-year-old Mamie Johnson couldn’t believe what the man was saying to her. For her entire life, all that she had thought about was baseball. Mamie had played in her grandmother’s yard when she was a young girl. When she was 10, she was selected to play on the all-white, all-male Police Athletic League team in Long Branch, New Jersey, after she demonstrated her pitching skills to the coach. When she moved to Washington, D.C., to live with her mother, she played in a city league that had excellent players. And today this man from the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League was telling her that she didn’t belong, without even letting her try out for the team!</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mamie reached down and picked up the ball she had been practicing with. She squeezed it as hard as she could, trying to hold back the tears. As she held the ball, she knew she had to throw it at least once. She knew the man would never change his mind, but she had to show him what he would be missing. She raised the ball up to her chest, kicked up her leg, pulled her arm back, and threw the ball as hard as she could toward home plate.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the ball landed beyond home plate, everyone’s eyes turned toward Mamie. She heard the whispers as she picked up her things. With her head held high, Mamie walked off the field and headed for the bus stop. She had been fighting battles like this all her life. People would tell her that girls weren’t supposed to play baseball. Then they would tell her that she shouldn’t play baseball with boys. Other people didn’t think she should play with white people.&nbsp;Some even taunted her about her small size. She was only five feet three inches tall and weighed less than 100 pounds. But Mamie surprised them, and she always proved them wrong.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although Mamie wasn’t given a chance to try out for the girl’s professional baseball league, she didn’t stop playing the game she loved. She spent just about every Sunday afternoon during spring and summer playing at Bannecker Field in Washington, D.C. The people who watched her play weren’t so critical. The baseball field was in the middle of an African American neighborhood. A university and a school were nearby, and there was a bakery so close by that freshly baked bread could be smelled from the field. When Mamie stepped up on the pitcher’s mound, she could see the U.S. Capitol.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One Sunday afternoon in 1953, Mamie’s friend Rita pointed at the stands and whispered, “That man in the suit has been at our games for the last three weeks. I wonder who he is.” Rita loved baseball as much as Mamie did. Rita had gone to the tryouts for the girl’s professional baseball league with Mamie two years ago, hoping to get a position on the team. Mamie wondered whether the man was a scout looking for new players for a professional team.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Let’s show him how well the girls can play with these guys,” Mamie said, smiling at Rita.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mamie ran onto the field and took her spot on the pitcher’s mound. She was feeling good, and her right arm felt strong. Even though Mamie was tiny, she didn’t feel small today. As the game began and she threw more and more pitches, she started to feel like a giant. Mamie struck out one batter after another and thought she was having her best game ever.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By the time the game was almost over, Mamie’s team was winning, but by only one run. Mamie looked at the last batter. She knew that he was just as determined to win the game as she was. Mamie could also feel the man in the suit watching her from the stands. She had to show them both what she could do. This batter was the best hitter on the team. He would try to hit a home run, and there were two runners on&nbsp;the bases. Mamie knew she had to strike him out. She took a deep breath and gripped the ball in her hand. Then she threw the first pitch right over the plate for a strike.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the batter got set again, Mamie thought about her next pitch. Staring at the tall batter, Mamie threw a ball that was level with his knees. He swung hard but missed, for a second strike.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“One more strike, and he’s out!” Mamie heard Rita yelling from behind her. “You can do it!”</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mamie tried to relax as she felt the eyes of the man in the suit watching her every move. She stepped back onto the pitcher’s mound and again waited for the batter to get ready. She didn’t have to wait for long, though. He stepped up to the plate and pointed at Mamie with the bat, trying to make her flinch. But that was the worst thing he could have done. Mamie remained calm. With all her might, she threw the ball and sent the batter a message—strike three!</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before Mamie knew it, she was surrounded by <span class="txt-underline">jubilant</span> teammates who jumped up and down and congratulated her. Then the man in the suit shook her hand and introduced himself. “I’m Bish Tyson,” he said. “Can you come try out for my team next week? I work for the Indianapolis Clowns, one of the best professional baseball teams in the Negro Leagues. I’d like to recruit you for the team.”</p>
        <p>
          <em>In 1953 Mamie “Peanut” Johnson (who was given her nickname because of her size) became the first woman to pitch in a professional baseball league for African American men. Known for her pitching style and precision, Mamie Johnson proved her ability to play alongside men.</em>

          <strong>My Trip to Big Bend</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Andres Benavides</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I went on an incredible trip to Big Bend National Park last week. Mom and Dad and I planned the whole thing with my cousin Mike, who works as a guide there. We had an unbelievable trip, including rafting, rock climbing, and backpacking. Mike wanted to show me what Big Bend National Park is all about.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On the first day we put on our helmets and life jackets, climbed into our raft, and plunged into the muddy Rio Grande. Mike taught me a few tips on paddling. While I practiced, he explained that our trip would take us through Boquillas Canyon. The trip was 33 miles long, much longer than the rafting trips I had taken before. But I was so excited that I didn’t mind. Besides, the calm waters kept us from getting too tired.</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
                  <img width="69%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766039416/fa6fwpwphpi8lrl0ft8d.png" alt="T3_Y5_CT_EN_23_1">


        </p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As Mike and I drifted through Boquillas Canyon, he told me a little about the area. Big Bend became a national park in 1944. It encompasses more than 800,000 acres. There are rugged mountains, a vast desert, deep canyons, and more than 100 miles of winding river. As we floated along in our raft, I looked up at towering cliffs as tall as skyscrapers. The huge rock walls made me feel very small. The only sound I could hear was the flowing river. Then suddenly I heard a low grunting. I looked up and saw a group of big hairy pigs passing by. I asked Mike whether there were farms in Big Bend. He laughed and told me that these creatures were actually javelinas, which look kind of like wild pigs.</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
                  <img width="50%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766039415/exyfvlhcijxasj6kapyl.png" alt="T3_Y5_CT_EN_23_2">


        </p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At the end of the day, we camped on the riverbank. At first I missed my soft bed back at home, but the stars overhead were so beautiful that I quickly forgot about being uncomfortable and fell asleep. The next morning my muscles ached from all the paddling the day before. Mike wasn’t sore at all. He was ready to go.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We spent three tiring but peaceful days floating through the canyon. After our tour of the canyon, we traded our raft and paddles for ropes and harnesses and started hiking through the desert to the Chisos Mountains. Although most of Big Bend is desert, there are forested mountains that reach a mile into the sky. Mike likes to call them the upside-down mountains. Most mountains have trees at the bottom and bare rocks at the top. The Chisos, however, have low, scrubby desert plants at the bottom and big trees at the top.</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
                  <img width="77%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766039416/oobcaqrblpyntvj53muf.png" alt="T3_Y5_CT_EN_23_3">


        </p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Admiring the mountain cliffs from a distance is one thing, but climbing them is another. I have to admit that I was a little uneasy. Fortunately Mike knew that I had never been rock climbing, so he took me to a fairly easy climbing area called Basin Rock. As we started up the cliffs, the big cracks in the rocks helped me keep my footing. The more we climbed, the easier it became. When we had climbed for a few hours, we stopped on a large flat slab and admired the view. After all that work, I didn’t want to go right back down the mountain.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once we made camp and ate dinner at the base of the mountain, I was so exhausted that I fell right to sleep. The next morning the yapping of nearby coyotes woke me. I went to wash up and discovered fresh coyote tracks just 30 feet from my sleeping bag! After eating a quick breakfast, we put on our backpacks and began our hike in the desert. The land seemed to <span class="txt-underline">transform</span> from big trees to pink and white wildflowers and cacti blooming with yellow flowers. One plant looked like a bunch of dagger blades sticking out of the ground. Mike said it was called lechuguilla. We had to walk carefully because so many of these plants were on the narrow dirt&nbsp;path. One wrong move and the sharp plants could have jabbed our skin right through our pants.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Several miles farther, the path became wider and steeper. Soon the trail was shaded by shrubby oak trees and junipers, which gave welcome relief from the desert heat. We had reached an area where the desert became forest. Now, instead of graceful roadrunners crossing our path, we had creepy tarantulas crawling by. I wasn’t too happy about this change. As we stopped to eat under the feathery dark-green branches of some pine trees, I realized how much I had seen and done in just a few days. I could hardly believe how fast the days had gone by. Thinking about leaving Big Bend made me realize that it is a place like no other on Earth.</p>

          <strong>My Trip to Big Bend</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Andres Benavides</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I went on an incredible trip to Big Bend National Park last week. Mom and Dad and I planned the whole thing with my cousin Mike, who works as a guide there. We had an unbelievable trip, including rafting, rock climbing, and backpacking. Mike wanted to show me what Big Bend National Park is all about.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On the first day we put on our helmets and life jackets, climbed into our raft, and plunged into the muddy Rio Grande. Mike taught me a few tips on paddling. While I practiced, he explained that our trip would take us through Boquillas Canyon. The trip was 33 miles long, much longer than the rafting trips I had taken before. But I was so excited that I didn’t mind. Besides, the calm waters kept us from getting too tired.</p>

        </p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As Mike and I drifted through Boquillas Canyon, he told me a little about the area. Big Bend became a national park in 1944. It encompasses more than 800,000 acres. There are rugged mountains, a vast desert, deep canyons, and more than 100 miles of winding river. As we floated along in our raft, I looked up at towering cliffs as tall as skyscrapers. The huge rock walls made me feel very small. The only sound I could hear was the flowing river. Then suddenly I heard a low grunting. I looked up and saw a group of big hairy pigs passing by. I asked Mike whether there were farms in Big Bend. He laughed and told me that these creatures were actually javelinas, which look kind of like wild pigs.</p>

        </p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At the end of the day, we camped on the riverbank. At first I missed my soft bed back at home, but the stars overhead were so beautiful that I quickly forgot about being uncomfortable and fell asleep. The next morning my muscles ached from all the paddling the day before. Mike wasn’t sore at all. He was ready to go.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We spent three tiring but peaceful days floating through the canyon. After our tour of the canyon, we traded our raft and paddles for ropes and harnesses and started hiking through the desert to the Chisos Mountains. Although most of Big Bend is desert, there are forested mountains that reach a mile into the sky. Mike likes to call them the upside-down mountains. Most mountains have trees at the bottom and bare rocks at the top. The Chisos, however, have low, scrubby desert plants at the bottom and big trees at the top.</p>

        </p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Admiring the mountain cliffs from a distance is one thing, but climbing them is another. I have to admit that I was a little uneasy. Fortunately Mike knew that I had never been rock climbing, so he took me to a fairly easy climbing area called Basin Rock. As we started up the cliffs, the big cracks in the rocks helped me keep my footing. The more we climbed, the easier it became. When we had climbed for a few hours, we stopped on a large flat slab and admired the view. After all that work, I didn’t want to go right back down the mountain.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once we made camp and ate dinner at the base of the mountain, I was so exhausted that I fell right to sleep. The next morning the yapping of nearby coyotes woke me. I went to wash up and discovered fresh coyote tracks just 30 feet from my sleeping bag! After eating a quick breakfast, we put on our backpacks and began our hike in the desert. The land seemed to <span class="txt-underline">transform</span> from big trees to pink and white wildflowers and cacti blooming with yellow flowers. One plant looked like a bunch of dagger blades sticking out of the ground. Mike said it was called lechuguilla. We had to walk carefully because so many of these plants were on the narrow dirt&nbsp;path. One wrong move and the sharp plants could have jabbed our skin right through our pants.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Several miles farther, the path became wider and steeper. Soon the trail was shaded by shrubby oak trees and junipers, which gave welcome relief from the desert heat. We had reached an area where the desert became forest. Now, instead of graceful roadrunners crossing our path, we had creepy tarantulas crawling by. I wasn’t too happy about this change. As we stopped to eat under the feathery dark-green branches of some pine trees, I realized how much I had seen and done in just a few days. I could hardly believe how fast the days had gone by. Thinking about leaving Big Bend made me realize that it is a place like no other on Earth.</p>

          <strong>My Trip to Big Bend</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Andres Benavides</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I went on an incredible trip to Big Bend National Park last week. Mom and Dad and I planned the whole thing with my cousin Mike, who works as a guide there. We had an unbelievable trip, including rafting, rock climbing, and backpacking. Mike wanted to show me what Big Bend National Park is all about.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On the first day we put on our helmets and life jackets, climbed into our raft, and plunged into the muddy Rio Grande. Mike taught me a few tips on paddling. While I practiced, he explained that our trip would take us through Boquillas Canyon. The trip was 33 miles long, much longer than the rafting trips I had taken before. But I was so excited that I didn’t mind. Besides, the calm waters kept us from getting too tired.</p>

        </p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As Mike and I drifted through Boquillas Canyon, he told me a little about the area. Big Bend became a national park in 1944. It encompasses more than 800,000 acres. There are rugged mountains, a vast desert, deep canyons, and more than 100 miles of winding river. As we floated along in our raft, I looked up at towering cliffs as tall as skyscrapers. The huge rock walls made me feel very small. The only sound I could hear was the flowing river. Then suddenly I heard a low grunting. I looked up and saw a group of big hairy pigs passing by. I asked Mike whether there were farms in Big Bend. He laughed and told me that these creatures were actually javelinas, which look kind of like wild pigs.</p>

        </p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At the end of the day, we camped on the riverbank. At first I missed my soft bed back at home, but the stars overhead were so beautiful that I quickly forgot about being uncomfortable and fell asleep. The next morning my muscles ached from all the paddling the day before. Mike wasn’t sore at all. He was ready to go.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We spent three tiring but peaceful days floating through the canyon. After our tour of the canyon, we traded our raft and paddles for ropes and harnesses and started hiking through the desert to the Chisos Mountains. Although most of Big Bend is desert, there are forested mountains that reach a mile into the sky. Mike likes to call them the upside-down mountains. Most mountains have trees at the bottom and bare rocks at the top. The Chisos, however, have low, scrubby desert plants at the bottom and big trees at the top.</p>

        </p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Admiring the mountain cliffs from a distance is one thing, but climbing them is another. I have to admit that I was a little uneasy. Fortunately Mike knew that I had never been rock climbing, so he took me to a fairly easy climbing area called Basin Rock. As we started up the cliffs, the big cracks in the rocks helped me keep my footing. The more we climbed, the easier it became. When we had climbed for a few hours, we stopped on a large flat slab and admired the view. After all that work, I didn’t want to go right back down the mountain.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once we made camp and ate dinner at the base of the mountain, I was so exhausted that I fell right to sleep. The next morning the yapping of nearby coyotes woke me. I went to wash up and discovered fresh coyote tracks just 30 feet from my sleeping bag! After eating a quick breakfast, we put on our backpacks and began our hike in the desert. The land seemed to <span class="txt-underline">transform</span> from big trees to pink and white wildflowers and cacti blooming with yellow flowers. One plant looked like a bunch of dagger blades sticking out of the ground. Mike said it was called lechuguilla. We had to walk carefully because so many of these plants were on the narrow dirt&nbsp;path. One wrong move and the sharp plants could have jabbed our skin right through our pants.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Several miles farther, the path became wider and steeper. Soon the trail was shaded by shrubby oak trees and junipers, which gave welcome relief from the desert heat. We had reached an area where the desert became forest. Now, instead of graceful roadrunners crossing our path, we had creepy tarantulas crawling by. I wasn’t too happy about this change. As we stopped to eat under the feathery dark-green branches of some pine trees, I realized how much I had seen and done in just a few days. I could hardly believe how fast the days had gone by. Thinking about leaving Big Bend made me realize that it is a place like no other on Earth.</p>

          <strong>My Trip to Big Bend</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Andres Benavides</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I went on an incredible trip to Big Bend National Park last week. Mom and Dad and I planned the whole thing with my cousin Mike, who works as a guide there. We had an unbelievable trip, including rafting, rock climbing, and backpacking. Mike wanted to show me what Big Bend National Park is all about.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On the first day we put on our helmets and life jackets, climbed into our raft, and plunged into the muddy Rio Grande. Mike taught me a few tips on paddling. While I practiced, he explained that our trip would take us through Boquillas Canyon. The trip was 33 miles long, much longer than the rafting trips I had taken before. But I was so excited that I didn’t mind. Besides, the calm waters kept us from getting too tired.</p>

        </p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As Mike and I drifted through Boquillas Canyon, he told me a little about the area. Big Bend became a national park in 1944. It encompasses more than 800,000 acres. There are rugged mountains, a vast desert, deep canyons, and more than 100 miles of winding river. As we floated along in our raft, I looked up at towering cliffs as tall as skyscrapers. The huge rock walls made me feel very small. The only sound I could hear was the flowing river. Then suddenly I heard a low grunting. I looked up and saw a group of big hairy pigs passing by. I asked Mike whether there were farms in Big Bend. He laughed and told me that these creatures were actually javelinas, which look kind of like wild pigs.</p>

        </p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At the end of the day, we camped on the riverbank. At first I missed my soft bed back at home, but the stars overhead were so beautiful that I quickly forgot about being uncomfortable and fell asleep. The next morning my muscles ached from all the paddling the day before. Mike wasn’t sore at all. He was ready to go.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We spent three tiring but peaceful days floating through the canyon. After our tour of the canyon, we traded our raft and paddles for ropes and harnesses and started hiking through the desert to the Chisos Mountains. Although most of Big Bend is desert, there are forested mountains that reach a mile into the sky. Mike likes to call them the upside-down mountains. Most mountains have trees at the bottom and bare rocks at the top. The Chisos, however, have low, scrubby desert plants at the bottom and big trees at the top.</p>

        </p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Admiring the mountain cliffs from a distance is one thing, but climbing them is another. I have to admit that I was a little uneasy. Fortunately Mike knew that I had never been rock climbing, so he took me to a fairly easy climbing area called Basin Rock. As we started up the cliffs, the big cracks in the rocks helped me keep my footing. The more we climbed, the easier it became. When we had climbed for a few hours, we stopped on a large flat slab and admired the view. After all that work, I didn’t want to go right back down the mountain.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once we made camp and ate dinner at the base of the mountain, I was so exhausted that I fell right to sleep. The next morning the yapping of nearby coyotes woke me. I went to wash up and discovered fresh coyote tracks just 30 feet from my sleeping bag! After eating a quick breakfast, we put on our backpacks and began our hike in the desert. The land seemed to <span class="txt-underline">transform</span> from big trees to pink and white wildflowers and cacti blooming with yellow flowers. One plant looked like a bunch of dagger blades sticking out of the ground. Mike said it was called lechuguilla. We had to walk carefully because so many of these plants were on the narrow dirt&nbsp;path. One wrong move and the sharp plants could have jabbed our skin right through our pants.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Several miles farther, the path became wider and steeper. Soon the trail was shaded by shrubby oak trees and junipers, which gave welcome relief from the desert heat. We had reached an area where the desert became forest. Now, instead of graceful roadrunners crossing our path, we had creepy tarantulas crawling by. I wasn’t too happy about this change. As we stopped to eat under the feathery dark-green branches of some pine trees, I realized how much I had seen and done in just a few days. I could hardly believe how fast the days had gone by. Thinking about leaving Big Bend made me realize that it is a place like no other on Earth.</p>

          <strong>My Trip to Big Bend</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Andres Benavides</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I went on an incredible trip to Big Bend National Park last week. Mom and Dad and I planned the whole thing with my cousin Mike, who works as a guide there. We had an unbelievable trip, including rafting, rock climbing, and backpacking. Mike wanted to show me what Big Bend National Park is all about.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On the first day we put on our helmets and life jackets, climbed into our raft, and plunged into the muddy Rio Grande. Mike taught me a few tips on paddling. While I practiced, he explained that our trip would take us through Boquillas Canyon. The trip was 33 miles long, much longer than the rafting trips I had taken before. But I was so excited that I didn’t mind. Besides, the calm waters kept us from getting too tired.</p>

        </p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As Mike and I drifted through Boquillas Canyon, he told me a little about the area. Big Bend became a national park in 1944. It encompasses more than 800,000 acres. There are rugged mountains, a vast desert, deep canyons, and more than 100 miles of winding river. As we floated along in our raft, I looked up at towering cliffs as tall as skyscrapers. The huge rock walls made me feel very small. The only sound I could hear was the flowing river. Then suddenly I heard a low grunting. I looked up and saw a group of big hairy pigs passing by. I asked Mike whether there were farms in Big Bend. He laughed and told me that these creatures were actually javelinas, which look kind of like wild pigs.</p>

        </p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At the end of the day, we camped on the riverbank. At first I missed my soft bed back at home, but the stars overhead were so beautiful that I quickly forgot about being uncomfortable and fell asleep. The next morning my muscles ached from all the paddling the day before. Mike wasn’t sore at all. He was ready to go.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We spent three tiring but peaceful days floating through the canyon. After our tour of the canyon, we traded our raft and paddles for ropes and harnesses and started hiking through the desert to the Chisos Mountains. Although most of Big Bend is desert, there are forested mountains that reach a mile into the sky. Mike likes to call them the upside-down mountains. Most mountains have trees at the bottom and bare rocks at the top. The Chisos, however, have low, scrubby desert plants at the bottom and big trees at the top.</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
                  <img width="77%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766028956/ogg5pbdgrasqvdlcgemt.png" alt="T3_Y5_CT_EN_23_3">


        </p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Admiring the mountain cliffs from a distance is one thing, but climbing them is another. I have to admit that I was a little uneasy. Fortunately Mike knew that I had never been rock climbing, so he took me to a fairly easy climbing area called Basin Rock. As we started up the cliffs, the big cracks in the rocks helped me keep my footing. The more we climbed, the easier it became. When we had climbed for a few hours, we stopped on a large flat slab and admired the view. After all that work, I didn’t want to go right back down the mountain.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once we made camp and ate dinner at the base of the mountain, I was so exhausted that I fell right to sleep. The next morning the yapping of nearby coyotes woke me. I went to wash up and discovered fresh coyote tracks just 30 feet from my sleeping bag! After eating a quick breakfast, we put on our backpacks and began our hike in the desert. The land seemed to <span class="txt-underline">transform</span> from big trees to pink and white wildflowers and cacti blooming with yellow flowers. One plant looked like a bunch of dagger blades sticking out of the ground. Mike said it was called lechuguilla. We had to walk carefully because so many of these plants were on the narrow dirt&nbsp;path. One wrong move and the sharp plants could have jabbed our skin right through our pants.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Several miles farther, the path became wider and steeper. Soon the trail was shaded by shrubby oak trees and junipers, which gave welcome relief from the desert heat. We had reached an area where the desert became forest. Now, instead of graceful roadrunners crossing our path, we had creepy tarantulas crawling by. I wasn’t too happy about this change. As we stopped to eat under the feathery dark-green branches of some pine trees, I realized how much I had seen and done in just a few days. I could hardly believe how fast the days had gone by. Thinking about leaving Big Bend made me realize that it is a place like no other on Earth.</p>
