<strong>POOR PANDORA</strong>

<p><em>By Elizabeth Williams</em></p>

<p>I must warn you before I get into this story<br>
Be prepared – its horrific, surprising and gory!<br>
It’s made me so incredibly furious<br>
Cause it’s an insult to woman and all who are curious<br>
But hang on, I’m getting ahead of myself<br>
Let’s jump back a few thousand years…</p>

<p>When a Greek man named Hesiod roamed the earth<br>
And wanted to explain humanity’s birth<br>
He wrote an epic poem – about a billion pages<br>
About Prometheus, Pandora and the Myth of Five Ages.&nbsp;<br>
It’s complex – a myriad of lessons and teachings<br>
But the first known mention of Pandora.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, I know backstory can be tedious and boring<br>
And the last thing I want is for you to be snoring<br>
But there’s a few things you just have to know about<br>
In order for the story to have any clout.<br>
It all starts with Zeus, the boss-god of mythology<br>
Who is actually not very nice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But he does give two brothers a chance to find<br>
A way to make the ‘man’ in ‘mankind’.<br>
So, Prometheus creates a whole host of boys<br>
And Epimetheus gives them animal toys.<br>
Out of care for his creation, Prometheus’ desire<br>
Was to give his golden boys lashings of fire.<br>
Zeus didn’t want mere mortals to have it<br>
But Prometheus gave it anyway.</p>

<p>This caused Zeus to lose his… head<br>
and chain him to a cliff where an eagle fed<br>
on his liver, which grew back every day<br>
only to appear, then again be hacked away.<br>
Then Heracles rocks up and sets him free<br>
Which makes Zeus rather irate.</p>

<p>So, Zeus thinks – ‘how can I make him suffer?<br>
I know! What punishment could be tougher<br>
Than to send him the gift of a girl?<br>
So, he got Hephaestus to give it a whirl<br>
Can you believe it? The first woman was made<br>
As a punishment for men!</p>

<p>So, Pandora was fashioned by the hands of the gods<br>
Who bestowed her with gifts – some of them odd -&nbsp;<br>
Her name means, ‘all gifts’ (she was given a lot!)<br>
But most of all - she was crazy hot!<br>
She was made to be irresistible, Aphrodite’s clone<br>
But also, idle and full of deceit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But before on mankind, she was let loose,<br>
She got an extra special gift especially from Zeus.<br>
It was an enticing box, well, technically a jar<br>
(‘box’ was a mistranslation most bizarre)<br>
But here’s the catch – she was told never to open it.<br>
But to leave it on the shelf.</p>

<p>So, of course she opens it – what else could she do?<br>
I’m sure if it was in front of you, you’d open it too!<br>
But when she does all hell breaks loose, quite literally!<br>
And evil is unleashed on the earth to roam free –&nbsp;<br>
So, she shuts it quickly and all that remains&nbsp;<br>
Inside the jar is hope.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well, that’s according to the original myth<br>
Over the years it’s been changed and messed with<br>
But the essential story remains the same<br>
The first woman, Pandora – gods’ little game –<br>
But before I object, protest and wail<br>
I must remember, it’s just a mythical tale.&nbsp;</p>

<strong>POOR PANDORA</strong>

<p><em>By Elizabeth Williams</em></p>

<p>I must warn you before I get into this story<br>
Be prepared – its horrific, surprising and gory!<br>
It’s made me so incredibly furious<br>
Cause it’s an insult to woman and all who are curious<br>
But hang on, I’m getting ahead of myself<br>
Let’s jump back a few thousand years…</p>

<p>When a Greek man named Hesiod roamed the earth<br>
And wanted to explain humanity’s birth<br>
He wrote an epic poem – about a billion pages<br>
About Prometheus, Pandora and the Myth of Five Ages.&nbsp;<br>
It’s complex – a myriad of lessons and teachings<br>
But the first known mention of Pandora.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, I know backstory can be tedious and boring<br>
And the last thing I want is for you to be snoring<br>
But there’s a few things you just have to know about<br>
In order for the story to have any clout.<br>
It all starts with Zeus, the boss-god of mythology<br>
Who is actually not very nice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But he does give two brothers a chance to find<br>
A way to make the ‘man’ in ‘mankind’.<br>
So, Prometheus creates a whole host of boys<br>
And Epimetheus gives them animal toys.<br>
Out of care for his creation, Prometheus’ desire<br>
Was to give his golden boys lashings of fire.<br>
Zeus didn’t want mere mortals to have it<br>
But Prometheus gave it anyway.</p>

<p>This caused Zeus to lose his… head<br>
and chain him to a cliff where an eagle fed<br>
on his liver, which grew back every day<br>
only to appear, then again be hacked away.<br>
Then Heracles rocks up and sets him free<br>
Which makes Zeus rather irate.</p>

<p>So, Zeus thinks – ‘how can I make him suffer?<br>
I know! What punishment could be tougher<br>
Than to send him the gift of a girl?<br>
So, he got Hephaestus to give it a whirl<br>
Can you believe it? The first woman was made<br>
As a punishment for men!</p>

<p>So, Pandora was fashioned by the hands of the gods<br>
Who bestowed her with gifts – some of them odd -&nbsp;<br>
Her name means, ‘all gifts’ (she was given a lot!)<br>
But most of all - she was crazy hot!<br>
She was made to be irresistible, Aphrodite’s clone<br>
But also, idle and full of deceit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But before on mankind, she was let loose,<br>
She got an extra special gift especially from Zeus.<br>
It was an enticing box, well, technically a jar<br>
(‘box’ was a mistranslation most bizarre)<br>
But here’s the catch – she was told never to open it.<br>
But to leave it on the shelf.</p>

<p>So, of course she opens it – what else could she do?<br>
I’m sure if it was in front of you, you’d open it too!<br>
But when she does all hell breaks loose, quite literally!<br>
And evil is unleashed on the earth to roam free –&nbsp;<br>
So, she shuts it quickly and all that remains&nbsp;<br>
Inside the jar is hope.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well, that’s according to the original myth<br>
Over the years it’s been changed and messed with<br>
But the essential story remains the same<br>
The first woman, Pandora – gods’ little game –<br>
But before I object, protest and wail<br>
I must remember, it’s just a mythical tale.&nbsp;</p>

          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Earth's sun</strong>
        </p>
        <p>The sun lies at the heart of the solar system, where it is by far the largest object. It holds 99.8% of the solar system's mass and is roughly 109 times the diameter of the Earth — <strong>1</strong>………….</p>
        <p>The surface of the sun is about 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit (5,500 degrees Celsius) hot, while temperatures in the core reach more than 27 million F (15 million C), driven by nuclear reactions. One would need to explode 100 billion tons of dynamite every second to match the energy produced by the sun, according to NASA.</p>
        <p>The sun is one of more than 100 billion stars in the Milky Way. It orbits some 25,000 light-years from the galactic core, completing a revolution once every 250 million years or so. The sun is relatively young, part of a generation of stars known as Population I, which are relatively rich in elements heavier than helium. <strong>2</strong>………….&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The sun was born about 4.6 billion years ago. <strong>3</strong>…………. As the nebula collapsed because of its gravity, it spun faster and flattened into a disk. Most of the material was pulled toward the center to form the sun.</p>
        <p>The sun has enough nuclear fuel to stay much as it is now for another 5 billion years. After that, it will swell to become a red giant. <strong>4</strong>…………. Slowly, the white dwarf will fade, and will enter its final phase as a dim, cool theoretical object sometimes known as a black dwarf.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>5</strong>…………. Nearly all the remaining matter consists of seven other elements — oxygen, carbon, neon, nitrogen, magnesium, iron and silicon. For every 1 million atoms of hydrogen in the sun, there are 98,000 of helium, 850 of oxygen, 360 of carbon, 120 of neon, 110 of nitrogen, 40 of magnesium, 35 of iron and 35 of silicon. Still, hydrogen is the lightest of all elements, so it only accounts for roughly 72% of the sun's mass, while helium makes up about 26%.</p>
        <p><strong>6</strong>…………. They emerge where dense bundles of magnetic field lines from the sun's interior break through the surface. The number of sunspots varies as solar magnetic activity does — the change in this number, from a minimum of none to a maximum of roughly 250 sunspots or clusters of sunspots and then back to a minimum, is known as the solar cycle, and averages about 11 years long.&nbsp;</p>

          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Earth's sun</strong>
        </p>
        <p>The sun lies at the heart of the solar system, where it is by far the largest object. It holds 99.8% of the solar system's mass and is roughly 109 times the diameter of the Earth — <strong>1</strong>………….</p>
        <p>The surface of the sun is about 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit (5,500 degrees Celsius) hot, while temperatures in the core reach more than 27 million F (15 million C), driven by nuclear reactions. One would need to explode 100 billion tons of dynamite every second to match the energy produced by the sun, according to NASA.</p>
        <p>The sun is one of more than 100 billion stars in the Milky Way. It orbits some 25,000 light-years from the galactic core, completing a revolution once every 250 million years or so. The sun is relatively young, part of a generation of stars known as Population I, which are relatively rich in elements heavier than helium. <strong>2</strong>………….&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The sun was born about 4.6 billion years ago. <strong>3</strong>…………. As the nebula collapsed because of its gravity, it spun faster and flattened into a disk. Most of the material was pulled toward the center to form the sun.</p>
        <p>The sun has enough nuclear fuel to stay much as it is now for another 5 billion years. After that, it will swell to become a red giant. <strong>4</strong>…………. Slowly, the white dwarf will fade, and will enter its final phase as a dim, cool theoretical object sometimes known as a black dwarf.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>5</strong>…………. Nearly all the remaining matter consists of seven other elements — oxygen, carbon, neon, nitrogen, magnesium, iron and silicon. For every 1 million atoms of hydrogen in the sun, there are 98,000 of helium, 850 of oxygen, 360 of carbon, 120 of neon, 110 of nitrogen, 40 of magnesium, 35 of iron and 35 of silicon. Still, hydrogen is the lightest of all elements, so it only accounts for roughly 72% of the sun's mass, while helium makes up about 26%.</p>
        <p><strong>6</strong>…………. They emerge where dense bundles of magnetic field lines from the sun's interior break through the surface. The number of sunspots varies as solar magnetic activity does — the change in this number, from a minimum of none to a maximum of roughly 250 sunspots or clusters of sunspots and then back to a minimum, is known as the solar cycle, and averages about 11 years long.&nbsp;</p>

          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Earth's sun</strong>
        </p>
        <p>The sun lies at the heart of the solar system, where it is by far the largest object. It holds 99.8% of the solar system's mass and is roughly 109 times the diameter of the Earth — <strong>1</strong>………….</p>
        <p>The surface of the sun is about 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit (5,500 degrees Celsius) hot, while temperatures in the core reach more than 27 million F (15 million C), driven by nuclear reactions. One would need to explode 100 billion tons of dynamite every second to match the energy produced by the sun, according to NASA.</p>
        <p>The sun is one of more than 100 billion stars in the Milky Way. It orbits some 25,000 light-years from the galactic core, completing a revolution once every 250 million years or so. The sun is relatively young, part of a generation of stars known as Population I, which are relatively rich in elements heavier than helium. <strong>2</strong>………….&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The sun was born about 4.6 billion years ago. <strong>3</strong>…………. As the nebula collapsed because of its gravity, it spun faster and flattened into a disk. Most of the material was pulled toward the center to form the sun.</p>
        <p>The sun has enough nuclear fuel to stay much as it is now for another 5 billion years. After that, it will swell to become a red giant. <strong>4</strong>…………. Slowly, the white dwarf will fade, and will enter its final phase as a dim, cool theoretical object sometimes known as a black dwarf.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>5</strong>…………. Nearly all the remaining matter consists of seven other elements — oxygen, carbon, neon, nitrogen, magnesium, iron and silicon. For every 1 million atoms of hydrogen in the sun, there are 98,000 of helium, 850 of oxygen, 360 of carbon, 120 of neon, 110 of nitrogen, 40 of magnesium, 35 of iron and 35 of silicon. Still, hydrogen is the lightest of all elements, so it only accounts for roughly 72% of the sun's mass, while helium makes up about 26%.</p>
        <p><strong>6</strong>…………. They emerge where dense bundles of magnetic field lines from the sun's interior break through the surface. The number of sunspots varies as solar magnetic activity does — the change in this number, from a minimum of none to a maximum of roughly 250 sunspots or clusters of sunspots and then back to a minimum, is known as the solar cycle, and averages about 11 years long.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>The sun was born about 4.6 billion years ago. <strong>3</strong>…………. As the nebula collapsed because of its gravity, it spun faster and flattened into a disk. Most of the material was pulled toward the center to form the sun.</p>
        <p>The sun has enough nuclear fuel to stay much as it is now for another 5 billion years. After that, it will swell to become a red giant. <strong>4</strong>…………. Slowly, the white dwarf will fade, and will enter its final phase as a dim, cool theoretical object sometimes known as a black dwarf.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>5</strong>…………. Nearly all the remaining matter consists of seven other elements — oxygen, carbon, neon, nitrogen, magnesium, iron and silicon. For every 1 million atoms of hydrogen in the sun, there are 98,000 of helium, 850 of oxygen, 360 of carbon, 120 of neon, 110 of nitrogen, 40 of magnesium, 35 of iron and 35 of silicon. Still, hydrogen is the lightest of all elements, so it only accounts for roughly 72% of the sun's mass, while helium makes up about 26%.</p>
        <p><strong>6</strong>…………. They emerge where dense bundles of magnetic field lines from the sun's interior break through the surface. The number of sunspots varies as solar magnetic activity does — the change in this number, from a minimum of none to a maximum of roughly 250 sunspots or clusters of sunspots and then back to a minimum, is known as the solar cycle, and averages about 11 years long.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Earth's sun</strong>
        </p>
        <p>The sun lies at the heart of the solar system, where it is by far the largest object. It holds 99.8% of the solar system's mass and is roughly 109 times the diameter of the Earth — <strong>1</strong>………….</p>
        <p>The surface of the sun is about 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit (5,500 degrees Celsius) hot, while temperatures in the core reach more than 27 million F (15 million C), driven by nuclear reactions. One would need to explode 100 billion tons of dynamite every second to match the energy produced by the sun, according to NASA.</p>
        <p>The sun is one of more than 100 billion stars in the Milky Way. It orbits some 25,000 light-years from the galactic core, completing a revolution once every 250 million years or so. The sun is relatively young, part of a generation of stars known as Population I, which are relatively rich in elements heavier than helium. <strong>2</strong>………….&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The sun was born about 4.6 billion years ago. <strong>3</strong>…………. As the nebula collapsed because of its gravity, it spun faster and flattened into a disk. Most of the material was pulled toward the center to form the sun.</p>
        <p>The sun has enough nuclear fuel to stay much as it is now for another 5 billion years. After that, it will swell to become a red giant. <strong>4</strong>…………. Slowly, the white dwarf will fade, and will enter its final phase as a dim, cool theoretical object sometimes known as a black dwarf.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>5</strong>…………. Nearly all the remaining matter consists of seven other elements — oxygen, carbon, neon, nitrogen, magnesium, iron and silicon. For every 1 million atoms of hydrogen in the sun, there are 98,000 of helium, 850 of oxygen, 360 of carbon, 120 of neon, 110 of nitrogen, 40 of magnesium, 35 of iron and 35 of silicon.

Everyone fails at something some time. But for teenagers, failure can feel especially devastating as they deal with so many changes in their bodies, brains and in their lives. It’s important to help your teen deal with failure and see it as something to learn from so they can build the skills they need to succeed at school and in life.<br>
<br>
Sometimes, teens who experience a failure can turn a single event – such as getting a D on a Maths test or not getting selected for a sporting team – into something that defines who they are. They may believe they are a failure. Feeling like a failure can become all-consuming and taint a young person’s view of life. If your teen finds themselves in this headspace, they may need your help in shifting their thinking. Here’s some examples of what your teen might say and how you could respond to help them see that a single event does not make them a failure:<br>
I failed at Maths so I must be a failure.&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Instead</strong>: You failed once but there are still many other things you don’t fail at.<br>
I only got 48% on the Maths test so I’ll probably fail Maths and have to drop out of school.<br>
<strong>Instead</strong>: You struggled with that one maths test but overall, you are tracking for a B.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Growing up in an Indian family obsessed with good grades can be a nightmarish situation for many kids. I am sure several of my Indian friends would be able to relate. Indian parents are obsessed with phrases like “Log kya kahenge” (“What will people say?”) and “Sharmaji ke bete ko dekha?” which roughly translates to, “Look at the neighbor’s son, see how much better he is doing.” My parents were no different. I never tasted failure throughout my life until I reached high school. I always secured the best grades somehow until then. But then in high school, something happened, and I ended up ranking fifth in the cohort. My parents couldn’t take that failure, as for them it was a matter of pride, that my friends had scored more than I did for the first time. Personally, I had no issues accepting my grades, right until the point I realized that my parents were ashamed of me. My failure was not about getting the best grades, it was about disappointing my parents. I was 15, and my long, arduous journey with failure had just begun.<br>
<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
The wisdom of learning from failure is incontrovertible. Yet organizations that do it well are extraordinarily rare. This gap is not due to a lack of commitment to learning. Managers in the vast majority of enterprises that I have studied over the past twenty years—pharmaceutical, financial services, product design, telecommunications, and construction companies; hospitals; and NASA’s space shuttle program, among others—genuinely wanted to help their organizations learn from failures to improve future performance. In some cases they and their teams had devoted many hours to after-action reviews, postmortems, and the like. But time after time I saw that these painstaking efforts led to no real change. The reason: Those managers were thinking about failure the wrong way.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}
<p>Ultimately, we have to decide for ourselves what constitutes failure, but the world is quite eager to give you a set of criteria, if you let it. So, I think it’s fair to say that by any conventional measure, a mere seven years after my graduation day, I had failed on an epic scale. An exceptionally short-lived marriage had imploded and I was jobless, a lone parent and as poor as it is possible to be in modern Britain without being homeless.<br>
I had no idea then how far the tunnel extended, and for a long time any light at the end of it was a hope rather than a reality. So why do I talk about the benefits of failure? Simply because it is a stripping away of the inessential. I stopped pretending to myself that I was anything other than what I was and began directing all my energy into finishing the only work that mattered to me.<br>
Had I really succeeded at anything else I may never have found the determination to succeed in the one arena where I truly belonged.<br>

Growing up in an Indian family obsessed with good grades can be a nightmarish situation for many kids. I am sure several of my Indian friends would be able to relate. Indian parents are obsessed with phrases like “Log kya kahenge” (“What will people say?”) and “Sharmaji ke bete ko dekha?” which roughly translates to, “Look at the neighbor’s son, see how much better he is doing.” My parents were no different. I never tasted failure throughout my life until I reached high school. I always secured the best grades somehow until then. But then in high school, something happened, and I ended up ranking fifth in the cohort. My parents couldn’t take that failure, as for them it was a matter of pride, that my friends had scored more than I did for the first time. Personally, I had no issues accepting my grades, right until the point I realized that my parents were ashamed of me. My failure was not about getting the best grades, it was about disappointing my parents. I was 15, and my long, arduous journey with failure had just begun.<br>

The wisdom of learning from failure is incontrovertible. Yet organizations that do it well are extraordinarily rare. This gap is not due to a lack of commitment to learning. Managers in the vast majority of enterprises that I have studied over the past twenty years—pharmaceutical, financial services, product design, telecommunications, and construction companies; hospitals; and NASA’s space shuttle program, among others—genuinely wanted to help their organizations learn from failures to improve future performance. In some cases they and their teams had devoted many hours to after-action reviews, postmortems, and the like. But time after time I saw that these painstaking efforts led to no real change. The reason: Those managers were thinking about failure the wrong way.<br>

<p>Ultimately, we have to decide for ourselves what constitutes failure, but the world is quite eager to give you a set of criteria, if you let it. So, I think it’s fair to say that by any conventional measure, a mere seven years after my graduation day, I had failed on an epic scale. An exceptionally short-lived marriage had imploded and I was jobless, a lone parent and as poor as it is possible to be in modern Britain without being homeless.<br>
I had no idea then how far the tunnel extended, and for a long time any light at the end of it was a hope rather than a reality. So why do I talk about the benefits of failure? Simply because it is a stripping away of the inessential. I stopped pretending to myself that I was anything other than what I was and began directing all my energy into finishing the only work that mattered to me.<br>
Had I really succeeded at anything else I may never have found the determination to succeed in the one arena where I truly belonged.<br>

Everyone fails at something some time. But for teenagers, failure can feel especially devastating as they deal with so many changes in their bodies, brains and in their lives. It’s important to help your teen deal with failure and see it as something to learn from so they can build the skills they need to succeed at school and in life.<br>
<br>
Sometimes, teens who experience a failure can turn a single event – such as getting a D on a Maths test or not getting selected for a sporting team – into something that defines who they are. They may believe they are a failure. Feeling like a failure can become all-consuming and taint a young person’s view of life. If your teen finds themselves in this headspace, they may need your help in shifting their thinking. Here’s some examples of what your teen might say and how you could respond to help them see that a single event does not make them a failure:<br>
I failed at Maths so I must be a failure.&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Instead</strong>: You failed once but there are still many other things you don’t fail at.<br>
I only got 48% on the Maths test so I’ll probably fail Maths and have to drop out of school.<br>
<strong>Instead</strong>: You struggled with that one maths test but overall, you are tracking for a B.<br>

Everyone fails at something some time. But for teenagers, failure can feel especially devastating as they deal with so many changes in their bodies, brains and in their lives. It’s important to help your teen deal with failure and see it as something to learn from so they can build the skills they need to succeed at school and in life.<br>
<br>
Sometimes, teens who experience a failure can turn a single event – such as getting a D on a Maths test or not getting selected for a sporting team – into something that defines who they are. They may believe they are a failure. Feeling like a failure can become all-consuming and taint a young person’s view of life. If your teen finds themselves in this headspace, they may need your help in shifting their thinking. Here’s some examples of what your teen might say and how you could respond to help them see that a single event does not make them a failure:<br>
I failed at Maths so I must be a failure.&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Instead</strong>: You failed once but there are still many other things you don’t fail at.<br>
I only got 48% on the Maths test so I’ll probably fail Maths and have to drop out of school.<br>
<strong>Instead</strong>: You struggled with that one maths test but overall, you are tracking for a B.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Growing up in an Indian family obsessed with good grades can be a nightmarish situation for many kids. I am sure several of my Indian friends would be able to relate. Indian parents are obsessed with phrases like “Log kya kahenge” (“What will people say?”) and “Sharmaji ke bete ko dekha?” which roughly translates to, “Look at the neighbor’s son, see how much better he is doing.” My parents were no different. I never tasted failure throughout my life until I reached high school. I always secured the best grades somehow until then. But then in high school, something happened, and I ended up ranking fifth in the cohort. My parents couldn’t take that failure, as for them it was a matter of pride, that my friends had scored more than I did for the first time. Personally, I had no issues accepting my grades, right until the point I realized that my parents were ashamed of me. My failure was not about getting the best grades, it was about disappointing my parents. I was 15, and my long, arduous journey with failure had just begun.<br>
<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
The wisdom of learning from failure is incontrovertible. Yet organizations that do it well are extraordinarily rare. This gap is not due to a lack of commitment to learning. Managers in the vast majority of enterprises that I have studied over the past twenty years—pharmaceutical, financial services, product design, telecommunications, and construction companies; hospitals; and NASA’s space shuttle program, among others—genuinely wanted to help their organizations learn from failures to improve future performance. In some cases they and their teams had devoted many hours to after-action reviews, postmortems, and the like. But time after time I saw that these painstaking efforts led to no real change. The reason: Those managers were thinking about failure the wrong way.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}
<p>Ultimately, we have to decide for ourselves what constitutes failure, but the world is quite eager to give you a set of criteria, if you let it. So, I think it’s fair to say that by any conventional measure, a mere seven years after my graduation day, I had failed on an epic scale. An exceptionally short-lived marriage had imploded and I was jobless, a lone parent and as poor as it is possible to be in modern Britain without being homeless.<br>
I had no idea then how far the tunnel extended, and for a long time any light at the end of it was a hope rather than a reality. So why do I talk about the benefits of failure? Simply because it is a stripping away of the inessential. I stopped pretending to myself that I was anything other than what I was and began directing all my energy into finishing the only work that mattered to me.<br>
Had I really succeeded at anything else I may never have found the determination to succeed in the one arena where I truly belonged.<br>

<strong>THE POET AND HIS SONG</strong>

<p><em>By Paul Laurence Dunbar&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>A song is but a little thing,<br>
And yet what joy it is to sing!<br>
In hours of toil it gives me zest,<br>
And when at eve I long for rest;<br>
When cows come home along the bars,<br>
And in the fold I hear the bell,<br>
As Night, the shepherd, herds his stars,<br>
I sing my song, and all is well.</p>

<p>There are no ears to hear my lays,<br>
No lips to lift a word of praise;<br>
But still, with faith unfaltering,<br>
I live and laugh and love and sing.<br>
What matters yon unheeding throng?<br>
They cannot feel my spirit’s spell,<br>
Since life is sweet and love is long,<br>
I sing my song, and all is well.</p>

<p>My days are never days of ease;<br>
I till my ground and prune my trees.<br>
When ripened gold is all the plain,<br>
I put my sickle to the grain.<br>
I labor hard, and toil and sweat,<br>
While others dream within the dell;<br>
But even while my brow is wet,<br>
I sing my song, and all is well.</p>

<p>Sometimes the sun, unkindly hot,<br>
My garden makes a desert spot;<br>
Sometimes a blight upon the tree<br>
Takes all my fruit away from me;<br>
And then with throes of bitter pain<br>
Rebellious passions rise and swell;<br>
But—life is more than fruit or grain,<br>
And so I sing, and all is well.</p>

<strong>THE POET AND HIS SONG</strong>

<p><em>By Paul Laurence Dunbar&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>A song is but a little thing,<br>
And yet what joy it is to sing!<br>
In hours of toil it gives me zest,<br>
And when at eve I long for rest;<br>
When cows come home along the bars,<br>
And in the fold I hear the bell,<br>
As Night, the shepherd, herds his stars,<br>
I sing my song, and all is well.</p>

<p>There are no ears to hear my lays,<br>
No lips to lift a word of praise;<br>
But still, with faith unfaltering,<br>
I live and laugh and love and sing.<br>
What matters yon unheeding throng?<br>
They cannot feel my spirit’s spell,<br>
Since life is sweet and love is long,<br>
I sing my song, and all is well.</p>

<p>My days are never days of ease;<br>
I till my ground and prune my trees.<br>
When ripened gold is all the plain,<br>
I put my sickle to the grain.<br>
I labor hard, and toil and sweat,<br>
While others dream within the dell;<br>
But even while my brow is wet,<br>
I sing my song, and all is well.</p>

<p>Sometimes the sun, unkindly hot,<br>
My garden makes a desert spot;<br>
Sometimes a blight upon the tree<br>
Takes all my fruit away from me;<br>
And then with throes of bitter pain<br>
Rebellious passions rise and swell;<br>
But—life is more than fruit or grain,<br>
And so I sing, and all is well.</p>

My garden makes a desert spot;<br>
Sometimes a blight upon the tree<br>
Takes all my fruit away from me;<br>
And then with throes of bitter pain<br>
Rebellious passions rise and swell;<br>
But—life is more than fruit or grain,<br>
And so I sing, and all is well.</p>

          <br>
          <strong>Gymnastics</strong>
        </p>
        <p>The term gymnastics, derived from a Greek word meaning “to exercise naked,” applied in ancient Greece to all exercises practiced in the gymnasium, the place where male athletes did indeed exercise unclothed. Many of these exercises came to be included in the Olympic Games, until the abandonment of the Games in 393 CE. <strong>1</strong>………….</p>
        <p>Olympic gymnastics are grouped into different divisions—artistic, rhythmic, and trampoline. For men the artistic gymnastics events are: floor exercise, pommel horse, rings, vault, parallel bars, horizontal bar, and combined exercises (the all-around), which combines the scores of the other six events. <strong>2</strong>…………. For women the artistic events are floor exercise, vault, uneven bars, balance beam, and combined exercises, both team and individual.</p>
        <p>Rhythmic group gymnastics was originally required in the women’s artistic program but became a separate sport when it was introduced internationally at an invitational competition in Budapest, Hungary, in 1963. Thereafter the Fédération Internationale Gymnastique (FIG) scheduled a world competition in the even-numbered years beginning in 1964. First known as modern rhythmic gymnastics, and later as rhythmic sport gymnastics, the discipline now known as rhythmic gymnastics became an Olympic sport in 1984. This branch of gymnastics is practiced only by women. <strong>3</strong>…………. Medals are awarded at the Olympics and world championships for team, group, all-around, and individual event competition.</p>
        <p><strong>4</strong>…………. Trampoline debuted as a men’s and women’s event at the 2000 Olympic Games; Olympic competition is individual only. World championship trampoline events also include double mini-trampoline and synchronized trampoline competition. <strong>5</strong>………….</p>
        <p>Sports acrobatics has been contested internationally since 1973. <strong>6</strong>…………. The events in sports acrobatics are: women’s pairs, mixed pairs, men’s pairs, women’s trios, and men’s fours. Pairs and group exercises are performed to a musical accompaniment on a free-exercise-type platform. There are several routines, some of which must include “human pyramids” that are created by the gymnasts and must be held for four seconds to be scored; the pairs exercise must contain at least six partner-balance elements held for two seconds; and throws with twisting and somersaulting interspersed with tumbling elements must also be included.</p>

          <strong>Gymnastics</strong>
        </p>
        <p>The term gymnastics, derived from a Greek word meaning “to exercise naked,” applied in ancient Greece to all exercises practiced in the gymnasium, the place where male athletes did indeed exercise unclothed. Many of these exercises came to be included in the Olympic Games, until the abandonment of the Games in 393 CE. <strong>1</strong>………….</p>
        <p>Olympic gymnastics are grouped into different divisions—artistic, rhythmic, and trampoline. For men the artistic gymnastics events are: floor exercise, pommel horse, rings, vault, parallel bars, horizontal bar, and combined exercises (the all-around), which combines the scores of the other six events. <strong>2</strong>…………. For women the artistic events are floor exercise, vault, uneven bars, balance beam, and combined exercises, both team and individual.</p>
        <p>Rhythmic group gymnastics was originally required in the women’s artistic program but became a separate sport when it was introduced internationally at an invitational competition in Budapest, Hungary, in 1963. Thereafter the Fédération Internationale Gymnastique (FIG) scheduled a world competition in the even-numbered years beginning in 1964. First known as modern rhythmic gymnastics, and later as rhythmic sport gymnastics, the discipline now known as rhythmic gymnastics became an Olympic sport in 1984. This branch of gymnastics is practiced only by women. <strong>3</strong>…………. Medals are awarded at the Olympics and world championships for team, group, all-around, and individual event competition.</p>
        <p><strong>4</strong>…………. Trampoline debuted as a men’s and women’s event at the 2000 Olympic Games; Olympic competition is individual only. World championship trampoline events also include double mini-trampoline and synchronized trampoline competition. <strong>5</strong>………….</p>
        <p>Sports acrobatics has been contested internationally since 1973. <strong>6</strong>…………. The events in sports acrobatics are: women’s pairs, mixed pairs, men’s pairs, women’s trios, and men’s fours. Pairs and group exercises are performed to a musical accompaniment on a free-exercise-type platform. There are several routines, some of which must include “human pyramids” that are created by the gymnasts and must be held for four seconds to be scored; the pairs exercise must contain at least six partner-balance elements held for two seconds; and throws with twisting and somersaulting interspersed with tumbling elements must also be included.</p>

        <p>The term gymnastics, derived from a Greek word meaning “to exercise naked,” applied in ancient Greece to all exercises practiced in the gymnasium, the place where male athletes did indeed exercise unclothed. Many of these exercises came to be included in the Olympic Games, until the abandonment of the Games in 393 CE. <strong>1</strong>………….</p>
        <p>Olympic gymnastics are grouped into different divisions—artistic, rhythmic, and trampoline. For men the artistic gymnastics events are: floor exercise, pommel horse, rings, vault, parallel bars, horizontal bar, and combined exercises (the all-around), which combines the scores of the other six events. <strong>2</strong>…………. For women the artistic events are floor exercise, vault, uneven bars, balance beam, and combined exercises, both team and individual.</p>
        <p>Rhythmic group gymnastics was originally required in the women’s artistic program but became a separate sport when it was introduced internationally at an invitational competition in Budapest, Hungary, in 1963. Thereafter the Fédération Internationale Gymnastique (FIG) scheduled a world competition in the even-numbered years beginning in 1964. First known as modern rhythmic gymnastics, and later as rhythmic sport gymnastics, the discipline now known as rhythmic gymnastics became an Olympic sport in 1984. This branch of gymnastics is practiced only by women. <strong>3</strong>…………. Medals are awarded at the Olympics and world championships for team, group, all-around, and individual event competition.</p>
        <p><strong>4</strong>…………. Trampoline debuted as a men’s and women’s event at the 2000 Olympic Games; Olympic competition is individual only. World championship trampoline events also include double mini-trampoline and synchronized trampoline competition. <strong>5</strong>………….</p>
        <p>Sports acrobatics has been contested internationally since 1973. <strong>6</strong>…………. The events in sports acrobatics are: women’s pairs, mixed pairs, men’s pairs, women’s trios, and men’s fours. Pairs and group exercises are performed to a musical accompaniment on a free-exercise-type platform. There are several routines, some of which must include “human pyramids” that are created by the gymnasts and must be held for four seconds to be scored; the pairs exercise must contain at least six partner-balance elements held for two seconds; and throws with twisting and somersaulting interspersed with tumbling elements must also be included.</p>
