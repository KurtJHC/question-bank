          <strong>The Egypt Game&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Zilpha Keatley Snyder&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>NOT LONG AGO IN A LARGE UNIVERSITY TOWN IN California, on a street called Orchard Avenue, a strange old man ran a dusty shabby store. Above the dirty show windows a faded peeling sign said:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A-Z ANTIQUES</p>
        <p>CURIOS</p>
        <p>USED MERCHANDISE</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Nobody knew for sure what the A-Z meant. Perhaps it referred to the fact that all sorts of strange things—everything from A to Z—were sold in the store. Or perhaps it had something to do with the owner’s name. However, no one seemed to know for sure what his name actually was. It was all part of a mysterious uncertainty about even the smallest item of public information about the old man. Nobody seemed certain, for instance, just why he was known as the Professor.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The neighbourhood surrounding the Professor’s store was made up of inexpensive apartment houses, little family-owned shops, and small, aging homes. The people of the area, many of whom had some connection with the university, could trace their ancestors to every continent, and just about every country in the world.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There were dozens of children in the neighbourhood; boys and girls of every size and style and colour, some of whom could speak more than one language when they wanted to. But in their schools and on the streets they all seemed to speak the same language and to have a number of things in common. And one of the things they had in common, at that time, was a vague and mysterious fear of the old man called the Professor.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Just what was so dangerous about the Professor was uncertain, like everything else about him, but his appearance undoubtedly had something to do with the rumors. He was tall and bent and his thin beard straggled up his cheeks like dry moss on gray rocks. His eyes were dark and expressionless, and set so deep under heavy brows that from a distance they looked like dark empty holes. And, from a distance was the only way that most of the children of Orchard Avenue cared to see them. The Professor lived somewhere at the back of his dingy store, and when he came out to stand in the sun in his doorway, smaller children would cross the street if they had to walk by.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now and then, older and braver boys, inspired by the old man’s strangeness, would dare each other into an attempt to tease or torment him—but not for long. Their absolute failure to get any sort of a reaction from their victim was not only discouraging, it was weird enough to spoil the fun for even the bravest of bullies.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Since there were several antique stores in the area to draw the buyers, the Professor seemed to do a fairly good business with out-of-town collectors; but his local trade was very small. It was said that he sold items that were used, but not antique, very cheaply, but even for grown-ups the prospect of a bargain was often not enough to offset the discomfort of the old man’s stony stare.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was one day early in a recent September that the Professor happened to be the only witness to the very beginning of the Egypt Game. He had been looking for something in a seldom used storeroom at the back of his shop, when a slight noise drew him to a window. He lifted a gunnysack curtain, rubbed a peephole in the thick coating of dirt, and peered through. Outside that particular window was a small storage yard surrounded by a high board fence. It had been years since the Professor had made any use of the area, and the weedgrown yard and open lean-to shed were empty except for a few pieces of forgotten junk. But as the old man peered through his dirty window, two girls were pulling a much smaller boy through a hole in the fence.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>NOT LONG AGO IN A LARGE UNIVERSITY TOWN IN California, on a street called Orchard Avenue, a strange old man ran a dusty shabby store. Above the dirty show windows a faded peeling sign said:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A-Z ANTIQUES</p>
        <p>CURIOS</p>
        <p>USED MERCHANDISE</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Nobody knew for sure what the A-Z meant. Perhaps it referred to the fact that all sorts of strange things—everything from A to Z—were sold in the store. Or perhaps it had something to do with the owner’s name. However, no one seemed to know for sure what his name actually was. It was all part of a mysterious uncertainty about even the smallest item of public information about the old man. Nobody seemed certain, for instance, just why he was known as the Professor.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The neighbourhood surrounding the Professor’s store was made up of inexpensive apartment houses, little family-owned shops, and small, aging homes. The people of the area, many of whom had some connection with the university, could trace their ancestors to every continent, and just about every country in the world.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There were dozens of children in the neighbourhood; boys and girls of every size and style and colour, some of whom could speak more than one language when they wanted to. But in their schools and on the streets they all seemed to speak the same language and to have a number of things in common. And one of the things they had in common, at that time, was a vague and mysterious fear of the old man called the Professor.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Just what was so dangerous about the Professor was uncertain, like everything else about him, but his appearance undoubtedly had something to do with the rumors. He was tall and bent and his thin beard straggled up his cheeks like dry moss on gray rocks. His eyes were dark and expressionless, and set so deep under heavy brows that from a distance they looked like dark empty holes. And, from a distance was the only way that most of the children of Orchard Avenue cared to see them. The Professor lived somewhere at the back of his dingy store, and when he came out to stand in the sun in his doorway, smaller children would cross the street if they had to walk by.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now and then, older and braver boys, inspired by the old man’s strangeness, would dare each other into an attempt to tease or torment him—but not for long. Their absolute failure to get any sort of a reaction from their victim was not only discouraging, it was weird enough to spoil the fun for even the bravest of bullies.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Since there were several antique stores in the area to draw the buyers, the Professor seemed to do a fairly good business with out-of-town collectors; but his local trade was very small. It was said that he sold items that were used, but not antique, very cheaply, but even for grown-ups the prospect of a bargain was often not enough to offset the discomfort of the old man’s stony stare.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was one day early in a recent September that the Professor happened to be the only witness to the very beginning of the Egypt Game. He had been looking for something in a seldom used storeroom at the back of his shop, when a slight noise drew him to a window. He lifted a gunnysack curtain, rubbed a peephole in the thick coating of dirt, and peered through. Outside that particular window was a small storage yard surrounded by a high board fence. It had been years since the Professor had made any use of the area, and the weedgrown yard and open lean-to shed were empty except for a few pieces of forgotten junk. But as the old man peered through his dirty window, two girls were pulling a much smaller boy through a hole in the fence.</p>

          <strong>The Egypt Game&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Zilpha Keatley Snyder&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>NOT LONG AGO IN A LARGE UNIVERSITY TOWN IN California, on a street called Orchard Avenue, a strange old man ran a dusty shabby store. Above the dirty show windows a faded peeling sign said:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A-Z ANTIQUES</p>
        <p>CURIOS</p>
        <p>USED MERCHANDISE</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Nobody knew for sure what the A-Z meant. Perhaps it referred to the fact that all sorts of strange things—everything from A to Z—were sold in the store. Or perhaps it had something to do with the owner’s name. However, no one seemed to know for sure what his name actually was. It was all part of a mysterious uncertainty about even the smallest item of public information about the old man. Nobody seemed certain, for instance, just why he was known as the Professor.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The neighbourhood surrounding the Professor’s store was made up of inexpensive apartment houses, little family-owned shops, and small, aging homes. The people of the area, many of whom had some connection with the university, could trace their ancestors to every continent, and just about every country in the world.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There were dozens of children in the neighbourhood; boys and girls of every size and style and colour, some of whom could speak more than one language when they wanted to. But in their schools and on the streets they all seemed to speak the same language and to have a number of things in common. And one of the things they had in common, at that time, was a vague and mysterious fear of the old man called the Professor.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Just what was so dangerous about the Professor was uncertain, like everything else about him, but his appearance undoubtedly had something to do with the rumors. He was tall and bent and his thin beard straggled up his cheeks like dry moss on gray rocks. His eyes were dark and expressionless, and set so deep under heavy brows that from a distance they looked like dark empty holes. And, from a distance was the only way that most of the children of Orchard Avenue cared to see them. The Professor lived somewhere at the back of his dingy store, and when he came out to stand in the sun in his doorway, smaller children would cross the street if they had to walk by.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now and then, older and braver boys, inspired by the old man’s strangeness, would dare each other into an attempt to tease or torment him—but not for long. Their absolute failure to get any sort of a reaction from their victim was not only discouraging, it was weird enough to spoil the fun for even the bravest of bullies.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Since there were several antique stores in the area to draw the buyers, the Professor seemed to do a fairly good business with out-of-town collectors; but his local trade was very small. It was said that he sold items that were used, but not antique, very cheaply, but even for grown-ups the prospect of a bargain was often not enough to offset the discomfort of the old man’s stony stare.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>NOT LONG AGO IN A LARGE UNIVERSITY TOWN IN California, on a street called Orchard Avenue, a strange old man ran a dusty shabby store. Above the dirty show windows a faded peeling sign said:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A-Z ANTIQUES</p>

The people of the area, many of whom had some connection with the university, could trace their ancestors to every continent, and just about every country in the world.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There were dozens of children in the neighbourhood; boys and girls of every size and style and colour, some of whom could speak more than one language when they wanted to.

          <strong>The Egypt Game&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Zilpha Keatley Snyder&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>NOT LONG AGO IN A LARGE UNIVERSITY TOWN IN California, on a street called Orchard Avenue, a strange old man ran a dusty shabby store. Above the dirty show windows a faded peeling sign said:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A-Z ANTIQUES</p>
        <p>CURIOS</p>
        <p>USED MERCHANDISE</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Nobody knew for sure what the A-Z meant. Perhaps it referred to the fact that all sorts of strange things—everything from A to Z—were sold in the store. Or perhaps it had something to do with the owner’s name. However, no one seemed to know for sure what his name actually was. It was all part of a mysterious uncertainty about even the smallest item of public information about the old man. Nobody seemed certain, for instance, just why he was known as the Professor.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The neighbourhood surrounding the Professor’s store was made up of inexpensive apartment houses, little family-owned shops, and small, aging homes. The people of the area, many of whom had some connection with the university, could trace their ancestors to every continent, and just about every country in the world.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There were dozens of children in the neighbourhood; boys and girls of every size and style and colour, some of whom could speak more than one language when they wanted to. But in their schools and on the streets they all seemed to speak the same language and to have a number of things in common. And one of the things they had in common, at that time, was a vague and mysterious fear of the old man called the Professor.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Just what was so dangerous about the Professor was uncertain, like everything else about him, but his appearance undoubtedly had something to do with the rumors. He was tall and bent and his thin beard straggled up his cheeks like dry moss on gray rocks. His eyes were dark and expressionless, and set so deep under heavy brows that from a distance they looked like dark empty holes. And, from a distance was the only way that most of the children of Orchard Avenue cared to see them. The Professor lived somewhere at the back of his dingy store, and when he came out to stand in the sun in his doorway, smaller children would cross the street if they had to walk by.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now and then, older and braver boys, inspired by the old man’s strangeness, would dare each other into an attempt to tease or torment him—but not for long. Their absolute failure to get any sort of a reaction from their victim was not only discouraging, it was weird enough to spoil the fun for even the bravest of bullies.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Since there were several antique stores in the area to draw the buyers, the Professor seemed to do a fairly good business with out-of-town collectors; but his local trade was very small. It was said that he sold items that were used, but not antique, very cheaply, but even for grown-ups the prospect of a bargain was often not enough to offset the discomfort of the old man’s stony stare.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was one day early in a recent September that the Professor happened to be the only witness to the very beginning of the Egypt Game. He had been looking for something in a seldom used storeroom at the back of his shop, when a slight noise drew him to a window. He lifted a gunnysack curtain, rubbed a peephole in the thick coating of dirt, and peered through. Outside that particular window was a small storage yard surrounded by a high board fence. It had been years since the Professor had made any use of the area, and the weedgrown yard and open lean-to shed were empty except for a few pieces of forgotten junk. But as the old man peered through his dirty window, two girls were pulling a much smaller boy through a hole in the fence.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Imperial vs Metric&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
The Metric system started in France during the 1700’s. It is based on the metre (length), gram (weight, or more properly “mass”) and litre (volume). “Metric” comes from the word “metre.”</p>
        <p>There is also a system of prefixes for making things bigger (kilo- , mega- , giga- , tera- ) or smaller (milli- , micro- , nano- ) in multiples of 1000: think of your milligrams of medicines or your gigabytes of computing power. <strong>12 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>The Imperial system, on the other hand, is based on the inch / foot / yard / mile (length), the ounce / pound / stone / hundredweight (weight / mass) and the fluid ounce / pint / quart / gallon (volume). The Imperial system is generally <em>not </em>decimal:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>LENGTH: There are 12 inches in a foot, 3 feet in a yard, and 1760 yards in a mile – a curious choice of number with a long and confusing history based on even older lengths called the FURLONG, POLE and CHAIN.</li>
          <li>WEIGHT / MASS: There are 16 ounces in a pound, 14 pounds in a stone, and 8 stones in a hundredweight (or 7 stone 2 pounds if you’re in North America – somewhat confusingly!).</li>
          <li>CAPACITY:<strong> 13 ……….&nbsp;</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>These bizarre conversion factors and cross-continental differences are confusing for countries that use the imperial system, whereas the metric system of prefixes deals effortlessly with the miniscule and enormous quantities of modern living – like microns or megabytes. <strong>14 ………. </strong>: one cm<sup>3</sup> is exactly equal to one ml (millilitre), and a litre of water weighs precisely one kilogram. Now, that’s beautiful!<br>
<br>
<strong>Which is more intuitive?&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>Let’s take length: Most everyday objects we measure are either something you use (a book, a door) or a person (how tall do you think she is?). The inch and foot are <em>just the right size</em> for these measurements!</p>
        <p>Most of us can imagine someone who’s 5 foot 4 quite easily: a foot is, well, about the length of an adult’s foot, and the inch is the distance between your thumb and forefinger when you hold them parallel as if to say “about this big”. But “one point six three metres” or “163cm” are both harder for us to process – <strong>15 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>Now, take weight: Again, the Imperial units were designed with everyday objects in mind – “four ounces of butter” is easier to handle than “114 grams”: the grams are too accurate!&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So although ingredients such as flour, sugar and butter are now sold by the kilo, many of us still use ounces to weigh them. When weighing ourselves, compare these three equal values: 159lbs, 11 and a bit stone, or 72kg. <strong>16 ………. </strong>And finally, volume: now both systems are easy to picture: we all know what one pint and one litre look like (if you don’t then look for a pint glass and a one litre bottle of juice in your kitchen). <strong>17 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Imperial vs Metric&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
The Metric system started in France during the 1700’s. It is based on the metre (length), gram (weight, or more properly “mass”) and litre (volume). “Metric” comes from the word “metre.”</p>
        <p>There is also a system of prefixes for making things bigger (kilo- , mega- , giga- , tera- ) or smaller (milli- , micro- , nano- ) in multiples of 1000: think of your milligrams of medicines or your gigabytes of computing power. <strong>12 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>The Imperial system, on the other hand, is based on the inch / foot / yard / mile (length), the ounce / pound / stone / hundredweight (weight / mass) and the fluid ounce / pint / quart / gallon (volume). The Imperial system is generally <em>not </em>decimal:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>LENGTH: There are 12 inches in a foot, 3 feet in a yard, and 1760 yards in a mile – a curious choice of number with a long and confusing history based on even older lengths called the FURLONG, POLE and CHAIN.</li>
          <li>WEIGHT / MASS: There are 16 ounces in a pound, 14 pounds in a stone, and 8 stones in a hundredweight (or 7 stone 2 pounds if you’re in North America – somewhat confusingly!).</li>
          <li>CAPACITY:<strong> 13 ……….&nbsp;</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>These bizarre conversion factors and cross-continental differences are confusing for countries that use the imperial system, whereas the metric system of prefixes deals effortlessly with the miniscule and enormous quantities of modern living – like microns or megabytes. <strong>14 ………. </strong>: one cm<sup>3</sup> is exactly equal to one ml (millilitre), and a litre of water weighs precisely one kilogram. Now, that’s beautiful!<br>
<br>
<strong>Which is more intuitive?&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>Let’s take length: Most everyday objects we measure are either something you use (a book, a door) or a person (how tall do you think she is?). The inch and foot are <em>just the right size</em> for these measurements!</p>
        <p>Most of us can imagine someone who’s 5 foot 4 quite easily: a foot is, well, about the length of an adult’s foot, and the inch is the distance between your thumb and forefinger when you hold them parallel as if to say “about this big”. But “one point six three metres” or “163cm” are both harder for us to process – <strong>15 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>Now, take weight: Again, the Imperial units were designed with everyday objects in mind – “four ounces of butter” is easier to handle than “114 grams”: the grams are too accurate!&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So although ingredients such as flour, sugar and butter are now sold by the kilo, many of us still use ounces to weigh them. When weighing ourselves, compare these three equal values: 159lbs, 11 and a bit stone, or 72kg. <strong>16 ………. </strong>And finally, volume: now both systems are easy to picture: we all know what one pint and one litre look like (if you don’t then look for a pint glass and a one litre bottle of juice in your kitchen). <strong>17 ……….</strong></p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Imperial vs Metric&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
The Metric system started in France during the 1700’s. It is based on the metre (length), gram (weight, or more properly “mass”) and litre (volume). “Metric” comes from the word “metre.”</p>
        <p>There is also a system of prefixes for making things bigger (kilo- , mega- , giga- , tera- ) or smaller (milli- , micro- , nano- ) in multiples of 1000: think of your milligrams of medicines or your gigabytes of computing power. <strong>12 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>The Imperial system, on the other hand, is based on the inch / foot / yard / mile (length), the ounce / pound / stone / hundredweight (weight / mass) and the fluid ounce / pint / quart / gallon (volume). The Imperial system is generally <em>not </em>decimal:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>LENGTH: There are 12 inches in a foot, 3 feet in a yard, and 1760 yards in a mile – a curious choice of number with a long and confusing history based on even older lengths called the FURLONG, POLE and CHAIN.</li>
          <li>WEIGHT / MASS: There are 16 ounces in a pound, 14 pounds in a stone, and 8 stones in a hundredweight (or 7 stone 2 pounds if you’re in North America – somewhat confusingly!).</li>
          <li>CAPACITY:<strong> 13 ……….&nbsp;</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>These bizarre conversion factors and cross-continental differences are confusing for countries that use the imperial system, whereas the metric system of prefixes deals effortlessly with the miniscule and enormous quantities of modern living – like microns or megabytes. <strong>14 ………. </strong>: one cm<sup>3</sup> is exactly equal to one ml (millilitre), and a litre of water weighs precisely one kilogram. Now, that’s beautiful!<br>
<br>
<strong>Which is more intuitive?&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>Let’s take length: Most everyday objects we measure are either something you use (a book, a door) or a person (how tall do you think she is?). The inch and foot are <em>just the right size</em> for these measurements!</p>
        <p>Most of us can imagine someone who’s 5 foot 4 quite easily: a foot is, well, about the length of an adult’s foot, and the inch is the distance between your thumb and forefinger when you hold them parallel as if to say “about this big”. But “one point six three metres” or “163cm” are both harder for us to process – <strong>15 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>Now, take weight: Again, the Imperial units were designed with everyday objects in mind – “four ounces of butter” is easier to handle than “114 grams”: the grams are too accurate!&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>So although ingredients such as flour, sugar and butter are now sold by the kilo, many of us still use ounces to weigh them. When weighing ourselves, compare these three equal values: 159lbs, 11 and a bit stone, or 72kg. <strong>16 ………. </strong>And finally, volume: now both systems are easy to picture: we all know what one pint and one litre look like (if you don’t then look for a pint glass and a one litre bottle of juice in your kitchen). <strong>17 ……….&nbsp;</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Imperial vs Metric&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
The Metric system started in France during the 1700’s. It is based on the metre (length), gram (weight, or more properly “mass”) and litre (volume). “Metric” comes from the word “metre.”</p>
        <p>There is also a system of prefixes for making things bigger (kilo- , mega- , giga- , tera- ) or smaller (milli- , micro- , nano- ) in multiples of 1000: think of your milligrams of medicines or your gigabytes of computing power. <strong>12 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>The Imperial system, on the other hand, is based on the inch / foot / yard / mile (length), the ounce / pound / stone / hundredweight (weight / mass) and the fluid ounce / pint / quart / gallon (volume). The Imperial system is generally <em>not </em>decimal:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>LENGTH: There are 12 inches in a foot, 3 feet in a yard, and 1760 yards in a mile – a curious choice of number with a long and confusing history based on even older lengths called the FURLONG, POLE and CHAIN.</li>
          <li>WEIGHT / MASS: There are 16 ounces in a pound, 14 pounds in a stone, and 8 stones in a hundredweight (or 7 stone 2 pounds if you’re in North America – somewhat confusingly!).</li>
          <li>CAPACITY:<strong> 13 ……….&nbsp;</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>These bizarre conversion factors and cross-continental differences are confusing for countries that use the imperial system, whereas the metric system of prefixes deals effortlessly with the miniscule and enormous quantities of modern living – like microns or megabytes. <strong>14 ………. </strong>: one cm<sup>3</sup> is exactly equal to one ml (millilitre), and a litre of water weighs precisely one kilogram. Now, that’s beautiful!<br>
<br>
<strong>Which is more intuitive?&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>Let’s take length: Most everyday objects we measure are either something you use (a book, a door) or a person (how tall do you think she is?). The inch and foot are <em>just the right size</em> for these measurements!</p>
        <p>Most of us can imagine someone who’s 5 foot 4 quite easily: a foot is, well, about the length of an adult’s foot, and the inch is the distance between your thumb and forefinger when you hold them parallel as if to say “about this big”. But “one point six three metres” or “163cm” are both harder for us to process – <strong>15 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>Now, take weight: Again, the Imperial units were designed with everyday objects in mind – “four ounces of butter” is easier to handle than “114 grams”: the grams are too accurate!&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So although ingredients such as flour, sugar and butter are now sold by the kilo, many of us still use ounces to weigh them. When weighing ourselves, compare these three equal values: 159lbs, 11 and a bit stone, or 72kg. <strong>16 ………. </strong>And finally, volume: now both systems are easy to picture: we all know what one pint and one litre look like (if you don’t then look for a pint glass and a one litre bottle of juice in your kitchen). <strong>17 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>

The Metric system started in France during the 1700’s. It is based on the metre (length), gram (weight, or more properly “mass”) and litre (volume). “Metric” comes from the word “metre.”</p>

        <p>The Imperial system, on the other hand, is based on the inch / foot / yard / mile (length), the ounce / pound / stone / hundredweight (weight / mass) and the fluid ounce / pint / quart / gallon (volume). The Imperial system is generally <em>not </em>decimal:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>LENGTH: There are 12 inches in a foot, 3 feet in a yard, and 1760 yards in a mile – a curious choice of number with a long and confusing history based on even older lengths called the FURLONG, POLE and CHAIN.</li>
          <li>WEIGHT / MASS: There are 16 ounces in a pound, 14 pounds in a stone, and 8 stones in a hundredweight (or 7 stone 2 pounds if you’re in North America – somewhat confusingly!).</li>

In modern&nbsp;clothing&nbsp;and&nbsp;fashion design, a&nbsp;button&nbsp;is a small&nbsp;fastener, now most commonly made of&nbsp;plastic&nbsp;but also may be made of metal, wood, or&nbsp;seashell, that joins two pieces of&nbsp;fabric&nbsp;together. In&nbsp;archaeology, a button can be a significant&nbsp;artifact. In the&nbsp;applied arts&nbsp;and&nbsp;craft, a button can be an example of&nbsp;folk art,&nbsp;studio craft, or even a miniature&nbsp;work of art.<br>
<br>
Buttons are most often attached to articles of&nbsp;clothing, but can also be used on containers such as&nbsp;wallets&nbsp;and bags. However, buttons may be sewn onto garments and similar items exclusively for purposes of&nbsp;ornamentation. Buttons serving as&nbsp;fasteners&nbsp;work by slipping through a fabric or thread loop or by sliding through a&nbsp;buttonhole.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
A&nbsp;zipper,&nbsp;zip,&nbsp;fly, or&nbsp;zip fastener, formerly known as a&nbsp;clasp locker, is a commonly used device for binding the edges of an opening of&nbsp;fabric&nbsp;or other flexible material, such as on a garment or a bag. It is used in clothing (e.g., jackets and jeans),&nbsp;luggage&nbsp;and other bags,&nbsp;sporting goods,&nbsp;camping&nbsp;gear (e.g.&nbsp;tents&nbsp;and&nbsp;sleeping bags), and other items.<br>
<br>
Zippers come in all different sizes, shapes, and colours.&nbsp;Whitcomb L. Judson, who was an American inventor from Chicago, is sometimes given credit as the inventor of the zipper, but his device was used for footwear not clothing. The method, still in use today, is based on interlocking teeth. Initially, it was titled the "hookless fastener" and was later redesigned to become more reliable.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
A&nbsp;snap fastener&nbsp;(also called&nbsp;press stud,&nbsp;dome fastener,&nbsp;popper,&nbsp;snap&nbsp;or&nbsp;tich) is a pair of interlocking discs, made out of a metal or plastic, commonly used in place of traditional&nbsp;buttons&nbsp;to fasten&nbsp;clothing&nbsp;and for similar purposes. A circular lip under one disc fits into a groove on the top of the other, holding them fast until a certain amount of force is applied. Different types of snaps can be attached to fabric or leather by&nbsp;riveting&nbsp;with a punch and die set specific to the type of rivet snaps used (striking the punch with a hammer to splay the tail), sewing, or plying with special snap pliers.<br>
<br>
Snap fasteners are a noted detail in American&nbsp;Western wear&nbsp;and are also often chosen for children's clothing, as they are relatively easy for children to use compared with traditional buttons.<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong> ^}<br>
Hook-and-loop fasteners,&nbsp;hook-and-pile fasteners&nbsp;or&nbsp;touch fasteners&nbsp;(often referred to by the&nbsp;genericised trademark&nbsp;velcro, due to the prominence of the&nbsp;Velcro Brand) consist of two components: typically, two lineal&nbsp;fabric&nbsp;strips (or, alternatively, round "dots" or squares) which are attached (sewn&nbsp;or otherwise adhered) to the opposing surfaces to be fastened. The first component features tiny hooks; the second features smaller loops. When the two are pressed together the hooks catch in the loops and the two pieces fasten or bind temporarily. When separated, by pulling or peeling the two surfaces apart, the strips make a distinctive ripping sound.<br>

In modern&nbsp;clothing&nbsp;and&nbsp;fashion design, a&nbsp;button&nbsp;is a small&nbsp;fastener, now most commonly made of&nbsp;plastic&nbsp;but also may be made of metal, wood, or&nbsp;seashell, that joins two pieces of&nbsp;fabric&nbsp;together. In&nbsp;archaeology, a button can be a significant&nbsp;artifact. In the&nbsp;applied arts&nbsp;and&nbsp;craft, a button can be an example of&nbsp;folk art,&nbsp;studio craft, or even a miniature&nbsp;work of art.<br>
<br>
Buttons are most often attached to articles of&nbsp;clothing, but can also be used on containers such as&nbsp;wallets&nbsp;and bags. However, buttons may be sewn onto garments and similar items exclusively for purposes of&nbsp;ornamentation. Buttons serving as&nbsp;fasteners&nbsp;work by slipping through a fabric or thread loop or by sliding through a&nbsp;buttonhole.&nbsp;<br>
<br>

A&nbsp;zipper,&nbsp;zip,&nbsp;fly, or&nbsp;zip fastener, formerly known as a&nbsp;clasp locker, is a commonly used device for binding the edges of an opening of&nbsp;fabric&nbsp;or other flexible material, such as on a garment or a bag. It is used in clothing (e.g., jackets and jeans),&nbsp;luggage&nbsp;and other bags,&nbsp;sporting goods,&nbsp;camping&nbsp;gear (e.g.&nbsp;tents&nbsp;and&nbsp;sleeping bags), and other items.<br>
<br>
Zippers come in all different sizes, shapes, and colours.&nbsp;Whitcomb L. Judson, who was an American inventor from Chicago, is sometimes given credit as the inventor of the zipper, but his device was used for footwear not clothing. The method, still in use today, is based on interlocking teeth. Initially, it was titled the "hookless fastener" and was later redesigned to become more reliable.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
A&nbsp;snap fastener&nbsp;(also called&nbsp;press stud,&nbsp;dome fastener,&nbsp;popper,&nbsp;snap&nbsp;or&nbsp;tich) is a pair of interlocking discs, made out of a metal or plastic, commonly used in place of traditional&nbsp;buttons&nbsp;to fasten&nbsp;clothing&nbsp;and for similar purposes. A circular lip under one disc fits into a groove on the top of the other, holding them fast until a certain amount of force is applied. Different types of snaps can be attached to fabric or leather by&nbsp;riveting&nbsp;with a punch and die set specific to the type of rivet snaps used (striking the punch with a hammer to splay the tail), sewing, or plying with special snap pliers.<br>
<br>
Snap fasteners are a noted detail in American&nbsp;Western wear&nbsp;and are also often chosen for children's clothing, as they are relatively easy for children to use compared with traditional buttons.<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Hook-and-loop fasteners,&nbsp;hook-and-pile fasteners&nbsp;or&nbsp;touch fasteners&nbsp;(often referred to by the&nbsp;genericised trademark&nbsp;velcro, due to the prominence of the&nbsp;Velcro Brand) consist of two components: typically, two lineal&nbsp;fabric&nbsp;strips (or, alternatively, round "dots" or squares) which are attached (sewn&nbsp;or otherwise adhered) to the opposing surfaces to be fastened. The first component features tiny hooks; the second features smaller loops. When the two are pressed together the hooks catch in the loops and the two pieces fasten or bind temporarily. When separated, by pulling or peeling the two surfaces apart, the strips make a distinctive ripping sound.<br>

          <strong>The Call of the Wild</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by Jack London</em>
        </p>
        <p>Buck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley. Judge Miller’s place, it was called. It stood back from the road, half hidden among the trees, through which glimpses could be caught of the wide cool verandah that ran around its four sides. The house was approached by gravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns and under the interlacing trees of tall poplars. At the rear things were on even a more spacious scale than at the front. There were great stables, where a dozen grooms and boys held forth, rows of vine-covered servants’ cottages an endless and orderly array of outhouses, long grape plantations, green pastures, orchards, and berry patches. Then there was the pumping plant for the artesian well and the big cement tank, where Judge Miller’s boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot afternoon.</p>
        <p>And over this great domain Buck ruled. Here he was born, and here he had lived the four years of his life. It was true, there were other dogs. There could not but be other dogs on so vast a place, but they did not count. They came and went, resided in the many kennels, or lived obscurely in the recesses of the house after the fashion of Toots, the Japanese pug, or Ysabel, the Mexican hairless, — strange creatures that rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground. On the other hand, there were the fox terriers, a score of them at least, who yelped fearful threats at Toots and Ysabel looking out of the windows at them and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with brooms and mops.</p>
        <p>But Buck was neither house-dog nor kennel-dog. The whole realm was his. He plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the Judge’s sons; he escorted Mollie and Alice, the Judge’s daughters, on long twilight or early morning rambles; on wintry nights he lay at the Judge’s feet before the roaring library fire; he carried the Judge’s grandsons on his back, or rolled them in the grass, and guarded their footsteps through wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable yard, and even beyond, where the paddocks were, and the berry patches. Among the terriers he stalked imperiously, and Toots and Ysabel he utterly ignored, for he was king, — king over all creeping, crawling, flying things of Judge Miller’s place, humans included.</p>
        <p>His father, Elmo, a huge St. Bernard, had been the Judge’s inseparable companion, and Buck attempted to follow in the way of his father. He was not so large, — he weighed only one hundred and forty pounds, — for his mother, Shep, had been a Scotch shepherd dog. Nevertheless, one hundred and forty pounds, to which was added the dignity that comes of good living and universal respect, enabled him to carry himself in right royal fashion. During the four years since his puppyhood he had lived the life of an aristocrat; he had a fine pride in himself, was even a trifle egotistical, as country gentlemen sometimes become because of their insular situation. But he had saved himself by not becoming a&nbsp;mere pampered house-dog. Hunting and kindred outdoor delights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles; and to him, the love of water had been a tonic and a health preserver.</p>

<p>There was once a boy who was so obsessed with watching TV that wherever he went, he would arrive late. He was so keen to return to the telly that he never finished his breakfast or anything.<br>
<br>
One day, in his post-box, was a mysterious parcel. Inside the parcel were some special spectacles, along with a piece of paper saying, "With these you'll be able to see time".<br>
<br>
The boy didn't understand. He put the glasses on, looked at his brother and saw an enormous pile of flowers on top of his head. The flowers were falling down to the ground, one by one. And it wasn't just his brother. Whenever he looked at anyone through those glasses, exactly the same was happening. The only difference was that the older the person was, the smaller was the pile of flowers on their head. And according to how that person behaved, the pile gained or lost flowers.<br>
<br>
The next morning, while having his breakfast, the boy remembered his glasses. Putting them on, he was horrified to see that, coming from his own pile, was a constant stream of flowers going in the direction of the television. Not only that, but the television now had an enormous mouth, and was ferociously gobbling up all the flowers. And everywhere he went he would see wild-looking televisions devouring flowers.<br>
<br>
Finally, after realising what televisions actually are, the boy decided he would never again allow them to eat up all his time.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
“Hey! Couch potato! Stop watching so much television or you'll rot your brain!”<br>
<br>
Have you ever had someone say something along those lines to you? If you watch as much television as most people do, then a concerned friend or family member may have tried to unglue you from the set and get you outside to play instead.<br>
<br>
Watching television is fun. There's no use in denying it. The entertainment industry makes billions of dollars by producing television programs that delight and entertain us. Whether it's a funny comedy, an action-packed crime drama, a sporting event, or a musical reality show, television programs offer a little something for everyone. Of course, television programs can be educational. You're sure to find interesting programming that can teach you a lot. Many other cable channels also feature fascinating educational content, from biographies and nature shows to historical features and game shows.<br>
<br>
But watching too much television might also actually change your brain in negative ways. Some fear that the brain will change in ways that lead to a shorter attention span that can affect learning.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Since the days of “Howdy Doody”, children have been drawn to their television sets to watch shows made especially for them. While grown-ups get into medical dramas and courtroom hijinks, kids just want to watch characters they love dealing with hilarious problems while learning important lessons in the process.<br>
<br>
Kids’ TV is a genre all its own; with brighter colours, smaller stories, and an element of silliness rarely found during primetime. From animated sponges to a boy named Beaver, the best children’s television shows of all time have been best friends for kids all over the world.<br>
<br>
We organised them into the 100 best programs to ever grace the small screen, here is number #1. Avatar: The Last Airbender [IMDb user rating: 9.2 - Years on air: 2005–2008] It’s an animated show set in an alternate world where people can manipulate the elements. A 12-year-old named Aang and his friends are tasked with bringing peace to the world by ending the Fire Lord’s century-long war. While the series was successful with 61 episodes over three seasons, the live-action adaptation, directed by M. Shyamalan, was universally shown.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
There's a perception that books are good, while TV is bad. Spend a day curled up with a book and you're an intellectual; spend a day watching your favorite show and you're a couch potato.<br>
<br>
But why is that? Why can't watching TV be just as educational as reading a book? In 2013 a team led by Hiraku Takeuchi at Tohoku University in Japan examined the effects of television on the brains of 276 children. He found that the more TV the kids watched, parts of their brain associated with higher arousal and aggression levels became thicker. Also, the more hours of television the kids watched, the lower their verbal test results became.<br>
<br>
In the same year, a study was done on how reading a novel affected the brain. College students were asked to read Pompeii by Robert Harris, a thriller. After reading the novel, the students had increased connectivity in parts of the brain that were related to language. There was also increased activity in the brain, that suggested readers experienced similar sensations to the characters in the book.<br>
<br>
There are also long-term effects from reading books. Reading keeps your mind alert and delays cognitive decline in elders. Research even found that Alzheimer's is 2.5 times less likely to appear in elderly people who read regularly, while TV was presented as a risk factor. Six minutes of reading can reduce stress levels by 68%.&nbsp;​<br>

          <strong>The Call of the Wild</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by Jack London</em>
        </p>
        <p>Buck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley. Judge Miller’s place, it was called. It stood back from the road, half hidden among the trees, through which glimpses could be caught of the wide cool verandah that ran around its four sides. The house was approached by gravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns and under the interlacing trees of tall poplars. At the rear things were on even a more spacious scale than at the front. There were great stables, where a dozen grooms and boys held forth, rows of vine-covered servants’ cottages an endless and orderly array of outhouses, long grape plantations, green pastures, orchards, and berry patches. Then there was the pumping plant for the artesian well and the big cement tank, where Judge Miller’s boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot afternoon.</p>
        <p>And over this great domain Buck ruled. Here he was born, and here he had lived the four years of his life. It was true, there were other dogs. There could not but be other dogs on so vast a place, but they did not count. They came and went, resided in the many kennels, or lived obscurely in the recesses of the house after the fashion of Toots, the Japanese pug, or Ysabel, the Mexican hairless, — strange creatures that rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground. On the other hand, there were the fox terriers, a score of them at least, who yelped fearful threats at Toots and Ysabel looking out of the windows at them and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with brooms and mops.</p>
        <p>But Buck was neither house-dog nor kennel-dog. The whole realm was his. He plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the Judge’s sons; he escorted Mollie and Alice, the Judge’s daughters, on long twilight or early morning rambles; on wintry nights he lay at the Judge’s feet before the roaring library fire; he carried the Judge’s grandsons on his back, or rolled them in the grass, and guarded their footsteps through wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable yard, and even beyond, where the paddocks were, and the berry patches. Among the terriers he stalked imperiously, and Toots and Ysabel he utterly ignored, for he was king, — king over all creeping, crawling, flying things of Judge Miller’s place, humans included.</p>
        <p>His father, Elmo, a huge St. Bernard, had been the Judge’s inseparable companion, and Buck attempted to follow in the way of his father. He was not so large, — he weighed only one hundred and forty pounds, — for his mother, Shep, had been a Scotch shepherd dog. Nevertheless, one hundred and forty pounds, to which was added the dignity that comes of good living and universal respect, enabled him to carry himself in right royal fashion. During the four years since his puppyhood he had lived the life of an aristocrat; he had a fine pride in himself, was even a trifle egotistical, as country gentlemen sometimes become because of their insular situation. But he had saved himself by not becoming a&nbsp;mere pampered house-dog. Hunting and kindred outdoor delights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles; and to him, the love of water had been a tonic and a health preserver.</p>
