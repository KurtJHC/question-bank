But did you know that all five of your senses work together? All five collaborate to feed information about our surrounding environment into the brain, a concept known as perception. Perception is vital to human survival, as our senses help us do things like detect threats, locate food, and communicate with other humans. While our senses are connected, each of the five performs a vital function.</p>
Lots of new studies are being done every day on the connections between the senses. While all of our senses have an important function independently, they also build off of one another to influence overall perception. In addition, some people even have a condition known as synesthesia, in which the senses combine their information in peculiar ways, resulting in the ability to hear colors or see tastes. But even without synesthesia, all of us experience some degree of overlap between the senses. For example, sight and hearing are closely tied, as seen in a phenomenon called the McGurk effect: If you hear a person pronounce the sound "bah" but it appears as though their mouth is pronouncing the sound "fah," your brain will hear the sound "fah," even if that is not the sound it is actually hearing. Hearing and vision also work together to help the body orient itself within the environment, and the two senses being out of sync can result in difficulty with balance and spatial reasoning. Smell and taste provide another well-known example of senses working together: The presence of a strong, unpleasant odor will influence how the body perceives the taste of an otherwise pleasant food. Even physically, the throat connects the nose and mouth, and it is impossible to completely disconnect the senses of smell and taste. Other connections between senses are less understood, but scientists are learning more and more about perception and the way our senses work together.</div>

          <strong>To see or not to see – the impact of indigenous tourism</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Over the past decade, adventure travel has shifted from being less about adrenaline and more about learning and transformation.&nbsp;Indigenous tourism, also known as&nbsp;ethnic&nbsp;or&nbsp;tribal&nbsp;tourism, has been a particularly fast-growing trend.</p>
        <p>For travellers interested in a meaningful interaction with other cultures, these tours can be very rewarding.&nbsp;However, with volumes of visitors increasing rapidly, issues have been raised about whether it’s ethical to visit the tribes and what&nbsp;consequences&nbsp;it bears for the preservation of the native lifestyles and traditions. Indigenous tourism&nbsp;is&nbsp;‘tourism activity in which indigenous people are directly involved either through control and/or by having their culture serve as the essence of the attraction.’ These days you don’t have to look far for crafty tour companies and travel agencies offering&nbsp;tribal visits&nbsp;where busloads of foreigners are driven to visit native people in their reservations or villages.</p>
        <p>Ideally, the villagers&nbsp;should be able to assert some degree of control over their engagement with tourism and should secure clear economical benefits from this. Unfortunately, in practice often very little of the tourism dollars remain in the villages. There has been growing evidence that the tribes are being&nbsp;exploited&nbsp;by these so-called tour operators looking for quick and easy profit. The concerns arise also because in many cases Western visitors come hoping for the perfect photo opportunity rather than true cultural immersion and genuine engagement. Critics&nbsp;describe some tribal village visits as&nbsp;‘human zoos,’ where the subjects are essentially trapped in their villages, compelled to wear traditional clothing and smile for photos.&nbsp;Their culture suffers and they don’t have time for their traditional life and costumes. Their traditional dresses and products are on display for tourists but in reality their way of life is, in a lot of cases, long gone.</p>
        <p>‘Human zoos’, or&nbsp;‘human safaris’&nbsp;as they are dubbed in more remote areas, are a growing concern in places such as&nbsp;Peru, where&nbsp;unscrupulous&nbsp;tour operators are profiting from the exploitation of indigenous tribes in the Amazon jungle.&nbsp;As tourism increases around the&nbsp;Manú&nbsp;Biosphere Reserve&nbsp;near Cuzco, so does the number of reported sightings of the&nbsp;Mashco-Piro&nbsp;– one of around 15&nbsp;uncontacted tribes&nbsp;in Peru, and one of only around 100 such tribes left in the world. This is particularly worrying as&nbsp;any attempt to contact such tribes may have grave consequences – a simple cold (their immunity differs from ‘Western’) could put an entire tribe in danger.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, it can be argued that&nbsp;ethnic&nbsp;tourism has helped&nbsp;foster greater awareness&nbsp;of indigenous people, many of whom face oppression, forced land relocation, and challenges to social and economic integration.&nbsp;The influx of tourists has also allowed for traditional&nbsp;tribal arts and handicrafts&nbsp;to flourish, which often means an additional – or the only – source of income for the community. The intricate hand-made masks of Costa Rican&nbsp;Boruca&nbsp;people, for example, have gained international fame and facilitated not only economic self-reliance of the village, but also the preservation of the craft.</p>
        <p>Ethical and&nbsp;responsible tour companies&nbsp;do exist. In general,&nbsp;the best tours&nbsp;are the ones where small groups or individuals go with the intention to stay in village overnight, as it generates the most sustainable income for the communities. These&nbsp;homestays&nbsp;are a true&nbsp;cultural immersion&nbsp;and quite likely an experience of a lifetime.</p>

          <strong>To see or not to see – the impact of indigenous tourism</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Over the past decade, adventure travel has shifted from being less about adrenaline and more about learning and transformation.&nbsp;Indigenous tourism, also known as&nbsp;ethnic&nbsp;or&nbsp;tribal&nbsp;tourism, has been a particularly fast-growing trend.</p>
        <p>For travellers interested in a meaningful interaction with other cultures, these tours can be very rewarding.&nbsp;However, with volumes of visitors increasing rapidly, issues have been raised about whether it’s ethical to visit the tribes and what&nbsp;consequences&nbsp;it bears for the preservation of the native lifestyles and traditions. Indigenous tourism&nbsp;is&nbsp;‘tourism activity in which indigenous people are directly involved either through control and/or by having their culture serve as the essence of the attraction.’ These days you don’t have to look far for crafty tour companies and travel agencies offering&nbsp;tribal visits&nbsp;where busloads of foreigners are driven to visit native people in their reservations or villages.</p>
        <p>Ideally, the villagers&nbsp;should be able to assert some degree of control over their engagement with tourism and should secure clear economical benefits from this. Unfortunately, in practice often very little of the tourism dollars remain in the villages. There has been growing evidence that the tribes are being&nbsp;exploited&nbsp;by these so-called tour operators looking for quick and easy profit. The concerns arise also because in many cases Western visitors come hoping for the perfect photo opportunity rather than true cultural immersion and genuine engagement. Critics&nbsp;describe some tribal village visits as&nbsp;‘human zoos,’ where the subjects are essentially trapped in their villages, compelled to wear traditional clothing and smile for photos.&nbsp;Their culture suffers and they don’t have time for their traditional life and costumes. Their traditional dresses and products are on display for tourists but in reality their way of life is, in a lot of cases, long gone.</p>
        <p>‘Human zoos’, or&nbsp;‘human safaris’&nbsp;as they are dubbed in more remote areas, are a growing concern in places such as&nbsp;Peru, where&nbsp;unscrupulous&nbsp;tour operators are profiting from the exploitation of indigenous tribes in the Amazon jungle.&nbsp;As tourism increases around the&nbsp;Manú&nbsp;Biosphere Reserve&nbsp;near Cuzco, so does the number of reported sightings of the&nbsp;Mashco-Piro&nbsp;– one of around 15&nbsp;uncontacted tribes&nbsp;in Peru, and one of only around 100 such tribes left in the world. This is particularly worrying as&nbsp;any attempt to contact such tribes may have grave consequences – a simple cold (their immunity differs from ‘Western’) could put an entire tribe in danger.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, it can be argued that&nbsp;ethnic&nbsp;tourism has helped&nbsp;foster greater awareness&nbsp;of indigenous people, many of whom face oppression, forced land relocation, and challenges to social and economic integration.&nbsp;The influx of tourists has also allowed for traditional&nbsp;tribal arts and handicrafts&nbsp;to flourish, which often means an additional – or the only – source of income for the community. The intricate hand-made masks of Costa Rican&nbsp;Boruca&nbsp;people, for example, have gained international fame and facilitated not only economic self-reliance of the village, but also the preservation of the craft.</p>
        <p>Ethical and&nbsp;responsible tour companies&nbsp;do exist. In general,&nbsp;the best tours&nbsp;are the ones where small groups or individuals go with the intention to stay in village overnight, as it generates the most sustainable income for the communities. These&nbsp;homestays&nbsp;are a true&nbsp;cultural immersion&nbsp;and quite likely an experience of a lifetime.</p>

          <strong>To see or not to see – the impact of indigenous tourism</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Over the past decade, adventure travel has shifted from being less about adrenaline and more about learning and transformation.&nbsp;Indigenous tourism, also known as&nbsp;ethnic&nbsp;or&nbsp;tribal&nbsp;tourism, has been a particularly fast-growing trend.</p>
        <p>For travellers interested in a meaningful interaction with other cultures, these tours can be very rewarding.&nbsp;However, with volumes of visitors increasing rapidly, issues have been raised about whether it’s ethical to visit the tribes and what&nbsp;consequences&nbsp;it bears for the preservation of the native lifestyles and traditions. Indigenous tourism&nbsp;is&nbsp;‘tourism activity in which indigenous people are directly involved either through control and/or by having their culture serve as the essence of the attraction.’ These days you don’t have to look far for crafty tour companies and travel agencies offering&nbsp;tribal visits&nbsp;where busloads of foreigners are driven to visit native people in their reservations or villages.</p>
        <p>Ideally, the villagers&nbsp;should be able to assert some degree of control over their engagement with tourism and should secure clear economical benefits from this. Unfortunately, in practice often very little of the tourism dollars remain in the villages. There has been growing evidence that the tribes are being&nbsp;exploited&nbsp;by these so-called tour operators looking for quick and easy profit. The concerns arise also because in many cases Western visitors come hoping for the perfect photo opportunity rather than true cultural immersion and genuine engagement. Critics&nbsp;describe some tribal village visits as&nbsp;‘human zoos,’ where the subjects are essentially trapped in their villages, compelled to wear traditional clothing and smile for photos.&nbsp;Their culture suffers and they don’t have time for their traditional life and costumes. Their traditional dresses and products are on display for tourists but in reality their way of life is, in a lot of cases, long gone.</p>
        <p>‘Human zoos’, or&nbsp;‘human safaris’&nbsp;as they are dubbed in more remote areas, are a growing concern in places such as&nbsp;Peru, where&nbsp;unscrupulous&nbsp;tour operators are profiting from the exploitation of indigenous tribes in the Amazon jungle.&nbsp;As tourism increases around the&nbsp;Manú&nbsp;Biosphere Reserve&nbsp;near Cuzco, so does the number of reported sightings of the&nbsp;Mashco-Piro&nbsp;– one of around 15&nbsp;uncontacted tribes&nbsp;in Peru, and one of only around 100 such tribes left in the world. This is particularly worrying as&nbsp;any attempt to contact such tribes may have grave consequences – a simple cold (their immunity differs from ‘Western’) could put an entire tribe in danger.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, it can be argued that&nbsp;ethnic&nbsp;tourism has helped&nbsp;foster greater awareness&nbsp;of indigenous people, many of whom face oppression, forced land relocation, and challenges to social and economic integration.&nbsp;The influx of tourists has also allowed for traditional&nbsp;tribal arts and handicrafts&nbsp;to flourish, which often means an additional – or the only – source of income for the community. The intricate hand-made masks of Costa Rican&nbsp;Boruca&nbsp;people, for example, have gained international fame and facilitated not only economic self-reliance of the village, but also the preservation of the craft.</p>
        <p>Ethical and&nbsp;responsible tour companies&nbsp;do exist. In general,&nbsp;the best tours&nbsp;are the ones where small groups or individuals go with the intention to stay in village overnight, as it generates the most sustainable income for the communities. These&nbsp;homestays&nbsp;are a true&nbsp;cultural immersion&nbsp;and quite likely an experience of a lifetime.</p>

        <p>Use the script below to answer Questions 27 to 30.<br>
<br>
<strong>HELENA&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>And what about the young man?</p>
        <p><strong>DOMIN</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Well, anyone who has looked into human anatomy will have seen at once that man is too complicated, and that a good engineer could make him more simply. So young Rossum began to overhaul anatomy and tried to see what could be left out or simplified. In short!–– but this isn't boring you, Miss Glory?</p>
        <p><strong>HELENA&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>No indeed. You're!–– it's awfully interesting.</p>
        <p><strong>DOMIN&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>So young Rossum said to himself: "A man is something that feels happy, plays the piano, likes going for a walk, and in fact, wants to do a whole lot of things that are really unnecessary."</p>
        <p><strong>HELENA&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Oh.</p>
        <p><strong>DOMIN&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>That are unnecessary when he wants, let us say, to weave or count. Do you play the piano?</p>
        <p><strong>HELENA&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Yes.</p>
        <p><strong>DOMIN&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>That's good. But a working machine must not play the piano, must not feel happy, must not do a whole lot of other things. A gasoline motor must not have tassels or ornaments, Miss Glory. And to manufacture artificial workers is the same thing as to manufacture gasoline motors. The process must be of the simplest, and the product of the best from a practical point of view. What sort of worker do you think is the best from a practical point of view?</p>
        <p><strong>HELENA&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>What?</p>
        <p><strong>DOMIN&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>What sort of worker do you think is the best from a practical point of view?</p>
        <p><strong>HELENA</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the one who is most honest and hardworking.</p>
        <p><strong>DOMIN&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>No; the one that is the cheapest. The one whose requirements are the smallest. Young Rossum invented a worker with the minimum amount of requirements. He had to simplify him. He rejected everything that did not contribute directly to the progress of work! Everything that makes man more expensive. In fact, he rejected man and made the Robot. My dear Miss Glory, the Robots are not people. Mechanically they are more perfect than we are, they have an enormously developed intelligence, but they have no soul.</p>
        <p><strong>HELENA&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>How do you know they've no soul?</p>
        <p><strong>DOMIN</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Have you ever seen what a Robot looks like inside? Very neat, very simple. Really, a beautiful piece of work. Not much in it, but everything in flawless order. The product of an engineer is technically at a higher pitch of perfection than a product of nature.</p>

        <p>Use the script below to answer Questions 27 to 30.<br>
<br>
<strong>HELENA&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>And what about the young man?</p>
        <p><strong>DOMIN</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Well, anyone who has looked into human anatomy will have seen at once that man is too complicated, and that a good engineer could make him more simply. So young Rossum began to overhaul anatomy and tried to see what could be left out or simplified. In short!–– but this isn't boring you, Miss Glory?</p>
        <p><strong>HELENA&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>No indeed. You're!–– it's awfully interesting.</p>
        <p><strong>DOMIN&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>So young Rossum said to himself: "A man is something that feels happy, plays the piano, likes going for a walk, and in fact, wants to do a whole lot of things that are really unnecessary."</p>
        <p><strong>HELENA&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Oh.</p>
        <p><strong>DOMIN&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>That are unnecessary when he wants, let us say, to weave or count. Do you play the piano?</p>
        <p><strong>HELENA&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Yes.</p>
        <p><strong>DOMIN&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>That's good. But a working machine must not play the piano, must not feel happy, must not do a whole lot of other things. A gasoline motor must not have tassels or ornaments, Miss Glory. And to manufacture artificial workers is the same thing as to manufacture gasoline motors. The process must be of the simplest, and the product of the best from a practical point of view. What sort of worker do you think is the best from a practical point of view?</p>
        <p><strong>HELENA&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>What?</p>
        <p><strong>DOMIN&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>What sort of worker do you think is the best from a practical point of view?</p>
        <p><strong>HELENA</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the one who is most honest and hardworking.</p>
        <p><strong>DOMIN&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>No; the one that is the cheapest. The one whose requirements are the smallest. Young Rossum invented a worker with the minimum amount of requirements. He had to simplify him. He rejected everything that did not contribute directly to the progress of work! Everything that makes man more expensive. In fact, he rejected man and made the Robot. My dear Miss Glory, the Robots are not people. Mechanically they are more perfect than we are, they have an enormously developed intelligence, but they have no soul.</p>
        <p><strong>HELENA&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>How do you know they've no soul?</p>
        <p><strong>DOMIN</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Have you ever seen what a Robot looks like inside? Very neat, very simple. Really, a beautiful piece of work. Not much in it, but everything in flawless order. The product of an engineer is technically at a higher pitch of perfection than a product of nature.</p>

Salvage and recovery efforts have evolved into a romantic yet highly litigious activity. The idea of coming upon a pile of gold doubloons, finding the purser’s safe on an ocean liner, or discovering the military secrets deep inside a warship are some of the fantasies of many divers. But in the search of making those fantasies a reality, knowing some of the laws may help keep you out of jail.</p><p>That’s right, diving on some wrecks is illegal and can lead to your gear being confiscated, getting fined, and possibly landing you in prison. The laws regarding shipwrecks create a constant confusion among explorers depending on where they are diving. These rules pertain to which wrecks can be dived, and how they are dived. Many wrecks are protected from artifact collection, disturbances, and some if they can even be photographed.</p><p>The<em> laws of finds</em> and <em>the laws of salvage</em> are key aspects of admiralty law that provide understanding for how a shipwreck’s ownership is established. Salvage laws allow for salvors to take possession of a wreck to save cargo and then negotiate with the vessel’s owners for payment. The <em>laws of finds</em> is a little different. If a ship has been underwater for some years, but its owners have not been recovering its contents, then a new finder may claim the ship and its contents. This is similar to a penny found on the street, but not that simple.</p><p>Shipwreck divers love to collect artifacts, especially from military ships. One famous shipwreck, the&nbsp;<em>USS San Diego</em>, a World War I armored cruiser sank in 1918 off the Long Island Coast of N.Y. in 33 meters of water. In 1962 the U.S. Navy sold it to a salvage company who planned to recover the scrap metal. Local organizations fought against the project and it was eventually abandoned. For almost forty years shipwreck divers explored and recovered artifacts from this historic site, making it one of the most popular dive locations in the United States. However, in 2006 the <em>USS&nbsp;San Diego</em>&nbsp;was listed on the National Registry of Historic Places and it became illegal to collect artifacts.</p>
But how does all of this affect the average scuba diver who just wants to dive shipwrecks? First, most commercial dive operators are familiar with the rules that affect the shipwrecks on their dive destinations. Those who are running expeditions and have permits for specific sites will inform their clients of any restrictions. And should you come across a wreck that you found all on your own&nbsp;

<p>consult with a maritime attorney to understand your rights before shouting about it on social media. Other countries have rules and it’s important to understand those as well.</p>
The laws that revolve around shipwrecks serve a dual purpose, first to help protect what is rightfully owned by someone, and secondly to help preserve the integrity of historically significant sites for future divers to see. While some of the oversight is overreaching, there may be some benefit of the protection. Shipwreck diving is one of the most exciting and rewarding types of diving we can do. Recreational and technical divers can get a glimpse of our past, and gain an understanding of the fragility of sailing the seas.</div>

          <strong>HOW PARENTS ARE RUINING YOUTH SPORTS</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Three out of four American families with school-aged children have at least one playing an organized sport — a total of about 45 million kids. By age 15, as many as 80 percent of these youngsters have quit, according to the&nbsp;<em>Open Access Journal of Sports Medicine</em>.&nbsp;One reason is the gap between the child’s desire to have fun and the misguided notion among some adults that their kids’ games are a miniature version of grown-up competitions, where the goal is to win. In 20 years of coaching youth and high school sports, I can say unequivocally that adult expectations are the number one problem. As we approach summer, when the living is supposed to be easy, too many families are searching the Internet for a private batting instructor, a summer hockey program, an expensive strength camp, and that elusive AAU coach who can get their 11-year-old to improve her jump shot. This is a misguided attempt to accelerate a process that may not even be occurring, since most young athletes will never reach the elite level.</p>
        <p>When I was growing up in Methuen, we organized our own football, hockey, and baseball teams. Any kid who had a football helmet, a pair of Bobby Orr Rally skates, or a first baseman’s mitt could play. We contacted teams from other neighborhoods and played entire seasons without our parents having anything to do with it. My friends and I even staged our own tennis tournaments at the public courts. (The baseball players swore it helped with their timing at the plate.)</p>
        <p>Except for renting the ice at the local rink, and a set of hockey jerseys we pitched in to buy, it was free. We played for the love of it. Indeed, many of us went on to play high school and college varsity sports.</p>
        <p>Maybe you’re thinking: So this guy went to grammar school with Huck Finn, good for him. But how’s little Eliza going to get a scholarship if she’s not throwing heat? But the fact is, approximately one percent of high school athletes will receive a Division 1 scholarship. And those scholarships, on average, are worth much less than the family’s investment in private lessons, sports camps, and other training.</p>

We contacted teams from other neighborhoods and played entire seasons without our parents having anything to do with it. My friends and I even staged our own tennis tournaments at the public courts. (The baseball players swore it helped with their timing at the plate.)</p>
        <p>Except for renting the ice at the local rink, and a set of hockey jerseys we pitched in to buy, it was free. We played for the love of it. Indeed, many of us went on to play high school and college varsity sports.</p>
        <p>Maybe you’re thinking: So this guy went to grammar school with Huck Finn, good for him. But how’s little Eliza going to get a scholarship if she’s not throwing heat? But the fact is, approximately one percent of high school athletes will receive a Division 1 scholarship. And those scholarships, on average, are worth much less than the family’s investment in private lessons, sports camps, and other training.</p>

        <p><strong>Mother</strong>: You don’t get the point do you? What did I do to deserve a slob as a nineteen year old son? It’s not about the house being spotless. But it does need to be in some sort of order or everything will be havoc. I’m just asking for a little bit of help to do that.</p>

        <p><strong>Son</strong>: I never said that.</p>
        <p><strong>Mother</strong>: I know what you’re thinking when you give me that look. (Sigh) I’m just asking that you help me out a bit around the house by not leaving a mess everywhere.</p>
        <p><strong>Son</strong>: I don’t leave a mess everywhere.</p>
        <p><strong>Mother</strong>: Well what’s with all the food wrappers and crumbs all over the lounge sofas? And the mountain of clothes at the end of your bed and the empty beer bottles your friends brought over yesterday.</p>
        <p><strong>Son</strong>: Ugh, well you can’t expect the house to be completely spotless. We’re living in it, there’s bound to be some mess.</p>
        <p><strong>Mother</strong>: You don’t get the point do you? What did I do to deserve a slob as a nineteen year old son? It’s not about the house being spotless. But it does need to be in some sort of order or everything will be havoc. I’m just asking for a little bit of help to do that.</p>
        <p><strong>Son</strong>: Hmph, you’re exaggerating. It’s not even half as bad as you think it is, Mum.&nbsp;</p>
