          <strong>CELL&nbsp;PHONES</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The cell phone had its roots in the telegraph and telephone. These are both devices that are able to send messages through land-based wires called phone lines. That means that a coded message or a voice is sent through phone lines in order to make it to its destination. The receiving person can then translate the code or listen to the voice on the other end. On a telephone, people were capable of having a conversation from across the nation while it sounded like they were in the same room as each other. In order for them to be able to make a call to each other, though, there would have to be a web of phone lines connecting them over thousands of miles of land. Laying all of these phone lines was very cumbersome, as was only being able to send or receive calls from a stationary place, like a house or office. While the telephone made broad communication more accessible, it still did not have entirely enough freedom for the people.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This was all changed in the year 1973. A man named Martin Cooper invented the first cellular phone while working for Motorola. It was about the size of a brick and weighed over 30 ounces (or 1.8 pounds). While big in size, it was even larger in potential. Cooper made his first call on his cell phone while walking in the middle of a New York street. There were no wires connected to his phone. There was nothing restricting his movement and he could send or receive calls from anywhere.</p>

          <strong>CELL&nbsp;PHONES</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The cell phone had its roots in the telegraph and telephone. These are both devices that are able to send messages through land-based wires called phone lines. That means that a coded message or a voice is sent through phone lines in order to make it to its destination. The receiving person can then translate the code or listen to the voice on the other end. On a telephone, people were capable of having a conversation from across the nation while it sounded like they were in the same room as each other. In order for them to be able to make a call to each other, though, there would have to be a web of phone lines connecting them over thousands of miles of land. Laying all of these phone lines was very cumbersome, as was only being able to send or receive calls from a stationary place, like a house or office. While the telephone made broad communication more accessible, it still did not have entirely enough freedom for the people.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This was all changed in the year 1973. A man named Martin Cooper invented the first cellular phone while working for Motorola. It was about the size of a brick and weighed over 30 ounces (or 1.8 pounds). While big in size, it was even larger in potential. Cooper made his first call on his cell phone while walking in the middle of a New York street. There were no wires connected to his phone. There was nothing restricting his movement and he could send or receive calls from anywhere.</p>

              <strong>Extract A</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Poetry is emotional. It engages that organ which is most underused in academia—the heart. Reading poetry is not simply about understanding the rhyme scheme of an Alexandrian sonnet or being able to write a paper on the theological conceits of the metaphysical poets. A poem is first and foremost an expression of emotion. You have to engage your feelings when you read a poem or you haven’t read the poem. This is important because academia wants you to be objective and scientific all the time. The poet proclaims, “Forget the science already! We want passion, not pie charts!” While poetry engages your emotions it does so in a rational and structured way. Poetry is smart. It does a formal dance around the emotions and engages them while also engaging your brain. Emotion on its own is mere sentimentality. Emotion in classical poetry fuses the intellect with emotion in a high and noble human experience.</p>

              <strong>Extract B</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Reading poetry is good for you because it stretches your imagination. To understand a poem you have to step outside your narrow little world and see the world from a new perspective. The poet makes connections that nobody else makes and to understand them, you must get your mind out of a rut and double check your understanding of reality. What did Emily Dickinson see when she observed, “A narrow fellow in the grass occasionally rides…?” Oh, I see! It’s a snake. Or is it? As your imagination is stretched your perception of reality widens out. Things are not what they seem. They are more than what you thought they were, and this shake up of your preconceptions is what education is all about.</p>

              <strong>Extract C</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Just as in reading poetry, writing poetry puts you in touch with your emotions. You must write a poem about something you are passionate about. As you do, you are forced to examine your emotions and express them in a way which not only communicates a message, but also the emotion of the message. The final couplet or stanza should bring the reader to an “Aha!” moment in which enlightenment and emotion are fused. That’s hard to do, but as you learn to do it you learn to work with emotion and manage it, rather than simply being swept up by the emotions of the moment. Thus, you learn that channeled emotions are far stronger, long lasting and effective than the mere sweep of overwhelming feeling. Emotions that are fused with an exercise of the intellect are most powerful of all.</p>

              <strong>Extract D</strong>
            </p>
            <p>As you write poetry you are forced to think in creative and mind-bending ways. The poet is a person who makes unusual connections. Anybody can see a black dog in a white collar, but a poet sees a priest dressed in black, wearing a white collar that binds him and liberates him all at once. He sees a black dog who serves a white God which is “dog” backwards and knows the priest is both a black dog and a backward god at once. This is why the poets were always also jesters. They were jokers. Like comedians, they saw connections nobody else saw, and as they made those connections the perceptions of their audience were opened up, “Aha!” and they saw the world, truth and beauty in a fresh and startling way.</p>

            <p>Reading poetry is good for you because it stretches your imagination. To understand a poem you have to step outside your narrow little world and see the world from a new perspective. The poet makes connections that nobody else makes and to understand them, you must get your mind out of a rut and double check your understanding of reality. What did Emily Dickinson see when she observed, “A narrow fellow in the grass occasionally rides…?” Oh, I see! It’s a snake. Or is it? As your imagination is stretched your perception of reality widens out. Things are not what they seem. They are more than what you thought they were, and this shake up of your preconceptions is what education is all about.</p>

            <p>Just as in reading poetry, writing poetry puts you in touch with your emotions. You must write a poem about something you are passionate about. As you do, you are forced to examine your emotions and express them in a way which not only communicates a message, but also the emotion of the message. The final couplet or stanza should bring the reader to an “Aha!” moment in which enlightenment and emotion are fused. That’s hard to do, but as you learn to do it you learn to work with emotion and manage it, rather than simply being swept up by the emotions of the moment. Thus, you learn that channeled emotions are far stronger, long lasting and effective than the mere sweep of overwhelming feeling. Emotions that are fused with an exercise of the intellect are most powerful of all.</p>

            <p>As you write poetry you are forced to think in creative and mind-bending ways. The poet is a person who makes unusual connections. Anybody can see a black dog in a white collar, but a poet sees a priest dressed in black, wearing a white collar that binds him and liberates him all at once. He sees a black dog who serves a white God which is “dog” backwards and knows the priest is both a black dog and a backward god at once. This is why the poets were always also jesters. They were jokers. Like comedians, they saw connections nobody else saw, and as they made those connections the perceptions of their audience were opened up, “Aha!” and they saw the world, truth and beauty in a fresh and startling way.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Poetry is emotional. It engages that organ which is most underused in academia—the heart. Reading poetry is not simply about understanding the rhyme scheme of an Alexandrian sonnet or being able to write a paper on the theological conceits of the metaphysical poets. A poem is first and foremost an expression of emotion. You have to engage your feelings when you read a poem or you haven’t read the poem. This is important because academia wants you to be objective and scientific all the time. The poet proclaims, “Forget the science already! We want passion, not pie charts!” While poetry engages your emotions it does so in a rational and structured way. Poetry is smart. It does a formal dance around the emotions and engages them while also engaging your brain. Emotion on its own is mere sentimentality. Emotion in classical poetry fuses the intellect with emotion in a high and noble human experience.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Poetry is emotional. It engages that organ which is most underused in academia—the heart. Reading poetry is not simply about understanding the rhyme scheme of an Alexandrian sonnet or being able to write a paper on the theological conceits of the metaphysical poets. A poem is first and foremost an expression of emotion. You have to engage your feelings when you read a poem or you haven’t read the poem. This is important because academia wants you to be objective and scientific all the time. The poet proclaims, “Forget the science already! We want passion, not pie charts!” While poetry engages your emotions it does so in a rational and structured way. Poetry is smart. It does a formal dance around the emotions and engages them while also engaging your brain. Emotion on its own is mere sentimentality. Emotion in classical poetry fuses the intellect with emotion in a high and noble human experience.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Reading poetry is good for you because it stretches your imagination. To understand a poem you have to step outside your narrow little world and see the world from a new perspective. The poet makes connections that nobody else makes and to understand them, you must get your mind out of a rut and double check your understanding of reality. What did Emily Dickinson see when she observed, “A narrow fellow in the grass occasionally rides…?” Oh, I see! It’s a snake. Or is it? As your imagination is stretched your perception of reality widens out. Things are not what they seem. They are more than what you thought they were, and this shake up of your preconceptions is what education is all about.</p>

              <strong>Extract C</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Just as in reading poetry, writing poetry puts you in touch with your emotions. You must write a poem about something you are passionate about. As you do, you are forced to examine your emotions and express them in a way which not only communicates a message, but also the emotion of the message. The final couplet or stanza should bring the reader to an “Aha!” moment in which enlightenment and emotion are fused. That’s hard to do, but as you learn to do it you learn to work with emotion and manage it, rather than simply being swept up by the emotions of the moment. Thus, you learn that channeled emotions are far stronger, long lasting and effective than the mere sweep of overwhelming feeling. Emotions that are fused with an exercise of the intellect are most powerful of all.</p>

            <p>As you write poetry you are forced to think in creative and mind-bending ways. The poet is a person who makes unusual connections. Anybody can see a black dog in a white collar, but a poet sees a priest dressed in black, wearing a white collar that binds him and liberates him all at once. He sees a black dog who serves a white God which is “dog” backwards and knows the priest is both a black dog and a backward god at once. This is why the poets were always also jesters. They were jokers. Like comedians, they saw connections nobody else saw, and as they made those connections the perceptions of their audience were opened up, “Aha!” and they saw the world, truth and beauty in a fresh and startling way.</p>

            <p>Reading poetry is good for you because it stretches your imagination. To understand a poem you have to step outside your narrow little world and see the world from a new perspective. The poet makes connections that nobody else makes and to understand them, you must get your mind out of a rut and double check your understanding of reality. What did Emily Dickinson see when she observed, “A narrow fellow in the grass occasionally rides…?” Oh, I see! It’s a snake. Or is it? As your imagination is stretched your perception of reality widens out. Things are not what they seem. They are more than what you thought they were, and this shake up of your preconceptions is what education is all about.</p>

            <p>Just as in reading poetry, writing poetry puts you in touch with your emotions. You must write a poem about something you are passionate about. As you do, you are forced to examine your emotions and express them in a way which not only communicates a message, but also the emotion of the message. The final couplet or stanza should bring the reader to an “Aha!” moment in which enlightenment and emotion are fused. That’s hard to do, but as you learn to do it you learn to work with emotion and manage it, rather than simply being swept up by the emotions of the moment. Thus, you learn that channeled emotions are far stronger, long lasting and effective than the mere sweep of overwhelming feeling. Emotions that are fused with an exercise of the intellect are most powerful of all.</p>

            <p>As you write poetry you are forced to think in creative and mind-bending ways. The poet is a person who makes unusual connections. Anybody can see a black dog in a white collar, but a poet sees a priest dressed in black, wearing a white collar that binds him and liberates him all at once. He sees a black dog who serves a white God which is “dog” backwards and knows the priest is both a black dog and a backward god at once. This is why the poets were always also jesters. They were jokers. Like comedians, they saw connections nobody else saw, and as they made those connections the perceptions of their audience were opened up, “Aha!” and they saw the world, truth and beauty in a fresh and startling way.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Poetry is emotional. It engages that organ which is most underused in academia—the heart. Reading poetry is not simply about understanding the rhyme scheme of an Alexandrian sonnet or being able to write a paper on the theological conceits of the metaphysical poets. A poem is first and foremost an expression of emotion. You have to engage your feelings when you read a poem or you haven’t read the poem. This is important because academia wants you to be objective and scientific all the time. The poet proclaims, “Forget the science already! We want passion, not pie charts!” While poetry engages your emotions it does so in a rational and structured way. Poetry is smart. It does a formal dance around the emotions and engages them while also engaging your brain. Emotion on its own is mere sentimentality. Emotion in classical poetry fuses the intellect with emotion in a high and noble human experience.</p>

            <p>As you write poetry you are forced to think in creative and mind-bending ways. The poet is a person who makes unusual connections. Anybody can see a black dog in a white collar, but a poet sees a priest dressed in black, wearing a white collar that binds him and liberates him all at once. He sees a black dog who serves a white God which is “dog” backwards and knows the priest is both a black dog and a backward god at once. This is why the poets were always also jesters. They were jokers. Like comedians, they saw connections nobody else saw, and as they made those connections the perceptions of their audience were opened up, “Aha!” and they saw the world, truth and beauty in a fresh and startling way.</p>

              <strong>Extract A</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Poetry is emotional. It engages that organ which is most underused in academia—the heart. Reading poetry is not simply about understanding the rhyme scheme of an Alexandrian sonnet or being able to write a paper on the theological conceits of the metaphysical poets. A poem is first and foremost an expression of emotion. You have to engage your feelings when you read a poem or you haven’t read the poem. This is important because academia wants you to be objective and scientific all the time. The poet proclaims, “Forget the science already! We want passion, not pie charts!” While poetry engages your emotions it does so in a rational and structured way. Poetry is smart. It does a formal dance around the emotions and engages them while also engaging your brain. Emotion on its own is mere sentimentality. Emotion in classical poetry fuses the intellect with emotion in a high and noble human experience.</p>

              <strong>Extract B</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Reading poetry is good for you because it stretches your imagination. To understand a poem you have to step outside your narrow little world and see the world from a new perspective. The poet makes connections that nobody else makes and to understand them, you must get your mind out of a rut and double check your understanding of reality. What did Emily Dickinson see when she observed, “A narrow fellow in the grass occasionally rides…?” Oh, I see! It’s a snake. Or is it? As your imagination is stretched your perception of reality widens out. Things are not what they seem. They are more than what you thought they were, and this shake up of your preconceptions is what education is all about.</p>

              <strong>Extract C</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Just as in reading poetry, writing poetry puts you in touch with your emotions. You must write a poem about something you are passionate about. As you do, you are forced to examine your emotions and express them in a way which not only communicates a message, but also the emotion of the message. The final couplet or stanza should bring the reader to an “Aha!” moment in which enlightenment and emotion are fused. That’s hard to do, but as you learn to do it you learn to work with emotion and manage it, rather than simply being swept up by the emotions of the moment. Thus, you learn that channeled emotions are far stronger, long lasting and effective than the mere sweep of overwhelming feeling. Emotions that are fused with an exercise of the intellect are most powerful of all.</p>

          <strong>Pippi Longstocking&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Astrid Lindgren&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘What shall we do now?’ Tommy asked.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘I don’t know what you’re thinking of doing,’ Pippi said. ‘But <span class="txt-underline"><strong>I’m not the kind to put my feet up</strong></span>. I am, in fact, a thing-finder, and thing-finders never get a minute’s rest.’</p>
        <p>‘What did you say you were?’ asked Annika.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘A thing-finder.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘What’s that?’ asked Tommy.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Someone who finds things, of course! What else could it be?’ said Pippi, as she swept all the flour on the floor into a small pile. ‘The whole world is full of things and there’s a crying need for someone to find them. And that’s just what a thing-finder does.’</p>
        <p>‘What kind of things?’ asked Annika.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Oh, all sorts,’ said Pippi. ‘Clumps of gold, ostrich feathers, dead rats, teeny-weeny nuts and bolts. Stuff like that.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Tommy and Annika thought it sounded good fun and they really wanted to be thingfinders too. Although Tommy said he’d rather find a clump of gold than a dead rat.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘We’ll have to see what turns up,’ said Pippi. ‘Something always does. But let’s get a move on in case any other thing-finders come along and make off with all the clumps of gold around here.’</p>
        <p>The three thing-finders set off. They thought it was best to start looking among the houses close by, because Pippi said that even if it was perfectly possible to find a little nail or bolt in the middle of a forest, the best things were actually found close to where people lived.</p>
        <p>‘But on the other hand,’ she said. ‘I have seen examples of quite the opposite. I remember the time I was looking for things in the jungles of Borneo. Right in the very middle of the rain forest, where no-one had ever set foot before, what do you think I found? I’ll tell you: a very fine wooden leg. I gave it away later to an old man with only one leg, and he said you couldn’t buy such a fine wooden leg even if you had heaps of money.’</p>
        <p>Tommy and Annika watched Pippi closely to see how a thing-finder behaved. Pippi ran from one side of the road to the other, shaded her eyes with her hand, and looked and looked. Sometimes she crawled on her knees, stuck her hand through fences and said disappointedly:</p>
        <p>‘Odd! I was absolutely sure I saw a clump of gold.’</p>
        <p>‘Can we really take everything we find?’ asked Annika.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Yes, everything that’s lying on the ground,’ said Pippi.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Further down the road an elderly gent was sleeping on the lawn outside his house.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘He’s lying on the ground,’ Pippi said. ‘And we’ve found him. Let’s have ‘im!’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Tommy and Annika were flabbergasted.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘No, no, Pippi, we can’t take an old man, we just can’t.’ said Tommy. ‘What do we want him for, anyway?’</p>
        <p>‘What do we want him for? We could use him for lots of things. We could put him in&nbsp;a little rabbit hutch instead of a rabbit and feed him dandelion leaves. But if you’d rather not, well, that’s fine by me. But it really annoys me to think another thing-finder might come along and pinch him.’</p>
        <p>They walked on. All of a sudden Pippi gave an ear-splitting yell.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Oh, I’ve never seen anything like this!’ she shouted, picking up a rusty old tin from the grass. ‘What a find! What a <em>find</em>! You can never have too many tins.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Tommy looked at the tin doubtfully and said: ‘What can you use <em>that </em>for?’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Oh, you can use it for lots of things,’ Pippi said. ‘You could put biscuits in it, for one thing. Then it would be one of those nice Tins For Biscuits. On the other hand, you don’t have to put biscuits in it, and then it will be one of those Tins Not For Biscuits. It’s not quite so nice, mind you, but that’s all right too.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She studied the tin, which really was very rusty indeed and also had a hole in the bottom.</p>
        <p>‘This almost looks as if it’s a Tin Not For Biscuits,’ she said thoughtfully. ‘But you can always plonk it over your head and pretend it’s the middle of the night.’</p>
        <p>So she did. With the tin over her head she walked along like a little metal tower and didn’t stop until she fell over a fence and onto her stomach. There was loud crash as the tin hit the ground.</p>
        <p>‘There, you see,’ said Pippi, taking off the tin. ‘If I hadn’t had that on my head I would have fallen flat on my face and bashed myself silly.’</p>
        <p>‘But,’ said Annika. ‘If you hadn’t had the tin on your head you wouldn’t have tripped over the fence in the first place.’</p>
        <p>Just as Annika finished speaking Pippi gave another yelp and triumphantly held up an empty cotton reel.</p>
        <p>‘It must be my lucky day today,’ she said. ‘Such a dear, sweet little cotton reel to blow bubbles with or hang on a piece of string and have as a necklace! I want to go home and do it this very minute.’</p>

          <strong>Pippi Longstocking&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Astrid Lindgren&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘What shall we do now?’ Tommy asked.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘I don’t know what you’re thinking of doing,’ Pippi said. ‘But <span class="txt-underline"><strong>I’m not the kind to put my feet up</strong></span>. I am, in fact, a thing-finder, and thing-finders never get a minute’s rest.’</p>
        <p>‘What did you say you were?’ asked Annika.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘A thing-finder.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘What’s that?’ asked Tommy.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Someone who finds things, of course! What else could it be?’ said Pippi, as she swept all the flour on the floor into a small pile. ‘The whole world is full of things and there’s a crying need for someone to find them. And that’s just what a thing-finder does.’</p>
        <p>‘What kind of things?’ asked Annika.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Oh, all sorts,’ said Pippi. ‘Clumps of gold, ostrich feathers, dead rats, teeny-weeny nuts and bolts. Stuff like that.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Tommy and Annika thought it sounded good fun and they really wanted to be thingfinders too. Although Tommy said he’d rather find a clump of gold than a dead rat.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘We’ll have to see what turns up,’ said Pippi. ‘Something always does. But let’s get a move on in case any other thing-finders come along and make off with all the clumps of gold around here.’</p>
        <p>The three thing-finders set off. They thought it was best to start looking among the houses close by, because Pippi said that even if it was perfectly possible to find a little nail or bolt in the middle of a forest, the best things were actually found close to where people lived.</p>
        <p>‘But on the other hand,’ she said. ‘I have seen examples of quite the opposite. I remember the time I was looking for things in the jungles of Borneo. Right in the very middle of the rain forest, where no-one had ever set foot before, what do you think I found? I’ll tell you: a very fine wooden leg. I gave it away later to an old man with only one leg, and he said you couldn’t buy such a fine wooden leg even if you had heaps of money.’</p>
        <p>Tommy and Annika watched Pippi closely to see how a thing-finder behaved. Pippi ran from one side of the road to the other, shaded her eyes with her hand, and looked and looked. Sometimes she crawled on her knees, stuck her hand through fences and said disappointedly:</p>
        <p>‘Odd! I was absolutely sure I saw a clump of gold.’</p>
        <p>‘Can we really take everything we find?’ asked Annika.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Yes, everything that’s lying on the ground,’ said Pippi.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Further down the road an elderly gent was sleeping on the lawn outside his house.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘He’s lying on the ground,’ Pippi said. ‘And we’ve found him. Let’s have ‘im!’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Tommy and Annika were flabbergasted.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘No, no, Pippi, we can’t take an old man, we just can’t.’ said Tommy. ‘What do we want him for, anyway?’</p>
        <p>‘What do we want him for? We could use him for lots of things. We could put him in&nbsp;a little rabbit hutch instead of a rabbit and feed him dandelion leaves. But if you’d rather not, well, that’s fine by me. But it really annoys me to think another thing-finder might come along and pinch him.’</p>
        <p>They walked on. All of a sudden Pippi gave an ear-splitting yell.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Oh, I’ve never seen anything like this!’ she shouted, picking up a rusty old tin from the grass. ‘What a find! What a <em>find</em>! You can never have too many tins.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Tommy looked at the tin doubtfully and said: ‘What can you use <em>that </em>for?’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Oh, you can use it for lots of things,’ Pippi said. ‘You could put biscuits in it, for one thing. Then it would be one of those nice Tins For Biscuits. On the other hand, you don’t have to put biscuits in it, and then it will be one of those Tins Not For Biscuits. It’s not quite so nice, mind you, but that’s all right too.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She studied the tin, which really was very rusty indeed and also had a hole in the bottom.</p>
        <p>‘This almost looks as if it’s a Tin Not For Biscuits,’ she said thoughtfully. ‘But you can always plonk it over your head and pretend it’s the middle of the night.’</p>
        <p>So she did. With the tin over her head she walked along like a little metal tower and didn’t stop until she fell over a fence and onto her stomach. There was loud crash as the tin hit the ground.</p>
        <p>‘There, you see,’ said Pippi, taking off the tin. ‘If I hadn’t had that on my head I would have fallen flat on my face and bashed myself silly.’</p>
        <p>‘But,’ said Annika. ‘If you hadn’t had the tin on your head you wouldn’t have tripped over the fence in the first place.’</p>
        <p>Just as Annika finished speaking Pippi gave another yelp and triumphantly held up an empty cotton reel.</p>
        <p>‘It must be my lucky day today,’ she said. ‘Such a dear, sweet little cotton reel to blow bubbles with or hang on a piece of string and have as a necklace! I want to go home and do it this very minute.’</p>

          <strong>Pippi Longstocking&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Astrid Lindgren&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘What shall we do now?’ Tommy asked.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘I don’t know what you’re thinking of doing,’ Pippi said. ‘But <span class="txt-underline"><strong>I’m not the kind to put my feet up</strong></span>. I am, in fact, a thing-finder, and thing-finders never get a minute’s rest.’</p>
        <p>‘What did you say you were?’ asked Annika.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘A thing-finder.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘What’s that?’ asked Tommy.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Someone who finds things, of course! What else could it be?’ said Pippi, as she swept all the flour on the floor into a small pile. ‘The whole world is full of things and there’s a crying need for someone to find them. And that’s just what a thing-finder does.’</p>
        <p>‘What kind of things?’ asked Annika.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Oh, all sorts,’ said Pippi. ‘Clumps of gold, ostrich feathers, dead rats, teeny-weeny nuts and bolts. Stuff like that.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Tommy and Annika thought it sounded good fun and they really wanted to be thingfinders too. Although Tommy said he’d rather find a clump of gold than a dead rat.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘We’ll have to see what turns up,’ said Pippi. ‘Something always does. But let’s get a move on in case any other thing-finders come along and make off with all the clumps of gold around here.’</p>
        <p>The three thing-finders set off. They thought it was best to start looking among the houses close by, because Pippi said that even if it was perfectly possible to find a little nail or bolt in the middle of a forest, the best things were actually found close to where people lived.</p>
        <p>‘But on the other hand,’ she said. ‘I have seen examples of quite the opposite. I remember the time I was looking for things in the jungles of Borneo. Right in the very middle of the rain forest, where no-one had ever set foot before, what do you think I found? I’ll tell you: a very fine wooden leg. I gave it away later to an old man with only one leg, and he said you couldn’t buy such a fine wooden leg even if you had heaps of money.’</p>
        <p>Tommy and Annika watched Pippi closely to see how a thing-finder behaved. Pippi ran from one side of the road to the other, shaded her eyes with her hand, and looked and looked. Sometimes she crawled on her knees, stuck her hand through fences and said disappointedly:</p>
        <p>‘Odd! I was absolutely sure I saw a clump of gold.’</p>
        <p>‘Can we really take everything we find?’ asked Annika.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Yes, everything that’s lying on the ground,’ said Pippi.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Further down the road an elderly gent was sleeping on the lawn outside his house.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘He’s lying on the ground,’ Pippi said. ‘And we’ve found him. Let’s have ‘im!’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Tommy and Annika were flabbergasted.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘No, no, Pippi, we can’t take an old man, we just can’t.’ said Tommy. ‘What do we want him for, anyway?’</p>
        <p>‘What do we want him for? We could use him for lots of things. We could put him in&nbsp;a little rabbit hutch instead of a rabbit and feed him dandelion leaves. But if you’d rather not, well, that’s fine by me. But it really annoys me to think another thing-finder might come along and pinch him.’</p>
        <p>They walked on. All of a sudden Pippi gave an ear-splitting yell.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Oh, I’ve never seen anything like this!’ she shouted, picking up a rusty old tin from the grass. ‘What a find! What a <em>find</em>! You can never have too many tins.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Tommy looked at the tin doubtfully and said: ‘What can you use <em>that </em>for?’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Oh, you can use it for lots of things,’ Pippi said. ‘You could put biscuits in it, for one thing. Then it would be one of those nice Tins For Biscuits. On the other hand, you don’t have to put biscuits in it, and then it will be one of those Tins Not For Biscuits. It’s not quite so nice, mind you, but that’s all right too.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She studied the tin, which really was very rusty indeed and also had a hole in the bottom.</p>
        <p>‘This almost looks as if it’s a Tin Not For Biscuits,’ she said thoughtfully. ‘But you can always plonk it over your head and pretend it’s the middle of the night.’</p>
        <p>So she did. With the tin over her head she walked along like a little metal tower and didn’t stop until she fell over a fence and onto her stomach. There was loud crash as the tin hit the ground.</p>
        <p>‘There, you see,’ said Pippi, taking off the tin. ‘If I hadn’t had that on my head I would have fallen flat on my face and bashed myself silly.’</p>
        <p>‘But,’ said Annika. ‘If you hadn’t had the tin on your head you wouldn’t have tripped over the fence in the first place.’</p>
        <p>Just as Annika finished speaking Pippi gave another yelp and triumphantly held up an empty cotton reel.</p>
        <p>‘It must be my lucky day today,’ she said. ‘Such a dear, sweet little cotton reel to blow bubbles with or hang on a piece of string and have as a necklace! I want to go home and do it this very minute.’</p>
