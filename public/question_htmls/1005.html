I was obsessed with “picture perfect”,&nbsp;<br>
I searched the world inside and out,&nbsp;<br>
For a single moment I could say,&nbsp;<br>
Is what life’s all about,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My life was viewed through lenses,&nbsp;<br>
My camera a medal worn with pride,&nbsp;<br>
I thought it held the moments,&nbsp;<br>
That I’d always keep inside,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But looking back at photos,&nbsp;<br>
I can’t remember how I felt,&nbsp;<br>
The noises that the world made,&nbsp;<br>
Or the way the warm air smelt,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I don’t remember how the day was,&nbsp;<br>
If it was going good or bad,&nbsp;<br>
<span class="txt-underline"><strong>I’ve just a snapshot of a moment,<br>
That nobody even had,&nbsp;</strong></span><br>
<br>
So I gave away my camera,<br>
And now use my eyes instead,&nbsp;<br>
To take photos for the scrapbook,&nbsp;<br>
That I’ve made inside my head,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I always thought my photos,&nbsp;<br>
Were ways to make my memories last,&nbsp;<br>
But you remember life much better,&nbsp;<br>
When you don’t view it all through glass.</p>

          <strong>Fantastic Benefits of Arts and Crafts for Kids&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>In this day and age, many parents resort to technology in order to keep their kids entertained and occupied, completely forgetting the benefits of arts and crafts. True, technology is very useful, and kids should be introduced to it, but it should never come at the expense of them playing and making things with their own hands.<strong> 12 ………. </strong>and here are some of them.<br>
<br>
<strong>It improves their coordination and fine motor skills.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Arts and crafts usually require kids to use both hands in a certain manner, which can help them develop fine motor skills and bilateral coordination. <strong>13 ……….</strong> – and kids enjoy doing them. This can help them develop faster and become more skilled in other daily activities such as tying their shoes, dressing, using kitchenware, etc.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>It helps them express themselves.&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>Kids tend to be very visual about everything that happens around them, and they generally absorb a lot of information every day. <strong>14 ………. </strong>Those kids may look for different, more visual ways to express their emotions and thoughts – and arts and crafts can give them what they need. It is a safe environment that they can control and shape in any way they want by using any materials they like. <strong>15 ……….<br>
<br>
It makes them more creative and productive.&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>There are no limits to children’s imagination, and arts and crafts are a great way for them to turn that endless imagination into something more productive. <strong>16 ………. </strong>which allows children to explore different options and pick those that they find the most enjoyable. And who knows, they might even discover a fun hobby, like drawing, that can later become a lucrative career, like graphic design.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>It helps them develop other skills.&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>Young kids usually begin using pens by scribbling random things. However, the thing is, the more they scribble, the better they will be at controlling the pen and their movements across the paper. <strong>17 ……….</strong> In other words, the more they scribble, the faster they’ll master everything they need in order to write clearly. Also, you can encourage scribbling by giving them colorful gel pens—scribbling with such fun pens will make them want to do it all the time!</p>

<strong>It helps them develop other skills.&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>Young kids usually begin using pens by scribbling random things. However, the thing is, the more they scribble, the better they will be at controlling the pen and their movements across the paper. <strong>17 ……….</strong> In other words, the more they scribble, the faster they’ll master everything they need in order to write clearly. Also, you can encourage scribbling by giving them colorful gel pens—scribbling with such fun pens will make them want to do it all the time!</p>

          <strong>Fantastic Benefits of Arts and Crafts for Kids&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>In this day and age, many parents resort to technology in order to keep their kids entertained and occupied, completely forgetting the benefits of arts and crafts. True, technology is very useful, and kids should be introduced to it, but it should never come at the expense of them playing and making things with their own hands.<strong> 12 ………. </strong>and here are some of them.<br>
<br>
<strong>It improves their coordination and fine motor skills.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Arts and crafts usually require kids to use both hands in a certain manner, which can help them develop fine motor skills and bilateral coordination. <strong>13 ……….</strong> – and kids enjoy doing them. This can help them develop faster and become more skilled in other daily activities such as tying their shoes, dressing, using kitchenware, etc.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>It helps them express themselves.&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>Kids tend to be very visual about everything that happens around them, and they generally absorb a lot of information every day. <strong>14 ………. </strong>Those kids may look for different, more visual ways to express their emotions and thoughts – and arts and crafts can give them what they need. It is a safe environment that they can control and shape in any way they want by using any materials they like. <strong>15 ……….<br>
<br>
It makes them more creative and productive.&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>There are no limits to children’s imagination, and arts and crafts are a great way for them to turn that endless imagination into something more productive. <strong>16 ………. </strong>which allows children to explore different options and pick those that they find the most enjoyable. And who knows, they might even discover a fun hobby, like drawing, that can later become a lucrative career, like graphic design.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>It helps them develop other skills.&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>Young kids usually begin using pens by scribbling random things. However, the thing is, the more they scribble, the better they will be at controlling the pen and their movements across the paper. <strong>17 ……….</strong> In other words, the more they scribble, the faster they’ll master everything they need in order to write clearly.

          <strong>Fantastic Benefits of Arts and Crafts for Kids&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>In this day and age, many parents resort to technology in order to keep their kids entertained and occupied, completely forgetting the benefits of arts and crafts. True, technology is very useful, and kids should be introduced to it, but it should never come at the expense of them playing and making things with their own hands.<strong> 12 ………. </strong>and here are some of them.<br>
<br>
<strong>It improves their coordination and fine motor skills.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Arts and crafts usually require kids to use both hands in a certain manner, which can help them develop fine motor skills and bilateral coordination. <strong>13 ……….</strong> – and kids enjoy doing them. This can help them develop faster and become more skilled in other daily activities such as tying their shoes, dressing, using kitchenware, etc.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>It helps them express themselves.&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>Kids tend to be very visual about everything that happens around them, and they generally absorb a lot of information every day. <strong>14 ………. </strong>Those kids may look for different, more visual ways to express their emotions and thoughts – and arts and crafts can give them what they need. It is a safe environment that they can control and shape in any way they want by using any materials they like. <strong>15 ……….<br>
<br>
It makes them more creative and productive.&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>There are no limits to children’s imagination, and arts and crafts are a great way for them to turn that endless imagination into something more productive. <strong>16 ………. </strong>which allows children to explore different options and pick those that they find the most enjoyable. And who knows, they might even discover a fun hobby, like drawing, that can later become a lucrative career, like graphic design.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>It helps them develop other skills.&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>Young kids usually begin using pens by scribbling random things. However, the thing is, the more they scribble, the better they will be at controlling the pen and their movements across the paper. <strong>17 ……….</strong> In other words, the more they scribble, the faster they’ll master everything they need in order to write clearly. Also, you can encourage scribbling by giving them colorful gel pens—scribbling with such fun pens will make them want to do it all the time!</p>

          <strong>Fantastic Benefits of Arts and Crafts for Kids&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>In this day and age, many parents resort to technology in order to keep their kids entertained and occupied, completely forgetting the benefits of arts and crafts. True, technology is very useful, and kids should be introduced to it, but it should never come at the expense of them playing and making things with their own hands.<strong> 12 ………. </strong>and here are some of them.<br>
<br>
<strong>It improves their coordination and fine motor skills.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Arts and crafts usually require kids to use both hands in a certain manner, which can help them develop fine motor skills and bilateral coordination. <strong>13 ……….</strong> – and kids enjoy doing them. This can help them develop faster and become more skilled in other daily activities such as tying their shoes, dressing, using kitchenware, etc.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>It helps them express themselves.&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>Kids tend to be very visual about everything that happens around them, and they generally absorb a lot of information every day. <strong>14 ………. </strong>Those kids may look for different, more visual ways to express their emotions and thoughts – and arts and crafts can give them what they need. It is a safe environment that they can control and shape in any way they want by using any materials they like. <strong>15 ……….<br>
<br>
It makes them more creative and productive.&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>There are no limits to children’s imagination, and arts and crafts are a great way for them to turn that endless imagination into something more productive. <strong>16 ………. </strong>which allows children to explore different options and pick those that they find the most enjoyable. And who knows, they might even discover a fun hobby, like drawing, that can later become a lucrative career, like graphic design.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>It helps them develop other skills.&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>Young kids usually begin using pens by scribbling random things. However, the thing is, the more they scribble, the better they will be at controlling the pen and their movements across the paper. <strong>17 ……….</strong> In other words, the more they scribble, the faster they’ll master everything they need in order to write clearly. Also, you can encourage scribbling by giving them colorful gel pens—scribbling with such fun pens will make them want to do it all the time!</p>

Parramatta is a major commercial suburb and centre in Greater Western Sydney, located in the state of New South Wales, Australia. It is located approximately 24 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district on the banks of the Parramatta River. Parramatta is the administrative seat of the local government area of the City of Parramatta and is often regarded as the main commercial centre and the central business district for the broader Greater Western Sydney region. Parramatta also has a long history as a second administrative centre in the Sydney metropolitan region, playing host to a number of state government departments as well as a registry for federal courts.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong> ^}&nbsp;<br>
Radiocarbon dating suggests human activity occurred in Parramatta from around 30,000 years ago. The Darug people who lived in the area before European settlement regarded the area as rich in food from the river and forests. They called the area Baramada or Burramatta ('Parramatta') which means "head of waters", "the place where the eels lie down" or "eel waters". To this day many eels and other sea creatures are attracted to nutrients that are concentrated where the saltwater of Port Jackson meets the freshwater of the Parramatta River. The Parramatta Eels Rugby League club chose their symbol as a result of this phenomenon.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}&nbsp;<br>
Parramatta was founded in 1788, the same year as Sydney. As such, Parramatta is the second oldest city in Australia, being only 10 months younger than Sydney. The British Colonists, who had arrived in January 1788 on the First Fleet at Sydney Cove, had only enough food to support themselves for a short time and the soil around Sydney Cove proved too poor to grow the amount of food that 1,000 convicts, soldiers and administrators needed to survive. During 1788, Governor Arthur Phillip had reconnoitred several places before choosing Parramatta as the most likely place for a successful large farm. Parramatta was the furthest navigable point inland on the Parramatta River (i.e. furthest from the thin, sandy coastal soil) and also the point at which the river became freshwater and therefore useful for farming.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}&nbsp;<br>
In an attempt to deal with the food crisis, Phillip in 1789 granted a convict named James Ruse the land of Experiment Farm at Parramatta on the condition that he develop a viable agriculture. There, Ruse became the first person to successfully grow grain in Australia. The Parramatta area was also the site of the pioneering of the Australian wool industry by John Macarthur's Elizabeth Farm in the 1790s. Philip Gidley King's account of his visit to Parramatta on 9 April 1790 is one of the earliest descriptions of the area. Walking four miles with Governor Phillip to Prospect, he saw undulating grassland interspersed with magnificent trees and a great number of kangaroos and emus.<br>

Parramatta was founded in 1788, the same year as Sydney. As such, Parramatta is the second oldest city in Australia, being only 10 months younger than Sydney. The British Colonists, who had arrived in January 1788 on the First Fleet at Sydney Cove, had only enough food to support themselves for a short time and the soil around Sydney Cove proved too poor to grow the amount of food that 1,000 convicts, soldiers and administrators needed to survive. During 1788, Governor Arthur Phillip had reconnoitred several places before choosing Parramatta as the most likely place for a successful large farm. Parramatta was the furthest navigable point inland on the Parramatta River (i.e. furthest from the thin, sandy coastal soil) and also the point at which the river became freshwater and therefore useful for farming.<br>

In an attempt to deal with the food crisis, Phillip in 1789 granted a convict named James Ruse the land of Experiment Farm at Parramatta on the condition that he develop a viable agriculture. There, Ruse became the first person to successfully grow grain in Australia. The Parramatta area was also the site of the pioneering of the Australian wool industry by John Macarthur's Elizabeth Farm in the 1790s. Philip Gidley King's account of his visit to Parramatta on 9 April 1790 is one of the earliest descriptions of the area. Walking four miles with Governor Phillip to Prospect, he saw undulating grassland interspersed with magnificent trees and a great number of kangaroos and emus.<br>

Parramatta is a major commercial suburb and centre in Greater Western Sydney, located in the state of New South Wales, Australia. It is located approximately 24 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district on the banks of the Parramatta River. Parramatta is the administrative seat of the local government area of the City of Parramatta and is often regarded as the main commercial centre and the central business district for the broader Greater Western Sydney region. Parramatta also has a long history as a second administrative centre in the Sydney metropolitan region, playing host to a number of state government departments as well as a registry for federal courts.<br>

Radiocarbon dating suggests human activity occurred in Parramatta from around 30,000 years ago. The Darug people who lived in the area before European settlement regarded the area as rich in food from the river and forests. They called the area Baramada or Burramatta ('Parramatta') which means "head of waters", "the place where the eels lie down" or "eel waters". To this day many eels and other sea creatures are attracted to nutrients that are concentrated where the saltwater of Port Jackson meets the freshwater of the Parramatta River. The Parramatta Eels Rugby League club chose their symbol as a result of this phenomenon.<br>

<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}&nbsp;<br>
Radiocarbon dating suggests human activity occurred in Parramatta from around 30,000 years ago. The Darug people who lived in the area before European settlement regarded the area as rich in food from the river and forests. They called the area Baramada or Burramatta ('Parramatta') which means "head of waters", "the place where the eels lie down" or "eel waters". To this day many eels and other sea creatures are attracted to nutrients that are concentrated where the saltwater of Port Jackson meets the freshwater of the Parramatta River. The Parramatta Eels Rugby League club chose their symbol as a result of this phenomenon.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}&nbsp;<br>
Parramatta was founded in 1788, the same year as Sydney. As such, Parramatta is the second oldest city in Australia, being only 10 months younger than Sydney. The British Colonists, who had arrived in January 1788 on the First Fleet at Sydney Cove, had only enough food to support themselves for a short time and the soil around Sydney Cove proved too poor to grow the amount of food that 1,000 convicts, soldiers and administrators needed to survive. During 1788, Governor Arthur Phillip had reconnoitred several places before choosing Parramatta as the most likely place for a successful large farm. Parramatta was the furthest navigable point inland on the Parramatta River (i.e. furthest from the thin, sandy coastal soil) and also the point at which the river became freshwater and therefore useful for farming.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}&nbsp;<br>
In an attempt to deal with the food crisis, Phillip in 1789 granted a convict named James Ruse the land of Experiment Farm at Parramatta on the condition that he develop a viable agriculture. There, Ruse became the first person to successfully grow grain in Australia. The Parramatta area was also the site of the pioneering of the Australian wool industry by John Macarthur's Elizabeth Farm in the 1790s. Philip Gidley King's account of his visit to Parramatta on 9 April 1790 is one of the earliest descriptions of the area. Walking four miles with Governor Phillip to Prospect, he saw undulating grassland interspersed with magnificent trees and a great number of kangaroos and emus.<br>

Dolphins, and other mammals, are warm-blooded, give birth to live young, nurse their young, are born with hair and breathe air. Sharks, like other fish, have gills to remove oxygen from the water, are cold-blooded and have scales. Sharks are also what are known as cartilaginous fish, meaning their skeletons are made of cartilage (like our ears and noses) rather than dense bones of dolphins and the human skeleton. Sharks are part of the elasmobranch family, while dolphins are part of the cetacean family.</div>
