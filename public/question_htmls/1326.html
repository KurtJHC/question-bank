          <strong>Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>by J. K. Rowling&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon’s car and crushed it into a trash can -- but at the moment it didn’t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils. “Make it move,” he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn’t budge. “Do it again,” Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on. “This is boring,” Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn’t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself – no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry’s. It winked. Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren’t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: “I get that all the time.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I know,” Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn’t sure the snake could hear him. “It must be really annoying.” The snake nodded vigorously. “Where do you come from, anyway?” Harry asked. The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it. Boa Constrictor, Brazil. “Was it nice there?” The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. “Oh, I see -- so you’ve never been to Brazil?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of&nbsp;them jump. “DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU&nbsp;WON’T BELIEVE WHAT IT’S DOING!”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dudley came <strong><span class="txt-underline">waddling</span></strong>&nbsp;toward them as fast as he could. “Out of the way, you,” he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened -- one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor’s tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits. As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, “Brazil, here I come.... Thanksss, amigo.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. “But the glass,” he kept saying, “where did the glass go?” The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologised over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn’t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, “Harry was talking to it, weren’t you, Harry?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, “Go -- cupboard -- stay -- no meals,” before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.</p>

Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon’s car and crushed it into a trash can -- but at the moment it didn’t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils. “Make it move,” he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn’t budge. “Do it again,” Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on. “This is boring,” Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn’t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself – no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry’s. It winked. Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren’t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: “I get that all the time.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I know,” Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn’t sure the snake could hear him. “It must be really annoying.” The snake nodded vigorously. “Where do you come from, anyway?” Harry asked. The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it. Boa Constrictor, Brazil. “Was it nice there?” The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. “Oh, I see -- so you’ve never been to Brazil?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of&nbsp;them jump. “DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU&nbsp;WON’T BELIEVE WHAT IT’S DOING!”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dudley came <strong><span class="txt-underline">waddling</span></strong>&nbsp;toward them as fast as he could. “Out of the way, you,” he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened -- one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor’s tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits. As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, “Brazil, here I come.... Thanksss, amigo.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. “But the glass,” he kept saying, “where did the glass go?” The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologised over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn’t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, “Harry was talking to it, weren’t you, Harry?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, “Go -- cupboard -- stay -- no meals,” before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.</p>

          <strong>Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>by J. K. Rowling&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon’s car and crushed it into a trash can -- but at the moment it didn’t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils. “Make it move,” he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn’t budge. “Do it again,” Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on. “This is boring,” Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn’t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself – no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry’s. It winked. Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren’t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: “I get that all the time.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I know,” Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn’t sure the snake could hear him. “It must be really annoying.” The snake nodded vigorously. “Where do you come from, anyway?” Harry asked. The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it. Boa Constrictor, Brazil. “Was it nice there?” The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. “Oh, I see -- so you’ve never been to Brazil?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of&nbsp;them jump. “DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU&nbsp;WON’T BELIEVE WHAT IT’S DOING!”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dudley came <strong><span class="txt-underline">waddling</span></strong>&nbsp;toward them as fast as he could. “Out of the way, you,” he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened -- one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor’s tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits. As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, “Brazil, here I come.... Thanksss, amigo.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. “But the glass,” he kept saying, “where did the glass go?” The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologised over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn’t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, “Harry was talking to it, weren’t you, Harry?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, “Go -- cupboard -- stay -- no meals,” before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.</p>

          <strong>Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>by J. K. Rowling&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon’s car and crushed it into a trash can -- but at the moment it didn’t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils. “Make it move,” he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn’t budge. “Do it again,” Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on. “This is boring,” Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn’t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself – no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry’s. It winked. Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren’t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: “I get that all the time.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I know,” Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn’t sure the snake could hear him. “It must be really annoying.” The snake nodded vigorously. “Where do you come from, anyway?” Harry asked. The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it. Boa Constrictor, Brazil. “Was it nice there?” The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. “Oh, I see -- so you’ve never been to Brazil?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of&nbsp;them jump. “DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU&nbsp;WON’T BELIEVE WHAT IT’S DOING!”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dudley came <strong><span class="txt-underline">waddling</span></strong>&nbsp;toward them as fast as he could. “Out of the way, you,” he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened -- one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor’s tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits. As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, “Brazil, here I come.... Thanksss, amigo.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. “But the glass,” he kept saying, “where did the glass go?” The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologised over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn’t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, “Harry was talking to it, weren’t you, Harry?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, “Go -- cupboard -- stay -- no meals,” before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.</p>

          <strong>Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>by J. K. Rowling&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon’s car and crushed it into a trash can -- but at the moment it didn’t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils. “Make it move,” he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn’t budge. “Do it again,” Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on. “This is boring,” Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn’t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself – no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry’s. It winked. Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren’t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: “I get that all the time.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I know,” Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn’t sure the snake could hear him. “It must be really annoying.” The snake nodded vigorously. “Where do you come from, anyway?” Harry asked. The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it. Boa Constrictor, Brazil. “Was it nice there?” The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. “Oh, I see -- so you’ve never been to Brazil?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of&nbsp;them jump. “DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU&nbsp;WON’T BELIEVE WHAT IT’S DOING!”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dudley came <strong><span class="txt-underline">waddling</span></strong>&nbsp;toward them as fast as he could. “Out of the way, you,” he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened -- one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor’s tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits. As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, “Brazil, here I come.... Thanksss, amigo.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. “But the glass,” he kept saying, “where did the glass go?” The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologised over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn’t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, “Harry was talking to it, weren’t you, Harry?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, “Go -- cupboard -- stay -- no meals,” before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.</p>

          <strong>Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>by J. K. Rowling&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon’s car and crushed it into a trash can -- but at the moment it didn’t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils. “Make it move,” he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn’t budge. “Do it again,” Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on. “This is boring,” Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn’t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself – no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry’s. It winked. Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren’t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: “I get that all the time.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I know,” Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn’t sure the snake could hear him. “It must be really annoying.” The snake nodded vigorously. “Where do you come from, anyway?” Harry asked. The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it. Boa Constrictor, Brazil. “Was it nice there?” The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. “Oh, I see -- so you’ve never been to Brazil?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of&nbsp;them jump. “DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU&nbsp;WON’T BELIEVE WHAT IT’S DOING!”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dudley came <strong><span class="txt-underline">waddling</span></strong>&nbsp;toward them as fast as he could. “Out of the way, you,” he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened -- one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor’s tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits. As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, “Brazil, here I come.... Thanksss, amigo.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. “But the glass,” he kept saying, “where did the glass go?” The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologised over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn’t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, “Harry was talking to it, weren’t you, Harry?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, “Go -- cupboard -- stay -- no meals,” before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.</p>

          <strong>Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>by J. K. Rowling&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon’s car and crushed it into a trash can -- but at the moment it didn’t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils. “Make it move,” he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn’t budge. “Do it again,” Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on. “This is boring,” Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn’t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself – no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry’s. It winked. Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren’t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: “I get that all the time.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I know,” Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn’t sure the snake could hear him. “It must be really annoying.” The snake nodded vigorously. “Where do you come from, anyway?” Harry asked. The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it. Boa Constrictor, Brazil. “Was it nice there?” The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. “Oh, I see -- so you’ve never been to Brazil?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of&nbsp;them jump. “DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU&nbsp;WON’T BELIEVE WHAT IT’S DOING!”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dudley came <strong><span class="txt-underline">waddling</span></strong>&nbsp;toward them as fast as he could. “Out of the way, you,” he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened -- one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor’s tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits. As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, “Brazil, here I come.... Thanksss, amigo.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. “But the glass,” he kept saying, “where did the glass go?” The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologised over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn’t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, “Harry was talking to it, weren’t you, Harry?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, “Go -- cupboard -- stay -- no meals,” before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.</p>

          <strong>A Sound of Thunder&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>by Ray Bradbury&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>Using a time machine, an organisation called Time Safari transports clients into the past to participate in hunting expeditions. A tourist Mr Eckels, together with tour guide, Travis, is visiting a prehistoric jungle in order to hunt a Tyrannosaurus Rex.</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The jungle was high and the jungle was broad. Sounds like music and flying tents filled the sky, and those were pterodactyls soaring with huge grey wings.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘I’ve hunted tiger, wild boar, buffalo, elephant, but now, this is it,’ said Eckels. ‘I’m shaking like a kid.’</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Ah,’ said Travis. Everyone stopped. Travis raised his hand. ‘Ahead,’ he whispered, ‘In the mist. There he is. There’s&nbsp;<strong><span class="txt-underline">his Royal Majesty</span></strong> now.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The jungle was wide and full of twitterings, rustlings, murmurs, and sighs. Suddenly, it all ceased, as if someone had shut a door. Silence. A sound of thunder. Out of the mist, one hundred yards away, came Tyrannosaurus Rex. ‘It,’ whispered Eckels, ‘It......’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Ssh!’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It came on great oiled, resilient, striding legs. It towered thirty feet above half of the trees, a great evil god, folding its delicate watchmaker’s claws close to its oily reptilian chest. Each lower leg was a piston, a thousand pounds of white bone, sunk in thick ropes of muscle, sheathed over in a gleam of pebbled skin like the armour of a terrible warrior. Each thigh was a ton of meat, ivory, and steel mesh. And from the great breathing cage of the upper body those two delicate arms dangled out front, arms with hands which might pick up and examine men like toys, while the snake neck coiled. And the head itself, a ton of sculptured stone, lifted easily upon the sky. Its mouth gaped, exposing a fence of teeth like daggers. Its eyes rolled, ostrich eggs, empty of all expression save hunger. It closed its mouth in a death grin. It ran, its pelvic bones crushing aside trees and bushes, its taloned feet clawing damp earth, leaving prints six inches deep wherever it settled its weight. It ran with a gliding ballet step, far too poised and balanced for its ten tons. It moved into a sunlit area warily, its beautifully reptilian hands feeling the air.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Why, why...,’ Eckels twitched his mouth, ‘It could reach up and grab the moon.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Ssh!’ Travis jerked angrily. ‘He hasn’t seen us yet.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘It can’t be killed.’ Eckels pronounced this verdict quietly, as if there could be no argument. He had weighed the evidence and this was his considered opinion. The rifle in his hands seemed like a toy gun. ‘We were fools to come. This is impossible.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Shut up!’ hissed Travis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Nightmare.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Turn around,’ commanded Travis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Walk quietly to the Machine. We’ll remit half your fee.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘I didn’t realise it would be this big,’ said Eckels. ‘I miscalculated, that’s all. And now I want out.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘It sees us!’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘There’s the red paint on its chest.’ The Tyrant Lizard raised itself. Its armoured flesh glittered like a thousand green coins. The coins, crusted with slime, steamed. In the slime, tiny insects wriggled, so that the entire body seemed to twitch and undulate, even while the monster itself did not move. It exhaled. The stink of raw flesh blew down the wilderness.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Get me out of here,’ said Eckels. ‘It was never like this before. I was always sure I’d come through alive. I had good guides, good safaris, and safety. This time, I figured wrong. I’ve met my match and admit it. This is too much for me to get hold of.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Don’t run,’ said Lesperance. ‘Turn around. Hide in the Machine.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Yes.’ Eckels seemed to be numb. He looked at his feet as if trying to make them move. He gave a grunt of helplessness.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Eckels!’ He took a few steps, blinking, shuffling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Not that way!’ The Monster, at the first motion, lunged forward with a terrible scream. It covered one hundred yards in six seconds. The rifles jerked up and blazed fire. A windstorm from the beast’s mouth engulfed them in the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>stench of slime and old blood</strong></span>. The Monster roared, teeth glittering with sun. The rifles cracked again, but their sound was lost in shriek and lizard thunder. The great level of the reptile’s tail swung up, lashed sideways. Trees exploded in clouds of leaf and branch. The Monster twitched its jeweller’s hands down to fondle at the men, to twist them in half, to crush them like berries, to cram them into its teeth and its screaming throat. Its boulder-stone eyes levelled with the men. They saw themselves mirrored. They fired at the metallic eyelids and the blazing black iris. Like a stone idol, like a mountain avalanche, Tyrannosaurus fell.</p>

          <strong>A Sound of Thunder&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>by Ray Bradbury&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>Using a time machine, an organisation called Time Safari transports clients into the past to participate in hunting expeditions. A tourist Mr Eckels, together with tour guide, Travis, is visiting a prehistoric jungle in order to hunt a Tyrannosaurus Rex.</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The jungle was high and the jungle was broad. Sounds like music and flying tents filled the sky, and those were pterodactyls soaring with huge grey wings.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘I’ve hunted tiger, wild boar, buffalo, elephant, but now, this is it,’ said Eckels. ‘I’m shaking like a kid.’</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Ah,’ said Travis. Everyone stopped. Travis raised his hand. ‘Ahead,’ he whispered, ‘In the mist. There he is. There’s&nbsp;<strong><span class="txt-underline">his Royal Majesty</span></strong> now.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The jungle was wide and full of twitterings, rustlings, murmurs, and sighs. Suddenly, it all ceased, as if someone had shut a door. Silence. A sound of thunder. Out of the mist, one hundred yards away, came Tyrannosaurus Rex. ‘It,’ whispered Eckels, ‘It......’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Ssh!’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It came on great oiled, resilient, striding legs. It towered thirty feet above half of the trees, a great evil god, folding its delicate watchmaker’s claws close to its oily reptilian chest. Each lower leg was a piston, a thousand pounds of white bone, sunk in thick ropes of muscle, sheathed over in a gleam of pebbled skin like the armour of a terrible warrior. Each thigh was a ton of meat, ivory, and steel mesh. And from the great breathing cage of the upper body those two delicate arms dangled out front, arms with hands which might pick up and examine men like toys, while the snake neck coiled. And the head itself, a ton of sculptured stone, lifted easily upon the sky. Its mouth gaped, exposing a fence of teeth like daggers. Its eyes rolled, ostrich eggs, empty of all expression save hunger. It closed its mouth in a death grin. It ran, its pelvic bones crushing aside trees and bushes, its taloned feet clawing damp earth, leaving prints six inches deep wherever it settled its weight. It ran with a gliding ballet step, far too poised and balanced for its ten tons. It moved into a sunlit area warily, its beautifully reptilian hands feeling the air.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Why, why...,’ Eckels twitched his mouth, ‘It could reach up and grab the moon.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Ssh!’ Travis jerked angrily. ‘He hasn’t seen us yet.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘It can’t be killed.’ Eckels pronounced this verdict quietly, as if there could be no argument. He had weighed the evidence and this was his considered opinion. The rifle in his hands seemed like a toy gun. ‘We were fools to come. This is impossible.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Shut up!’ hissed Travis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Nightmare.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Turn around,’ commanded Travis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Walk quietly to the Machine. We’ll remit half your fee.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘I didn’t realise it would be this big,’ said Eckels. ‘I miscalculated, that’s all. And now I want out.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘It sees us!’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘There’s the red paint on its chest.’ The Tyrant Lizard raised itself. Its armoured flesh glittered like a thousand green coins. The coins, crusted with slime, steamed. In the slime, tiny insects wriggled, so that the entire body seemed to twitch and undulate, even while the monster itself did not move. It exhaled. The stink of raw flesh blew down the wilderness.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Get me out of here,’ said Eckels. ‘It was never like this before. I was always sure I’d come through alive. I had good guides, good safaris, and safety. This time, I figured wrong. I’ve met my match and admit it. This is too much for me to get hold of.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Don’t run,’ said Lesperance. ‘Turn around. Hide in the Machine.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Yes.’ Eckels seemed to be numb. He looked at his feet as if trying to make them move. He gave a grunt of helplessness.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Eckels!’ He took a few steps, blinking, shuffling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Not that way!’ The Monster, at the first motion, lunged forward with a terrible scream. It covered one hundred yards in six seconds. The rifles jerked up and blazed fire. A windstorm from the beast’s mouth engulfed them in the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>stench of slime and old blood</strong></span>. The Monster roared, teeth glittering with sun. The rifles cracked again, but their sound was lost in shriek and lizard thunder. The great level of the reptile’s tail swung up, lashed sideways. Trees exploded in clouds of leaf and branch. The Monster twitched its jeweller’s hands down to fondle at the men, to twist them in half, to crush them like berries, to cram them into its teeth and its screaming throat. Its boulder-stone eyes levelled with the men. They saw themselves mirrored. They fired at the metallic eyelids and the blazing black iris. Like a stone idol, like a mountain avalanche, Tyrannosaurus fell.</p>

          <strong>A Sound of Thunder&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>by Ray Bradbury&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>Using a time machine, an organisation called Time Safari transports clients into the past to participate in hunting expeditions. A tourist Mr Eckels, together with tour guide, Travis, is visiting a prehistoric jungle in order to hunt a Tyrannosaurus Rex.</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The jungle was high and the jungle was broad. Sounds like music and flying tents filled the sky, and those were pterodactyls soaring with huge grey wings.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘I’ve hunted tiger, wild boar, buffalo, elephant, but now, this is it,’ said Eckels. ‘I’m shaking like a kid.’</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Ah,’ said Travis. Everyone stopped. Travis raised his hand. ‘Ahead,’ he whispered, ‘In the mist. There he is. There’s&nbsp;<strong><span class="txt-underline">his Royal Majesty</span></strong> now.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The jungle was wide and full of twitterings, rustlings, murmurs, and sighs. Suddenly, it all ceased, as if someone had shut a door. Silence. A sound of thunder. Out of the mist, one hundred yards away, came Tyrannosaurus Rex. ‘It,’ whispered Eckels, ‘It......’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Ssh!’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It came on great oiled, resilient, striding legs. It towered thirty feet above half of the trees, a great evil god, folding its delicate watchmaker’s claws close to its oily reptilian chest. Each lower leg was a piston, a thousand pounds of white bone, sunk in thick ropes of muscle, sheathed over in a gleam of pebbled skin like the armour of a terrible warrior. Each thigh was a ton of meat, ivory, and steel mesh. And from the great breathing cage of the upper body those two delicate arms dangled out front, arms with hands which might pick up and examine men like toys, while the snake neck coiled. And the head itself, a ton of sculptured stone, lifted easily upon the sky. Its mouth gaped, exposing a fence of teeth like daggers. Its eyes rolled, ostrich eggs, empty of all expression save hunger. It closed its mouth in a death grin. It ran, its pelvic bones crushing aside trees and bushes, its taloned feet clawing damp earth, leaving prints six inches deep wherever it settled its weight. It ran with a gliding ballet step, far too poised and balanced for its ten tons. It moved into a sunlit area warily, its beautifully reptilian hands feeling the air.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Why, why...,’ Eckels twitched his mouth, ‘It could reach up and grab the moon.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Ssh!’ Travis jerked angrily. ‘He hasn’t seen us yet.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘It can’t be killed.’ Eckels pronounced this verdict quietly, as if there could be no argument. He had weighed the evidence and this was his considered opinion. The rifle in his hands seemed like a toy gun. ‘We were fools to come. This is impossible.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Shut up!’ hissed Travis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Nightmare.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Turn around,’ commanded Travis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Walk quietly to the Machine. We’ll remit half your fee.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘I didn’t realise it would be this big,’ said Eckels. ‘I miscalculated, that’s all. And now I want out.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘It sees us!’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘There’s the red paint on its chest.’ The Tyrant Lizard raised itself. Its armoured flesh glittered like a thousand green coins. The coins, crusted with slime, steamed. In the slime, tiny insects wriggled, so that the entire body seemed to twitch and undulate, even while the monster itself did not move. It exhaled. The stink of raw flesh blew down the wilderness.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Get me out of here,’ said Eckels. ‘It was never like this before. I was always sure I’d come through alive. I had good guides, good safaris, and safety. This time, I figured wrong. I’ve met my match and admit it. This is too much for me to get hold of.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Don’t run,’ said Lesperance. ‘Turn around. Hide in the Machine.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Yes.’ Eckels seemed to be numb. He looked at his feet as if trying to make them move. He gave a grunt of helplessness.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Eckels!’ He took a few steps, blinking, shuffling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Not that way!’ The Monster, at the first motion, lunged forward with a terrible scream. It covered one hundred yards in six seconds. The rifles jerked up and blazed fire. A windstorm from the beast’s mouth engulfed them in the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>stench of slime and old blood</strong></span>. The Monster roared, teeth glittering with sun. The rifles cracked again, but their sound was lost in shriek and lizard thunder. The great level of the reptile’s tail swung up, lashed sideways. Trees exploded in clouds of leaf and branch. The Monster twitched its jeweller’s hands down to fondle at the men, to twist them in half, to crush them like berries, to cram them into its teeth and its screaming throat. Its boulder-stone eyes levelled with the men. They saw themselves mirrored. They fired at the metallic eyelids and the blazing black iris. Like a stone idol, like a mountain avalanche, Tyrannosaurus fell.</p>

          <strong>A Sound of Thunder&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>by Ray Bradbury&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>Using a time machine, an organisation called Time Safari transports clients into the past to participate in hunting expeditions. A tourist Mr Eckels, together with tour guide, Travis, is visiting a prehistoric jungle in order to hunt a Tyrannosaurus Rex.</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The jungle was high and the jungle was broad. Sounds like music and flying tents filled the sky, and those were pterodactyls soaring with huge grey wings.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘I’ve hunted tiger, wild boar, buffalo, elephant, but now, this is it,’ said Eckels. ‘I’m shaking like a kid.’</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Ah,’ said Travis. Everyone stopped. Travis raised his hand. ‘Ahead,’ he whispered, ‘In the mist. There he is. There’s&nbsp;<strong><span class="txt-underline">his Royal Majesty</span></strong> now.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The jungle was wide and full of twitterings, rustlings, murmurs, and sighs. Suddenly, it all ceased, as if someone had shut a door. Silence. A sound of thunder. Out of the mist, one hundred yards away, came Tyrannosaurus Rex. ‘It,’ whispered Eckels, ‘It......’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Ssh!’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It came on great oiled, resilient, striding legs. It towered thirty feet above half of the trees, a great evil god, folding its delicate watchmaker’s claws close to its oily reptilian chest. Each lower leg was a piston, a thousand pounds of white bone, sunk in thick ropes of muscle, sheathed over in a gleam of pebbled skin like the armour of a terrible warrior. Each thigh was a ton of meat, ivory, and steel mesh. And from the great breathing cage of the upper body those two delicate arms dangled out front, arms with hands which might pick up and examine men like toys, while the snake neck coiled. And the head itself, a ton of sculptured stone, lifted easily upon the sky. Its mouth gaped, exposing a fence of teeth like daggers. Its eyes rolled, ostrich eggs, empty of all expression save hunger. It closed its mouth in a death grin. It ran, its pelvic bones crushing aside trees and bushes, its taloned feet clawing damp earth, leaving prints six inches deep wherever it settled its weight. It ran with a gliding ballet step, far too poised and balanced for its ten tons. It moved into a sunlit area warily, its beautifully reptilian hands feeling the air.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Why, why...,’ Eckels twitched his mouth, ‘It could reach up and grab the moon.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Ssh!’ Travis jerked angrily. ‘He hasn’t seen us yet.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘It can’t be killed.’ Eckels pronounced this verdict quietly, as if there could be no argument. He had weighed the evidence and this was his considered opinion. The rifle in his hands seemed like a toy gun. ‘We were fools to come. This is impossible.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Shut up!’ hissed Travis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Nightmare.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Turn around,’ commanded Travis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Walk quietly to the Machine. We’ll remit half your fee.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘I didn’t realise it would be this big,’ said Eckels. ‘I miscalculated, that’s all. And now I want out.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘It sees us!’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘There’s the red paint on its chest.’ The Tyrant Lizard raised itself. Its armoured flesh glittered like a thousand green coins. The coins, crusted with slime, steamed. In the slime, tiny insects wriggled, so that the entire body seemed to twitch and undulate, even while the monster itself did not move. It exhaled. The stink of raw flesh blew down the wilderness.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Get me out of here,’ said Eckels. ‘It was never like this before. I was always sure I’d come through alive. I had good guides, good safaris, and safety. This time, I figured wrong. I’ve met my match and admit it. This is too much for me to get hold of.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Don’t run,’ said Lesperance. ‘Turn around. Hide in the Machine.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Yes.’ Eckels seemed to be numb. He looked at his feet as if trying to make them move. He gave a grunt of helplessness.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Eckels!’ He took a few steps, blinking, shuffling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Not that way!’ The Monster, at the first motion, lunged forward with a terrible scream. It covered one hundred yards in six seconds. The rifles jerked up and blazed fire. A windstorm from the beast’s mouth engulfed them in the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>stench of slime and old blood</strong></span>. The Monster roared, teeth glittering with sun. The rifles cracked again, but their sound was lost in shriek and lizard thunder. The great level of the reptile’s tail swung up, lashed sideways. Trees exploded in clouds of leaf and branch. The Monster twitched its jeweller’s hands down to fondle at the men, to twist them in half, to crush them like berries, to cram them into its teeth and its screaming throat. Its boulder-stone eyes levelled with the men. They saw themselves mirrored. They fired at the metallic eyelids and the blazing black iris. Like a stone idol, like a mountain avalanche, Tyrannosaurus fell.</p>

          <strong>A Sound of Thunder&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>by Ray Bradbury&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>Using a time machine, an organisation called Time Safari transports clients into the past to participate in hunting expeditions. A tourist Mr Eckels, together with tour guide, Travis, is visiting a prehistoric jungle in order to hunt a Tyrannosaurus Rex.</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The jungle was high and the jungle was broad. Sounds like music and flying tents filled the sky, and those were pterodactyls soaring with huge grey wings.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘I’ve hunted tiger, wild boar, buffalo, elephant, but now, this is it,’ said Eckels. ‘I’m shaking like a kid.’</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Ah,’ said Travis. Everyone stopped. Travis raised his hand. ‘Ahead,’ he whispered, ‘In the mist. There he is. There’s&nbsp;<strong><span class="txt-underline">his Royal Majesty</span></strong> now.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The jungle was wide and full of twitterings, rustlings, murmurs, and sighs. Suddenly, it all ceased, as if someone had shut a door. Silence. A sound of thunder. Out of the mist, one hundred yards away, came Tyrannosaurus Rex. ‘It,’ whispered Eckels, ‘It......’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Ssh!’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It came on great oiled, resilient, striding legs. It towered thirty feet above half of the trees, a great evil god, folding its delicate watchmaker’s claws close to its oily reptilian chest. Each lower leg was a piston, a thousand pounds of white bone, sunk in thick ropes of muscle, sheathed over in a gleam of pebbled skin like the armour of a terrible warrior. Each thigh was a ton of meat, ivory, and steel mesh. And from the great breathing cage of the upper body those two delicate arms dangled out front, arms with hands which might pick up and examine men like toys, while the snake neck coiled. And the head itself, a ton of sculptured stone, lifted easily upon the sky. Its mouth gaped, exposing a fence of teeth like daggers. Its eyes rolled, ostrich eggs, empty of all expression save hunger. It closed its mouth in a death grin. It ran, its pelvic bones crushing aside trees and bushes, its taloned feet clawing damp earth, leaving prints six inches deep wherever it settled its weight. It ran with a gliding ballet step, far too poised and balanced for its ten tons. It moved into a sunlit area warily, its beautifully reptilian hands feeling the air.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Why, why...,’ Eckels twitched his mouth, ‘It could reach up and grab the moon.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Ssh!’ Travis jerked angrily. ‘He hasn’t seen us yet.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘It can’t be killed.’ Eckels pronounced this verdict quietly, as if there could be no argument. He had weighed the evidence and this was his considered opinion. The rifle in his hands seemed like a toy gun. ‘We were fools to come. This is impossible.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Shut up!’ hissed Travis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Nightmare.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Turn around,’ commanded Travis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Walk quietly to the Machine. We’ll remit half your fee.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘I didn’t realise it would be this big,’ said Eckels. ‘I miscalculated, that’s all. And now I want out.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘It sees us!’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘There’s the red paint on its chest.’ The Tyrant Lizard raised itself. Its armoured flesh glittered like a thousand green coins. The coins, crusted with slime, steamed. In the slime, tiny insects wriggled, so that the entire body seemed to twitch and undulate, even while the monster itself did not move. It exhaled. The stink of raw flesh blew down the wilderness.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Get me out of here,’ said Eckels. ‘It was never like this before. I was always sure I’d come through alive. I had good guides, good safaris, and safety. This time, I figured wrong. I’ve met my match and admit it. This is too much for me to get hold of.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Don’t run,’ said Lesperance. ‘Turn around. Hide in the Machine.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Yes.’ Eckels seemed to be numb. He looked at his feet as if trying to make them move. He gave a grunt of helplessness.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Eckels!’ He took a few steps, blinking, shuffling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Not that way!’ The Monster, at the first motion, lunged forward with a terrible scream. It covered one hundred yards in six seconds. The rifles jerked up and blazed fire. A windstorm from the beast’s mouth engulfed them in the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>stench of slime and old blood</strong></span>. The Monster roared, teeth glittering with sun. The rifles cracked again, but their sound was lost in shriek and lizard thunder. The great level of the reptile’s tail swung up, lashed sideways. Trees exploded in clouds of leaf and branch. The Monster twitched its jeweller’s hands down to fondle at the men, to twist them in half, to crush them like berries, to cram them into its teeth and its screaming throat. Its boulder-stone eyes levelled with the men. They saw themselves mirrored. They fired at the metallic eyelids and the blazing black iris. Like a stone idol, like a mountain avalanche, Tyrannosaurus fell.</p>

          <em>Using a time machine, an organisation called Time Safari transports clients into the past to participate in hunting expeditions. A tourist Mr Eckels, together with tour guide, Travis, is visiting a prehistoric jungle in order to hunt a Tyrannosaurus Rex.</em>
        </p>

        <p>The jungle was high and the jungle was broad. Sounds like music and flying tents filled the sky, and those were pterodactyls soaring with huge grey wings.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘I’ve hunted tiger, wild boar, buffalo, elephant, but now, this is it,’ said Eckels. ‘I’m shaking like a kid.’</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Ah,’ said Travis. Everyone stopped. Travis raised his hand. ‘Ahead,’ he whispered, ‘In the mist. There he is. There’s&nbsp;<strong><span class="txt-underline">his Royal Majesty</span></strong> now.’&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Ssh!’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It came on great oiled, resilient, striding legs. It towered thirty feet above half of the trees, a great evil god, folding its delicate watchmaker’s claws close to its oily reptilian chest. Each lower leg was a piston, a thousand pounds of white bone, sunk in thick ropes of muscle, sheathed over in a gleam of pebbled skin like the armour of a terrible warrior. Each thigh was a ton of meat, ivory, and steel mesh. And from the great breathing cage of the upper body those two delicate arms dangled out front, arms with hands which might pick up and examine men like toys, while the snake neck coiled. And the head itself, a ton of sculptured stone, lifted easily upon the sky. Its mouth gaped, exposing a fence of teeth like daggers. Its eyes rolled, ostrich eggs, empty of all expression save hunger. It closed its mouth in a death grin. It ran, its pelvic bones crushing aside trees and bushes, its taloned feet clawing damp earth, leaving prints six inches deep wherever it settled its weight. It ran with a gliding ballet step, far too poised and balanced for its ten tons. It moved into a sunlit area warily, its beautifully reptilian hands feeling the air.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Why, why...,’ Eckels twitched his mouth, ‘It could reach up and grab the moon.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Ssh!’ Travis jerked angrily. ‘He hasn’t seen us yet.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘It can’t be killed.’ Eckels pronounced this verdict quietly, as if there could be no argument. He had weighed the evidence and this was his considered opinion. The rifle in his hands seemed like a toy gun. ‘We were fools to come. This is impossible.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Shut up!’ hissed Travis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Nightmare.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <p>‘It sees us!’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <p>‘There’s the red paint on its chest.’ The Tyrant Lizard raised itself. Its armoured flesh glittered like a thousand green coins. The coins, crusted with slime, steamed. In the slime, tiny insects wriggled, so that the entire body seemed to twitch and undulate, even while the monster itself did not move. It exhaled.

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Yes.’ Eckels seemed to be numb. He looked at his feet as if trying to make them move. He gave a grunt of helplessness.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Eckels!’ He took a few steps, blinking, shuffling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Not that way!’ The Monster, at the first motion, lunged forward with a terrible scream. It covered one hundred yards in six seconds. The rifles jerked up and blazed fire. A windstorm from the beast’s mouth engulfed them in the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>stench of slime and old blood</strong></span>. The Monster roared, teeth glittering with sun. The rifles cracked again, but their sound was lost in shriek and lizard thunder. The great level of the reptile’s tail swung up, lashed sideways. Trees exploded in clouds of leaf and branch. The Monster twitched its jeweller’s hands down to fondle at the men, to twist them in half, to crush them like berries, to cram them into its teeth and its screaming throat. Its boulder-stone eyes levelled with the men. They saw themselves mirrored. They fired at the metallic eyelids and the blazing black iris. Like a stone idol, like a mountain avalanche, Tyrannosaurus fell.</p>

          <strong>A Sound of Thunder&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>by Ray Bradbury&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>Using a time machine, an organisation called Time Safari transports clients into the past to participate in hunting expeditions. A tourist Mr Eckels, together with tour guide, Travis, is visiting a prehistoric jungle in order to hunt a Tyrannosaurus Rex.</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The jungle was high and the jungle was broad. Sounds like music and flying tents filled the sky, and those were pterodactyls soaring with huge grey wings.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘I’ve hunted tiger, wild boar, buffalo, elephant, but now, this is it,’ said Eckels. ‘I’m shaking like a kid.’</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Ah,’ said Travis. Everyone stopped. Travis raised his hand. ‘Ahead,’ he whispered, ‘In the mist. There he is. There’s&nbsp;<strong><span class="txt-underline">his Royal Majesty</span></strong> now.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The jungle was wide and full of twitterings, rustlings, murmurs, and sighs. Suddenly, it all ceased, as if someone had shut a door. Silence. A sound of thunder. Out of the mist, one hundred yards away, came Tyrannosaurus Rex. ‘It,’ whispered Eckels, ‘It......’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Ssh!’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It came on great oiled, resilient, striding legs. It towered thirty feet above half of the trees, a great evil god, folding its delicate watchmaker’s claws close to its oily reptilian chest. Each lower leg was a piston, a thousand pounds of white bone, sunk in thick ropes of muscle, sheathed over in a gleam of pebbled skin like the armour of a terrible warrior. Each thigh was a ton of meat, ivory, and steel mesh. And from the great breathing cage of the upper body those two delicate arms dangled out front, arms with hands which might pick up and examine men like toys, while the snake neck coiled. And the head itself, a ton of sculptured stone, lifted easily upon the sky. Its mouth gaped, exposing a fence of teeth like daggers. Its eyes rolled, ostrich eggs, empty of all expression save hunger. It closed its mouth in a death grin. It ran, its pelvic bones crushing aside trees and bushes, its taloned feet clawing damp earth, leaving prints six inches deep wherever it settled its weight. It ran with a gliding ballet step, far too poised and balanced for its ten tons. It moved into a sunlit area warily, its beautifully reptilian hands feeling the air.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Why, why...,’ Eckels twitched his mouth, ‘It could reach up and grab the moon.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Ssh!’ Travis jerked angrily. ‘He hasn’t seen us yet.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘It can’t be killed.’ Eckels pronounced this verdict quietly, as if there could be no argument. He had weighed the evidence and this was his considered opinion. The rifle in his hands seemed like a toy gun. ‘We were fools to come. This is impossible.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Shut up!’ hissed Travis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Nightmare.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Turn around,’ commanded Travis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Walk quietly to the Machine. We’ll remit half your fee.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘I didn’t realise it would be this big,’ said Eckels. ‘I miscalculated, that’s all. And now I want out.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘It sees us!’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘There’s the red paint on its chest.’ The Tyrant Lizard raised itself. Its armoured flesh glittered like a thousand green coins. The coins, crusted with slime, steamed. In the slime, tiny insects wriggled, so that the entire body seemed to twitch and undulate, even while the monster itself did not move. It exhaled. The stink of raw flesh blew down the wilderness.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Get me out of here,’ said Eckels. ‘It was never like this before. I was always sure I’d come through alive. I had good guides, good safaris, and safety. This time, I figured wrong. I’ve met my match and admit it. This is too much for me to get hold of.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Don’t run,’ said Lesperance. ‘Turn around. Hide in the Machine.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Yes.’ Eckels seemed to be numb. He looked at his feet as if trying to make them move. He gave a grunt of helplessness.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Eckels!’ He took a few steps, blinking, shuffling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Not that way!’ The Monster, at the first motion, lunged forward with a terrible scream. It covered one hundred yards in six seconds. The rifles jerked up and blazed fire. A windstorm from the beast’s mouth engulfed them in the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>stench of slime and old blood</strong></span>. The Monster roared, teeth glittering with sun. The rifles cracked again, but their sound was lost in shriek and lizard thunder. The great level of the reptile’s tail swung up, lashed sideways. Trees exploded in clouds of leaf and branch. The Monster twitched its jeweller’s hands down to fondle at the men, to twist them in half, to crush them like berries, to cram them into its teeth and its screaming throat. Its boulder-stone eyes levelled with the men. They saw themselves mirrored. They fired at the metallic eyelids and the blazing black iris. Like a stone idol, like a mountain avalanche, Tyrannosaurus fell.</p>
