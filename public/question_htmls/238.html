          <strong>Read the following extract from Jane Austen’s <span class="txt-underline"><em>Emma </em></span>to answer questions 5&nbsp;– 9.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>… She had heard, as soon as she got back to Mrs Goddard's, that Mr Martin had been there an hour before, and finding she was not at home, nor particularly expected, had left a little parcel for her from one of his sisters, and gone away; and on opening this parcel, she had actually found, besides the two songs which she had lent Elizabeth to copy, a letter to herself; and this letter was from him, from Mr. Martin, and contained a direct proposal of marriage. "Who could have thought it? She was so surprised she did not know what to do. Yes, quite a proposal of marriage; and a very good letter, at least she thought so. And he wrote as if he really loved her very much–but she did not know–and so, she was come as fast as she could to ask Miss Woodhouse what she should do. Emma was half-ashamed of her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful.</p>
        <p>"Upon my word," she cried, "the young man is determined not to lose anything for want of asking. He will connect himself well if he can."</p>
        <p>"Will you read the letter?" cried Harriet. "Pray do. I'd rather you would."</p>
        <p>Emma was not sorry to be pressed. She read, and was surprised. The style of the letter was much above her expectation. There were not merely no grammatical errors, but as a composition it would not have disgraced a gentleman; the language, though plain, was strong and unaffected, and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer. It was short, but expressed good sense, warm attachment, liberality, propriety, even delicacy of feeling. She paused over it, while Harriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion, with a "Well, well," and was at last forced to add, "Is it a good letter? Or is it too short?"</p>
        <p>"Yes, indeed, a very good letter," replied Emma rather slowly—"so good a letter, Harriet, that everything considered, I think one of his sisters must have helped him. I can hardly imagine the young man whom I saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well, if left quite to his own powers, and yet it is not the style of a woman; no, certainly, it is too strong and concise; not diffuse enough for a woman. No doubt he is a sensible man, and I suppose may have a natural talent for–thinks strongly and clearly–and when he takes a pen in hand, his thoughts naturally find proper words. It is so with some men. Yes, I understand the sort of mind. Vigorous, decided, with sentiments to a certain point, not coarse. A better written letter, Harriet (returning it,) than I had expected."</p>

          <strong>THE HERO</strong>

"Jack fell as he'd have wished," the Mother said,<br>
And folded up the letter that she'd read.<br>
"The Colonel writes so nicely." Something broke<br>
In the tired voice that quavered to a choke.<br>
She half looked up. "We mothers are so proud<br>
Of our dead soldiers." Then her face was bowed.</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">Quietly the Brother Officer went out.<br>
He'd told the poor old dear some gallant lies<br>
That she would nourish all her days, no doubt.<br>
For while he coughed and mumbled, her weak eyes<br>
Had shone with gentle triumph, brimmed with joy,<br>
Because he'd been so brave, her glorious boy.</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">He thought how "Jack," cold-footed, useless swine,<br>
Had panicked down the trench that night the mine<br>
Went up at Wicked Corner; how he'd tried<br>
To get sent home; and how, at last, he died,<br>
Blown to small bits. And no one seemed to care<br>
Except that lonely woman with white hair.</p>

Had shone with gentle triumph, brimmed with joy,<br>
Because he'd been so brave, her glorious boy.</p>

To get sent home; and how, at last, he died,<br>
Blown to small bits. And no one seemed to care<br>
Except that lonely woman with white hair.</p>

Reincarnation is the belief that a part of our consciousness will continue living after the death of the physical body and will be reborn into a new body here on Earth. The belief of reincarnation is widespread, in fact almost universal in the East, but it has never been that popular in the West. This is due to the scepticism of mainstream science and the fact that it is not really mentioned in the Christian Bible. However, times are slowly changing and more and more reputable doctors and scientists are now investigating aspects of reincarnation, including past life regression, near-death experiences and after-death communication.</p>

For others, it is a subject that is never contemplated because “ignorance is bliss.” But, whether we believe in it or not, the fact remains that life after death is a certainty because life cannot be extinguished – it only changes form. Death is an unsuitable term for passing on to a higher form of life because the self/monad cannot die – ever! The bodies of incarnation are discarded when they are no longer required, but the monad is immortal.</p>

          <strong>A Brief Overview of Reincarnation</strong>
        </p>
        <p><br>
Reincarnation is the belief that a part of our consciousness will continue living after the death of the physical body and will be reborn into a new body here on Earth. The belief of reincarnation is widespread, in fact almost universal in the East, but it has never been that popular in the West. This is due to the scepticism of mainstream science and the fact that it is not really mentioned in the Christian Bible. However, times are slowly changing and more and more reputable doctors and scientists are now investigating aspects of reincarnation, including past life regression, near-death experiences and after-death communication.</p>
        <p>For many people, the idea of life after death is very comforting because it lessens their grief and removes their fear of annihilation. For others, it is a subject that is never contemplated because “ignorance is bliss.” But, whether we believe in it or not, the fact remains that life after death is a certainty because life cannot be extinguished – it only changes form. Death is an unsuitable term for passing on to a higher form of life because the self/monad cannot die – ever! The bodies of incarnation are discarded when they are no longer required, but the monad is immortal.</p>

          <strong>Hey, That Reminds Me of this Great Analogy </strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <em>by Sam de Brito</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One of the many rewards of parenthood is it allows you to study how we humans 'learn to learn.’ Observing your child construct their understanding of the world also offers insights into how we adults do it, which in turn can improve your communication with others, if that sort of stuff matters to you.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most significant method kids use is analogy – comparing things they know, with things they don't, building levels of comprehension, abstraction and complexity. If you've had a variation of this conversation, you'll grasp my point: "What's beer, daddy?" "It's like a fizzy drink for grown-ups".</p>
        <p><em>New Scientist </em>offers the example of motherhood. Kids recognise their mums very early on, then slowly realise other people have them, that animals also have mothers and then, that even their mothers have mothers. Eventually they extend the idea of motherhood to objects like motherboards and mother of pearl and finally to concepts that don't physically exist, like Mother Nature.</p>
        <p>Douglas Hofstadter, author of the influential treatise on consciousness, <em>Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid</em>, rates analogy the core of human cognition: "Analogies, far from being unusual cognitive gems, are mundane events, being generated several times every second, and it is through them we manage to orient ourselves in the world," he writes.</p>
        <p>Like children, even the most experienced adult meets new, often dangerous situations many times a day. We deal with them by comparing them to past experiences, creating analogies almost subconsciously. Thus, you don't need to have crossed a foreign road or driven a strange car to know how to do it, not to mention TV remotes, computers, lifts, forks and public toilets.</p>
        <p>A quick look at the desktop on your computer with its mail, folders, windows and recycle bin shows how deeply rooted is analogy, nested inside further analogies, which represent abstract mappings of the physical world.</p>
        <p>It applies to relationships as well. You need not have experienced a person's life to understand it. That "me too" feeling when you empathise is an abstract form of analogy, as is the stuttering "like" of teen conversation and tens of thousands of other words, concepts, expressions and proverbs – from "messy" to "soap opera,” "slippery slope,” "been there, done that" and "the new black".</p>
        <p>Hofstadter argues analogy is also how almost every great scientific discovery has been made and explained – from the earth being round like "a ball", to sound "waves,” Einstein's theory of light "particles" (photons), black "holes" and the "Big Bang.” "An apt analogy allows a person to treat something new as if it were familiar," writes Hofstadter.</p>
        <p>Analogy, he says, "is the entire transport system of thought ... it pervades thinking, from throwaway remarks to deep scientific and artistic insights. Through analogies made in fractions of a second we retrieve apt categories based on subtle cues that reveal what counts in a situation and what doesn't."</p>
        <p>And once you realise how much cognition depends on analogy, you and I can improve our communication by stitching together word pictures that other people (and our children) already understand, to explain the idea we're trying to project.</p>
        <p>If you get my meaning.</p>

          <strong>Hey, That Reminds Me of this Great Analogy </strong>

          <em>by Sam de Brito</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One of the many rewards of parenthood is it allows you to study how we humans 'learn to learn.’ Observing your child construct their understanding of the world also offers insights into how we adults do it, which in turn can improve your communication with others, if that sort of stuff matters to you.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most significant method kids use is analogy – comparing things they know, with things they don't, building levels of comprehension, abstraction and complexity. If you've had a variation of this conversation, you'll grasp my point: "What's beer, daddy?" "It's like a fizzy drink for grown-ups".</p>
        <p><em>New Scientist </em>offers the example of motherhood. Kids recognise their mums very early on, then slowly realise other people have them, that animals also have mothers and then, that even their mothers have mothers. Eventually they extend the idea of motherhood to objects like motherboards and mother of pearl and finally to concepts that don't physically exist, like Mother Nature.</p>
        <p>Douglas Hofstadter, author of the influential treatise on consciousness, <em>Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid</em>, rates analogy the core of human cognition: "Analogies, far from being unusual cognitive gems, are mundane events, being generated several times every second, and it is through them we manage to orient ourselves in the world," he writes.</p>
        <p>Like children, even the most experienced adult meets new, often dangerous situations many times a day. We deal with them by comparing them to past experiences, creating analogies almost subconsciously. Thus, you don't need to have crossed a foreign road or driven a strange car to know how to do it, not to mention TV remotes, computers, lifts, forks and public toilets.</p>
        <p>A quick look at the desktop on your computer with its mail, folders, windows and recycle bin shows how deeply rooted is analogy, nested inside further analogies, which represent abstract mappings of the physical world.</p>
        <p>It applies to relationships as well. You need not have experienced a person's life to understand it. That "me too" feeling when you empathise is an abstract form of analogy, as is the stuttering "like" of teen conversation and tens of thousands of other words, concepts, expressions and proverbs – from "messy" to "soap opera,” "slippery slope,” "been there, done that" and "the new black".</p>
        <p>Hofstadter argues analogy is also how almost every great scientific discovery has been made and explained – from the earth being round like "a ball", to sound "waves,” Einstein's theory of light "particles" (photons), black "holes" and the "Big Bang.” "An apt analogy allows a person to treat something new as if it were familiar," writes Hofstadter.</p>
        <p>Analogy, he says, "is the entire transport system of thought ... it pervades thinking, from throwaway remarks to deep scientific and artistic insights. Through analogies made in fractions of a second we retrieve apt categories based on subtle cues that reveal what counts in a situation and what doesn't."</p>
        <p>And once you realise how much cognition depends on analogy, you and I can improve our communication by stitching together word pictures that other people (and our children) already understand, to explain the idea we're trying to project.</p>
        <p>If you get my meaning.</p>

          <strong>Hey, That Reminds Me of this Great Analogy </strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <em>by Sam de Brito</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One of the many rewards of parenthood is it allows you to study how we humans 'learn to learn.’ Observing your child construct their understanding of the world also offers insights into how we adults do it, which in turn can improve your communication with others, if that sort of stuff matters to you.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most significant method kids use is analogy – comparing things they know, with things they don't, building levels of comprehension, abstraction and complexity. If you've had a variation of this conversation, you'll grasp my point: "What's beer, daddy?" "It's like a fizzy drink for grown-ups".</p>
        <p><em>New Scientist </em>offers the example of motherhood. Kids recognise their mums very early on, then slowly realise other people have them, that animals also have mothers and then, that even their mothers have mothers. Eventually they extend the idea of motherhood to objects like motherboards and mother of pearl and finally to concepts that don't physically exist, like Mother Nature.</p>
        <p>Douglas Hofstadter, author of the influential treatise on consciousness, <em>Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid</em>, rates analogy the core of human cognition: "Analogies, far from being unusual cognitive gems, are mundane events, being generated several times every second, and it is through them we manage to orient ourselves in the world," he writes.</p>
        <p>Like children, even the most experienced adult meets new, often dangerous situations many times a day. We deal with them by comparing them to past experiences, creating analogies almost subconsciously. Thus, you don't need to have crossed a foreign road or driven a strange car to know how to do it, not to mention TV remotes, computers, lifts, forks and public toilets.</p>
        <p>A quick look at the desktop on your computer with its mail, folders, windows and recycle bin shows how deeply rooted is analogy, nested inside further analogies, which represent abstract mappings of the physical world.</p>
        <p>It applies to relationships as well. You need not have experienced a person's life to understand it. That "me too" feeling when you empathise is an abstract form of analogy, as is the stuttering "like" of teen conversation and tens of thousands of other words, concepts, expressions and proverbs – from "messy" to "soap opera,” "slippery slope,” "been there, done that" and "the new black".</p>
        <p>Hofstadter argues analogy is also how almost every great scientific discovery has been made and explained – from the earth being round like "a ball", to sound "waves,” Einstein's theory of light "particles" (photons), black "holes" and the "Big Bang.” "An apt analogy allows a person to treat something new as if it were familiar," writes Hofstadter.</p>
        <p>Analogy, he says, "is the entire transport system of thought ... it pervades thinking, from throwaway remarks to deep scientific and artistic insights. Through analogies made in fractions of a second we retrieve apt categories based on subtle cues that reveal what counts in a situation and what doesn't."</p>
        <p>And once you realise how much cognition depends on analogy, you and I can improve our communication by stitching together word pictures that other people (and our children) already understand, to explain the idea we're trying to project.</p>
        <p>If you get my meaning.</p>

        <p><strong>Read the following extract from George Orwell’s <span class="txt-underline"><em>Animal Farm</em></span> to answer questions 31 - 35</strong>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I have little more to say. I merely repeat, remember always your duty of enmity towards Man and all his ways. Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend. And remember also that in fighting against Man, we must not come to resemble him. Even when you have conquered him, do not adopt his <em><strong>vices</strong></em>. No animal must ever live in a house, or sleep in a bed, or wear clothes, or drink alcohol, or smoke tobacco, or touch money, or engage in trade. All the habits of Man are evil. And, above all, no animal must ever tyrannise over his own kind. Weak or strong, clever or simple, we are all brothers. No animal must ever kill any other animal. All animals are equal.</p>
        <p>“And now, comrades, I will tell you about my dream of last night. I cannot describe that dream to you. It was a dream of the earth as it will be when Man has vanished. But it reminded me of something that I had long forgotten. Many years ago, when I was a little pig, my mother and the other sows used to sing an old song of which they knew only the tune and the first three words. I had known that tune in my infancy, but it had long since passed out of my mind. Last night, however, it came back to me in my dream. And what is more, the words of the song also came back – words, I am certain, which were sung by the animals of long ago and have been lost to memory for generations. I will sing you that song now, comrades. I am old and my voice is hoarse, but when I have taught you the tune, you can sing it better for yourselves. It is called, ‘Beasts of England.’”</p>
        <p>Old Major cleared his throat and began to sing. As he had said, his voice was hoarse, but he sang well enough, and it was a stirring tune, something between ‘Clementine’ and ‘La Cucaracha.’</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I have little more to say. I merely repeat, remember always your duty of enmity towards Man and all his ways. Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend. And remember also that in fighting against Man, we must not come to resemble him. Even when you have conquered him, do not adopt his <em><strong>vices</strong></em>. No animal must ever live in a house, or sleep in a bed, or wear clothes, or drink alcohol, or smoke tobacco, or touch money, or engage in trade. All the habits of Man are evil. And, above all, no animal must ever tyrannise over his own kind. Weak or strong, clever or simple, we are all brothers. No animal must ever kill any other animal. All animals are equal.</p>
        <p>“And now, comrades, I will tell you about my dream of last night. I cannot describe that dream to you. It was a dream of the earth as it will be when Man has vanished. But it reminded me of something that I had long forgotten. Many years ago, when I was a little pig, my mother and the other sows used to sing an old song of which they knew only the tune and the first three words. I had known that tune in my infancy, but it had long since passed out of my mind. Last night, however, it came back to me in my dream. And what is more, the words of the song also came back – words, I am certain, which were sung by the animals of long ago and have been lost to memory for generations. I will sing you that song now, comrades. I am old and my voice is hoarse, but when I have taught you the tune, you can sing it better for yourselves. It is called, ‘Beasts of England.’”</p>
        <p>Old Major cleared his throat and began to sing. As he had said, his voice was hoarse, but he sang well enough, and it was a stirring tune, something between ‘Clementine’ and ‘La Cucaracha.’</p>

        <p><strong>Read the following extract from George Orwell’s <span class="txt-underline"><em>Animal Farm</em></span> to answer questions 31 - 35</strong>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I have little more to say. I merely repeat, remember always your duty of enmity towards Man and all his ways. Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend. And remember also that in fighting against Man, we must not come to resemble him. Even when you have conquered him, do not adopt his <em><strong>vices</strong></em>. No animal must ever live in a house, or sleep in a bed, or wear clothes, or drink alcohol, or smoke tobacco, or touch money, or engage in trade. All the habits of Man are evil. And, above all, no animal must ever tyrannise over his own kind. Weak or strong, clever or simple, we are all brothers. No animal must ever kill any other animal. All animals are equal.</p>
        <p>“And now, comrades, I will tell you about my dream of last night. I cannot describe that dream to you. It was a dream of the earth as it will be when Man has vanished. But it reminded me of something that I had long forgotten. Many years ago, when I was a little pig, my mother and the other sows used to sing an old song of which they knew only the tune and the first three words. I had known that tune in my infancy, but it had long since passed out of my mind. Last night, however, it came back to me in my dream. And what is more, the words of the song also came back – words, I am certain, which were sung by the animals of long ago and have been lost to memory for generations. I will sing you that song now, comrades. I am old and my voice is hoarse, but when I have taught you the tune, you can sing it better for yourselves. It is called, ‘Beasts of England.’”</p>
        <p>Old Major cleared his throat and began to sing. As he had said, his voice was hoarse, but he sang well enough, and it was a stirring tune, something between ‘Clementine’ and ‘La Cucaracha.’</p>

Earth has not anything to show more fair:<br>
Dull would he be of soul who could pass by<br>
A sight so touching in its majesty:<br>
This City now doth, like a garment, wear<br>
The beauty of the morning; silent, bare,<br>
Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie<br>
Open unto the fields, and to the sky;<br>
All bright and glittering in the smokeless air.</p>

In his first splendour, valley, rock, or hill;<br>
Ne'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!<br>
The river glideth at his own sweet will:<br>
Dear God! the very houses seem asleep;<br>
And all that mighty heart is lying still!</p>
