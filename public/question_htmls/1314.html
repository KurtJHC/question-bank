          <strong>​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Johanna Spyri</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>From the old and pleasantly situated village of Mayenfeld, a footpath winds through green and shady meadows to the foot of the mountains, which on this side look down from their stern and lofty heights upon the valley below. The land grows gradually wilder as the path ascends, and the climber has not gone far before he begins to inhale the fragrance of the short grass and sturdy mountain-plants, for the way is steep and leads directly up to the summits above.<br>
<br>
On a clear sunny morning in June, two figures might be seen climbing the narrow mountain path; one, a tall strong-looking girl, the other a child whom she was leading by the hand, and whose little cheeks were so aglow with heat that the crimson colour could be seen even through the dark, sunburnt skin. And this was hardly to be wondered at, for in spite of the hot June sun, the child was clothed as if to keep off the bitterest frost. She did not look more than five years old, if as much, but what her natural figure was like, it would have been hard to say, for she had apparently two, if not three dresses, one above the other, and over these a thick red woollen shawl wound round about her, so that the little body presented a shapeless appearance, as, with its small feet shod in thick, nailed mountain-shoes, it slowly and laboriously plodded its way up in the heat. The two must have left the valley a good hour's walk behind them, when they came to the hamlet known as Dorfli, which is situated half-way up the mountain. Here the wayfarers met with greetings from all sides, some calling to them from windows, some from open doors, others from outside, for the elder girl was now in her old home. She did not, however, pause in her walk to respond to her friends' welcoming cries and questions, but passed on without stopping for a moment until she reached the last of the scattered houses of the hamlet. Here a voice called to her from the door: "Wait a moment, Dete; if you are going up higher, I will come with you."<br>
<br>
The girl thus addressed stood still, and the child immediately let go her hand and seated herself on the ground.<br>
<br>
"Are you tired, Heidi?" asked her companion.<br>
<br>
"No, I am hot," answered the child.<br>
<br>
"We shall soon get to the top now. You must walk bravely on a little longer, and take good long steps, and in another hour, we shall be there," said Dete in an encouraging voice.<br>
<br>
They were now joined by a stout, good-natured-looking woman, who walked on ahead with her old acquaintance, the two breaking forth at once into lively conversation about everybody and everything in Dorfli and its surroundings, while the child wandered behind them.<br>
<br>
"And where are you off to with the child?" asked the one who had just joined the party. "I suppose it is the child your sister left?"<br>
<br>
"Yes," answered Dete. "I am taking her up to Uncle, where she must stay."<br>
<br>
"The child stay up there with Alm-Uncle! You must be out of your senses, Dete! How can you think of such a thing! The old man, however, will soon send you and your proposal packing off home again!"<br>
<br>
"He cannot very well do that, seeing that he is her grandfather. He must do something for her. I have had the charge of the child till now, and I can tell you, Barbel, I am not going to give up the chance which has just fallen to me of getting a good place, for her sake. It is for the grandfather now to do his duty by her."<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; …<br>
<br>
"I am glad I am not the child!" exclaimed Barbel, with a gesture of horrified pity. "Not a creature knows anything about the old man up there! He will have nothing to do with anybody, and never sets his foot inside a church from one year's end to another. When he does come down once in a while, everybody clears out of the way of him and his big stick. The mere sight of him, with his bushy grey eyebrows and his immense beard, is alarming enough. He looks like any old heathen or Indian, and few would care to meet him alone."<br>
<br>
"Well, and what of that?" said Dete, in a defiant voice, "he is the grandfather all the same, and must look after the child. He is not likely to do her any harm, and if he does, he will be answerable for it, not I."<br>
<br>
"I should very much like to know," continued Barbel, in an inquiring tone of voice, "what the old man has on his conscience that he looks as he does, and lives up there on the mountain like a hermit, hardly ever allowing himself to be seen. All kinds of things are said about him. You, Dete, however, must certainly have learnt a good deal concerning him from your sister--am I not right?"<br>
<br>
"You are right, I did, but I am not going to repeat what I heard; if it should come to his ears I should get into trouble about it."</p>

Smiling is infectious,<br>
You catch it like the flu,<br>
When someone smiled at me today,<br>
I started smiling too.<br>
<br>
I passed around the corner<br>
And someone saw my grin.<br>
When he smiled I realised<br>
I’d passed it on to him.<br>
<br>
I thought about that smile,<br>
Then I realised its worth.<br>
A single smile, just like mine<br>
Could travel around the Earth.<br>
<br>
So, if you feel a smile begin,<br>
Don’t leave it undetected.<br>
Let’s start an epidemic quick,<br>
And get the world infected!</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Book Review – Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</strong><br><br>
The Philosopher’s Stone is the first in J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series of seven novels that have made her the most successful literary author of all time, selling in excess of 400 million copies world-wide. <strong>31</strong> ……….<br>
<br>
Do the Harry Potter books live up to the hype? When I first began reading the Philosopher’s Stone, I was immediately struck by how good - and laugh-out-loud funny - the humour was. <strong>32</strong> ………. &nbsp;but Rowling has managed to infuse this book with a lovely wit and charm that will both amuse and delight adults and children.<br>
<br>
Here is an example, with the ending being particularly good:<br>
<br>
<em>"Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large, pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes and thick, blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. </em><strong>33</strong> ………. – <em>Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig."</em><br>
<br>
There are characters in this book that will remind us of all the people we have met. <strong>34</strong> ………. &nbsp;or a bossy and interfering (yet kind-hearted) girl like Hermione. A large number of the younger readers will also be able to easily identify with Harry, especially with his initial feelings of isolation and not belonging, and then through to his excitement at finally leaving that life behind in favour of one where he belongs and will be happy.<br>
<br>
When Harry begins his first term at Hogwarts (a wizarding school) he is not alone in being overawed:<br>
<br>
<em>“‘Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight of Hogwarts in a sec,’ Hagrid called over his shoulder, ‘jus’ round this bend here.’ There was a loud ‘Oooooh!’<br>
The narrow path had opened suddenly on to the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.”</em><br>
<br>
Hogwarts is a truly magical place, not only in the most obvious way but also in all the detail that the author has gone to describe it so vibrantly. It is the place that everybody wishes they could have gone to when they were eleven. <strong>35</strong> ………. &nbsp;The story builds towards an exciting conclusion that has the ultimate feel-good factor.<br>
<br>
J.K. Rowling should be commended for getting so many people reading and excited by books. The biggest surprise must be the effect that this novel had on the adult population, both male and female - at the time the books were published many a commuting train was spotted with Harry Potter books providing world-weary workers with a wonderful sense of escapism. <strong>36</strong> ……….<br>
<br>
Is all the hype about the Harry Potter books justified? In a word, yes, the books are a joy to read and possibly the most rewarding young adult’s book since The Hobbit.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Book Review – Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</strong><br><br>
The Philosopher’s Stone is the first in J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series of seven novels that have made her the most successful literary author of all time, selling in excess of 400 million copies world-wide. <strong>31</strong> ……….<br>
<br>
Do the Harry Potter books live up to the hype? When I first began reading the Philosopher’s Stone, I was immediately struck by how good - and laugh-out-loud funny - the humour was. <strong>32</strong> ………. &nbsp;but Rowling has managed to infuse this book with a lovely wit and charm that will both amuse and delight adults and children.<br>
<br>
Here is an example, with the ending being particularly good:<br>
<br>
<em>"Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large, pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes and thick, blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. </em><strong>33</strong> ………. – <em>Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig."</em><br>
<br>
There are characters in this book that will remind us of all the people we have met. <strong>34</strong> ………. &nbsp;or a bossy and interfering (yet kind-hearted) girl like Hermione. A large number of the younger readers will also be able to easily identify with Harry, especially with his initial feelings of isolation and not belonging, and then through to his excitement at finally leaving that life behind in favour of one where he belongs and will be happy.<br>
<br>
When Harry begins his first term at Hogwarts (a wizarding school) he is not alone in being overawed:<br>
<br>
<em>“‘Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight of Hogwarts in a sec,’ Hagrid called over his shoulder, ‘jus’ round this bend here.’ There was a loud ‘Oooooh!’<br>
The narrow path had opened suddenly on to the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.”</em><br>
<br>
Hogwarts is a truly magical place, not only in the most obvious way but also in all the detail that the author has gone to describe it so vibrantly. It is the place that everybody wishes they could have gone to when they were eleven. <strong>35</strong> ………. &nbsp;The story builds towards an exciting conclusion that has the ultimate feel-good factor.<br>
<br>
J.K. Rowling should be commended for getting so many people reading and excited by books. The biggest surprise must be the effect that this novel had on the adult population, both male and female - at the time the books were published many a commuting train was spotted with Harry Potter books providing world-weary workers with a wonderful sense of escapism. <strong>36</strong> ……….<br>
<br>
Is all the hype about the Harry Potter books justified? In a word, yes, the books are a joy to read and possibly the most rewarding young adult’s book since The Hobbit.</p>

There are characters in this book that will remind us of all the people we have met. <strong>34</strong> ………. &nbsp;or a bossy and interfering (yet kind-hearted) girl like Hermione. A large number of the younger readers will also be able to easily identify with Harry, especially with his initial feelings of isolation and not belonging, and then through to his excitement at finally leaving that life behind in favour of one where he belongs and will be happy.<br>
<br>
When Harry begins his first term at Hogwarts (a wizarding school) he is not alone in being overawed:<br>
<br>
<em>“‘Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight of Hogwarts in a sec,’ Hagrid called over his shoulder, ‘jus’ round this bend here.’ There was a loud ‘Oooooh!’<br>
The narrow path had opened suddenly on to the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.”</em><br>
<br>
Hogwarts is a truly magical place, not only in the most obvious way but also in all the detail that the author has gone to describe it so vibrantly. It is the place that everybody wishes they could have gone to when they were eleven. <strong>35</strong> ………. &nbsp;The story builds towards an exciting conclusion that has the ultimate feel-good factor.<br>
<br>
J.K. Rowling should be commended for getting so many people reading and excited by books. The biggest surprise must be the effect that this novel had on the adult population, both male and female - at the time the books were published many a commuting train was spotted with Harry Potter books providing world-weary workers with a wonderful sense of escapism. <strong>36</strong> ……….<br>
<br>
Is all the hype about the Harry Potter books justified? In a word, yes, the books are a joy to read and possibly the most rewarding young adult’s book since The Hobbit.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Book Review – Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</strong><br><br>
The Philosopher’s Stone is the first in J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series of seven novels that have made her the most successful literary author of all time, selling in excess of 400 million copies world-wide. <strong>31</strong> ……….<br>
<br>
Do the Harry Potter books live up to the hype? When I first began reading the Philosopher’s Stone, I was immediately struck by how good - and laugh-out-loud funny - the humour was. <strong>32</strong> ………. &nbsp;but Rowling has managed to infuse this book with a lovely wit and charm that will both amuse and delight adults and children.<br>
<br>
Here is an example, with the ending being particularly good:<br>
<br>
<em>"Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large, pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes and thick, blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. </em><strong>33</strong> ………. – <em>Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig."</em><br>
<br>
There are characters in this book that will remind us of all the people we have met. <strong>34</strong> ………. &nbsp;or a bossy and interfering (yet kind-hearted) girl like Hermione. A large number of the younger readers will also be able to easily identify with Harry, especially with his initial feelings of isolation and not belonging, and then through to his excitement at finally leaving that life behind in favour of one where he belongs and will be happy.<br>
<br>
When Harry begins his first term at Hogwarts (a wizarding school) he is not alone in being overawed:<br>
<br>
<em>“‘Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight of Hogwarts in a sec,’ Hagrid called over his shoulder, ‘jus’ round this bend here.’ There was a loud ‘Oooooh!’<br>
The narrow path had opened suddenly on to the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.”</em><br>
<br>
Hogwarts is a truly magical place, not only in the most obvious way but also in all the detail that the author has gone to describe it so vibrantly. It is the place that everybody wishes they could have gone to when they were eleven. <strong>35</strong> ………. &nbsp;The story builds towards an exciting conclusion that has the ultimate feel-good factor.<br>
<br>
J.K. Rowling should be commended for getting so many people reading and excited by books. The biggest surprise must be the effect that this novel had on the adult population, both male and female - at the time the books were published many a commuting train was spotted with Harry Potter books providing world-weary workers with a wonderful sense of escapism. <strong>36</strong> ……….<br>
<br>
Is all the hype about the Harry Potter books justified? In a word, yes, the books are a joy to read and possibly the most rewarding young adult’s book since The Hobbit.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Book Review – Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</strong><br><br>
The Philosopher’s Stone is the first in J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series of seven novels that have made her the most successful literary author of all time, selling in excess of 400 million copies world-wide. <strong>31</strong> ……….<br>
<br>
Do the Harry Potter books live up to the hype? When I first began reading the Philosopher’s Stone, I was immediately struck by how good - and laugh-out-loud funny - the humour was. <strong>32</strong> ………. &nbsp;but Rowling has managed to infuse this book with a lovely wit and charm that will both amuse and delight adults and children.<br>
<br>
Here is an example, with the ending being particularly good:<br>
<br>
<em>"Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large, pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes and thick, blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. </em><strong>33</strong> ………. – <em>Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig."</em><br>
<br>
There are characters in this book that will remind us of all the people we have met. <strong>34</strong> ………. &nbsp;or a bossy and interfering (yet kind-hearted) girl like Hermione. A large number of the younger readers will also be able to easily identify with Harry, especially with his initial feelings of isolation and not belonging, and then through to his excitement at finally leaving that life behind in favour of one where he belongs and will be happy.<br>
<br>
When Harry begins his first term at Hogwarts (a wizarding school) he is not alone in being overawed:<br>
<br>
<em>“‘Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight of Hogwarts in a sec,’ Hagrid called over his shoulder, ‘jus’ round this bend here.’ There was a loud ‘Oooooh!’<br>
The narrow path had opened suddenly on to the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.”</em><br>
<br>
Hogwarts is a truly magical place, not only in the most obvious way but also in all the detail that the author has gone to describe it so vibrantly. It is the place that everybody wishes they could have gone to when they were eleven. <strong>35</strong> ………. &nbsp;The story builds towards an exciting conclusion that has the ultimate feel-good factor.<br>
<br>
J.K. Rowling should be commended for getting so many people reading and excited by books. The biggest surprise must be the effect that this novel had on the adult population, both male and female - at the time the books were published many a commuting train was spotted with Harry Potter books providing world-weary workers with a wonderful sense of escapism. <strong>36</strong> ……….<br>
<br>
Is all the hype about the Harry Potter books justified? In a word, yes, the books are a joy to read and possibly the most rewarding young adult’s book since The Hobbit.</p>

        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Johanna Spyri</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>From the old and pleasantly situated village of Mayenfeld, a footpath winds through green and shady meadows to the foot of the mountains, which on this side look down from their stern and lofty heights upon the valley below. The land grows gradually wilder as the path ascends, and the climber has not gone far before he begins to inhale the fragrance of the short grass and sturdy mountain-plants, for the way is steep and leads directly up to the summits above.<br>
<br>
On a clear sunny morning in June, two figures might be seen climbing the narrow mountain path; one, a tall strong-looking girl, the other a child whom she was leading by the hand, and whose little cheeks were so aglow with heat that the crimson colour could be seen even through the dark, sunburnt skin. And this was hardly to be wondered at, for in spite of the hot June sun, the child was clothed as if to keep off the bitterest frost. She did not look more than five years old, if as much, but what her natural figure was like, it would have been hard to say, for she had apparently two, if not three dresses, one above the other, and over these a thick red woollen shawl wound round about her, so that the little body presented a shapeless appearance, as, with its small feet shod in thick, nailed mountain-shoes, it slowly and laboriously plodded its way up in the heat. The two must have left the valley a good hour's walk behind them, when they came to the hamlet known as Dorfli, which is situated half-way up the mountain. Here the wayfarers met with greetings from all sides, some calling to them from windows, some from open doors, others from outside, for the elder girl was now in her old home. She did not, however, pause in her walk to respond to her friends' welcoming cries and questions, but passed on without stopping for a moment until she reached the last of the scattered houses of the hamlet. Here a voice called to her from the door: "Wait a moment, Dete; if you are going up higher, I will come with you."<br>
<br>
The girl thus addressed stood still, and the child immediately let go her hand and seated herself on the ground.<br>
<br>
"Are you tired, Heidi?" asked her companion.<br>
<br>
"No, I am hot," answered the child.<br>
<br>
"We shall soon get to the top now. You must walk bravely on a little longer, and take good long steps, and in another hour, we shall be there," said Dete in an encouraging voice.<br>
<br>
They were now joined by a stout, good-natured-looking woman, who walked on ahead with her old acquaintance, the two breaking forth at once into lively conversation about everybody and everything in Dorfli and its surroundings, while the child wandered behind them.<br>
<br>
"And where are you off to with the child?" asked the one who had just joined the party. "I suppose it is the child your sister left?"<br>
<br>
"Yes," answered Dete. "I am taking her up to Uncle, where she must stay."<br>
<br>
"The child stay up there with Alm-Uncle! You must be out of your senses, Dete! How can you think of such a thing! The old man, however, will soon send you and your proposal packing off home again!"<br>
<br>
"He cannot very well do that, seeing that he is her grandfather. He must do something for her. I have had the charge of the child till now, and I can tell you, Barbel, I am not going to give up the chance which has just fallen to me of getting a good place, for her sake. It is for the grandfather now to do his duty by her."<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; …<br>
<br>
"I am glad I am not the child!" exclaimed Barbel, with a gesture of horrified pity. "Not a creature knows anything about the old man up there! He will have nothing to do with anybody, and never sets his foot inside a church from one year's end to another. When he does come down once in a while, everybody clears out of the way of him and his big stick. The mere sight of him, with his bushy grey eyebrows and his immense beard, is alarming enough. He looks like any old heathen or Indian, and few would care to meet him alone."<br>
<br>
"Well, and what of that?" said Dete, in a defiant voice, "he is the grandfather all the same, and must look after the child. He is not likely to do her any harm, and if he does, he will be answerable for it, not I."<br>
<br>
"I should very much like to know," continued Barbel, in an inquiring tone of voice, "what the old man has on his conscience that he looks as he does, and lives up there on the mountain like a hermit, hardly ever allowing himself to be seen. All kinds of things are said about him. You, Dete, however, must certainly have learnt a good deal concerning him from your sister--am I not right?"<br>
<br>
"You are right, I did, but I am not going to repeat what I heard; if it should come to his ears I should get into trouble about it."</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;<br><br><strong>The Magic Faraway Tree&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p><em>by Enid Blyton</em>&nbsp;<br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The children ate their breakfast quickly. Mother told them to make sandwiches for themselves and to take a small chocolate cake from the cupboard.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“You can take some doughnuts too,” she said, “and there are apples in that dish over there. When you come home, I’ll bake some potatoes in the oven, and you can eat them with butter and cheese.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Oooh, Mother – we <em>will</em> be hungry!” said Joe at once. “Let’s hurry up with the sandwiches. We want to start off as soon as possible.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Now be home by six o’clock, or I shall worry,” said Mother. “Look after your cousin, Joe.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes, I will,” promised Joe.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At last, everything was ready. Joe packed the food into a leather bag and slung it over his shoulder. Then the four of them set off to the Enchanted Wood.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It didn’t take them long to get there. A narrow ditch was between the lane and the wood.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“You’ve got to jump over the ditch, Rick,” said Joe. They all jumped over. Rick stood still when he was in the wood.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“What a strange noise the leaves of the trees make,” he said. “It’s as if they were talking to one another – telling secrets.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Wisha, wisha, wisha, wisha,” whispered the trees.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“They <em>are</em> telling secrets,” said Beth. “And do you know, Rick – if the trees have any message for us, we can hear it by pressing our left ears to the trunks of the trees! Then we really hear what they say!”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Wisha-wisha-wisha-wisha,” said the trees.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Come on,” said Joe impatiently. “Let’s go to the Faraway Tree.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;They all went on – and soon came to the mysterious magic tree. Rick stared at it in great astonishment.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Wow, it’s simply ENORMOUS!” he said. “I’ve never seen such a big tree in my life. And you can’t possibly see the top. Goodness me! What kind of tree is it? It’s got oak leaves, and yet it doesn’t really seem like an oak.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s a funny tree,” said Beth. “It may grow acorns and oak leaves for a little way – and then suddenly you notice that it’s growing plums. Then, another day it may grow apples or pears. You just never know. But it’s all very exciting.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“How do you climb it?” asked Rick. “In the ordinary way?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Well, we will today,” said Joe, “because we want to show our friends who live inside the tree. But sometimes there’s a rope that is let down the tree, and we can go up easily with the help of that. Or sometimes Moon-Face lets down a cushion on the end of the rope and then pulls us up one by one.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He swung himself up into the tree, and the others followed. After a bit, Rick gave a shout. “Wow! It’s extraordinary! This tree is growing nuts now! Look!”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough it was. Rick picked some and cracked them. They were hazel nuts, ripe and sweet. Everyone had some and enjoyed them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Now when they had all got very high up indeed, Rick was most surprised to see a little window in the trunk of the Faraway Tree.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Goodness – does somebody live just here?” he called to the others. “Look – there’s a window here. I’m going to peep in.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“You’d better not!” shouted Joe. “The Angry Pixie lives there, and he hates people peeping in.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But Rick felt so curious that he just <em>had</em> to peep in. The Angry Pixie was at home. He was filling his kettle with water, when he looked up and saw Rick’s surprised face at his window. Nothing made the pixie more angry than to see people looking at him. He rushed to the window at once and flung it open.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Peeping again!” he shouted. “It’s too bad! All day and night people come peeping. Take that!”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He emptied the kettle of cold water all over poor Rick. Then he slammed his window and drew the curtains across. Joe, Beth and Frannie couldn’t help laughing.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>The Magic Faraway Tree&nbsp;</strong>

          <strong>The Magic Faraway Tree&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Enid Blyton&nbsp;</em><br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The children ate their breakfast quickly. Mother told them to make sandwiches for themselves and to take a small chocolate cake from the cupboard.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“You can take some doughnuts too,” she said, “and there are apples in that dish over there. When you come home, I’ll bake some potatoes in the oven, and you can eat them with butter and cheese.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Oooh, Mother – we <em>will</em> be hungry!” said Joe at once. “Let’s hurry up with the sandwiches. We want to start off as soon as possible.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Now be home by six o’clock, or I shall worry,” said Mother. “Look after your cousin, Joe.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes, I will,” promised Joe.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At last, everything was ready. Joe packed the food into a leather bag and slung it over his shoulder. Then the four of them set off to the Enchanted Wood.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It didn’t take them long to get there. A narrow ditch was between the lane and the wood.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“You’ve got to jump over the ditch, Rick,” said Joe. They all jumped over. Rick stood still when he was in the wood.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“What a strange noise the leaves of the trees make,” he said. “It’s as if they were talking to one another – telling secrets.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Wisha, wisha, wisha, wisha,” whispered the trees.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“They <em>are</em> telling secrets,” said Beth. “And do you know, Rick – if the trees have any message for us, we can hear it by pressing our left ears to the trunks of the trees! Then we really hear what they say!”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Wisha-wisha-wisha-wisha,” said the trees.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Come on,” said Joe impatiently. “Let’s go to the Faraway Tree.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;They all went on – and soon came to the mysterious magic tree. Rick stared at it in great astonishment.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Wow, it’s simply ENORMOUS!” he said. “I’ve never seen such a big tree in my life. And you can’t possibly see the top. Goodness me! What kind of tree is it? It’s got oak leaves, and yet it doesn’t really seem like an oak.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s a funny tree,” said Beth. “It may grow acorns and oak leaves for a little way – and then suddenly you notice that it’s growing plums. Then, another day it may grow apples or pears. You just never know. But it’s all very exciting.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“How do you climb it?” asked Rick. “In the ordinary way?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Well, we will today,” said Joe, “because we want to show our friends who live inside the tree. But sometimes there’s a rope that is let down the tree, and we can go up easily with the help of that. Or sometimes Moon-Face lets down a cushion on the end of the rope and then pulls us up one by one.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He swung himself up into the tree, and the others followed. After a bit, Rick gave a shout. “Wow! It’s extraordinary! This tree is growing nuts now! Look!”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough it was. Rick picked some and cracked them. They were hazel nuts, ripe and sweet. Everyone had some and enjoyed them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Now when they had all got very high up indeed, Rick was most surprised to see a little window in the trunk of the Faraway Tree.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Goodness – does somebody live just here?” he called to the others. “Look – there’s a window here. I’m going to peep in.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“You’d better not!” shouted Joe. “The Angry Pixie lives there, and he hates people peeping in.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But Rick felt so curious that he just <em>had</em> to peep in. The Angry Pixie was at home. He was filling his kettle with water, when he looked up and saw Rick’s surprised face at his window. Nothing made the pixie more angry than to see people looking at him. He rushed to the window at once and flung it open.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Peeping again!” he shouted. “It’s too bad! All day and night people come peeping. Take that!”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He emptied the kettle of cold water all over poor Rick. Then he slammed his window and drew the curtains across. Joe, Beth and Frannie couldn’t help laughing.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>The Magic Faraway Tree&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Enid Blyton&nbsp;</em><br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The children ate their breakfast quickly. Mother told them to make sandwiches for themselves and to take a small chocolate cake from the cupboard.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“You can take some doughnuts too,” she said, “and there are apples in that dish over there. When you come home, I’ll bake some potatoes in the oven, and you can eat them with butter and cheese.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Oooh, Mother – we <em>will</em> be hungry!” said Joe at once. “Let’s hurry up with the sandwiches. We want to start off as soon as possible.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Now be home by six o’clock, or I shall worry,” said Mother. “Look after your cousin, Joe.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes, I will,” promised Joe.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At last, everything was ready. Joe packed the food into a leather bag and slung it over his shoulder. Then the four of them set off to the Enchanted Wood.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It didn’t take them long to get there. A narrow ditch was between the lane and the wood.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“You’ve got to jump over the ditch, Rick,” said Joe. They all jumped over. Rick stood still when he was in the wood.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“What a strange noise the leaves of the trees make,” he said. “It’s as if they were talking to one another – telling secrets.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Wisha, wisha, wisha, wisha,” whispered the trees.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“They <em>are</em> telling secrets,” said Beth. “And do you know, Rick – if the trees have any message for us, we can hear it by pressing our left ears to the trunks of the trees! Then we really hear what they say!”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Wisha-wisha-wisha-wisha,” said the trees.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Come on,” said Joe impatiently. “Let’s go to the Faraway Tree.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;They all went on – and soon came to the mysterious magic tree. Rick stared at it in great astonishment.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Wow, it’s simply ENORMOUS!” he said. “I’ve never seen such a big tree in my life. And you can’t possibly see the top. Goodness me! What kind of tree is it? It’s got oak leaves, and yet it doesn’t really seem like an oak.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s a funny tree,” said Beth. “It may grow acorns and oak leaves for a little way – and then suddenly you notice that it’s growing plums. Then, another day it may grow apples or pears. You just never know. But it’s all very exciting.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“How do you climb it?” asked Rick. “In the ordinary way?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Well, we will today,” said Joe, “because we want to show our friends who live inside the tree. But sometimes there’s a rope that is let down the tree, and we can go up easily with the help of that. Or sometimes Moon-Face lets down a cushion on the end of the rope and then pulls us up one by one.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He swung himself up into the tree, and the others followed. After a bit, Rick gave a shout. “Wow! It’s extraordinary! This tree is growing nuts now! Look!”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough it was. Rick picked some and cracked them. They were hazel nuts, ripe and sweet. Everyone had some and enjoyed them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Now when they had all got very high up indeed, Rick was most surprised to see a little window in the trunk of the Faraway Tree.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Goodness – does somebody live just here?” he called to the others. “Look – there’s a window here. I’m going to peep in.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“You’d better not!” shouted Joe. “The Angry Pixie lives there, and he hates people peeping in.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But Rick felt so curious that he just <em>had</em> to peep in. The Angry Pixie was at home. He was filling his kettle with water, when he looked up and saw Rick’s surprised face at his window. Nothing made the pixie more angry than to see people looking at him. He rushed to the window at once and flung it open.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Peeping again!” he shouted. “It’s too bad! All day and night people come peeping. Take that!”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He emptied the kettle of cold water all over poor Rick. Then he slammed his window and drew the curtains across. Joe, Beth and Frannie couldn’t help laughing.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>The Magic Faraway Tree&nbsp;</strong>

Nick and Matt were going to meet and go to the movies together. The movie started at 6:30 pm and they both wanted to be there at exactly 6:20pm so they could buy tickets and get a seat together. They both didn’t realise that Nick’s watch was 5 minutes fast and Matt’s watch was 3 minutes slow. They both arrived exactly when their watches said it was 6:20.<br>
<br>
Who got there first and how long did they have to wait for the other person to arrive?&nbsp;<br>
