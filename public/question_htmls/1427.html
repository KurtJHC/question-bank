        <p>Taj Mahal, the magnificent monument that stands at the heart of India, has a story that has been melting the hearts of millions of listeners since the time Taj Mahal has been visible. It is a story, that although ending back in 1631, continues to live on in the concrete form of Taj Mahal and is considered a living example of eternal love. <strong>15 ………. </strong>These two people from the course of history have set an example for the people living in the present and the future. As the poet, Edwin Arnold describes it, "Not a piece of architecture, as other buildings are, but the proud passion of an emperor's love wrought in living stones." The story that follows next will prove why that statement is true.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Shah Jahan, initially named Prince Khurram, was born in the year 1592. He was the son of Jehangir, the fourth Mughal emperor of India and the grandson of Akbar the Great. In 1607, Shah Jahan strolled down the Meena Bazaar, accompanied by a string of fawning courtiers. <strong>16 ……….</strong> It was love at first sight and the girl was Mumtaz Mahal, who was known as Arjumand Banu Begum at that time. At that time, he was 14 years old and she, a Muslim Persian princess, was 15. After meeting her, Shah Jahan went back to his father and declared that he wanted to marry her. The match was solemnised five years later i.e., in the year 1612.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was in the year 1628 that Shah Jahan became the Emperor and he entrusted Arjumand Banu with the royal seal. <strong>17 ………. </strong>Though Shah Jahan also had other wives, Mumtaz Mahal was his favourite and accompanied him everywhere, even on military campaigns. In the year 1631, when Mumtaz Mahal was giving birth to their 14th child, she died due to some complications. While Mumtaz was on her deathbed, Shah Jahan promised her that he would never remarry and would build the richest mausoleum over her grave.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It is said that Shah Jahan was so heartbroken after her death that he ordered the court into mourning for two years. Sometime after her death, Shah Jahan undertook the task of creating the world's most beautiful monument in the memory of his beloved. It took 22 years and the labour of 22,000 workers to construct the monument. <strong>18 ………. </strong>This magnificent monument came to be known as "Taj Mahal" and now counts amongst the Seven Wonders of the World. It is the true story of the Taj Mahal of India which has mesmerised many people with its bewitching beauty</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Shah Jahan was wealthy enough to support the Taj Mahal and its mighty maintenance costs. However, over the centuries, the Mughal Empire lost its riches and the Taj Mahal fell into ruins. By the 1800s, the British ousted the Mughals and took over India. The Taj Mahal was dissected for its beauty—the British cut gemstones from its walls, stole silver candlesticks and doors, and even tried to sell the white marble overseas. <strong>19 ……….</strong> Rather than looting the Taj Mahal, Curzon worked to restore it.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Taj Mahal has once again become a magnificent place with 2.5 million visitors each year. <strong>20 ………. </strong>Once a month, visitors also have the opportunity to make a short visit during a full moon to see how the Taj Mahal seems to glow from the inside out in the moonlight. The Taj Mahal was placed on the World Heritage List by UNESCO in 1983, but this protection has not guaranteed its safety. It is now at the mercy of pollutants from nearby factories and excessive humidity from the breath of its visitors.</p>

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Mark Twain said that “Humour is the great thing, the saving thing after all. The minute it crops up, all our hardnesses yield, all our irritations, and resentments flit away and a sunny spirit takes their place.”<br>
<br>
He is certainly not wrong. Humour may very well be the great thing. It touches upon nearly every facet of life — 90 percent of men and 81 percent of women report that a sense of humour is the most important quality in a partner, it’s a crucial quality for leaders and it’s even been shown to improve cancer treatments.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Humour doesn’t just guard against depression. It also improves people’s overall quality of life. Researchers have found that people who score highly in certain types of humour have better self-esteem, more positive affect, greater self-competency, more control over anxiety and better performance in social interactions.<br>
<br>
In addition to working as a mental immune system, research has shown that humour can actually improve your physical immune system.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Laughter can also improve cardiovascular health and lowers heart rates, blood pressure, and muscular tension. Aside from improving your health, laughter can also lead to greater creativity and a productivity tool as well. This is because laughter lights up the anterior cingulate cortex, an area of the brain associated with attention and decision-making.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There’s no doubt that humour is a life skill that everybody needs, but how do we define it? Can it be taught? The jury is still out on those issues.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
A colleague accused me of having a tendency to over-react, so I have no choice but to burn down his house and wish him only bad luck. Fair’s fair, right? I learned to respond strongly to things from a former boss who used to say the following sentence at least once a day: “Some fool has moved my (random object) and when I find out who did it, God help me, I am going to tear this place down… oh, there it is.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Some people think overreacting is a bad thing but look at the evidence. The richest country in the world is the United States, from which a reader has just sent me a video of a man riding a moped pursued by 12 police cars. A moped, for those who don’t know, is a motorbike powered by an engine with the strength of a mosquito suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But just days later, the US record on maximum overreaction was beaten by a news report sent to me by a reader in Canada. Twelve police squad cars and a tactical attack squad were sent to a block of flats in Winnipeg, Ontario, after an unknown person slammed a door in the building.<br>
<br>
This makes me want to live in Canada. I’ve lived in places where the police don’t even react to murders unless they happen at the actual police station, and even then, the only reaction is an irritated desk sergeant looking up from Candy Crush and raising an eyebrow.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Learning how to be funny is an essential people skill. Most people don’t realise you can learn how to be funny. In fact, I want to convince you that the funniest people hone their witty craft. And being funny matters.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
You’ll be more successful if you know how to make people laugh … but only the good kind of laugh, not the awkward kind: So, this is how you do it. Give the opposite answer to yes/no questions. Play with Numbers e.g. only 2000 people at the small party. Use The Rule of 3, that establishes a pattern, then ends with something unexpected. Use a Character Switch e.g. if you meet a bear in the woods, scary for the bear! Use “Whatever” as Your Secret Weapon. Use real-life stories, not jokes. Delay the funny. Now, I am going to end on something you know: practise makes perfect.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Hey, you don't read this book. Do NOT read this book. Just shut it quietly and put it back where you found it. Look, bozo, I'm not kidding. What is there about the last sentence that you don't understand? Are you being rude or are you just really, really stupid? Can you even read? Let me try it one more time: Shut this book and put it back right now. I see we have an extremely difficult customer here. Take my advice, shut this book and put it back on the shelf. It's for your own good. There are BAD things in this book. REALLY BAD things. Not convinced? Then I'm going to have to list some of the things in this book. Don't blame me if it upsets you. It's not my fault; I warned you. VIOLENCE. Yep. There's blood in this book. Red stuff. It's nasty. It's yucky. It's downright gory. SAD THINGS. I'm talking about accidents, people going insane, even dying. We take no responsibility for any deeply traumatic condition that may yuck up your life if you are stupid enough to read this book despite the loads and loads of warnings telling you not to. Good grief! You really are a pest, aren't you? Well, this is your final chance. Put the book down quietly and go away.<br>

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Mark Twain said that “Humour is the great thing, the saving thing after all. The minute it crops up, all our hardnesses yield, all our irritations, and resentments flit away and a sunny spirit takes their place.”<br>
<br>
He is certainly not wrong. Humour may very well be the great thing. It touches upon nearly every facet of life — 90 percent of men and 81 percent of women report that a sense of humour is the most important quality in a partner, it’s a crucial quality for leaders and it’s even been shown to improve cancer treatments.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Humour doesn’t just guard against depression. It also improves people’s overall quality of life. Researchers have found that people who score highly in certain types of humour have better self-esteem, more positive affect, greater self-competency, more control over anxiety and better performance in social interactions.<br>
<br>
In addition to working as a mental immune system, research has shown that humour can actually improve your physical immune system.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Laughter can also improve cardiovascular health and lowers heart rates, blood pressure, and muscular tension. Aside from improving your health, laughter can also lead to greater creativity and a productivity tool as well. This is because laughter lights up the anterior cingulate cortex, an area of the brain associated with attention and decision-making.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There’s no doubt that humour is a life skill that everybody needs, but how do we define it? Can it be taught? The jury is still out on those issues.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
A colleague accused me of having a tendency to over-react, so I have no choice but to burn down his house and wish him only bad luck. Fair’s fair, right? I learned to respond strongly to things from a former boss who used to say the following sentence at least once a day: “Some fool has moved my (random object) and when I find out who did it, God help me, I am going to tear this place down… oh, there it is.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Some people think overreacting is a bad thing but look at the evidence. The richest country in the world is the United States, from which a reader has just sent me a video of a man riding a moped pursued by 12 police cars. A moped, for those who don’t know, is a motorbike powered by an engine with the strength of a mosquito suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But just days later, the US record on maximum overreaction was beaten by a news report sent to me by a reader in Canada. Twelve police squad cars and a tactical attack squad were sent to a block of flats in Winnipeg, Ontario, after an unknown person slammed a door in the building.<br>
<br>
This makes me want to live in Canada. I’ve lived in places where the police don’t even react to murders unless they happen at the actual police station, and even then, the only reaction is an irritated desk sergeant looking up from Candy Crush and raising an eyebrow.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Learning how to be funny is an essential people skill. Most people don’t realise you can learn how to be funny. In fact, I want to convince you that the funniest people hone their witty craft. And being funny matters.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
You’ll be more successful if you know how to make people laugh … but only the good kind of laugh, not the awkward kind: So, this is how you do it. Give the opposite answer to yes/no questions. Play with Numbers e.g. only 2000 people at the small party. Use The Rule of 3, that establishes a pattern, then ends with something unexpected. Use a Character Switch e.g. if you meet a bear in the woods, scary for the bear! Use “Whatever” as Your Secret Weapon. Use real-life stories, not jokes. Delay the funny. Now, I am going to end on something you know: practise makes perfect.<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Hey, you don't read this book. Do NOT read this book. Just shut it quietly and put it back where you found it. Look, bozo, I'm not kidding. What is there about the last sentence that you don't understand? Are you being rude or are you just really, really stupid? Can you even read? Let me try it one more time: Shut this book and put it back right now. I see we have an extremely difficult customer here. Take my advice, shut this book and put it back on the shelf. It's for your own good. There are BAD things in this book. REALLY BAD things. Not convinced? Then I'm going to have to list some of the things in this book. Don't blame me if it upsets you. It's not my fault; I warned you. VIOLENCE. Yep. There's blood in this book. Red stuff. It's nasty. It's yucky. It's downright gory. SAD THINGS. I'm talking about accidents, people going insane, even dying. We take no responsibility for any deeply traumatic condition that may yuck up your life if you are stupid enough to read this book despite the loads and loads of warnings telling you not to. Good grief! You really are a pest, aren't you? Well, this is your final chance. Put the book down quietly and go away.<br>

Mark Twain said that “Humour is the great thing, the saving thing after all. The minute it crops up, all our hardnesses yield, all our irritations, and resentments flit away and a sunny spirit takes their place.”<br>
<br>
He is certainly not wrong. Humour may very well be the great thing. It touches upon nearly every facet of life — 90 percent of men and 81 percent of women report that a sense of humour is the most important quality in a partner, it’s a crucial quality for leaders and it’s even been shown to improve cancer treatments.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Humour doesn’t just guard against depression. It also improves people’s overall quality of life. Researchers have found that people who score highly in certain types of humour have better self-esteem, more positive affect, greater self-competency, more control over anxiety and better performance in social interactions.<br>
<br>
In addition to working as a mental immune system, research has shown that humour can actually improve your physical immune system.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Laughter can also improve cardiovascular health and lowers heart rates, blood pressure, and muscular tension. Aside from improving your health, laughter can also lead to greater creativity and a productivity tool as well. This is because laughter lights up the anterior cingulate cortex, an area of the brain associated with attention and decision-making.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There’s no doubt that humour is a life skill that everybody needs, but how do we define it? Can it be taught? The jury is still out on those issues.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
A colleague accused me of having a tendency to over-react, so I have no choice but to burn down his house and wish him only bad luck. Fair’s fair, right? I learned to respond strongly to things from a former boss who used to say the following sentence at least once a day: “Some fool has moved my (random object) and when I find out who did it, God help me, I am going to tear this place down… oh, there it is.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Some people think overreacting is a bad thing but look at the evidence. The richest country in the world is the United States, from which a reader has just sent me a video of a man riding a moped pursued by 12 police cars. A moped, for those who don’t know, is a motorbike powered by an engine with the strength of a mosquito suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But just days later, the US record on maximum overreaction was beaten by a news report sent to me by a reader in Canada. Twelve police squad cars and a tactical attack squad were sent to a block of flats in Winnipeg, Ontario, after an unknown person slammed a door in the building.<br>
<br>
This makes me want to live in Canada. I’ve lived in places where the police don’t even react to murders unless they happen at the actual police station, and even then, the only reaction is an irritated desk sergeant looking up from Candy Crush and raising an eyebrow.&nbsp;<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Learning how to be funny is an essential people skill. Most people don’t realise you can learn how to be funny. In fact, I want to convince you that the funniest people hone their witty craft. And being funny matters.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
You’ll be more successful if you know how to make people laugh … but only the good kind of laugh, not the awkward kind: So, this is how you do it. Give the opposite answer to yes/no questions. Play with Numbers e.g. only 2000 people at the small party. Use The Rule of 3, that establishes a pattern, then ends with something unexpected. Use a Character Switch e.g. if you meet a bear in the woods, scary for the bear! Use “Whatever” as Your Secret Weapon. Use real-life stories, not jokes. Delay the funny. Now, I am going to end on something you know: practise makes perfect.<br>

Hey, you don't read this book. Do NOT read this book. Just shut it quietly and put it back where you found it. Look, bozo, I'm not kidding. What is there about the last sentence that you don't understand? Are you being rude or are you just really, really stupid? Can you even read? Let me try it one more time: Shut this book and put it back right now. I see we have an extremely difficult customer here. Take my advice, shut this book and put it back on the shelf. It's for your own good. There are BAD things in this book. REALLY BAD things. Not convinced? Then I'm going to have to list some of the things in this book. Don't blame me if it upsets you. It's not my fault; I warned you. VIOLENCE. Yep. There's blood in this book. Red stuff. It's nasty. It's yucky. It's downright gory. SAD THINGS. I'm talking about accidents, people going insane, even dying. We take no responsibility for any deeply traumatic condition that may yuck up your life if you are stupid enough to read this book despite the loads and loads of warnings telling you not to.

          <br>
          <strong>BAMBI</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Felix Salten&nbsp;</em><br><br>
Bambi was often left alone now. But he did not have the same fear of it as he had the first time. His mother would disappear, and then, however much he called for her, she did not come. But then she would reappear unexpectedly. Another time, it happened in full daylight. Bambi had been walking for hours through the dense woods and finally began to call. Not so much because he was afraid, but because he did not want to remain so alone anymore, and he felt he would soon be in a terrible state. So, he began to call for his mother.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, there was one of their fathers standing in front of him, looking at him severely. Bambi had not heard him coming and he was startled. This elder stag looked more powerful than the others, he was taller and more proud. His coat was aflame with a deep dark red, but his face shone silver-grey; and a powerful, black pearled crown extended high above his playful ears.</p>
        <p>“What are you calling for?” the old stag asked severely. Bambi trembled in awe of the elder stag and did not dare to make any answer. “Your mother hasn’t got the time to spend on you now!” the elder continued. Bambi was completely cowed by this imperious voice, but at the same time he felt admiration for it. “Can’t you be by yourself for a while? You should be ashamed of yourself!” Bambi would have liked to say that he could be by himself perfectly well, that he had often been by himself, but he said nothing. He did as he was told and became terribly ashamed. The elder turned round and left him. Bambi did not know how the stag left, where he had gone, did not even know whether he had left quickly or slowly. He was simply gone, just as suddenly as he had arrived. Bambi strained his ears, but he heard no steps moving away from him, no leaf being disturbed. That made him suppose the elder must still be quite near to him, and he smelt the air on every side. He learned nothing from that. Bambi sighed in relief as he was once more alone, but at the same time he yearned to see the old stag again and to make sure he was not displeased with him.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then his mother arrived but Bambi said nothing about his meeting with the elder. Nor did he ever call for her, now, when she was out of sight. He thought about the old stag when he wandered about on his own; he felt a powerful wish to come across him. Then he would say to him, “See? I’m not calling for anyone.” And the elder would praise him. He did speak to Gobo and Faline though, the next time they were together on the meadow. They listened with excitement and they had no experience of their own that could compare with this. “Weren’t you scared?” asked Gobo excitedly. Yes! Bambi admitted, he had been scared. Just a little bit. “I’d have been terribly scared,” Gobo told him. Bambi answered that no, he had not been very scared, because the elder had been so majestic. Gobo told him, “That wouldn’t have been much help for me. I’d have been too scared even to look at him. When I get scared everything flickers in front of my eyes, so that I can’t see anything and&nbsp;my heart beats so hard that I can’t breathe.” What Bambi had told them made Faline very thoughtful and she said nothing.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The next time they met, though, Gobo and Faline rushed to him in great leaps and bounds. They were alone once more, as was Bambi. “We’ve been looking for you for ages,” declared Gobo. “Yes,” said Faline with an air of importance, “as now we know exactly who it was that you saw.” Bambi was so keen to know he jumped in the air. “Who ...!?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Faline took pleasure in saying, “It was the old prince.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“How do you know that?” Bambi wanted to know.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Our mother told us!” retorted Faline.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Bambi was astonished, and he showed it. “Did you tell her about it then?” The two of them nodded their heads. “But that was a secret!” objected Bambi.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Gobo reacted. He quickly tried to excuse himself. “It wasn’t me. It was Faline who did it.” But Faline cheerfully called, “Oh, so what? Secret!? I wanted to know who it was, and now we do know, and that’s much more interesting!” Bambi was burning to hear all about this, and his wish was satisfied. Faline told him everything. “He’s the most noble stag in the whole wood. He’s the prince. There is no second most noble, no one comes near to him. No one knows how old he is. No one knows where he lives. No one knows who his relatives are. Very few have ever even seen him. Now and then there’s a rumour that he’s dead because he hasn’t been seen for a long time. Then somebody catches a glimpse of him and then everyone knows he’s still alive. No one has ever dared to ask him where he’s been. He doesn’t speak to anyone, and no one dares to speak to him. He goes along the paths where no one else ever goes; he knows every part of the wood, even the most distant corner. And nothing is a danger to him. Other princes might tussle with each other, sometimes as a test or in fun but sometimes they fight in earnest. It’s many years since he fought with anyone. And there’s no one still alive who did fight with him a long time ago. He’s the great prince.”&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>BAMBI</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Felix Salten&nbsp;</em><br><br>
Bambi was often left alone now. But he did not have the same fear of it as he had the first time. His mother would disappear, and then, however much he called for her, she did not come. But then she would reappear unexpectedly. Another time, it happened in full daylight. Bambi had been walking for hours through the dense woods and finally began to call. Not so much because he was afraid, but because he did not want to remain so alone anymore, and he felt he would soon be in a terrible state. So, he began to call for his mother.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, there was one of their fathers standing in front of him, looking at him severely. Bambi had not heard him coming and he was startled. This elder stag looked more powerful than the others, he was taller and more proud. His coat was aflame with a deep dark red, but his face shone silver-grey; and a powerful, black pearled crown extended high above his playful ears.</p>
        <p>“What are you calling for?” the old stag asked severely. Bambi trembled in awe of the elder stag and did not dare to make any answer. “Your mother hasn’t got the time to spend on you now!” the elder continued. Bambi was completely cowed by this imperious voice, but at the same time he felt admiration for it. “Can’t you be by yourself for a while? You should be ashamed of yourself!” Bambi would have liked to say that he could be by himself perfectly well, that he had often been by himself, but he said nothing. He did as he was told and became terribly ashamed. The elder turned round and left him. Bambi did not know how the stag left, where he had gone, did not even know whether he had left quickly or slowly. He was simply gone, just as suddenly as he had arrived. Bambi strained his ears, but he heard no steps moving away from him, no leaf being disturbed. That made him suppose the elder must still be quite near to him, and he smelt the air on every side. He learned nothing from that. Bambi sighed in relief as he was once more alone, but at the same time he yearned to see the old stag again and to make sure he was not displeased with him.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then his mother arrived but Bambi said nothing about his meeting with the elder. Nor did he ever call for her, now, when she was out of sight. He thought about the old stag when he wandered about on his own; he felt a powerful wish to come across him. Then he would say to him, “See? I’m not calling for anyone.” And the elder would praise him. He did speak to Gobo and Faline though, the next time they were together on the meadow. They listened with excitement and they had no experience of their own that could compare with this. “Weren’t you scared?” asked Gobo excitedly. Yes! Bambi admitted, he had been scared. Just a little bit. “I’d have been terribly scared,” Gobo told him. Bambi answered that no, he had not been very scared, because the elder had been so majestic. Gobo told him, “That wouldn’t have been much help for me. I’d have been too scared even to look at him. When I get scared everything flickers in front of my eyes, so that I can’t see anything and&nbsp;my heart beats so hard that I can’t breathe.” What Bambi had told them made Faline very thoughtful and she said nothing.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The next time they met, though, Gobo and Faline rushed to him in great leaps and bounds. They were alone once more, as was Bambi. “We’ve been looking for you for ages,” declared Gobo. “Yes,” said Faline with an air of importance, “as now we know exactly who it was that you saw.” Bambi was so keen to know he jumped in the air. “Who ...!?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Faline took pleasure in saying, “It was the old prince.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“How do you know that?” Bambi wanted to know.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Our mother told us!” retorted Faline.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Bambi was astonished, and he showed it. “Did you tell her about it then?” The two of them nodded their heads. “But that was a secret!” objected Bambi.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Gobo reacted. He quickly tried to excuse himself. “It wasn’t me. It was Faline who did it.” But Faline cheerfully called, “Oh, so what? Secret!? I wanted to know who it was, and now we do know, and that’s much more interesting!” Bambi was burning to hear all about this, and his wish was satisfied. Faline told him everything. “He’s the most noble stag in the whole wood. He’s the prince. There is no second most noble, no one comes near to him. No one knows how old he is. No one knows where he lives. No one knows who his relatives are. Very few have ever even seen him. Now and then there’s a rumour that he’s dead because he hasn’t been seen for a long time. Then somebody catches a glimpse of him and then everyone knows he’s still alive. No one has ever dared to ask him where he’s been. He doesn’t speak to anyone, and no one dares to speak to him. He goes along the paths where no one else ever goes; he knows every part of the wood, even the most distant corner. And nothing is a danger to him. Other princes might tussle with each other, sometimes as a test or in fun but sometimes they fight in earnest. It’s many years since he fought with anyone. And there’s no one still alive who did fight with him a long time ago. He’s the great prince.”&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>BAMBI</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Felix Salten&nbsp;</em><br><br>
Bambi was often left alone now. But he did not have the same fear of it as he had the first time. His mother would disappear, and then, however much he called for her, she did not come. But then she would reappear unexpectedly. Another time, it happened in full daylight. Bambi had been walking for hours through the dense woods and finally began to call. Not so much because he was afraid, but because he did not want to remain so alone anymore, and he felt he would soon be in a terrible state. So, he began to call for his mother.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, there was one of their fathers standing in front of him, looking at him severely. Bambi had not heard him coming and he was startled. This elder stag looked more powerful than the others, he was taller and more proud. His coat was aflame with a deep dark red, but his face shone silver-grey; and a powerful, black pearled crown extended high above his playful ears.</p>
        <p>“What are you calling for?” the old stag asked severely. Bambi trembled in awe of the elder stag and did not dare to make any answer. “Your mother hasn’t got the time to spend on you now!” the elder continued. Bambi was completely cowed by this imperious voice, but at the same time he felt admiration for it. “Can’t you be by yourself for a while? You should be ashamed of yourself!” Bambi would have liked to say that he could be by himself perfectly well, that he had often been by himself, but he said nothing. He did as he was told and became terribly ashamed. The elder turned round and left him. Bambi did not know how the stag left, where he had gone, did not even know whether he had left quickly or slowly. He was simply gone, just as suddenly as he had arrived. Bambi strained his ears, but he heard no steps moving away from him, no leaf being disturbed. That made him suppose the elder must still be quite near to him, and he smelt the air on every side. He learned nothing from that. Bambi sighed in relief as he was once more alone, but at the same time he yearned to see the old stag again and to make sure he was not displeased with him.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then his mother arrived but Bambi said nothing about his meeting with the elder. Nor did he ever call for her, now, when she was out of sight. He thought about the old stag when he wandered about on his own; he felt a powerful wish to come across him. Then he would say to him, “See? I’m not calling for anyone.” And the elder would praise him. He did speak to Gobo and Faline though, the next time they were together on the meadow. They listened with excitement and they had no experience of their own that could compare with this. “Weren’t you scared?” asked Gobo excitedly. Yes! Bambi admitted, he had been scared. Just a little bit. “I’d have been terribly scared,” Gobo told him. Bambi answered that no, he had not been very scared, because the elder had been so majestic. Gobo told him, “That wouldn’t have been much help for me. I’d have been too scared even to look at him. When I get scared everything flickers in front of my eyes, so that I can’t see anything and&nbsp;my heart beats so hard that I can’t breathe.” What Bambi had told them made Faline very thoughtful and she said nothing.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The next time they met, though, Gobo and Faline rushed to him in great leaps and bounds. They were alone once more, as was Bambi. “We’ve been looking for you for ages,” declared Gobo. “Yes,” said Faline with an air of importance, “as now we know exactly who it was that you saw.” Bambi was so keen to know he jumped in the air. “Who ...!?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Faline took pleasure in saying, “It was the old prince.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“How do you know that?” Bambi wanted to know.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Our mother told us!” retorted Faline.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Bambi was astonished, and he showed it. “Did you tell her about it then?” The two of them nodded their heads. “But that was a secret!” objected Bambi.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Gobo reacted. He quickly tried to excuse himself. “It wasn’t me. It was Faline who did it.” But Faline cheerfully called, “Oh, so what? Secret!? I wanted to know who it was, and now we do know, and that’s much more interesting!” Bambi was burning to hear all about this, and his wish was satisfied. Faline told him everything. “He’s the most noble stag in the whole wood. He’s the prince. There is no second most noble, no one comes near to him. No one knows how old he is. No one knows where he lives. No one knows who his relatives are. Very few have ever even seen him. Now and then there’s a rumour that he’s dead because he hasn’t been seen for a long time. Then somebody catches a glimpse of him and then everyone knows he’s still alive. No one has ever dared to ask him where he’s been. He doesn’t speak to anyone, and no one dares to speak to him. He goes along the paths where no one else ever goes; he knows every part of the wood, even the most distant corner. And nothing is a danger to him. Other princes might tussle with each other, sometimes as a test or in fun but sometimes they fight in earnest. It’s many years since he fought with anyone. And there’s no one still alive who did fight with him a long time ago. He’s the great prince.”&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>BAMBI</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Felix Salten&nbsp;</em><br><br>
Bambi was often left alone now. But he did not have the same fear of it as he had the first time. His mother would disappear, and then, however much he called for her, she did not come. But then she would reappear unexpectedly. Another time, it happened in full daylight. Bambi had been walking for hours through the dense woods and finally began to call. Not so much because he was afraid, but because he did not want to remain so alone anymore, and he felt he would soon be in a terrible state. So, he began to call for his mother.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, there was one of their fathers standing in front of him, looking at him severely. Bambi had not heard him coming and he was startled. This elder stag looked more powerful than the others, he was taller and more proud. His coat was aflame with a deep dark red, but his face shone silver-grey; and a powerful, black pearled crown extended high above his playful ears.</p>
        <p>“What are you calling for?” the old stag asked severely. Bambi trembled in awe of the elder stag and did not dare to make any answer. “Your mother hasn’t got the time to spend on you now!” the elder continued. Bambi was completely cowed by this imperious voice, but at the same time he felt admiration for it. “Can’t you be by yourself for a while? You should be ashamed of yourself!” Bambi would have liked to say that he could be by himself perfectly well, that he had often been by himself, but he said nothing. He did as he was told and became terribly ashamed. The elder turned round and left him. Bambi did not know how the stag left, where he had gone, did not even know whether he had left quickly or slowly. He was simply gone, just as suddenly as he had arrived. Bambi strained his ears, but he heard no steps moving away from him, no leaf being disturbed. That made him suppose the elder must still be quite near to him, and he smelt the air on every side. He learned nothing from that. Bambi sighed in relief as he was once more alone, but at the same time he yearned to see the old stag again and to make sure he was not displeased with him.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then his mother arrived but Bambi said nothing about his meeting with the elder. Nor did he ever call for her, now, when she was out of sight. He thought about the old stag when he wandered about on his own; he felt a powerful wish to come across him. Then he would say to him, “See? I’m not calling for anyone.” And the elder would praise him. He did speak to Gobo and Faline though, the next time they were together on the meadow. They listened with excitement and they had no experience of their own that could compare with this. “Weren’t you scared?” asked Gobo excitedly. Yes! Bambi admitted, he had been scared. Just a little bit. “I’d have been terribly scared,” Gobo told him. Bambi answered that no, he had not been very scared, because the elder had been so majestic. Gobo told him, “That wouldn’t have been much help for me. I’d have been too scared even to look at him. When I get scared everything flickers in front of my eyes, so that I can’t see anything and&nbsp;my heart beats so hard that I can’t breathe.” What Bambi had told them made Faline very thoughtful and she said nothing.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The next time they met, though, Gobo and Faline rushed to him in great leaps and bounds. They were alone once more, as was Bambi. “We’ve been looking for you for ages,” declared Gobo. “Yes,” said Faline with an air of importance, “as now we know exactly who it was that you saw.” Bambi was so keen to know he jumped in the air. “Who ...!?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Faline took pleasure in saying, “It was the old prince.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“How do you know that?” Bambi wanted to know.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Our mother told us!” retorted Faline.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Bambi was astonished, and he showed it. “Did you tell her about it then?” The two of them nodded their heads. “But that was a secret!” objected Bambi.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Gobo reacted. He quickly tried to excuse himself. “It wasn’t me. It was Faline who did it.” But Faline cheerfully called, “Oh, so what? Secret!? I wanted to know who it was, and now we do know, and that’s much more interesting!” Bambi was burning to hear all about this, and his wish was satisfied. Faline told him everything. “He’s the most noble stag in the whole wood. He’s the prince. There is no second most noble, no one comes near to him. No one knows how old he is. No one knows where he lives. No one knows who his relatives are. Very few have ever even seen him. Now and then there’s a rumour that he’s dead because he hasn’t been seen for a long time. Then somebody catches a glimpse of him and then everyone knows he’s still alive. No one has ever dared to ask him where he’s been. He doesn’t speak to anyone, and no one dares to speak to him. He goes along the paths where no one else ever goes; he knows every part of the wood, even the most distant corner. And nothing is a danger to him. Other princes might tussle with each other, sometimes as a test or in fun but sometimes they fight in earnest. It’s many years since he fought with anyone. And there’s no one still alive who did fight with him a long time ago. He’s the great prince.”&nbsp;</p>

          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>BAMBI</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Felix Salten&nbsp;</em><br><br>
Bambi was often left alone now. But he did not have the same fear of it as he had the first time. His mother would disappear, and then, however much he called for her, she did not come. But then she would reappear unexpectedly. Another time, it happened in full daylight. Bambi had been walking for hours through the dense woods and finally began to call. Not so much because he was afraid, but because he did not want to remain so alone anymore, and he felt he would soon be in a terrible state. So, he began to call for his mother.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, there was one of their fathers standing in front of him, looking at him severely. Bambi had not heard him coming and he was startled. This elder stag looked more powerful than the others, he was taller and more proud. His coat was aflame with a deep dark red, but his face shone silver-grey; and a powerful, black pearled crown extended high above his playful ears.</p>
        <p>“What are you calling for?” the old stag asked severely. Bambi trembled in awe of the elder stag and did not dare to make any answer. “Your mother hasn’t got the time to spend on you now!” the elder continued. Bambi was completely cowed by this imperious voice, but at the same time he felt admiration for it. “Can’t you be by yourself for a while? You should be ashamed of yourself!” Bambi would have liked to say that he could be by himself perfectly well, that he had often been by himself, but he said nothing. He did as he was told and became terribly ashamed. The elder turned round and left him. Bambi did not know how the stag left, where he had gone, did not even know whether he had left quickly or slowly. He was simply gone, just as suddenly as he had arrived. Bambi strained his ears, but he heard no steps moving away from him, no leaf being disturbed. That made him suppose the elder must still be quite near to him, and he smelt the air on every side. He learned nothing from that. Bambi sighed in relief as he was once more alone, but at the same time he yearned to see the old stag again and to make sure he was not displeased with him.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then his mother arrived but Bambi said nothing about his meeting with the elder. Nor did he ever call for her, now, when she was out of sight. He thought about the old stag when he wandered about on his own; he felt a powerful wish to come across him. Then he would say to him, “See? I’m not calling for anyone.” And the elder would praise him. He did speak to Gobo and Faline though, the next time they were together on the meadow. They listened with excitement and they had no experience of their own that could compare with this. “Weren’t you scared?” asked Gobo excitedly. Yes! Bambi admitted, he had been scared. Just a little bit. “I’d have been terribly scared,” Gobo told him. Bambi answered that no, he had not been very scared, because the elder had been so majestic. Gobo told him, “That wouldn’t have been much help for me. I’d have been too scared even to look at him. When I get scared everything flickers in front of my eyes, so that I can’t see anything and&nbsp;my heart beats so hard that I can’t breathe.” What Bambi had told them made Faline very thoughtful and she said nothing.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The next time they met, though, Gobo and Faline rushed to him in great leaps and bounds. They were alone once more, as was Bambi. “We’ve been looking for you for ages,” declared Gobo. “Yes,” said Faline with an air of importance, “as now we know exactly who it was that you saw.” Bambi was so keen to know he jumped in the air. “Who ...!?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Faline took pleasure in saying, “It was the old prince.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“How do you know that?” Bambi wanted to know.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Our mother told us!” retorted Faline.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Bambi was astonished, and he showed it. “Did you tell her about it then?” The two of them nodded their heads. “But that was a secret!” objected Bambi.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Gobo reacted. He quickly tried to excuse himself. “It wasn’t me. It was Faline who did it.” But Faline cheerfully called, “Oh, so what? Secret!? I wanted to know who it was, and now we do know, and that’s much more interesting!” Bambi was burning to hear all about this, and his wish was satisfied. Faline told him everything. “He’s the most noble stag in the whole wood. He’s the prince. There is no second most noble, no one comes near to him. No one knows how old he is. No one knows where he lives. No one knows who his relatives are. Very few have ever even seen him. Now and then there’s a rumour that he’s dead because he hasn’t been seen for a long time. Then somebody catches a glimpse of him and then everyone knows he’s still alive. No one has ever dared to ask him where he’s been. He doesn’t speak to anyone, and no one dares to speak to him. He goes along the paths where no one else ever goes; he knows every part of the wood, even the most distant corner. And nothing is a danger to him. Other princes might tussle with each other, sometimes as a test or in fun but sometimes they fight in earnest. It’s many years since he fought with anyone. And there’s no one still alive who did fight with him a long time ago. He’s the great prince.”&nbsp;</p>

But all of us has got the woods.&nbsp;<br>

It don't belong to me;&nbsp;<br>
The boss he owns the timber - still,&nbsp;<br>
It's there fer me to see.&nbsp;<br>
An', 'twixt the ownin' of the same&nbsp;<br>
An' smellin' of its smell,&nbsp;<br>
I've got the best of that there game.&nbsp;<br>
An' so I'm feelin' well.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The boss in town unrolls a map&nbsp;<br>
An' proudly says, "It's mine."&nbsp;<br>
But he don't drink no maple sap&nbsp;<br>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Apollo 13: The moon-mission that dodged disaster&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Apollo 13 was NASA's third moon-landing mission, but the astronauts never made it to the lunar surface. An oxygen tank explosion almost 56 hours into the flight forced the crew to abandon all thoughts of reaching the moon. The spacecraft was damaged, but the crew were able to seek cramped shelter in the lunar module for the trip back to Earth, before returning to the command module for an uncomfortable splashdown. <strong>15 ………. </strong>It also illustrates NASA's innovative mind’s ability to work together to save lives on the fly. The Apollo 13 mission celebrates its 50th anniversary this year on April 11.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Apollo 13 astronauts were commander James Lovell, lunar module pilot Fred Haise and command module pilot John "Jack" Swigert. Apollo 13 launched on April 11, 1970. The Apollo spacecraft was made up of two independent spacecrafts joined by a tunnel: orbiter Odyssey and lander Aquarius. The crew lived in Odyssey on the journey to the moon. <strong>16 ………. </strong>Mission controller, Sy Liebergot then saw a low-pressure warning signal on a hydrogen tank in Odyssey. The signal could have shown a problem or could have indicated the hydrogen just needed to be resettled by heating and fanning the gas inside the tank. That procedure was called a "cryo stir," and was supposed to stop the supercold gas from settling into layers.</p>
        <p>Swigert flipped the switch for the routine procedure. A moment later, the entire spacecraft shook. Alarm lights lit up in Odyssey and in Mission Control as oxygen pressure fell and power disappeared. The crew notified Mission Control, with Swigert famously saying, "Houston, we've had a problem." (Note that the 1995 movie "Apollo 13" took some creative license with the phrase, changing it to "Houston, we have a problem," and having the words come out of Apollo 13 commander James Lovell's mouth.) Much later, a NASA accident investigation board determined wires were exposed in the oxygen tank because of a combination of manufacturing and testing errors before flight. <strong>17 ………. </strong>It ripped apart one oxygen tank and damaged another inside the spacecraft. Since oxygen fed Odyssey's fuel cells, power was reduced as well. The spacecraft's attitude control thrusters, sensing the venting oxygen, tried to stabilise the spacecraft through firing small jets. The system wasn't very successful given several of the jets were slammed shut by the explosion.</p>
        <p>Fortunately for Apollo 13, the damaged Odyssey had a healthy backup. It was Aquarius, which wasn't supposed to be turned on until the crew was close to landing on the moon. Haise and Lovell frantically worked to boot Aquarius up in less time than designed. <strong>18 ………. </strong>So, as Lovell and Haise got the lunar module up and running, Swigert remained in Odyssey to shut down its systems to conserve power for splashdown.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The crew had to balance the challenge of getting home with the challenge of preserving power on Aquarius. After they performed a crucial burn to point the spacecraft back towards Earth, the crew powered down every nonessential system in the spacecraft. Without a source of heat, cabin temperatures quickly dropped down close to freezing. Some food became inedible. The crew also rationed water to make sure Aquarius — operating for longer than it was designed — would have enough liquid to cool its hardware down. <strong>19 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>On Earth, flight director Gene Kranz pulled his shift of controllers off regular rotation to focus on managing consumables like water and power. Other mission control teams helped the crew with its daily activities. Spacecraft manufacturers worked around the clock to support NASA and the crew. It was a rough journey home. The entire spaceflight crew lost weight and Haise developed a kidney infection. But the small vessel protected and carried the crew long enough to reach Earth's atmosphere. In the hours before splashdown, the exhausted crew scrambled back over to the Odyssey and powered it up. <strong>20 ………. </strong>However, thanks to safeguards put in place after the Apollo 1 disaster, there were no issues. Lovell, Haise and Swigert splashed down safely in the Pacific Ocean near Samoa, on April 17.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Apollo 13: The moon-mission that dodged disaster&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Apollo 13 was NASA's third moon-landing mission, but the astronauts never made it to the lunar surface. An oxygen tank explosion almost 56 hours into the flight forced the crew to abandon all thoughts of reaching the moon. The spacecraft was damaged, but the crew were able to seek cramped shelter in the lunar module for the trip back to Earth, before returning to the command module for an uncomfortable splashdown. <strong>15 ………. </strong>It also illustrates NASA's innovative mind’s ability to work together to save lives on the fly. The Apollo 13 mission celebrates its 50th anniversary this year on April 11.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Apollo 13 astronauts were commander James Lovell, lunar module pilot Fred Haise and command module pilot John "Jack" Swigert. Apollo 13 launched on April 11, 1970. The Apollo spacecraft was made up of two independent spacecrafts joined by a tunnel: orbiter Odyssey and lander Aquarius. The crew lived in Odyssey on the journey to the moon. <strong>16 ………. </strong>Mission controller, Sy Liebergot then saw a low-pressure warning signal on a hydrogen tank in Odyssey. The signal could have shown a problem or could have indicated the hydrogen just needed to be resettled by heating and fanning the gas inside the tank. That procedure was called a "cryo stir," and was supposed to stop the supercold gas from settling into layers.</p>
        <p>Swigert flipped the switch for the routine procedure. A moment later, the entire spacecraft shook. Alarm lights lit up in Odyssey and in Mission Control as oxygen pressure fell and power disappeared. The crew notified Mission Control, with Swigert famously saying, "Houston, we've had a problem." (Note that the 1995 movie "Apollo 13" took some creative license with the phrase, changing it to "Houston, we have a problem," and having the words come out of Apollo 13 commander James Lovell's mouth.) Much later, a NASA accident investigation board determined wires were exposed in the oxygen tank because of a combination of manufacturing and testing errors before flight. <strong>17 ………. </strong>It ripped apart one oxygen tank and damaged another inside the spacecraft. Since oxygen fed Odyssey's fuel cells, power was reduced as well. The spacecraft's attitude control thrusters, sensing the venting oxygen, tried to stabilise the spacecraft through firing small jets. The system wasn't very successful given several of the jets were slammed shut by the explosion.</p>
        <p>Fortunately for Apollo 13, the damaged Odyssey had a healthy backup. It was Aquarius, which wasn't supposed to be turned on until the crew was close to landing on the moon. Haise and Lovell frantically worked to boot Aquarius up in less time than designed. <strong>18 ………. </strong>So, as Lovell and Haise got the lunar module up and running, Swigert remained in Odyssey to shut down its systems to conserve power for splashdown.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The crew had to balance the challenge of getting home with the challenge of preserving power on Aquarius. After they performed a crucial burn to point the spacecraft back towards Earth, the crew powered down every nonessential system in the spacecraft. Without a source of heat, cabin temperatures quickly dropped down close to freezing. Some food became inedible. The crew also rationed water to make sure Aquarius — operating for longer than it was designed — would have enough liquid to cool its hardware down. <strong>19 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>On Earth, flight director Gene Kranz pulled his shift of controllers off regular rotation to focus on managing consumables like water and power. Other mission control teams helped the crew with its daily activities. Spacecraft manufacturers worked around the clock to support NASA and the crew. It was a rough journey home. The entire spaceflight crew lost weight and Haise developed a kidney infection. But the small vessel protected and carried the crew long enough to reach Earth's atmosphere. In the hours before splashdown, the exhausted crew scrambled back over to the Odyssey and powered it up. <strong>20 ………. </strong>However, thanks to safeguards put in place after the Apollo 1 disaster, there were no issues. Lovell, Haise and Swigert splashed down safely in the Pacific Ocean near Samoa, on April 17.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Apollo 13: The moon-mission that dodged disaster&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Apollo 13 was NASA's third moon-landing mission, but the astronauts never made it to the lunar surface. An oxygen tank explosion almost 56 hours into the flight forced the crew to abandon all thoughts of reaching the moon. The spacecraft was damaged, but the crew were able to seek cramped shelter in the lunar module for the trip back to Earth, before returning to the command module for an uncomfortable splashdown. <strong>15 ………. </strong>It also illustrates NASA's innovative mind’s ability to work together to save lives on the fly. The Apollo 13 mission celebrates its 50th anniversary this year on April 11.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Apollo 13 astronauts were commander James Lovell, lunar module pilot Fred Haise and command module pilot John "Jack" Swigert. Apollo 13 launched on April 11, 1970. The Apollo spacecraft was made up of two independent spacecrafts joined by a tunnel: orbiter Odyssey and lander Aquarius. The crew lived in Odyssey on the journey to the moon. <strong>16 ………. </strong>Mission controller, Sy Liebergot then saw a low-pressure warning signal on a hydrogen tank in Odyssey. The signal could have shown a problem or could have indicated the hydrogen just needed to be resettled by heating and fanning the gas inside the tank. That procedure was called a "cryo stir," and was supposed to stop the supercold gas from settling into layers.</p>
        <p>Swigert flipped the switch for the routine procedure. A moment later, the entire spacecraft shook. Alarm lights lit up in Odyssey and in Mission Control as oxygen pressure fell and power disappeared. The crew notified Mission Control, with Swigert famously saying, "Houston, we've had a problem." (Note that the 1995 movie "Apollo 13" took some creative license with the phrase, changing it to "Houston, we have a problem," and having the words come out of Apollo 13 commander James Lovell's mouth.) Much later, a NASA accident investigation board determined wires were exposed in the oxygen tank because of a combination of manufacturing and testing errors before flight. <strong>17 ………. </strong>It ripped apart one oxygen tank and damaged another inside the spacecraft. Since oxygen fed Odyssey's fuel cells, power was reduced as well. The spacecraft's attitude control thrusters, sensing the venting oxygen, tried to stabilise the spacecraft through firing small jets. The system wasn't very successful given several of the jets were slammed shut by the explosion.</p>
        <p>Fortunately for Apollo 13, the damaged Odyssey had a healthy backup. It was Aquarius, which wasn't supposed to be turned on until the crew was close to landing on the moon. Haise and Lovell frantically worked to boot Aquarius up in less time than designed. <strong>18 ………. </strong>So, as Lovell and Haise got the lunar module up and running, Swigert remained in Odyssey to shut down its systems to conserve power for splashdown.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The crew had to balance the challenge of getting home with the challenge of preserving power on Aquarius. After they performed a crucial burn to point the spacecraft back towards Earth, the crew powered down every nonessential system in the spacecraft. Without a source of heat, cabin temperatures quickly dropped down close to freezing. Some food became inedible. The crew also rationed water to make sure Aquarius — operating for longer than it was designed — would have enough liquid to cool its hardware down. <strong>19 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>On Earth, flight director Gene Kranz pulled his shift of controllers off regular rotation to focus on managing consumables like water and power. Other mission control teams helped the crew with its daily activities. Spacecraft manufacturers worked around the clock to support NASA and the crew. It was a rough journey home. The entire spaceflight crew lost weight and Haise developed a kidney infection. But the small vessel protected and carried the crew long enough to reach Earth's atmosphere. In the hours before splashdown, the exhausted crew scrambled back over to the Odyssey and powered it up. <strong>20 ………. </strong>However, thanks to safeguards put in place after the Apollo 1 disaster, there were no issues. Lovell, Haise and Swigert splashed down safely in the Pacific Ocean near Samoa, on April 17.</p>
