<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of expectations and reality. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
A problem with expectations was made famous by the Charles Dickens 1861 novel, "Great Expectations". The main character, Pip, inherits money from a secret benefactor. He views this fortune as a stepping stone to marrying the girl of his dreams.
<p><br>
When he ultimately learned that the money was not necessarily part of that larger plan, he realised that he had taken for granted so many important relationships and gifts in his life. His expectations had robbed him of fully appreciating his reality.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of expectations and reality. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Research backs up the idea that we may not fully appreciate what we have when we are expecting more or comparing what we have to what we could have. One study found that participants who were exposed to a subliminal reminder of wealth spent less time savouring a chocolate bar and exhibited less enjoyment of the experience than other subjects who weren't reminded of wealth.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
This is an interesting study that can remind us all to try to savour our chocolate (and lives) more, and perhaps to try not to remind ourselves of what we don't have. This study can also remind us, however, of how easy it is to let our thoughts colour our enjoyment of what we actually have.<br>
<br>
How many times have we focused so much on something we wanted that we didn't truly savour what we had? How often might our expectations for great things make us feel like what we have isn't really that great (when there are many people who have less)?<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of expectations and reality. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Our expectations can get the better of us when we expect more than what is realistic in a given situation. We might expect our partners to live up to what we see in romance films, our jobs to be idealised versions we had as children, or even our lives to match up to what we see on Instagram.<br>
<br>
Our expectations can create significant stress when they don't match up to reality. Also consider how social media can greatly contribute to this: we compare our own worst moments (those not deemed to be shareable online) to others' best moments, which very often are filtered to seem perfect. We may not even realise this mismatched comparison.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of expectations and reality. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
If you'd like to get out of the expectations vs. reality trap, it all comes down to awareness. Becoming aware of what you are expecting is a great start. Becoming aware of what you "should" be expecting is also a wise idea.<br>
<br>
When you find that what is happening is not what you expected, actively look for the positives in what you have. You may find that once you get over the disappointment, you have something you didn't initially realise you wanted. This helps you to be more appreciative of what you have.</p>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of emotions. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Emotions give us clues about how to respond to things happening in our environment: <em>Is he dangerous? Does she love me? Can I trust him?</em>

<p><br>
But can we trust our perceptions as we travel around the globe? Can Japanese tourists identify threatening people in Canada? Can a man from Saudi Arabia tell the difference between anger and disgust in Argentina?<br>
<br>
A long line of research suggests the answer is basically “yes”—humans appear to express certain fundamental emotions through universal facial expressions that are usually recognisable to people from other cultures. This seems to be true even across cultures that have had little or no exposure to each other.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of emotions. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Jessica Tracy, a University of British Columbia researcher who studies emotions—pride, in particular—agrees that studying children in emotion recognition tasks can be tricky, especially when children are from small-scale, non-literate societies.<br>
<br>
“I don’t think we really know how early children learn how to pair emotion words with their sense of what an emotion is,” she says. “The idea behind universality of emotion isn’t saying that every child is born knowing that a word goes with a particular emotional expression; it’s saying people evolved to understand the emotion behind an expression.”<br>
<br>
That’s why researchers who work with children—and even with adults in these kinds of societies—usually have to come up with more ingenious ways to study what they understand about an emotional expression, she adds. For example, in past research many scientists have used stories to give context for an emotion, perhaps by asking a participant to say what face in a group of photos looks like someone who is being attacked by a wild boar.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of emotions. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
<em>How do people feel?</em><br>
<br>
“At first, the question seemed flaky,” said Orlagh O’Brien. But for the quiet, withdrawn graphic designer, it was an earnest search for connection. She wondered whether others also felt emotions as physical sensations — anger as a tightness in the gut, happiness as a warm tingle. “We think we’re trapped with a whole world of individuality inside of ourselves, and I had this sense that we have more in common than we realise.”<br>
<br>
So, O’Brien led a survey of about 250 people over the course of three months. After asking respondents to describe five emotions in drawings, colours and words, she created Emotionally Vague, an online data visualisation of the results. Sure enough, distinct patterns emerged. For example, she asked respondents to draw lines on a human silhouette to illustrate each emotion. The more pleasurable the emotion, the more the lines radiated outward; the more painful the emotion, the more they contracted inward.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of emotions. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
In a study recently published in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences</em>, more than 700 participants were shown two blank silhouettes alongside words, movies, stories, and facial expressions. They were then asked to rate how they felt and where on their body they felt it, corresponding to the silhouettes. This created an overall picture of bodily responses to emotions, with depression and sadness leading to numbed feelings in the extremities and anxiety centered in the torso.<br>
<br>
The researchers acknowledge that "[all] cultures have body-related expressions for describing emotional states" — such as "butterflies in the stomach" — that don't necessarily have an actual physiological link, and thus, some of the feelings experienced by the participants could be societally influenced rather than organic. But, even though they can't rule out such a possibility, the authors say the results of the study don't agree with that argument. Researchers claim they found a strong consensus in physical responses to a given emotion in people from a range of cultural and linguistic backgrounds, suggesting that these are "universal sensation patterns triggered by activation of emotion systems."</p>

<br>
School leavers interested in learning a trade but dissuaded by society’s bias toward university are encouraged to genuinely compare the two options. When it comes to employability, cost and earning potential, a trade option often can come out on top.<br>
<br>
NECA Electrical Apprenticeships general manager, Tom Emeleus says more school leavers are going to university based on a myth that it is the only way to secure a strong future but fewer jobs require a degree than many people think. “We’re setting up a generation of youth with unrealistic job expectations and large debt,” he says. In NSW there are 10 qualified school teachers seeking employment for every available job. This is just one of numerous examples. “Tradies understand the value of a trade and the career opportunities it represents but the message isn’t getting through to school leavers.”<br>
<br>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of career options. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
&nbsp;
<p>Of 2014’s apprentice and trainee graduates, 84.1 per cent were employed after completion, the National Centre for Vocational Education Research finds. Of university graduates from the same year, by comparison, 68.8 per cent of those looking for full-time work found it within four months, Graduate Careers Australia data shows.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Emeleus says electrical apprentices in particular have high employment rates and 99 per cent of NECA apprentices are immediately hired. Electrician, Ben Proudfoot does not regret his choice to pursue a trade over university as he was hired straight out of his apprenticeship by host employer Stowe Australia. Proudfoot, a NECA graduate, says his parents never pressured him to go to university but some of his friends that chose that path did not understand the appeals of an apprenticeship – although now they do. “Some of them are happy with what they are doing but some go ‘oh I wish I had a trade’ when they see what I can do,” he says.<br>

<br>
University fees differ depending on degree and institution but range from $6000 to $10,000 a year. An apprenticeship, on the other hand, is paid for by the employer so the apprentice can graduate without debt. They also earn while they learn unlike with a university degree, during which students must rely on parents or work part time on top of study.<br>
<br>
A first-year apprentice bricklayer employed on award rates, for example, usually earns $12.78 an hour, increasing to $20.07 an hour as a fourth-year apprentice. In electrical trades, Emeleus says an apprentice will typically earn $150,000 over the course of their training.<br>

The median annual starting salary for a new bachelor degree graduate younger than 25 and in their first full-time job was $54,000 in 2015, Graduate Careers Australia reveals. By comparison, NCVER finds the median annual income of a VET graduate working full time is $56,000. For those employed before finishing training, the median was even higher at $59,000.<br>

Emeleus says new electricians on award rates start on $56,000 but many in the construction industry can earn as much as $80,000 to $91,000 a year straight out of their apprenticeship.<br>
<br>
TAFE NSW Illawarra Institute director, Di Murray says people are surprised how far a trade, and vocational education, can take them. “You only have to think about how much you might pay a plumber to come in and do some work for you – trade qualifications can pay very well,’’ she says.&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of board games. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
In the board game, Pandemic, several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all over the world! The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The game board depicts several major population centres on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but there are also ‘Epidemic!’ cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the 'normal' spread of the infections.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Team players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five - but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spread beyond recovery the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win!&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of board games. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Playing board games is entertaining, but that is only one benefit of board game playing. There has been quite a resurgence in the popularity of board games, and for many people, playing board games connects them with their past. Playing board games brings people closer, strengthens relationships, and can help you meet new people.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Board games can be for two or more players. The foundation of some board game is cooperation, but others pit the players against each other. It is the perfect way to spend time in nice company and strengthen bonds with other human beings.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Playing board games increases brain function. Playing is exercise for your brain. Playing stimulates brain areas that are responsible for memory formation and complex thought processes for all ages. Playing board games teaches you how to set goals and be patient. Winning takes strategy and patience. In a happy environment these things are learned in a stress-free and challenging but fun way. Playing board games is great for reducing stress and makes for laughter. A side effect of board game playing is laughter.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of board games. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Chess is a game of strategy and tactics. Each player commands an army of 16 chessmen --- pawns and other pieces (the king, queen, bishops, knights, and rooks). A well-played chess game has three stages.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
In the opening, the players bring out their forces in preparation for combat. The middle-game begins as the players maneuver for position and carry out attacks and counterattacks. The final stage is the end-game when, with fewer pawns and pieces left on the board, it is safer for the kings to come out and join the final battle.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
As play proceeds, each player will capture some of the opponent's men. As long as the piece a player gives up is generally equal to the piece he gets in return, we say the players are exchanging. If you unintentionally place a piece where it can be captured without getting a piece of equal value in return, we say that you put that piece en prise. (This is a French term that literally means "in take".) Sometimes a player may place a piece en prise in order to trick an opponent. If the opponent captures the offered man, it may leave him open to attack.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of board games. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
No chess player has a more well-known public figure than Magnus Carlsen, of Norway. Two weeks ago, at a press conference, Magnus Carlsen and his opponent, Fabiano Caruana were asked to name their favourite chess players from the past. Caruana answered with ‘Bobby Fischer’, the brilliant American whose dynamic play broke the Russian dominance of the game. Carlsen gave a different answer: “Probably myself, like, three or four years ago,” he said. The media members in attendance laughed and applauded.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
It was classic Carlsen: arrogant and self-critical at the same time and very charming. And who could disagree with him? Just before his twenty-third birthday, in 2013, Carlsen, who was already the No. 1 player in the world, won his first world championship, beating Viswanathan Anand in such swift and decisive fashion that they did not even play the final two games. Carlsen is now widely regarded as the best chess player of all time. He has been the top player in the world since 2011, and the reigning world champion ever since that victory over Anand. He has achieved history’s highest Elo rating, the system used to evaluate a player’s skill. He has won in nearly every manner possible—with aggressive attacks and astonishing defense, with Houdini-like escapes and by slowly gaining control of the board.&nbsp;<br>

HOW DO BEES MAKE HONEYCOMB?</strong>
        <p><br>
Ever wondered where the term “busy as a bee” came from? Well, here is your answer. Honeybees work day and night in their hives making an enchanting and intricately built geometric phenomenon that we call honeycomb. How—and why—do those little fluffy guys all work together to produce the hexagonal honeycomb shape that a lot of people know and love? <strong>(A)</strong> ……….&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Honeybees are fascinating for a number of reasons. Their work ethic, the sweet syrup they secrete, and the intricate social structure of their homes used for storing honey are just a few. Honeycombs lie inside the beehives. <strong>(B)</strong> ……….&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Why Do Bees Make Honeycomb?</strong><br>
While this is a common condiment, bees do not necessarily create honey for humans to benefit. Though humans can enjoy the many health benefits offered by honey, it is primarily essential for bees to survive the winter months. <strong>(C)</strong> ……….&nbsp; This results in bees having to rely on the honey resources they have built up as the “winter cluster”. Because this is so essential for bees to survive, they have perfected the art of the honeycombs’ hexagonal architectural design.</p>
        <p>If you are wondering how a group of bees choose the perfect location to build the honeycomb, it’s primarily achieved by finding a surface they feel suitable for their hive. <strong>(D)</strong> ……….&nbsp; After they find a safe and protected place, the group of bees begin construction at the top and work their way down.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Why is Honeycomb Hexagonal?</strong><br>
Why the hexagon, of all shapes? <strong>(E)</strong> ……….&nbsp; (Scientists even claim that bees are excellent mathematicians.) <strong>(F)</strong> ……….&nbsp; This shape allows the bee to fit into the structure, as well as contains the nectar and stores it. Let’s call this their very own honey jar. Not only do the honeycomb cells hold the bees’ honey stores and nectar, they also store pollen, water, and larvae</p>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of childhood memories. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
If you can’t remember life as an infant, you’re not alone. As adults looking back to childhood, we cannot typically recall anything before age 3-4 years. This phenomenon is known as infantile amnesia. Although some individuals report very early memories of being walked in their pram as a baby, or falling asleep in a cot, these memories are likely to be fictional. One of the most important developments for the onset of memory is language. Research shows that language is needed not just for sharing our experiences, but for encoding them. For example, young children invited to use a fictional “magic shrinking machine” could only recall this one year later if they had the appropriate vocabulary at the time of the event.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of childhood memories. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
While the development of language and sense of self enable our earliest childhood memories to form, family factors shape their contents. Within families, parents reminisce with their children multiple times a day – reliving family holidays, for example, or bonding over sibling hijinks, or reflecting on past transgressions to discuss the lessons learned.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Interestingly, however, there are strong individual differences in the way they do so. Some parents use a highly “elaborative” reminiscing style: asking questions and providing event detail and structure in a way that scaffolds and encourages the child’s own contribution. Others are less elaborative. Some parents also focus particularly on emotional content (“She was really sad! Why did she start crying?”), while others focus more on factual details. These individual differences have important implications, with children eventually coming to adopt the personalised style of their parents: first during shared reminiscing conversations, and later in their own independent memories.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of childhood memories. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Broader family structures and experiences also play a role. In Italy, children growing up in intergenerational households tend to have both earlier childhood memories and more childhood memories than children growing up in traditional nuclear families. This probably occurs due to more opportunities to engage in rich and elaborative reminiscing conversations.&nbsp;
<p><br>
Consistent with the “individualist” values of Western culture, American college students’ earliest childhood memories are typically long, specific and self-focused. Consistent with the “collectivist” values of Chinese culture, Chinese students’ earliest childhood memories are typically brief, and more likely to reference social responsibilities. In New Zealand, where Māori culture includes a rich oral tradition in which stories are shared across generations, Māori mothers have been found to reminisce differently to Pākehā (European New Zealand) mothers about important life events. When talking with their children about their own birth stories, for example, Māori mothers include more elaborations, more references to emotion, and more references to relational time.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of childhood memories. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
In our recent study, we asked more than 6,000 people of all ages to tell us what their first autobiographical memory was, how old they were when the event happened, to rate how emotional and vivid it was and to report what perspective the memory was “seen” from.<br>
<br>
We found that on average, people reported their first memory occurring during the first half of the third year of their lives (3.24 years to be precise). This matches well with other studies that have investigated the age of early memories. In our study, we found that around 40% of participants reported remembering events from the age of two or below – and 14% of people recalled memories from age one and below. However, psychological research suggests that memories occurring below the age of three are highly unusual – and indeed, highly improbable.<br>

<br>
Gunpowder Plot</strong><br><br>
The Gunpowder Plot was a failed attempt to blow up England’s King James I and the Parliament on November 5, 1605. The plot was organised by Robert Catesby in an effort to end the persecution of Roman Catholics by the English government. Catesby and others hoped to replace the country’s Protestant government with Catholic leadership. Around midnight on November 4, 1605, one of the conspirators, Guy Fawkes, was arrested. <strong>(A)</strong>&nbsp;………. Fawkes and other men involved in the plot were tried and executed for treason. Every November 5, the British celebrate Guy Fawkes Day by burning Fawkes in effigy.</p>
        <p>At about midnight on the night of November 4-5, Sir Thomas Knyvet, a justice of the peace, found Guy Fawkes lurking in a cellar under the Parliament building. <strong>(B)</strong> ………. The search resulted in thirty-six barrels of gunpowder being found, and Fawkes was taken into custody. After being tortured, Fawkes revealed he was a participant in an English Catholic conspiracy to annihilate England’s Protestant government and replace it with Catholic leadership.</p>
        <p>What became known as the Gunpowder Plot was organised by Robert Catesby, an English Catholic who was out for revenge. <strong>(C)</strong> ………. Guy Fawkes had converted to Catholicism. His religious zeal led him to fight in the army of Catholic Spain in the Protestant Netherlands.</p>
        <p>Catesby and the handful of other plotters rented a cellar that extended under the House of Lords building, and Fawkes planted the gunpowder there. However, as the November 5 opening meeting of Parliament approached, Lord Monteagle (1575-1622), the brother-in-law of one of the conspirators, received an anonymous letter. <strong>(D)</strong> ………. Monteagle alerted the government hours before the attack was to have taken place. Fawkes and the explosives were found. By torturing Fawkes, King James’ government learned the identities of his co-conspirators. During the next few weeks, English authorities killed or captured all the plotters and put the survivors on trial. Fawkes and the other surviving chief conspirators were sentenced to be hanged in London, but Fawkes jumped from a ladder while climbing to the gallows and died.</p>
        <p>In 1606, Parliament established November 5 as a day of public thanksgiving. Guy Fawkes Night is also referred to as Guy Fawkes Day and Bonfire Night. <strong>(E)</strong> ………. As dusk falls, villagers and city dwellers across Britain light bonfires, set off fireworks and burn effigies of Fawkes.<br>
Today, Guy Fawkes Day is celebrated in the United Kingdom, and in a number of countries that were formerly part of the British Empire, with parades, fireworks, bonfires, and food. Straw effigies of Fawkes are tossed on the bonfire. <strong>(F)</strong> ………. But traditionally, children carried these effigies, called “Guys”, through the streets in the days leading up to Guy Fawkes Day, and asked passers-by for “a penny for the guy,” often reciting rhymes associated with the occasion, the best known of which dates from the 18th century:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Remember, remember; The fifth of November; Gunpowder treason and plot<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;We see no reason; Why Gunpowder treason; Should ever be forgot……&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Fireworks, a major component of most Guy Fawkes Day celebrations, represent the explosives that were never used by the plotters. Guards perform an annual search of the Parliament building to check for potential arsonists, although it is more ceremonial than serious.</p>

<br>
If you’re anything like me patience is something that doesn’t come easily: whether it be having to stand in endless queues; trying to get hold of someone only to be put on hold having gone through endless options; waiting for your concoctions to cook properly when you’re ‘starving’ (just recently I was so impatient for some pasta to cook that I ended up serving it semi-raw; which would have been delicious had I waited for a whole two more minutes).&nbsp;
<p>The list is endless… Of course, we are all becoming conditioned to live in the fast lane, with the comparative luxury of things happening quickly and immediately. The monumental technological advances of the last 10 years alone enable us to communicate, book, organise, shop, email, bank, socially connect, and show the world the evidence of all our endeavours at the speed of lightning!&nbsp;<br>
<br>
What is more serious is, having established a major goal in life, to subsequently have to undergo a never-ending WAITING GAME for it to happen – during which time it seems there is no choice but to endure delay after an obstacle or new challenge. But in the majority of situations impatience achieves nothing, apart from making us feel irritated, annoyed, jumpy, unfocused… and certainly does absolutely nothing to hurry things up!<br>

<br>
Once there were two companies who were competitors to each other in selling toothpaste and toothbrushes. After few years, they realised the need for toothbrushes for kids. Both the companies were aware that the first company to come out with the product would have the higher chance of dominating the market.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The first company, instead of doing any research, took the logical approach. Adults have bigger hands and need long and thick toothbrushes, but kids have smaller hands and need smaller, thinner toothbrushes. Without a second thought, they designed and produced a kid’s toothbrush in a few weeks and launched it in the market.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The second company, however, did extensive research. They went to hundreds of kids and observed the way they held the toothbrush and brushed their teeth. The info they received also included feedback on what kids wanted. The second company decided they needed a toothbrush similar to adults in terms of size but with some grooves, because kids, instead of holding the toothbrush in their fingers like adults, clung to the toothbrush.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
So instead of making a small toothbrush like the first company, they went with a bigger toothbrush which helps the child to brush effectively. In addition, they also added more colours and cartoon characters to the toothbrush to make it attractive to the kids. Soon they launched the toothbrush on the market and sold a record number of toothbrushes, and they started to dominate the market.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of patience. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
So, how do you learn to be more patient? When establishing a new goal in life, decide whether or not you’re in it for the long-term. Be realistic and prepare yourself for possible delays in the process. Accept that at times you may have to take a few steps back to find a new path, so to speak. Try as much as possible to live in and enjoy the present moment rather than worrying about what needs to happen in the future.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
If you’re struggling with a new task or skill, leave it and come back to it a bit later on, with fresh eyes. Be tolerant, not just with others but with yourself. The person who suffers most from your own impatience is you!<br>
<br>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of patience. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Robert the Bruce was crowned King of Scotland in 1306 and eventually led Scotland to victory in the First War of Scottish Independence against the English. The king was the one who won Scotland’s independence — it’s no wonder he lives on in legend as a national hero.<br>
<br>
But things weren’t always so sunny for King Robert at first, and that’s where the spider comes into the story. After the English had repeatedly defeated his armies, Robert was forced into hiding. Legend has it that when Robert’s spirits were broken, he took refuge in a cave.<br>
<br>
Sitting in the cave, he noticed a small spider attempting to weave a web. The spider tried and failed over and over. Each time the spider fell, it climbed back up to try again. Finally, the spider’s silk took hold, and the spider managed to spin a web.<br>
<br>
Robert the Bruce saw himself reflected in the spider’s struggle. After watching the spider finally succeed, Robert found the inspiration to return and fight the English, believing patience and determination would win in the end.<br>
<br>
He was finally victorious against the King of England in the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. This triumph ultimately turned the tides towards later winning the independence of Scotland in 1328.<br>

        <p><br><strong>Half the Inhabitants of the Oz Opal Capital Live Underground</strong><br><br>
70 percent of the world's opals come from the mining town of Coober Pedy in South Australia, where half of its population lives underground. The Australian town of Coober Pedy looks like something straight out of a movie — probably because it is. In 1985, Mel Gibson, Tina Turner and a team of filmmakers descended on this barren mining town in the Outback to shoot Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome. The other-world landscape is chequered with ruddy-coloured mounds of sandstone — the result of years of opal mining. <strong>(A)</strong> ………. That landscape, and the lure of finding a pricey opal, has drawn people here for years. It’s also forced the town’s residents underground — literally.</p>
        <p>“People come here to see things differently,” Robert Coro, of the Desert Cave Hotel, says. Parts of his hotel are located below the ground, like many other buildings in town. “It’s that kind of adventure mentality that attracts people here.” Nothing about Coober Pedy is for the faint of heart. For starters, it’s hot — really hot. In the summer, temperatures can creep up to 113 degrees in the shade, assuming you can find a tree large enough to stand under. Before the city passed a tree-planting initiative, its tallest tree was a sculpture built from scraps of metal. <strong>(B)&nbsp;</strong>………. The local (dirt) golf course provides golfers with squares of carpet for their tees.</p>
        <p>Since its founding 100 years ago after a teenager discovered opal gemstones there, the town has been ground zero for opal mining. An estimated 70 percent of the world’s opal production can be linked back to the town, earning it the title of Opal Capital of the World, and the majority of its 3,500 residents work in the opal industry. One of the latest finds was a set of opalised pearls dating back more than 65 million years — but the city offers other kinds of buried treasure, too. Rather than move to a cooler locale, the town’s earliest residents learned to adapt to the hellish environment. <strong>(C)</strong> ………. Using mining tools, hardy prospectors did what they did best and dug holes into the hillsides to make underground dwellings or “dugouts.” Today about half of the population lives in dugouts where the temperature stays at a constant 75 degrees all year round.</p>
        <p>Seeking relief from the heat — and the desert’s chilly winter nights — the townsfolk continued building underground. The result is a subterranean community that includes underground museums like the Umoona Opal Mine &amp; Museum, a sprawling former opal mine located alongside the town’s main drag. It has churches like the Serbian Orthodox Church, whose sandstone walls are decorated with intricate carvings of saints. <strong>(D)</strong> ………. They let their guests experience the strange peace of life beneath the surface.</p>
        <p>“The beauty of living underground is that it’s very quiet and very still,” Coro says. “There’s no air movement or rush of air from the air conditioner, and since there are no windows or natural light, you get a very peaceful night’s sleep.” <strong>(E)</strong> ………. They have created their own customised subterranean houses that go beyond just one or two rooms into sprawling labyrinths that stretch out like spiders’ webs. “People will carve out their own bookshelves into the sandstone walls,” Michelle Provatidis, the mayor of Coober Pedy and owner of Michelle’s Opals Australia, a jewellery shop, tells Smithsonian.com. “I even know someone who has an underground swimming pool in her home.”<br>
But it’s not just what’s going on beneath the surface that makes Coober Pedy so unique. Above ground, there are hints of the city’s strong mining roots and eccentricities around every turn. <strong>(F)</strong> ………. Also, signs around town warn people to beware of unmarked holes, the remnants of previous opal digs. There’s also the annual Coober Pedy Opal Festival, which this year was held on March 26. Even the thin veil of red dust that settles on roadways, cars and buildings serves as a constant reminder of Coober Pedy’s strange charm. There really is no other place like it on — or below — Earth.</p>

<br>
After working with camels for five years, 32-year-old Sophie Matterson decided to embark on an epic trek across Australia, with nothing but the animals she had come to love for company.<br>
<br>
She trained five of them to carry her provisions before beginning a 5,000km coast-to-coast walk from Australia’s western-most point in Shark Bay, Western Australia, to the eastern-most point in Byron Bay, New South Wales.<br>
<br>
What was only going to be a six-month break from her ‘real job’ turned into five years of working with camels. Her work taking tourists on camel trips made her wonder where she would go if she could go on her own camel trek.&nbsp;
<p>The answer: a 5,000km coast-to-coast walk with camels across the Outback. Sophie walked a 700km stretch of the Great Victoria Desert with almost no human contact.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
‘There are not many places left in the world where you can look around 360 degrees and just see nothing but the landscape. The signs of civilisation just melted away,’ Sophie says. ‘Car tracks and footprints last a long time in the desert – but there was just nothing. People think walking is the hard part,’ Sophie says, ‘but it’s almost the easiest part of the day. I can’t just pitch up and relax with a cup of tea when I’m done, setting up and breaking down the camp every day is arduous. There were intense highs and lows during this challenging journey. The isolation and strain on the animals at times were overwhelming. Despite this, the highs outweighed the challenges. I loved being out there alone, watching the landscape change.’<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of Australian Outback. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
How long can you survive in Australia's Outback? The stories of three people stranded in the Australian Outback for two weeks have captured global attention. Two of them survived, while a third didn’t.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The Outback is a vast remote area in the centre of Australia: dry, arid and almost entirely uninhabited. During summer, the Outback can get extremely hot and getting lost is dangerous.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
So, what are the chances of surviving if lost and what are the factors that take or save a life? "The biggest two factors are heat and dehydration," explains a spokesman for the Australia's Critical Care and Trauma Response Centre. “Generally, a person can survive for three days without water - but that is only under certain conditions: without physical exertion or being exposed to too much heat in the direct sun. In the unforgiving summer of the Outback, the window for surviving without water might be as short as one day,” he explains.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Only with shade and with minimal physical activity would a three-day survival in the outback be possible. The heat will likely shorten that window. Especially if you're trying to free a car stuck in mud or even if you decide to walk and look for help.<br>
<br>

<br>
Silo art has turned the Australian Outback into a vast outdoor gallery. Dotted across the country, the gigantic murals give those exploring the land an insight into the people who live there. Australia’s silo murals make a road trip an art odyssey. Painted on old GrainCorp concrete silos, a mural at Sheep Hills in western Victoria is a tribute to the traditional owners of the area.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The Melbourne artist Adnate spent four weeks with the community and wanted to shine a light on the region’s young Indigenous people and show the strong ancestral connection that they share with their elders. Melbourne street artist Jimmy Dvate, known for his depictions of the natural world, painted the Goorambat grain silos in Victoria’s north. One silo is a tribute to three Clydesdale packhorses named Clem, Sam and Banjo from a family of horses dating back 100 years. Another shows a threatened barking owl, drawing attention to the native species.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of Australian Outback. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Reg Foggerdy, an Australian camel-hunter has been found alive six days after being lost in the Outback. The 62-year-old Australian man, lost for six days, has been found alive after surviving without water and by eating ants, say police.<br>
<br>
Reg disappeared last week while in a remote area of Western Australia. Police trackers found him sitting under a tree around 15km (9 miles) from where he became lost. His family described him as an experienced bushman but have now told him to buy a satellite phone.<br>
<br>
Mr Foggerdy's wife Arlyn cried when she heard he had been found alive. "How you can survive without water and food is a miracle,'' she said. Wearing only a T-shirt, shorts, a cap and flip-flops when he went missing, Mr Foggerdy - a retired miner - apparently became disorientated in the fierce heat of the desert. He was discovered "extremely dehydrated, a bit delusional, but he's received treatment, and he's now sitting up and talking," Police Supt Andy Greatwood told ABC radio.<br>
<br>
Greatwood also praised Mr Foggerdy's fantastic skills, saying that while more details of how he coped were likely to emerge, "most people would not have survived. His last couple of days of being lost were spent lying down under a tree and eating black ants. That's the level of extreme measures that Mr Foggerdy has gone to," he said.<br>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Out of My Mind&nbsp;</strong><br><em>by Sharon M. Draper&nbsp;</em><br><br>
I can’t talk. I can’t walk. I can’t feed myself or take myself to the bathroom. Big bummer. My arms and hands are pretty stiff, but I can mash the buttons on the TV remote and move my wheelchair with the help of knobs that I can grab on the wheels. I can’t hold a spoon or a pencil without dropping it. And my balance is like zip—Humpty Dumpty had more control than I do.</p>
        <p>When people look at me, I guess they see a girl with short, dark, curly hair strapped into a pink wheelchair. By the way, there is nothing cute about a pink wheelchair. Pink doesn’t change a thing. They’d see a girl with dark brown eyes that are full of curiosity. But one of them is slightly out of whack. Her head wobbles a little. Sometimes she drools. She’s really tiny for a girl who is age ten and three quarters. Her legs are very thin, probably because they’ve never been used. Her body tends to move on its own agenda, with feet sometimes kicking out unexpectedly and arms occasionally flailing, connecting with whatever is close by—a stack of CDs, a bowl of soup, a vase of roses. Not a whole lot of control there. After folks got finished making a list of my problems, they might take time to notice that I have a fairly nice smile and deep dimples—I think my dimples are cool.</p>
        <p>I wear tiny gold earrings. Sometimes people never even ask my name, like it’s not important or something. It is. My name is Melody. I can remember way back to when I was really, really young. Of course, it’s hard to separate real memories from the videos of me that Dad took on his camcorder. I’ve watched those things a million times. Mum bringing me home from the hospital—her face showing smiles, but her eyes squinted with worry.</p>
        <p>Melody tucked into a tiny baby bathtub. My arms and legs looked so skinny. I didn’t splash or kick. Melody propped with blankets on the living room sofa—a look of contentment on my face. I never cried much when I was a baby; Mum swears it’s true.</p>
        <p>Mum massaging me with lotion after a bath—I can still smell the lavender—then wrapping me in a fluffy towel with a little hood built into one corner. Dad took videos of me getting fed, getting changed, and even me sleeping. As I got older, I guess he was waiting for me to turn over, and sit up, and walk. I never did.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But I did absorb everything. I began to recognise noises and smells and tastes. The whump and whoosh of the furnace coming alive each morning. The tangy odour of heated dust as the house warmed up. The feel of a sneeze in the back of my throat.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And music. Songs floated through me and stayed. Lullabies, mixed with the soft smells of bedtime, slept with me. Harmonies made me smile. It’s like I’ve always had a painted musical soundtrack playing background to my life. I can almost hear colours and smell images when music is played.</p>
        <p>Mum loves classical. Big, booming Beethoven symphonies blast from her CD player all day long. Those pieces always seem to be bright blue as I listen and they smell like fresh paint. Dad is partial to jazz, and every chance he gets, he winks at me, takes out Mum’s Mozart disc, then pops in a CD of Miles Davis or Woody Herman. Jazz to me sounds brown and tan, and it smells like wet dirt. Jazz music drives Mum crazy, which is probably why Dad puts it on. …</p>
        <p>For some reason, I’ve always loved country music— loud, guitar-strumming, broken-heart music. Country is lemons—not sour, but sugar sweet and tangy. Lemon cake icing, cool, fresh lemonade! Lemon, lemon, lemon! Love it.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When I was really little, I remember sitting in our kitchen, being fed breakfast by Mum, and a song came on the radio that made me screech with joy. So, I’m singin’ Elvira, Elvira My heart’s on fire, Elvira. How did I already know the words and the rhythms to that song? I have no idea. It must have seeped into my memory somehow—maybe from a radio or TV program. Anyway, I almost fell out of my chair. I scrunched up my face and jerked and twitched as I tried to point to the radio. I wanted to hear the song again. But Mum just looked at me like I was nuts.</p>
        <p>How could she understand that I loved the song “Elvira” by the Oak Ridge Boys when I barely understood it myself? I had no way to explain how I could smell freshly sliced lemons and see citrus-toned musical notes in my mind as it played.</p>
        <p>If I had a paintbrush . . . wow! What a painting that would be!&nbsp;</p>

Her body tends to move on its own agenda, with feet sometimes kicking out unexpectedly and arms occasionally flailing, connecting with whatever is close by—a stack of CDs, a bowl of soup, a vase of roses. Not a whole lot of control there. After folks got finished making a list of my problems, they might take time to notice that I have a fairly nice smile and deep dimples—I think my dimples are cool.</p>
        <p>I wear tiny gold earrings. Sometimes people never even ask my name, like it’s not important or something. It is. My name is Melody. I can remember way back to when I was really, really young. Of course, it’s hard to separate real memories from the videos of me that Dad took on his camcorder. I’ve watched those things a million times. Mum bringing me home from the hospital—her face showing smiles, but her eyes squinted with worry.</p>
        <p>Melody tucked into a tiny baby bathtub. My arms and legs looked so skinny. I didn’t splash or kick. Melody propped with blankets on the living room sofa—a look of contentment on my face. I never cried much when I was a baby; Mum swears it’s true.</p>
        <p>Mum massaging me with lotion after a bath—I can still smell the lavender—then wrapping me in a fluffy towel with a little hood built into one corner. Dad took videos of me getting fed, getting changed, and even me sleeping. As I got older, I guess he was waiting for me to turn over, and sit up, and walk. I never did.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But I did absorb everything. I began to recognise noises and smells and tastes. The whump and whoosh of the furnace coming alive each morning. The tangy odour of heated dust as the house warmed up. The feel of a sneeze in the back of my throat.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And music. Songs floated through me and stayed. Lullabies, mixed with the soft smells of bedtime, slept with me. Harmonies made me smile. It’s like I’ve always had a painted musical soundtrack playing background to my life. I can almost hear colours and smell images when music is played.</p>
        <p>Mum loves classical. Big, booming Beethoven symphonies blast from her CD player all day long. Those pieces always seem to be bright blue as I listen and they smell like fresh paint. Dad is partial to jazz, and every chance he gets, he winks at me, takes out Mum’s Mozart disc, then pops in a CD of Miles Davis or Woody Herman. Jazz to me sounds brown and tan, and it smells like wet dirt. Jazz music drives Mum crazy, which is probably why Dad puts it on. …</p>
        <p>For some reason, I’ve always loved country music— loud, guitar-strumming, broken-heart music. Country is lemons—not sour, but sugar sweet and tangy. Lemon cake icing, cool, fresh lemonade! Lemon, lemon, lemon! Love it.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When I was really little, I remember sitting in our kitchen, being fed breakfast by Mum, and a song came on the radio that made me screech with joy. So, I’m singin’ Elvira, Elvira My heart’s on fire, Elvira. How did I already know the words and the rhythms to that song? I have no idea. It must have seeped into my memory somehow—maybe from a radio or TV program. Anyway, I almost fell out of my chair. I scrunched up my face and jerked and twitched as I tried to point to the radio. I wanted to hear the song again. But Mum just looked at me like I was nuts.</p>
        <p>How could she understand that I loved the song “Elvira” by the Oak Ridge Boys when I barely understood it myself? I had no way to explain how I could smell freshly sliced lemons and see citrus-toned musical notes in my mind as it played.</p>
        <p>If I had a paintbrush . . . wow! What a painting that would be!&nbsp;</p>

I can’t talk. I can’t walk. I can’t feed myself or take myself to the bathroom. Big bummer. My arms and hands are pretty stiff, but I can mash the buttons on the TV remote and move my wheelchair with the help of knobs that I can grab on the wheels.

        <p>For some reason, I’ve always loved country music— loud, guitar-strumming, broken-heart music. Country is lemons—not sour, but sugar sweet and tangy. Lemon cake icing, cool, fresh lemonade! Lemon, lemon, lemon! Love it.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When I was really little, I remember sitting in our kitchen, being fed breakfast by Mum, and a song came on the radio that made me screech with joy. So, I’m singin’ Elvira, Elvira My heart’s on fire, Elvira. How did I already know the words and the rhythms to that song? I have no idea. It must have seeped into my memory somehow—maybe from a radio or TV program. Anyway, I almost fell out of my chair. I scrunched up my face and jerked and twitched as I tried to point to the radio. I wanted to hear the song again. But Mum just looked at me like I was nuts.</p>
        <p>How could she understand that I loved the song “Elvira” by the Oak Ridge Boys when I barely understood it myself? I had no way to explain how I could smell freshly sliced lemons and see citrus-toned musical notes in my mind as it played.</p>
        <p>If I had a paintbrush . . . wow! What a painting that would be!&nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Out of My Mind&nbsp;</strong><br><em>by Sharon M. Draper&nbsp;</em><br><br>
I can’t talk. I can’t walk. I can’t feed myself or take myself to the bathroom. Big bummer. My arms and hands are pretty stiff, but I can mash the buttons on the TV remote and move my wheelchair with the help of knobs that I can grab on the wheels. I can’t hold a spoon or a pencil without dropping it. And my balance is like zip—Humpty Dumpty had more control than I do.</p>
        <p>When people look at me, I guess they see a girl with short, dark, curly hair strapped into a pink wheelchair. By the way, there is nothing cute about a pink wheelchair. Pink doesn’t change a thing. They’d see a girl with dark brown eyes that are full of curiosity. But one of them is slightly out of whack. Her head wobbles a little. Sometimes she drools. She’s really tiny for a girl who is age ten and three quarters. Her legs are very thin, probably because they’ve never been used. Her body tends to move on its own agenda, with feet sometimes kicking out unexpectedly and arms occasionally flailing, connecting with whatever is close by—a stack of CDs, a bowl of soup, a vase of roses. Not a whole lot of control there. After folks got finished making a list of my problems, they might take time to notice that I have a fairly nice smile and deep dimples—I think my dimples are cool.</p>
        <p>I wear tiny gold earrings. Sometimes people never even ask my name, like it’s not important or something. It is. My name is Melody. I can remember way back to when I was really, really young. Of course, it’s hard to separate real memories from the videos of me that Dad took on his camcorder. I’ve watched those things a million times. Mum bringing me home from the hospital—her face showing smiles, but her eyes squinted with worry.</p>
        <p>Melody tucked into a tiny baby bathtub. My arms and legs looked so skinny. I didn’t splash or kick. Melody propped with blankets on the living room sofa—a look of contentment on my face. I never cried much when I was a baby; Mum swears it’s true.</p>
        <p>Mum massaging me with lotion after a bath—I can still smell the lavender—then wrapping me in a fluffy towel with a little hood built into one corner. Dad took videos of me getting fed, getting changed, and even me sleeping. As I got older, I guess he was waiting for me to turn over, and sit up, and walk. I never did.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But I did absorb everything. I began to recognise noises and smells and tastes. The whump and whoosh of the furnace coming alive each morning. The tangy odour of heated dust as the house warmed up. The feel of a sneeze in the back of my throat.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And music. Songs floated through me and stayed. Lullabies, mixed with the soft smells of bedtime, slept with me. Harmonies made me smile. It’s like I’ve always had a painted musical soundtrack playing background to my life. I can almost hear colours and smell images when music is played.</p>
        <p>Mum loves classical. Big, booming Beethoven symphonies blast from her CD player all day long. Those pieces always seem to be bright blue as I listen and they smell like fresh paint. Dad is partial to jazz, and every chance he gets, he winks at me, takes out Mum’s Mozart disc, then pops in a CD of Miles Davis or Woody Herman. Jazz to me sounds brown and tan, and it smells like wet dirt. Jazz music drives Mum crazy, which is probably why Dad puts it on. …</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Out of My Mind&nbsp;</strong><br><em>by Sharon M. Draper&nbsp;</em><br><br>
I can’t talk. I can’t walk. I can’t feed myself or take myself to the bathroom. Big bummer. My arms and hands are pretty stiff, but I can mash the buttons on the TV remote and move my wheelchair with the help of knobs that I can grab on the wheels. I can’t hold a spoon or a pencil without dropping it. And my balance is like zip—Humpty Dumpty had more control than I do.</p>
        <p>When people look at me, I guess they see a girl with short, dark, curly hair strapped into a pink wheelchair. By the way, there is nothing cute about a pink wheelchair. Pink doesn’t change a thing. They’d see a girl with dark brown eyes that are full of curiosity. But one of them is slightly out of whack. Her head wobbles a little. Sometimes she drools. She’s really tiny for a girl who is age ten and three quarters. Her legs are very thin, probably because they’ve never been used. Her body tends to move on its own agenda, with feet sometimes kicking out unexpectedly and arms occasionally flailing, connecting with whatever is close by—a stack of CDs, a bowl of soup, a vase of roses. Not a whole lot of control there. After folks got finished making a list of my problems, they might take time to notice that I have a fairly nice smile and deep dimples—I think my dimples are cool.</p>
        <p>I wear tiny gold earrings. Sometimes people never even ask my name, like it’s not important or something. It is. My name is Melody. I can remember way back to when I was really, really young. Of course, it’s hard to separate real memories from the videos of me that Dad took on his camcorder. I’ve watched those things a million times. Mum bringing me home from the hospital—her face showing smiles, but her eyes squinted with worry.</p>
        <p>Melody tucked into a tiny baby bathtub. My arms and legs looked so skinny. I didn’t splash or kick. Melody propped with blankets on the living room sofa—a look of contentment on my face. I never cried much when I was a baby; Mum swears it’s true.</p>
        <p>Mum massaging me with lotion after a bath—I can still smell the lavender—then wrapping me in a fluffy towel with a little hood built into one corner. Dad took videos of me getting fed, getting changed, and even me sleeping. As I got older, I guess he was waiting for me to turn over, and sit up, and walk. I never did.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But I did absorb everything. I began to recognise noises and smells and tastes. The whump and whoosh of the furnace coming alive each morning. The tangy odour of heated dust as the house warmed up. The feel of a sneeze in the back of my throat.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And music. Songs floated through me and stayed. Lullabies, mixed with the soft smells of bedtime, slept with me. Harmonies made me smile. It’s like I’ve always had a painted musical soundtrack playing background to my life. I can almost hear colours and smell images when music is played.</p>
        <p>Mum loves classical. Big, booming Beethoven symphonies blast from her CD player all day long. Those pieces always seem to be bright blue as I listen and they smell like fresh paint. Dad is partial to jazz, and every chance he gets, he winks at me, takes out Mum’s Mozart disc, then pops in a CD of Miles Davis or Woody Herman. Jazz to me sounds brown and tan, and it smells like wet dirt. Jazz music drives Mum crazy, which is probably why Dad puts it on. …</p>
        <p>For some reason, I’ve always loved country music— loud, guitar-strumming, broken-heart music. Country is lemons—not sour, but sugar sweet and tangy. Lemon cake icing, cool, fresh lemonade! Lemon, lemon, lemon! Love it.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When I was really little, I remember sitting in our kitchen, being fed breakfast by Mum, and a song came on the radio that made me screech with joy. So, I’m singin’ Elvira, Elvira My heart’s on fire, Elvira. How did I already know the words and the rhythms to that song? I have no idea. It must have seeped into my memory somehow—maybe from a radio or TV program. Anyway, I almost fell out of my chair. I scrunched up my face and jerked and twitched as I tried to point to the radio. I wanted to hear the song again. But Mum just looked at me like I was nuts.</p>
        <p>How could she understand that I loved the song “Elvira” by the Oak Ridge Boys when I barely understood it myself? I had no way to explain how I could smell freshly sliced lemons and see citrus-toned musical notes in my mind as it played.</p>
        <p>If I had a paintbrush . . . wow! What a painting that would be!&nbsp;</p>

        <p><br><strong>EVEL KNIEVEL – A LIFE OF DANGER</strong><br><br>
Now that Eddie Braun has completed the Snake River Canyon leap, we look back on the life of the world’s most famous stuntman, Evel Knievel. Legendary US daredevil, Evel Knievel once said that jumping a motorcycle wasn’t that difficult. It was the landing part that often proved a bit of an issue. <strong>(A)</strong> ……….&nbsp; In a career that shone like a beacon of 1970s pop culture, the iconic hospital-food aficionado had a penchant for star-spangled leather jumpsuits. He sustained somewhere in the order of 37 broken bones — including all his ribs, his pelvis three times, left femur five times, lower back twice, upper back twice. He survived a 28-day coma and helped redefine the meaning of the word ‘pain’, all as a result of landings that were anything but happy. Or soft.</p>
        <p>“I guess I thought I was Elvis Presley. But I’ll tell ya something: all Elvis did was stand on a stage and play a guitar,” Evel once helpfully explained. “He never fell off on that pavement at 80 miles per hour.” If there was a stunt Knievel never attempted — or a surgical procedure he didn’t undergo — chances are it wasn’t worth contemplating. <strong>(B)</strong> ………. Trucks, buses, lions, sharks, rattlesnakes and even geological formations were standard&nbsp; fare for the stylishly coiffured caped wonder.</p>
        <p>Demonstrating an unhinged passion for danger from childhood, Knievel exploded into prominence on New Year’s Eve 1967. That was when he attempted to jump 141 feet over the fountains at Caesar’s Palace casino in Las Vegas. He cleared the fountains easily. But the subsequent crash-landing left him with a fractured skull and broken pelvis, hips and ribs, and rendered him unconscious for a month. He awoke to find himself a national hero. “It was terrible,” he later said. “I lost control of the bike. <strong>(C)</strong> ……….&nbsp; I kept smashing over and over and ended up against a brick wall, 165 feet away.”</p>
        <p><strong>(D)</strong> ……….&nbsp; An example is his jump over 13 London buses at Wembley Stadium, which scored him a million dollars and resulted in a broken pelvis and hand after clipping the 13th bus. Then there was his leap over a shark tank in Chicago, which ended in a broken forearm and collarbone after skidding on the exit ramp. “In the old days, the promoters wanted more and more from me,” Evel once recalled of his spleen-jolting heyday. “They wanted me to jump or spill my blood and break my bones. Every time they wanted me to jump further, and further, and further. Hell, they thought my bike had wings.”</p>
        <p>Keen to flame the frenzy, in 1974 Knievel attempted to jump nearly 500 metres across Snake River Canyon in Idaho aboard a rocket-powered cycle. In front of thousands of gob-smacked spectators, Knievel launched his ballistic missile-shaped X-2 Skycycle (featuring two engines capable of producing more than 14,000lb of thrust) off a near-vertical ramp at a ball-tearing 560km/h. Apparently due to malfunction, the cycle’s parachute opened almost immediately after take-off, causing both it and the rider to drift slowly down to the canyon floor. The failed stunt worried Evel’s credibility, with detractors claiming he simply lost his nerve and pulled out of the attempt early. <strong>(E)</strong> ……….&nbsp; Alongside all the death-defying stunts were the temptations of life itself. Equally renowned for his gambling and bad temper as he was for his daredevil exploits, Knievel was a bloke who didn’t need to rely on spectacular crashes to mess with his health and future earning potential.</p>
        <p>Eventually fading from the limelight, his vast fortune lost, Knievel suffered severe ill health during the later phases of his life. In 1999, he underwent a liver transplant after nearly dying of hepatitis C, which he believed he’d contracted through a blood transfusion following one of his many massive spills. <strong>(F)</strong> ……….&nbsp; It was this incurable lung condition that ultimately achieved what countless impacts with solid objects failed to do. In May 2006, perhaps sensing the end was near, Evel appeared ready to finally meet his maker. “I can’t wait to meet God and ask why he didn’t make me go faster on some of those jumps, why he put me through all this pain. He knows I’m not evil.”</p>

Chengdu Shishi High School was founded in 141 B.C. and has operated on the same site for more than 2,150 years. The school has an excellent reputation on a provincial and national level and is located in the downtown area on an attractive campus. The international centre follows the British Cambridge International exams for its A-level program. These prepare students well for entry to universities worldwide.<br>
<br>
Chengdu is the capital of Sichuan province and one of China’s largest cities. With a long history, it is now famous for its relaxed lifestyle, spicy cuisine and as the home of the panda.<br>
<br>
Chengdu Shishi High School is likely the oldest school in the world, standing on the site of the first Chinese public school, built by a Han dynasty governor. It was originally constructed in stone, hence the current school’s name Shishi, which means stone chamber. The school is very much a Chinese state institution and students have physical exercises in the morning, eye exercises in the afternoon and the day begins with the national anthem. However, it is very internationally minded and fosters regular exchange program with countries including the USA and Denmark. In 2016, it hosted Cambridge International Examinations training courses that were attended by teachers from China and beyond.<br>

The King’s School in Canterbury is a modern school with a long history. Its roots can be traced back as far a 597 A.D. This was when St Augustine, having arrived in Canterbury from Rome, founded a monastery school. King Henry VIII’s banning of the monasteries meant it was re-founded as the King’s School in 1541. As the school flourished, the need for a primary school became apparent. It was founded in 1879, but the primary section spent the first half century in church grounds. Then in 1929, it moved to its present premises in Sturry, two miles from Canterbury. Formerly the home of Lord Alfred Milner, the Tudor house and grounds were given to The King’s School in his memory by Lady Milner. The new school building is on 80 acres along the River Stour. It was opened by the famous writer and poet, Rudyard Kipling on 5 October.<br>

<br>
There are some very unusual schools in the world. In Bangladesh, floods make it difficult for some students to learn, so education has been given to young people by transforming boats into schools and libraries. Then there is a special teaching facility, the Salem’s witch school that teaches witchcraft as the main subject. Dong Zhong, a school in a cave in the poor Mao village in Ziyun County in China, has been the place of learning since 1984 for kids with no access to education. But the school was recently closed after the Chinese government said China is not ‘a society of cavemen’. The 2,000 students at River Plate School, Argentina spend their school time learning in the Buenos Aires world class soccer Stadium; home of Atletico River Plate soccer club. Students at Microsoft-designed ‘School of the Future’, Philadelphia are given a laptop, but no reading or writing books. The school doesn’t allow using paper at all. In a social experiment, Burgess Hill School in London had absolutely no rules for students to follow. This was so much so that even lessons were voluntary. As such the school is no longer in operation. The Train Platform Schools in India use trains at train platforms to help children educate themselves instead of begging for money. They have so far taught 4,000 students. Which of these schools would you like to attend?<br>

        <p><strong>Read the text below. Six sentences&nbsp;have been removed from this text so that there are six gaps.<br>
<br>
Byron Bay</strong><br><br>
Byron Bay is not what it used to be. No shade intended: This small town on the north coast of the Australian state of New South Wales has always shifted with the times, and that’s no less true now. Byron Bay is known as an epicentre of Australia’s counter-culture. <strong>(A)</strong> ……...&nbsp; &nbsp;Locals, for instance, stopped McDonald’s from setting up its golden arches. But it wasn’t always this way: before the New Agers unfurled their prayer flags in the 1970s, it had a less romantic reputation as a hub of sand-mining, cedar-cutting, abattoirs and whaling.</p>
        <p>The Bundjalung nation of the Arakwal Australian Aboriginal people had been living along the coast of Byron Bay for more than 20,000 years when the cape was encountered in 1770 by Capt. James Cook, who named it for Commodore (later Admiral) John Byron, grandfather of the poet Lord Byron. Byron Bay was founded in 1860 as a timber port. It was declared a town in 1896 and a shire in 1906. Before coastal shipping declined, Byron Bay was the principal port between Newcastle (about 630km south) and Brisbane (140km north-northwest). Over the years, Byron Bay’s local economy underwent a dramatic evolution. <strong>(B)</strong> ……….&nbsp; For roughly 20 years gold was painstakingly extracted from the black sand as “poor man’s diggings”, which yielded a measure of profit for most who undertook its mining but did not bestow a fortune on anyone. In the mid-1930s it was learned that the sand that had been discarded by the prospectors, contained the valuable minerals rutile and zircon, which became the focus of a sand-mining industry that flourished until the early 1970s.</p>
        <p>Byron—or the Bay, as locals call it—is evolving again. It’s still a magnet for backpackers and surfers. However, these days it also attracts cashed-up visitors, and entrepreneurs who boast about ‘board meetings’ on the water. <strong>(C)</strong> ……….&nbsp; But its main selling points—a laid-back pace and beautiful beaches—are still just as appealing.</p>
        <p>To get there, we suggest you take the back road. There are two airports that service Byron Bay. The easiest option is to fly into Ballina Byron Gateway Airport (daily flights from Sydney, Melbourne and Newcastle) and book a transfer to Byron Bay. This will take you via the Coast Road, a scenic, 30-minute intro to the area that winds past windswept beaches, soft tea-tree forests, and cane fields before meandering into town through the lush back door of Broken Head. Alternatively, you’ll find more flight options at Gold Coast Airport, but a longer and less joy-sparking transfer via the freeway. On the upside, if you arrive this way you’ll get to see the famous “Cheer up, slow down, chill out” welcome sign, and the jaunty new silver lighthouse sculpture. Book ahead… Byron is busy year-round these days, so plan well ahead for accommodation. <strong>(D)</strong> ……….&nbsp; If you’re on a budget, the recently revamped Byron Bay YHA hostel is a good, cheap, and centrally located option. The Bower’s beach-chic suites and circular pool will rate highly on social media feeds. Also, more than 17 percent of Byron’s housing is listed on holiday rental platforms like Airbnb, so you should have plenty to choose from.</p>
        <p>And plan your trip. Byron Bay is part of the greater Byron Shire. Byron Bay is small; the Shire is large. <strong>(E)</strong> ……….&nbsp; Take The Byron at Byron Resort &amp; Spa, for instance—it sounds like it’s in the centre of Byron, but it’s actually in the suburb Suffolk Park, a 10-minute drive from town. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing—in fact, it can be a blessing to be able to retreat from the Byron bubble—just something to bear in mind when booking. Skip summer. Summer has northerly winds, week-long downpours, and throngs of tourists. The best time to visit is during autumn and winter (March to August), when the weather is great, the surf is at its best, and the crowds ease off (a little). From May to October you’ll also be able to spot humpback whales cruising past on their annual migration.</p>
        <p>Get up early and walk. It’s worth it to soak up the sunrise from Cape Byron, the most easterly point of Australia. You can save time and drive up to the historic lighthouse (there are limited parking spaces and entry is AUD$8). <strong>(F)</strong> ……….&nbsp; It winds through rare littoral rainforest, past pristine beaches and across grass-covered cliffs to reach the stately 1901 lighthouse on the headland and sweeping views of the ocean. The full loop is 3.7km and takes around two hours to complete, but don’t be tempted to take the shortcut down the road on the way back—the second half of the track along Tallow Ridge is equally special.</p>

When you’ve had your fill of history, culture and man-made wonders, sometimes sun, sea and sand are all you need. Desert islands like Fiji and Maui top the bucket lists of many a traveller, with all the ingredients for the perfect exotic holiday: tropical climates, swaying palms and blissful white-sand beaches. Closer to home, the Canary Island of Fuerteventura and Vis in Croatia make getting away from it all as easy as pie. Whether you're after some serious escapism or want to marvel at mother nature, Lucy McGuire picks some of the most exotic places to travel in the world. Her number one pick is Maui, Hawaii. With a legendary surf scene and golden crescent beaches that span more than 193km, there are attractions everywhere you turn in Hawaii. Maui, known as "the Valley Isle", is a favourite for its misty peaks, gorgeous sunsets and bamboo forests. Relax on Kaanapali Beach or see the red sands at Kaihalulu – it’s like no other beach in the world. Maui is a tropical wonderland, laced with tremendous trails and hiking routes. Do the 5-hour Waterfall and Rainforest Hike to take in a range of breathtaking 10–40m-high waterfalls. You'll have the chance to swim in natural pools, enjoy a fresh picnic lunch and learn all about the culture, flora and fauna of the area from your experienced naturalist guide.<br>

With approximately 85 million bed nights in 2019, London was the most popular European city destination in the ECM benchmarking report. International visitors to London had continually increased over the past decade. In second place was London’s competitor, Paris. The French capital accounted for around 52 million bed nights. But London is not necessarily the most attractive city. In the hospitality industry, a bed night measures the occupancy of one person (assigned to one bed) for one night. While London ranked first in terms of bed nights, the United Kingdom received a Travel &amp; Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI) score of 5.2 out of 7.0 in 2019, taking only the fourth place on the list. The TTCI takes into consideration factors such as a country's infrastructure and its policy and enabling conditions. Comparatively, Spain ranked first on the TTCI, but its capital city Madrid ranked only at sixth place in terms of bed nights, with approximately 21 million in 2019 and an increase in bed nights of 4.3 percent over the previous year.<br>

Just hours after Prime Minister, Scott Morrison announced on October 1 that he would soon reopen Australia’s international border, Madhu Tamilarasan was online booking a flight to London. “The law still doesn’t allow me to actually leave but I’ve taken a punt to book a ridiculously expensive flight,” she says. She hasn’t seen her parents for three and a half years.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Australia closed its border in March 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic started its race around the globe. Just 1.1 million passengers flew in or out of the country in the 2021 financial year, compared to 42 million in 2019, government data shows. But what’s it going to be like to travel overseas again? Where can we go? And what should you take?&nbsp;<br>
Businessman, Thornton, travelled to Europe earlier this year for business, carrying a “wad of paper” to get through border checks. The experience was not as hard as he expected, but it was time-consuming. “It’s going to be a lot of forms, a lot of box-ticking and a lot of checking,” he says. He had to arrive for his Eurostar train ride from London to Lille, for example, two hours before departure rather than 45 minutes in pre-COVID times. “There’s just a lot more rigour in terms of checking at passport control and immigration,” Thornton says.<br>

<br>
Getting out to see the world is a fantastic opportunity for you to explore and learn more about other cultures. However, it is important for authorities to screen for pests, diseases and weeds which may have travelled with you. To help protect our agricultural industries, unique environment and the health of all Australians, the department assesses all incoming air and sea travellers and screens baggage using X-ray machines, detector dogs and physical inspection. Unsure? Just declare it. You must declare certain food, plant material (including wooden articles) and animal products on your Incoming Passenger Card. Anything you declare will be assessed by a biosecurity officer, who will determine the risk associated with the goods and whether an inspection is required. If you are unsure, just declare it. Depending on the risk, you may be required to pay for the goods to be treated (e.g. fumigation or gamma irradiation), pay to export the goods from Australia or give up your goods for destruction. You will not face a penalty if you declare all goods, even if they are not allowed into Australia.<br>

        <p><br><strong>Marie Curie</strong><br><br>
On April 20, 1902, Marie and Pierre Curie successfully isolated radioactive radium salts from the mineral pitchblende in their laboratory in Paris. In 1898, the Curies had discovered the existence of the elements, radium and polonium in their research of pitchblende. One year after isolating radium, they would share the 1903 Nobel Prize in physics with French scientist, A. Henri Becquerel for their ground-breaking investigations of radioactivity. <strong>(A)</strong> ……….&nbsp; Both were for her ground-breaking work in radioactivity.</p>
        <p>Curie was born Maria Sklodowska in Warsaw, Poland, to school-teacher parents of modest means who encouraged their children’s educational aspirations. <strong>(B)</strong> ……….&nbsp; She agreed to fund Bronya’s medical degree in France by working as a governess. Bronya later helped Marie move to Paris and enrol at the prestigious Sorbonne, where she studied chemistry, maths and physics. Curie met her future husband, Pierre, while doing postgraduate research at the lab he supervised. The pair immediately bonded over their mutual interest in magnetism and fondness for cycling. A year later they were married in Sceaux, France. They used the money they had received as a wedding present to purchase bicycles for the many long rides they took together.</p>
        <p><strong>(C)</strong> ……….&nbsp; As a result, she began studying uranium rays; Pierre soon joined her in her research. Two years later, the Curies discovered polonium—named after Marie’s homeland—and radium. In 1903, they shared the Nobel Prize in physics with Becquerel for their ground-breaking work on radioactivity.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After Pierre’s tragic death in a 1906 accident, Marie was appointed to his seat at the Sorbonne, becoming the university’s first female professor. Just three years earlier, she had been the first woman in France to earn a doctorate. Today, France’s leading scientific and medical complex bears the name of both Curies. <strong>(D)</strong> ……….&nbsp; In 1911, she received the prestigious award again — in chemistry this time — for her isolation of radium and other accomplishments.</p>
        <p>During World War I, Curie used her radiography expertise to set up dozens of mobile and permanent X-ray stations, which helped doctors diagnose and treat battlefield injuries. They became known as “petites Curies” for their famous creator. <strong>(E)</strong> ……….&nbsp; The effects of doing this were poorly understood at the time. By the 1920s, she had developed muscle aches, anaemia, cataracts and a host of other symptoms. She died on July 4, 1934, of leukemia caused by exposure to radiation.</p>
        <p>Curie’s daughter, Irène followed in her mother’s footsteps, earning a doctorate in physics and conducting important research on synthesised radioactive elements. In 1935, she and her husband, Frédéric Joliot, shared the Noble Prize in chemistry for their discovery of artificial radioactivity. In 1995, the remains of Curie and her husband were enshrined in Paris’ Pantheon. <strong>(F)</strong> ……….&nbsp; She became the second woman to receive this honour and the first to earn it through her own achievements. Among her writing, Curie left behind this thought: "Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less."</p>
