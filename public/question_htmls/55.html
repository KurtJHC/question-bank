          <strong>The&nbsp;Redback Leftovers</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>By Debra Oswald</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>No sane person could describe the Redback Bay Under 13 Leftovers as a ‘team’ really. Imagine the worst soccer team you ever saw and then triple it. Let me review the lineup of players to give you some idea.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Shane Borman (the fridge with a head) was a pretty good player - except for one problem. He kept growling and thumping everyone else on the field. Even players on his own team.</p>
        <p>Someone’d bump Shane accidentally and he’d aim his fist. ‘Want me to thump ya? Do ya? I will. I’ll thump ya,’ he’d roar. And you had no trouble believing him.</p>
        <p>Robbie Oldroyd copped quite a few of Shane’s threats. Something about him particularly riles Shane up. Robbie would just dance off, cackling.</p>
        <p>Robbie went to my school, so I already knew he wasn’t on the same planet as other people. For a start, he was always singing to himself. In the middle of a soccer game he’d lose interest, wander off and swing back and forth on the goalposts or beat out a rhythm on the crossbar like it was a set of drums. Robbie made me laugh and he was never nasty - but I can see why he drove a lot of people crazy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mozzie was so small and scrawny, you’d pick him for maybe six years old. It was hard to believe he was nearly thirteen. You had to watch where you were going so you didn’t tread on tiny Mozzie.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That little guy was certainly fast, with decent ball skills. When I first saw him streak ahead of the pack, dribbling the ball, I thought - yes, one good player. But two seconds later, Mozzie got tackled and pulverised by one of the bigger players. He lay on the ground, too scared to get up, so small you could hardly see him above the stalks of grass.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was a beefy girl called Sarah. Seriously tall, huge shoulders, legs like tree trunks. She was pretty slow and lumbering on the field. Sarah ended up in the Leftovers because she’d quit the girls’ team. I think she was sick of getting teased about being big and all that.</p>
        <p>Anthony Zammit had been a hopeless player when he was five years old. But now he was thirteen, he was even worse.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Anthony’s speciality was the ‘air-kick’ where he’d swipe at the ball but only connect with the air and end up landing on his bum. But the thing about Anthony was that he didn’t care. He kept on hauling himself to his feet, still grinning. He was having a fantastic time, no matter how lousy he played. Anthony Zammit loved soccer more than any kid I ever met.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And Spencer - well, I hate to say it but Spencer was hopeless. Spencer kept trying these tricky manoeuvres but he’d always trip on his own feet and collapse face first in the dirt. Then Shane would run right over the top of him, grinding his big boot into Spencer’s back.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We had one player, Oliver, who didn’t even bother running after the ball. He just trudged grimly across the field, muttering to himself. Oliver had never played soccer in his life. He was only there because he’s done a deal with his mum to give one sport a go for a season.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At least Oliver turned up. Holly hardly ever showed. She always came running in late to training, panting and lopsided - with one soccer boot on, the other boot flapping in her hand. One side of her hair in a plait, the rest blowing loose. Too flustered and panicky to concentrate on soccer.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Holly had wanted to be in the girls’ team but she was too disorganised to register in time. That’s how she’d ended up a Leftover.</p>
        <p>Okay, so we did have a few good players. Apart from Stefan, we had Maria. She had speed, brilliant ball skills and fierce determination. Maria’s old club never gave girls a decent chance to make the First Grade. She got so mad she switched clubs. Now Maria was out to prove something. Trouble was, she got stuck in the Leftovers.</p>

          <strong>The&nbsp;Redback Leftovers</strong>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>No sane person could describe the Redback Bay Under 13 Leftovers as a ‘team’ really. Imagine the worst soccer team you ever saw and then triple it. Let me review the lineup of players to give you some idea.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Shane Borman (the fridge with a head) was a pretty good player - except for one problem. He kept growling and thumping everyone else on the field. Even players on his own team.</p>
        <p>Someone’d bump Shane accidentally and he’d aim his fist. ‘Want me to thump ya? Do ya? I will. I’ll thump ya,’ he’d roar. And you had no trouble believing him.</p>
        <p>Robbie Oldroyd copped quite a few of Shane’s threats. Something about him particularly riles Shane up. Robbie would just dance off, cackling.</p>
        <p>Robbie went to my school, so I already knew he wasn’t on the same planet as other people. For a start, he was always singing to himself. In the middle of a soccer game he’d lose interest, wander off and swing back and forth on the goalposts or beat out a rhythm on the crossbar like it was a set of drums. Robbie made me laugh and he was never nasty - but I can see why he drove a lot of people crazy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mozzie was so small and scrawny, you’d pick him for maybe six years old. It was hard to believe he was nearly thirteen. You had to watch where you were going so you didn’t tread on tiny Mozzie.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That little guy was certainly fast, with decent ball skills. When I first saw him streak ahead of the pack, dribbling the ball, I thought - yes, one good player. But two seconds later, Mozzie got tackled and pulverised by one of the bigger players. He lay on the ground, too scared to get up, so small you could hardly see him above the stalks of grass.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was a beefy girl called Sarah. Seriously tall, huge shoulders, legs like tree trunks. She was pretty slow and lumbering on the field. Sarah ended up in the Leftovers because she’d quit the girls’ team. I think she was sick of getting teased about being big and all that.</p>
        <p>Anthony Zammit had been a hopeless player when he was five years old. But now he was thirteen, he was even worse.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Anthony’s speciality was the ‘air-kick’ where he’d swipe at the ball but only connect with the air and end up landing on his bum. But the thing about Anthony was that he didn’t care. He kept on hauling himself to his feet, still grinning. He was having a fantastic time, no matter how lousy he played. Anthony Zammit loved soccer more than any kid I ever met.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And Spencer - well, I hate to say it but Spencer was hopeless. Spencer kept trying these tricky manoeuvres but he’d always trip on his own feet and collapse face first in the dirt. Then Shane would run right over the top of him, grinding his big boot into Spencer’s back.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We had one player, Oliver, who didn’t even bother running after the ball. He just trudged grimly across the field, muttering to himself. Oliver had never played soccer in his life. He was only there because he’s done a deal with his mum to give one sport a go for a season.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At least Oliver turned up. Holly hardly ever showed. She always came running in late to training, panting and lopsided - with one soccer boot on, the other boot flapping in her hand. One side of her hair in a plait, the rest blowing loose. Too flustered and panicky to concentrate on soccer.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Holly had wanted to be in the girls’ team but she was too disorganised to register in time. That’s how she’d ended up a Leftover.</p>
        <p>Okay, so we did have a few good players. Apart from Stefan, we had Maria. She had speed, brilliant ball skills and fierce determination. Maria’s old club never gave girls a decent chance to make the First Grade. She got so mad she switched clubs. Now Maria was out to prove something. Trouble was, she got stuck in the Leftovers.</p>

          <strong>The&nbsp;Redback Leftovers</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>By Debra Oswald</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>No sane person could describe the Redback Bay Under 13 Leftovers as a ‘team’ really. Imagine the worst soccer team you ever saw and then triple it. Let me review the lineup of players to give you some idea.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Shane Borman (the fridge with a head) was a pretty good player - except for one problem. He kept growling and thumping everyone else on the field. Even players on his own team.</p>
        <p>Someone’d bump Shane accidentally and he’d aim his fist. ‘Want me to thump ya? Do ya? I will. I’ll thump ya,’ he’d roar. And you had no trouble believing him.</p>
        <p>Robbie Oldroyd copped quite a few of Shane’s threats. Something about him particularly riles Shane up. Robbie would just dance off, cackling.</p>
        <p>Robbie went to my school, so I already knew he wasn’t on the same planet as other people. For a start, he was always singing to himself. In the middle of a soccer game he’d lose interest, wander off and swing back and forth on the goalposts or beat out a rhythm on the crossbar like it was a set of drums. Robbie made me laugh and he was never nasty - but I can see why he drove a lot of people crazy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mozzie was so small and scrawny, you’d pick him for maybe six years old. It was hard to believe he was nearly thirteen. You had to watch where you were going so you didn’t tread on tiny Mozzie.</p>

        <p>Holly had wanted to be in the girls’ team but she was too disorganised to register in time. That’s how she’d ended up a Leftover.</p>
        <p>Okay, so we did have a few good players. Apart from Stefan, we had Maria. She had speed, brilliant ball skills and fierce determination. Maria’s old club never gave girls a decent chance to make the First Grade. She got so mad she switched clubs. Now Maria was out to prove something. Trouble was, she got stuck in the Leftovers.</p>

          <strong>The&nbsp;Redback Leftovers</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>By Debra Oswald</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>No sane person could describe the Redback Bay Under 13 Leftovers as a ‘team’ really. Imagine the worst soccer team you ever saw and then triple it. Let me review the lineup of players to give you some idea.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Shane Borman (the fridge with a head) was a pretty good player - except for one problem. He kept growling and thumping everyone else on the field. Even players on his own team.</p>
        <p>Someone’d bump Shane accidentally and he’d aim his fist. ‘Want me to thump ya? Do ya? I will. I’ll thump ya,’ he’d roar. And you had no trouble believing him.</p>
        <p>Robbie Oldroyd copped quite a few of Shane’s threats. Something about him particularly riles Shane up. Robbie would just dance off, cackling.</p>
        <p>Robbie went to my school, so I already knew he wasn’t on the same planet as other people. For a start, he was always singing to himself. In the middle of a soccer game he’d lose interest, wander off and swing back and forth on the goalposts or beat out a rhythm on the crossbar like it was a set of drums. Robbie made me laugh and he was never nasty - but I can see why he drove a lot of people crazy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mozzie was so small and scrawny, you’d pick him for maybe six years old. It was hard to believe he was nearly thirteen. You had to watch where you were going so you didn’t tread on tiny Mozzie.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That little guy was certainly fast, with decent ball skills. When I first saw him streak ahead of the pack, dribbling the ball, I thought - yes, one good player. But two seconds later, Mozzie got tackled and pulverised by one of the bigger players. He lay on the ground, too scared to get up, so small you could hardly see him above the stalks of grass.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was a beefy girl called Sarah. Seriously tall, huge shoulders, legs like tree trunks. She was pretty slow and lumbering on the field. Sarah ended up in the Leftovers because she’d quit the girls’ team. I think she was sick of getting teased about being big and all that.</p>
        <p>Anthony Zammit had been a hopeless player when he was five years old. But now he was thirteen, he was even worse.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Anthony’s speciality was the ‘air-kick’ where he’d swipe at the ball but only connect with the air and end up landing on his bum. But the thing about Anthony was that he didn’t care. He kept on hauling himself to his feet, still grinning. He was having a fantastic time, no matter how lousy he played. Anthony Zammit loved soccer more than any kid I ever met.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And Spencer - well, I hate to say it but Spencer was hopeless. Spencer kept trying these tricky manoeuvres but he’d always trip on his own feet and collapse face first in the dirt. Then Shane would run right over the top of him, grinding his big boot into Spencer’s back.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We had one player, Oliver, who didn’t even bother running after the ball. He just trudged grimly across the field, muttering to himself. Oliver had never played soccer in his life. He was only there because he’s done a deal with his mum to give one sport a go for a season.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At least Oliver turned up. Holly hardly ever showed. She always came running in late to training, panting and lopsided - with one soccer boot on, the other boot flapping in her hand. One side of her hair in a plait, the rest blowing loose. Too flustered and panicky to concentrate on soccer.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Holly had wanted to be in the girls’ team but she was too disorganised to register in time. That’s how she’d ended up a Leftover.</p>
        <p>Okay, so we did have a few good players. Apart from Stefan, we had Maria. She had speed, brilliant ball skills and fierce determination. Maria’s old club never gave girls a decent chance to make the First Grade. She got so mad she switched clubs. Now Maria was out to prove something. Trouble was, she got stuck in the Leftovers.</p>

          <strong>The&nbsp;Redback Leftovers</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>By Debra Oswald</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>No sane person could describe the Redback Bay Under 13 Leftovers as a ‘team’ really. Imagine the worst soccer team you ever saw and then triple it. Let me review the lineup of players to give you some idea.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Shane Borman (the fridge with a head) was a pretty good player - except for one problem. He kept growling and thumping everyone else on the field. Even players on his own team.</p>
        <p>Someone’d bump Shane accidentally and he’d aim his fist. ‘Want me to thump ya? Do ya? I will. I’ll thump ya,’ he’d roar. And you had no trouble believing him.</p>
        <p>Robbie Oldroyd copped quite a few of Shane’s threats. Something about him particularly riles Shane up. Robbie would just dance off, cackling.</p>
        <p>Robbie went to my school, so I already knew he wasn’t on the same planet as other people. For a start, he was always singing to himself. In the middle of a soccer game he’d lose interest, wander off and swing back and forth on the goalposts or beat out a rhythm on the crossbar like it was a set of drums. Robbie made me laugh and he was never nasty - but I can see why he drove a lot of people crazy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mozzie was so small and scrawny, you’d pick him for maybe six years old. It was hard to believe he was nearly thirteen. You had to watch where you were going so you didn’t tread on tiny Mozzie.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That little guy was certainly fast, with decent ball skills. When I first saw him streak ahead of the pack, dribbling the ball, I thought - yes, one good player. But two seconds later, Mozzie got tackled and pulverised by one of the bigger players. He lay on the ground, too scared to get up, so small you could hardly see him above the stalks of grass.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was a beefy girl called Sarah. Seriously tall, huge shoulders, legs like tree trunks. She was pretty slow and lumbering on the field. Sarah ended up in the Leftovers because she’d quit the girls’ team. I think she was sick of getting teased about being big and all that.</p>
        <p>Anthony Zammit had been a hopeless player when he was five years old. But now he was thirteen, he was even worse.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Anthony’s speciality was the ‘air-kick’ where he’d swipe at the ball but only connect with the air and end up landing on his bum. But the thing about Anthony was that he didn’t care. He kept on hauling himself to his feet, still grinning. He was having a fantastic time, no matter how lousy he played. Anthony Zammit loved soccer more than any kid I ever met.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And Spencer - well, I hate to say it but Spencer was hopeless. Spencer kept trying these tricky manoeuvres but he’d always trip on his own feet and collapse face first in the dirt. Then Shane would run right over the top of him, grinding his big boot into Spencer’s back.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We had one player, Oliver, who didn’t even bother running after the ball. He just trudged grimly across the field, muttering to himself. Oliver had never played soccer in his life. He was only there because he’s done a deal with his mum to give one sport a go for a season.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At least Oliver turned up. Holly hardly ever showed. She always came running in late to training, panting and lopsided - with one soccer boot on, the other boot flapping in her hand. One side of her hair in a plait, the rest blowing loose. Too flustered and panicky to concentrate on soccer.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Holly had wanted to be in the girls’ team but she was too disorganised to register in time. That’s how she’d ended up a Leftover.</p>
        <p>Okay, so we did have a few good players. Apart from Stefan, we had Maria. She had speed, brilliant ball skills and fierce determination. Maria’s old club never gave girls a decent chance to make the First Grade. She got so mad she switched clubs. Now Maria was out to prove something. Trouble was, she got stuck in the Leftovers.</p>

        <p>Perhaps I ought to remember that she is very young, a <strong>mere</strong> girl and make allowances. She is all interest, eagerness, vivacity, the world is to her a charm, a wonder, a mystery, a joy; she can't speak for delight when she finds a new flower, she must pet it and caress it and smell it and talk to it, and pour out <strong>endearing</strong> names upon it. And she is colour-mad: brown rocks, yellow sand, grey moss, green <strong>foliage</strong>, blue sky; the pearl of the dawn, the purple shadows on the mountains, the golden islands floating in crimson seas at sunset, the <strong>pallid</strong> moon sailing through the shredded cloud-rack, the star-jewels glittering in the wastes of space – none of them is of any practical value, so far as I can see, but because they have colour and majesty, that is enough for her, and she loses her mind over them. If she could quiet down and keep still a couple minutes at a time, it would be a <strong>reposeful</strong> spectacle. In that case I think I could enjoy looking at her; indeed I am sure I could, for I am coming to realise that she is a quite remarkably <strong>comely</strong> creature – lithe, slender, trim, rounded, shapely, nimble, graceful; and once when she was standing marble-white and sun-drenched on a <strong>boulder</strong>, with her young head tilted back and her hand shading her eyes, watching the flight of a bird in the sky, I recognised that she was beautiful.</p>

          <strong>The Negro Mother</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Langston Hughes</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Children, I come back today<br>
To tell you a story of the long dark way<br>
That I had to climb, that I had to know<br>
In order that the race might live and grow.<br>
Look at my face – dark as the night –<br>
Yet shining like the sun with love's true light.<br>
I am the dark girl who crossed the red sea<br>
Carrying in my body the seed of the free.<br>
I am the woman who worked in the field<br>
Bringing the cotton and the corn to yield.<br>
I am the one who laboured as a slave,<br>
Beaten and mistreated for the work that I gave –<br>
Children sold away from me, I'm husband sold, too.<br>
No safety, no love, no respect was I due.<br>
<br>
Three hundred years in the deepest South:<br>
But God put a song and a prayer in my mouth.<br>
God put a dream like steel in my soul.<br>
Now, through my children, I'm reaching the goal.<br>
Now, through my children, young and free,<br>
I realised the blessing deed to me.<br>
I couldn't read then. I couldn't write.<br>
I had nothing, back there in the night.<br>
Sometimes, the valley was filled with tears,<br>
But I kept trudging on through the lonely years.<br>
Sometimes, the road was hot with the sun,<br>
But I had to keep on till my work was done:<br>
I had to keep on! No stopping for me –<br>
I was the seed of the coming Free.<br>
I nourished the dream that nothing could smother<br>
Deep in my breast – the Negro mother.<br>
I had only hope then, but now through you,<br>
Dark ones of today, my dreams must come true:<br>
All you dark children in the world out there,<br>
Remember my sweat, my pain, my despair.<br>
Remember my years, heavy with sorrow –<br>
And make of those years a torch for tomorrow.<br>
Make of my pass a road to the light<br>
Out of the darkness, the ignorance, the night.<br>
Lift high my banner out of the dust.<br>
Stand like free men supporting my trust.<br>
Believe in the right, let none push you back.<br>
Remember the whip and the slaver's track.<br>
Remember how the strong in struggle and strife<br>
Still bar you the way, and deny you life –<br>
But march ever forward, breaking down bars.<br>
Look ever upward at the sun and the stars.<br>
Oh, my dark children, may my dreams and my prayers<br>
Impel you forever up the great stairs –<br>
For I will be with you till no white brother<br>
Dares keep down the children of the Negro Mother.&nbsp;</p>

Look ever upward at the sun and the stars.<br>
Oh, my dark children, may my dreams and my prayers<br>
Impel you forever up the great stairs –<br>
For I will be with you till no white brother<br>
Dares keep down the children of the Negro Mother.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>The Negro Mother</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Langston Hughes</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Children, I come back today<br>
To tell you a story of the long dark way<br>
That I had to climb, that I had to know<br>
In order that the race might live and grow.<br>
Look at my face – dark as the night –<br>
Yet shining like the sun with love's true light.<br>
I am the dark girl who crossed the red sea<br>
Carrying in my body the seed of the free.<br>
I am the woman who worked in the field<br>
Bringing the cotton and the corn to yield.<br>
I am the one who laboured as a slave,<br>
Beaten and mistreated for the work that I gave –<br>
Children sold away from me, I'm husband sold, too.<br>
No safety, no love, no respect was I due.<br>
<br>
Three hundred years in the deepest South:<br>
But God put a song and a prayer in my mouth.<br>
God put a dream like steel in my soul.<br>
Now, through my children, I'm reaching the goal.<br>
Now, through my children, young and free,<br>
I realised the blessing deed to me.<br>
I couldn't read then. I couldn't write.<br>
I had nothing, back there in the night.<br>
Sometimes, the valley was filled with tears,<br>
But I kept trudging on through the lonely years.<br>
Sometimes, the road was hot with the sun,<br>
But I had to keep on till my work was done:<br>
I had to keep on! No stopping for me –<br>
I was the seed of the coming Free.<br>
I nourished the dream that nothing could smother<br>
Deep in my breast – the Negro mother.<br>
I had only hope then, but now through you,<br>
Dark ones of today, my dreams must come true:<br>
All you dark children in the world out there,<br>
Remember my sweat, my pain, my despair.<br>
Remember my years, heavy with sorrow –<br>
And make of those years a torch for tomorrow.<br>
Make of my pass a road to the light<br>
Out of the darkness, the ignorance, the night.<br>
Lift high my banner out of the dust.<br>
Stand like free men supporting my trust.<br>
Believe in the right, let none push you back.<br>
Remember the whip and the slaver's track.<br>
Remember how the strong in struggle and strife<br>
Still bar you the way, and deny you life –<br>
But march ever forward, breaking down bars.<br>
Look ever upward at the sun and the stars.<br>
Oh, my dark children, may my dreams and my prayers<br>
Impel you forever up the great stairs –<br>
For I will be with you till no white brother<br>
Dares keep down the children of the Negro Mother.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>The Negro Mother</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Langston Hughes</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Children, I come back today<br>
To tell you a story of the long dark way<br>
That I had to climb, that I had to know<br>
In order that the race might live and grow.<br>
Look at my face – dark as the night –<br>
Yet shining like the sun with love's true light.<br>
I am the dark girl who crossed the red sea<br>
Carrying in my body the seed of the free.<br>
I am the woman who worked in the field<br>
Bringing the cotton and the corn to yield.<br>
I am the one who laboured as a slave,<br>
Beaten and mistreated for the work that I gave –<br>
Children sold away from me, I'm husband sold, too.<br>
No safety, no love, no respect was I due.<br>
<br>
Three hundred years in the deepest South:<br>
But God put a song and a prayer in my mouth.<br>
God put a dream like steel in my soul.<br>
Now, through my children, I'm reaching the goal.<br>
Now, through my children, young and free,<br>
I realised the blessing deed to me.<br>
I couldn't read then. I couldn't write.<br>
I had nothing, back there in the night.<br>
Sometimes, the valley was filled with tears,<br>
But I kept trudging on through the lonely years.<br>
Sometimes, the road was hot with the sun,<br>
But I had to keep on till my work was done:<br>
I had to keep on! No stopping for me –<br>
I was the seed of the coming Free.<br>
I nourished the dream that nothing could smother<br>
Deep in my breast – the Negro mother.<br>
I had only hope then, but now through you,<br>
Dark ones of today, my dreams must come true:<br>
All you dark children in the world out there,<br>
Remember my sweat, my pain, my despair.<br>
Remember my years, heavy with sorrow –<br>
And make of those years a torch for tomorrow.<br>
Make of my pass a road to the light<br>
Out of the darkness, the ignorance, the night.<br>
Lift high my banner out of the dust.<br>
Stand like free men supporting my trust.<br>
Believe in the right, let none push you back.<br>
Remember the whip and the slaver's track.<br>
Remember how the strong in struggle and strife<br>
Still bar you the way, and deny you life –<br>
But march ever forward, breaking down bars.<br>
Look ever upward at the sun and the stars.<br>
Oh, my dark children, may my dreams and my prayers<br>
Impel you forever up the great stairs –<br>
For I will be with you till no white brother<br>
Dares keep down the children of the Negro Mother.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Children, I come back today<br>
To tell you a story of the long dark way<br>
That I had to climb, that I had to know<br>
In order that the race might live and grow.<br>
Look at my face – dark as the night –<br>
Yet shining like the sun with love's true light.<br>
I am the dark girl who crossed the red sea<br>
Carrying in my body the seed of the free.<br>
I am the woman who worked in the field<br>
Bringing the cotton and the corn to yield.<br>
I am the one who laboured as a slave,<br>
Beaten and mistreated for the work that I gave –<br>
Children sold away from me, I'm husband sold, too.<br>
No safety, no love, no respect was I due.<br>
<br>
Three hundred years in the deepest South:<br>
But God put a song and a prayer in my mouth.<br>
God put a dream like steel in my soul.<br>
Now, through my children, I'm reaching the goal.<br>
Now, through my children, young and free,<br>
I realised the blessing deed to me.<br>
I couldn't read then. I couldn't write.<br>
I had nothing, back there in the night.<br>
Sometimes, the valley was filled with tears,<br>
But I kept trudging on through the lonely years.<br>
Sometimes, the road was hot with the sun,<br>
But I had to keep on till my work was done:<br>
I had to keep on! No stopping for me –<br>
I was the seed of the coming Free.<br>
I nourished the dream that nothing could smother<br>
Deep in my breast – the Negro mother.<br>
I had only hope then, but now through you,<br>
Dark ones of today, my dreams must come true:<br>
All you dark children in the world out there,<br>
Remember my sweat, my pain, my despair.<br>
Remember my years, heavy with sorrow –<br>
And make of those years a torch for tomorrow.<br>
Make of my pass a road to the light<br>
Out of the darkness, the ignorance, the night.<br>
Lift high my banner out of the dust.<br>
Stand like free men supporting my trust.<br>
Believe in the right, let none push you back.<br>
Remember the whip and the slaver's track.<br>
Remember how the strong in struggle and strife<br>
Still bar you the way, and deny you life –<br>
But march ever forward, breaking down bars.<br>
Look ever upward at the sun and the stars.<br>
Oh, my dark children, may my dreams and my prayers<br>
Impel you forever up the great stairs –<br>
For I will be with you till no white brother<br>
Dares keep down the children of the Negro Mother.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>The Negro Mother</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Langston Hughes</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Children, I come back today<br>
To tell you a story of the long dark way<br>
That I had to climb, that I had to know<br>
In order that the race might live and grow.<br>
Look at my face – dark as the night –<br>
Yet shining like the sun with love's true light.<br>
I am the dark girl who crossed the red sea<br>
Carrying in my body the seed of the free.<br>
I am the woman who worked in the field<br>
Bringing the cotton and the corn to yield.<br>
I am the one who laboured as a slave,<br>
Beaten and mistreated for the work that I gave –<br>
Children sold away from me, I'm husband sold, too.<br>
No safety, no love, no respect was I due.<br>
<br>
Three hundred years in the deepest South:<br>
But God put a song and a prayer in my mouth.<br>
God put a dream like steel in my soul.<br>
Now, through my children, I'm reaching the goal.<br>
Now, through my children, young and free,<br>
I realised the blessing deed to me.<br>
I couldn't read then. I couldn't write.<br>
I had nothing, back there in the night.<br>
Sometimes, the valley was filled with tears,<br>
But I kept trudging on through the lonely years.<br>
Sometimes, the road was hot with the sun,<br>
But I had to keep on till my work was done:<br>
I had to keep on! No stopping for me –<br>
I was the seed of the coming Free.<br>
I nourished the dream that nothing could smother<br>
Deep in my breast – the Negro mother.<br>
I had only hope then, but now through you,<br>
Dark ones of today, my dreams must come true:<br>
All you dark children in the world out there,<br>
Remember my sweat, my pain, my despair.<br>
Remember my years, heavy with sorrow –<br>
And make of those years a torch for tomorrow.<br>
Make of my pass a road to the light<br>
Out of the darkness, the ignorance, the night.<br>
Lift high my banner out of the dust.<br>
Stand like free men supporting my trust.<br>
Believe in the right, let none push you back.<br>
Remember the whip and the slaver's track.<br>
Remember how the strong in struggle and strife<br>
Still bar you the way, and deny you life –<br>
But march ever forward, breaking down bars.<br>
Look ever upward at the sun and the stars.<br>
Oh, my dark children, may my dreams and my prayers<br>
Impel you forever up the great stairs –<br>
For I will be with you till no white brother<br>
Dares keep down the children of the Negro Mother.&nbsp;</p>
