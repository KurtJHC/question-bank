          <strong>Library magician</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On Saturday afternoons, I go to the library for story time with my little sister, Tess. The children’s librarian, Mr Frank, has been leading story time ever since my mum was a little girl! Today he was wearing a funny white beard and a lumpy, brown coat.</p>
        <p>When we sat down with the other kids, Mr Frank winked and said, ‘Did you know that every book is alive?’</p>
        <p>He picked up a book that had a picture of a bird on the inside and flapped the covers as if they were wings. Mr Frank had a great big smile. He brushed his coat sleeve over the book, and, <em>whoosh</em>, a white bird flew up to the ceiling! We all laughed and wondered where it came from. But Mr Frank whispered, ‘Shhhh! This is a library!’ and gave us an even bigger smile.</p>
        <p>Next he picked up a book titled <em>How to Make a Puppet</em>. As soon as he showed it to us, a little cowboy popped up from between the pages! The little cowboy was moving and talking! I covered my mouth to keep from laughing.</p>
        <p>Then Mr Frank picked up a book with orange and black stripes on the cover. The title was <em>Tigers of East Asia</em>. I glanced at Tess. My heart was thumping. Mr Frank placed the book behind his back then whisked it out again! Now it had claws! <em>‘RAWWRRR!’</em></p>
        <p>Tess was a little scared and ready to go home. As we waited to have our books scanned, Mr Frank handed me a book with a worn red cover. ‘Your mum used to borrow this one,’ he said. His eyes twinkled.</p>
        <p>On the way home I read the title, trying to imagine what was inside. I didn’t dare open it. But as we walked, a small thrill was rising inside me like a bird taking off.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On Saturday afternoons, I go to the library for story time with my little sister, Tess. The children’s librarian, Mr Frank, has been leading story time ever since my mum was a little girl! Today he was wearing a funny white beard and a lumpy, brown coat.</p>
        <p>When we sat down with the other kids, Mr Frank winked and said, ‘Did you know that every book is alive?’</p>
        <p>He picked up a book that had a picture of a bird on the inside and flapped the covers as if they were wings. Mr Frank had a great big smile. He brushed his coat sleeve over the book, and, <em>whoosh</em>, a white bird flew up to the ceiling! We all laughed and wondered where it came from. But Mr Frank whispered, ‘Shhhh! This is a library!’ and gave us an even bigger smile.</p>
        <p>Next he picked up a book titled <em>How to Make a Puppet</em>. As soon as he showed it to us, a little cowboy popped up from between the pages! The little cowboy was moving and talking! I covered my mouth to keep from laughing.</p>
        <p>Then Mr Frank picked up a book with orange and black stripes on the cover. The title was <em>Tigers of East Asia</em>. I glanced at Tess. My heart was thumping. Mr Frank placed the book behind his back then whisked it out again! Now it had claws! <em>‘RAWWRRR!’</em></p>
        <p>Tess was a little scared and ready to go home. As we waited to have our books scanned, Mr Frank handed me a book with a worn red cover. ‘Your mum used to borrow this one,’ he said. His eyes twinkled.</p>
        <p>On the way home I read the title, trying to imagine what was inside. I didn’t dare open it. But as we walked, a small thrill was rising inside me like a bird taking off.</p>

          <strong>Library magician</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On Saturday afternoons, I go to the library for story time with my little sister, Tess. The children’s librarian, Mr Frank, has been leading story time ever since my mum was a little girl! Today he was wearing a funny white beard and a lumpy, brown coat.</p>
        <p>When we sat down with the other kids, Mr Frank winked and said, ‘Did you know that every book is alive?’</p>
        <p>He picked up a book that had a picture of a bird on the inside and flapped the covers as if they were wings. Mr Frank had a great big smile. He brushed his coat sleeve over the book, and, <em>whoosh</em>, a white bird flew up to the ceiling! We all laughed and wondered where it came from. But Mr Frank whispered, ‘Shhhh! This is a library!’ and gave us an even bigger smile.</p>
        <p>Next he picked up a book titled <em>How to Make a Puppet</em>. As soon as he showed it to us, a little cowboy popped up from between the pages! The little cowboy was moving and talking! I covered my mouth to keep from laughing.</p>
        <p>Then Mr Frank picked up a book with orange and black stripes on the cover. The title was <em>Tigers of East Asia</em>. I glanced at Tess. My heart was thumping. Mr Frank placed the book behind his back then whisked it out again! Now it had claws! <em>‘RAWWRRR!’</em></p>
        <p>Tess was a little scared and ready to go home. As we waited to have our books scanned, Mr Frank handed me a book with a worn red cover. ‘Your mum used to borrow this one,’ he said. His eyes twinkled.</p>
        <p>On the way home I read the title, trying to imagine what was inside. I didn’t dare open it. But as we walked, a small thrill was rising inside me like a bird taking off.</p>

          <em>Buck, a sled dog that has been treated badly by humans in the past, is drawn to life in the wild. One night he hears the call of a timber wolf and goes to investigate.</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>The stranger</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As he drew closer to the cry he went more slowly, with caution in every movement, till he came to an open place among the trees, and looking out saw, erect on haunches, with nose pointed to the sky, a long, lean, timber wolf.</p>
        <p>He had made no noise, yet it ceased from its howling and tried to sense his presence. Buck stalked into the open, half crouching, body gathered compactly together, tail straight and stiff, feet falling with unwonted care 1. Every movement advertised both a threat and an overture of friendliness. It was the menacing truce that marks the meeting of wild beasts that prey. But the wolf fled at the sight of him. He followed, with wild leapings, in a frenzy to overtake. He ran him into a blind channel, in the bed of the creek where a timber jam barred the way.</p>
        <p>Buck did not attack, but circled him about and hedged him in with friendly advances. The wolf was suspicious and afraid; for Buck made three of him in weight, while his head barely reached Buck’s shoulder. Watching his chance, he darted away, and the chase was resumed. Time and again he was cornered, and the thing repeated, though he was in poor condition, or Buck could not so easily have overtaken him. He would run till Buck’s head was even with his flank, when he would whirl around at bay, only to dash away again at the first opportunity.</p>
        <p>But in the end Buck’s persistence was rewarded; for the wolf, finding that no harm was intended, finally sniffed noses with him. Then they became friendly, and played about in the nervous, half-coy way with which fierce beasts belie their fierceness. After some time of this the wolf started off at an easy lope in a manner that plainly showed he was going somewhere. He made it clear to Buck that he was to come, and they ran side by side through the sombre twilight, straight up the creek bed, into the gorge from which it issued, and across the bleak divide where it took its rise.</p>

          <em>Buck, a sled dog that has been treated badly by humans in the past, is drawn to life in the wild. One night he hears the call of a timber wolf and goes to investigate.</em>

          <strong>The stranger</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As he drew closer to the cry he went more slowly, with caution in every movement, till he came to an open place among the trees, and looking out saw, erect on haunches, with nose pointed to the sky, a long, lean, timber wolf.</p>
        <p>He had made no noise, yet it ceased from its howling and tried to sense his presence. Buck stalked into the open, half crouching, body gathered compactly together, tail straight and stiff, feet falling with unwonted care 1. Every movement advertised both a threat and an overture of friendliness. It was the menacing truce that marks the meeting of wild beasts that prey. But the wolf fled at the sight of him. He followed, with wild leapings, in a frenzy to overtake. He ran him into a blind channel, in the bed of the creek where a timber jam barred the way.</p>
        <p>Buck did not attack, but circled him about and hedged him in with friendly advances. The wolf was suspicious and afraid; for Buck made three of him in weight, while his head barely reached Buck’s shoulder. Watching his chance, he darted away, and the chase was resumed. Time and again he was cornered, and the thing repeated, though he was in poor condition, or Buck could not so easily have overtaken him. He would run till Buck’s head was even with his flank, when he would whirl around at bay, only to dash away again at the first opportunity.</p>
        <p>But in the end Buck’s persistence was rewarded; for the wolf, finding that no harm was intended, finally sniffed noses with him. Then they became friendly, and played about in the nervous, half-coy way with which fierce beasts belie their fierceness. After some time of this the wolf started off at an easy lope in a manner that plainly showed he was going somewhere. He made it clear to Buck that he was to come, and they ran side by side through the sombre twilight, straight up the creek bed, into the gorge from which it issued, and across the bleak divide where it took its rise.</p>

        <p>As he drew closer to the cry he went more slowly, with caution in every movement, till he came to an open place among the trees, and looking out saw, erect on haunches, with nose pointed to the sky, a long, lean, timber wolf.</p>
        <p>He had made no noise, yet it ceased from its howling and tried to sense his presence. Buck stalked into the open, half crouching, body gathered compactly together, tail straight and stiff, feet falling with unwonted care 1. Every movement advertised both a threat and an overture of friendliness. It was the menacing truce that marks the meeting of wild beasts that prey. But the wolf fled at the sight of him. He followed, with wild leapings, in a frenzy to overtake. He ran him into a blind channel, in the bed of the creek where a timber jam barred the way.</p>
        <p>Buck did not attack, but circled him about and hedged him in with friendly advances. The wolf was suspicious and afraid; for Buck made three of him in weight, while his head barely reached Buck’s shoulder. Watching his chance, he darted away, and the chase was resumed. Time and again he was cornered, and the thing repeated, though he was in poor condition, or Buck could not so easily have overtaken him. He would run till Buck’s head was even with his flank, when he would whirl around at bay, only to dash away again at the first opportunity.</p>
