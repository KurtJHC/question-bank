Ballet originated in the Italian Renaissance courts of the 15th century. Noblemen and women were treated to lavish events, especially wedding celebrations, where dancing and music created an elaborate spectacle. Dancing masters taught the steps to the no-bility, and the court participated in the performances. In the 16th century, Catherine de Medici — an Italian noblewoman, wife of King Henry II of France and a great patron of the arts — began to fund ballet in the French court. Her elaborate festivals encouraged the growth of ballet de cour, a program that included&nbsp; dance, decor, costume, song, mu-sic and poetry. A century later, King Louis XIV helped to popularize and standardize the art form. A passionate dancer, he performed many roles himself, including that of the Sun King in Ballet de la nuit. His love of ballet fostered its elevation from a past time for amateurs to an endeavor requiring professional training.<br>

You can’t be serious. I looked around at the class and they were all like poles – slender, athletic bodies that made me feel like an elephant. I’ve always known that ballerinas were light and supple, but this was next level. I shuffled nervously to the bar and began pointing my toes and lifting my leg, as instructed. ‘And lift, and down, and lift and down…’ the teachers voice droned on monotonously. I looked at the girl in front of me. She had a scar that snaked along the top of her back. In the mirror I saw another girl, closer now. Her face and back had been hijacked by acne. I wouldn’t wish that on any-one, but I have to admit it made me feel better and realise – perhaps everyone else isn’t as perfect as I thought.

          <strong>Endurance: The Toby Price Story</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>By Toby Price<br>
<br>
Toby Joseph Price is an Australian off-road and enduro motorcycle racing world champi-on.</em><br><br>
Roto. You’ve probably never heard of it and I don’t blame you. It’s not small, quite the opposite, but it’s incredibly isolated and unpopulated. A vast expanse of land over 700 kilometres west of Sydney. It’s a pretty insignificant place for most people, I suppose. But in the early 1980s it was the centre of the universe for my parents, John and Pauline Price.</p>
        <p>Life out in Roto wasn’t for the faint-hearted, particularly in the early days. The property was 42,000 acres of cattle and sheep farm, sprawling across the western country. When my folks first got out there, there was no running water. Water itself was a scarce com-modity, hot water even more so. Having a hot shower meant lighting a fire under a 44-gallon drum filled with water. There were snakes and spiders every¬where…</p>
        <p>A few years into the stint at Roto I hit the scene, and from the word go I just couldn’t sit still. The two-and-a-half-metre high fence around the homestead suddenly wasn’t big enough. I was the complete opposite to Matthew; if my parents gave him a toy, he’d sit there and play quietly for hours. If they tried the same with me, I’d be out the door as soon as they turned their backs. I was a nightmare for my poor parents. When I was 18 months old I decided to climb this big tree in our front yard. Getting up there was easy, but I quickly realised I didn’t know how to get down. Mum came out to hang the washing and could hear me calling, but couldn’t work out where I was. She eventually looked up and there I was, eight metres in the air. If Dad had tried to climb the tree it would have snapped, so my uncle used the front end loader to lift him up high enough to grab me. I’d regularly scale that big fence around the homestead and go walkabout. Luckily, wherever I went, our Great Dane Harley went with me. Any time Mum realised I was gone, all she had to do was find the dog.</p>
        <p>The big smoke to us was Hillston, population of around 1000 people. It wasn’t exactly around the corner, either. Getting to school each day was an epic trek; first, Mum would drive us to the bus stop . . . which was 17 kilometres away. Then it was another 50-odd kilometres on the school bus. The bus didn’t have air-conditioning and it was regularly 35, 40, even 45 degrees out there. And because it was dirt roads almost the entire way to school, the bus driver wouldn’t let us open the windows. It was like a sauna on that old thing.</p>
        <p>Being so remote, there were little luxuries that were always out of reach for us. Like ice cream. The kids that lived in town could go and get an ice cream or milkshake whenever they wanted one. For us, it was a special thing to go into Bill Morgan’s cafe and have an ice cream. If I ever complained about wanting to get an ice cream Mum would say, ‘It’s a bit hard, Tobes. We live in the bush’. I heard that a lot as a kid. At least by the time I was born the electricity was connected and we had a freezer at home, so we could buy tubs of ice cream from the shops.</p>
        <p>We spent most of our time outdoors, but we did have one living-room tradition. Like most Australian households in the early 1990s, we always watched the Hey Hey It’s Satur-day variety show on the weekend. There was a character called Plucka Duck that would give away prizes to guests. Big prizes, too. Things like cars and family holidays. When I was five years old I decided I wanted to enter, so I sent in an envelope with my name on it. To be honest I always thought our mail never left Hillston. A few weeks later we were watching the show and the host Daryl Somers announced the next contestant for Plucka Duck. ‘Toby Price, we’ll be in touch soon.’ We were sitting there in complete shock. On the Monday afternoon the phone rang at home. It was a producer for Hey Hey, asking to speak to Toby.</p>
        <p>‘He’s at school,’ said Mum.</p>
        <p>‘What? He’s at school?’</p>
        <p>‘Yeah, he’s only five years old.’</p>
        <p>The producer just assumed I was an adult. What was a five-year-old doing trying to win a car? For me it seemed like the most normal thing in the world. They eventually agreed I could go to Melbourne for the filming. If I couldn’t physically spin the wheel around at least once, Dad would take my place. We did a practice spin, and it didn’t just make it all the way around, it landed on the new car! The cameras weren’t rolling yet, and I’d used up all my luck. In the recording I kept ending up with prizes that weren’t suitable for a five-year-old. There was a king-size bed set, $2000 worth of kitchen appliances, $3000 worth of ladies’ clothes . . . eventually I won a family holiday to the Gold Coast. Perfect. I think it was the longest ever Plucka Duck segment. When I got back to school at Hillston the next week, I was basically a movie star.</p>

          <strong>Endurance: The Toby Price Story</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>By Toby Price<br>
<br>
Toby Joseph Price is an Australian off-road and enduro motorcycle racing world champi-on.</em><br><br>
Roto. You’ve probably never heard of it and I don’t blame you. It’s not small, quite the opposite, but it’s incredibly isolated and unpopulated. A vast expanse of land over 700 kilometres west of Sydney. It’s a pretty insignificant place for most people, I suppose. But in the early 1980s it was the centre of the universe for my parents, John and Pauline Price.</p>
        <p>Life out in Roto wasn’t for the faint-hearted, particularly in the early days. The property was 42,000 acres of cattle and sheep farm, sprawling across the western country. When my folks first got out there, there was no running water. Water itself was a scarce com-modity, hot water even more so. Having a hot shower meant lighting a fire under a 44-gallon drum filled with water. There were snakes and spiders every¬where…</p>
        <p>A few years into the stint at Roto I hit the scene, and from the word go I just couldn’t sit still. The two-and-a-half-metre high fence around the homestead suddenly wasn’t big enough. I was the complete opposite to Matthew; if my parents gave him a toy, he’d sit there and play quietly for hours. If they tried the same with me, I’d be out the door as soon as they turned their backs. I was a nightmare for my poor parents. When I was 18 months old I decided to climb this big tree in our front yard. Getting up there was easy, but I quickly realised I didn’t know how to get down. Mum came out to hang the washing and could hear me calling, but couldn’t work out where I was. She eventually looked up and there I was, eight metres in the air. If Dad had tried to climb the tree it would have snapped, so my uncle used the front end loader to lift him up high enough to grab me. I’d regularly scale that big fence around the homestead and go walkabout. Luckily, wherever I went, our Great Dane Harley went with me. Any time Mum realised I was gone, all she had to do was find the dog.</p>
        <p>The big smoke to us was Hillston, population of around 1000 people. It wasn’t exactly around the corner, either. Getting to school each day was an epic trek; first, Mum would drive us to the bus stop . . . which was 17 kilometres away. Then it was another 50-odd kilometres on the school bus. The bus didn’t have air-conditioning and it was regularly 35, 40, even 45 degrees out there. And because it was dirt roads almost the entire way to school, the bus driver wouldn’t let us open the windows. It was like a sauna on that old thing.</p>
        <p>Being so remote, there were little luxuries that were always out of reach for us. Like ice cream. The kids that lived in town could go and get an ice cream or milkshake whenever they wanted one. For us, it was a special thing to go into Bill Morgan’s cafe and have an ice cream. If I ever complained about wanting to get an ice cream Mum would say, ‘It’s a bit hard, Tobes. We live in the bush’. I heard that a lot as a kid. At least by the time I was born the electricity was connected and we had a freezer at home, so we could buy tubs of ice cream from the shops.</p>
        <p>We spent most of our time outdoors, but we did have one living-room tradition. Like most Australian households in the early 1990s, we always watched the Hey Hey It’s Satur-day variety show on the weekend. There was a character called Plucka Duck that would give away prizes to guests. Big prizes, too. Things like cars and family holidays. When I was five years old I decided I wanted to enter, so I sent in an envelope with my name on it. To be honest I always thought our mail never left Hillston. A few weeks later we were watching the show and the host Daryl Somers announced the next contestant for Plucka Duck. ‘Toby Price, we’ll be in touch soon.’ We were sitting there in complete shock. On the Monday afternoon the phone rang at home. It was a producer for Hey Hey, asking to speak to Toby.</p>
        <p>‘He’s at school,’ said Mum.</p>
        <p>‘What? He’s at school?’</p>
        <p>‘Yeah, he’s only five years old.’</p>
        <p>The producer just assumed I was an adult. What was a five-year-old doing trying to win a car? For me it seemed like the most normal thing in the world. They eventually agreed I could go to Melbourne for the filming. If I couldn’t physically spin the wheel around at least once, Dad would take my place. We did a practice spin, and it didn’t just make it all the way around, it landed on the new car! The cameras weren’t rolling yet, and I’d used up all my luck. In the recording I kept ending up with prizes that weren’t suitable for a five-year-old. There was a king-size bed set, $2000 worth of kitchen appliances, $3000 worth of ladies’ clothes . . . eventually I won a family holiday to the Gold Coast. Perfect. I think it was the longest ever Plucka Duck segment. When I got back to school at Hillston the next week, I was basically a movie star.</p>

          <strong>Endurance: The Toby Price Story</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>By Toby Price<br>
<br>
Toby Joseph Price is an Australian off-road and enduro motorcycle racing world champi-on.</em><br><br>
Roto. You’ve probably never heard of it and I don’t blame you. It’s not small, quite the opposite, but it’s incredibly isolated and unpopulated. A vast expanse of land over 700 kilometres west of Sydney. It’s a pretty insignificant place for most people, I suppose. But in the early 1980s it was the centre of the universe for my parents, John and Pauline Price.</p>
        <p>Life out in Roto wasn’t for the faint-hearted, particularly in the early days. The property was 42,000 acres of cattle and sheep farm, sprawling across the western country. When my folks first got out there, there was no running water. Water itself was a scarce com-modity, hot water even more so. Having a hot shower meant lighting a fire under a 44-gallon drum filled with water. There were snakes and spiders every¬where…</p>
        <p>A few years into the stint at Roto I hit the scene, and from the word go I just couldn’t sit still. The two-and-a-half-metre high fence around the homestead suddenly wasn’t big enough. I was the complete opposite to Matthew; if my parents gave him a toy, he’d sit there and play quietly for hours. If they tried the same with me, I’d be out the door as soon as they turned their backs. I was a nightmare for my poor parents. When I was 18 months old I decided to climb this big tree in our front yard. Getting up there was easy, but I quickly realised I didn’t know how to get down. Mum came out to hang the washing and could hear me calling, but couldn’t work out where I was. She eventually looked up and there I was, eight metres in the air. If Dad had tried to climb the tree it would have snapped, so my uncle used the front end loader to lift him up high enough to grab me. I’d regularly scale that big fence around the homestead and go walkabout. Luckily, wherever I went, our Great Dane Harley went with me. Any time Mum realised I was gone, all she had to do was find the dog.</p>
        <p>The big smoke to us was Hillston, population of around 1000 people. It wasn’t exactly around the corner, either. Getting to school each day was an epic trek; first, Mum would drive us to the bus stop . . . which was 17 kilometres away. Then it was another 50-odd kilometres on the school bus. The bus didn’t have air-conditioning and it was regularly 35, 40, even 45 degrees out there. And because it was dirt roads almost the entire way to school, the bus driver wouldn’t let us open the windows. It was like a sauna on that old thing.</p>
        <p>Being so remote, there were little luxuries that were always out of reach for us. Like ice cream. The kids that lived in town could go and get an ice cream or milkshake whenever they wanted one. For us, it was a special thing to go into Bill Morgan’s cafe and have an ice cream. If I ever complained about wanting to get an ice cream Mum would say, ‘It’s a bit hard, Tobes. We live in the bush’. I heard that a lot as a kid. At least by the time I was born the electricity was connected and we had a freezer at home, so we could buy tubs of ice cream from the shops.</p>
        <p>We spent most of our time outdoors, but we did have one living-room tradition. Like most Australian households in the early 1990s, we always watched the Hey Hey It’s Satur-day variety show on the weekend. There was a character called Plucka Duck that would give away prizes to guests. Big prizes, too. Things like cars and family holidays. When I was five years old I decided I wanted to enter, so I sent in an envelope with my name on it. To be honest I always thought our mail never left Hillston. A few weeks later we were watching the show and the host Daryl Somers announced the next contestant for Plucka Duck. ‘Toby Price, we’ll be in touch soon.’ We were sitting there in complete shock. On the Monday afternoon the phone rang at home. It was a producer for Hey Hey, asking to speak to Toby.</p>
        <p>‘He’s at school,’ said Mum.</p>
        <p>‘What? He’s at school?’</p>
        <p>‘Yeah, he’s only five years old.’</p>
        <p>The producer just assumed I was an adult. What was a five-year-old doing trying to win a car? For me it seemed like the most normal thing in the world. They eventually agreed I could go to Melbourne for the filming. If I couldn’t physically spin the wheel around at least once, Dad would take my place. We did a practice spin, and it didn’t just make it all the way around, it landed on the new car! The cameras weren’t rolling yet, and I’d used up all my luck. In the recording I kept ending up with prizes that weren’t suitable for a five-year-old. There was a king-size bed set, $2000 worth of kitchen appliances, $3000 worth of ladies’ clothes . . . eventually I won a family holiday to the Gold Coast. Perfect. I think it was the longest ever Plucka Duck segment. When I got back to school at Hillston the next week, I was basically a movie star.</p>

          <strong>Endurance: The Toby Price Story</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>By Toby Price<br>
<br>
Toby Joseph Price is an Australian off-road and enduro motorcycle racing world champi-on.</em><br><br>
Roto. You’ve probably never heard of it and I don’t blame you. It’s not small, quite the opposite, but it’s incredibly isolated and unpopulated. A vast expanse of land over 700 kilometres west of Sydney. It’s a pretty insignificant place for most people, I suppose. But in the early 1980s it was the centre of the universe for my parents, John and Pauline Price.</p>
        <p>Life out in Roto wasn’t for the faint-hearted, particularly in the early days. The property was 42,000 acres of cattle and sheep farm, sprawling across the western country. When my folks first got out there, there was no running water. Water itself was a scarce com-modity, hot water even more so. Having a hot shower meant lighting a fire under a 44-gallon drum filled with water. There were snakes and spiders every¬where…</p>
        <p>A few years into the stint at Roto I hit the scene, and from the word go I just couldn’t sit still. The two-and-a-half-metre high fence around the homestead suddenly wasn’t big enough. I was the complete opposite to Matthew; if my parents gave him a toy, he’d sit there and play quietly for hours. If they tried the same with me, I’d be out the door as soon as they turned their backs. I was a nightmare for my poor parents. When I was 18 months old I decided to climb this big tree in our front yard. Getting up there was easy, but I quickly realised I didn’t know how to get down. Mum came out to hang the washing and could hear me calling, but couldn’t work out where I was. She eventually looked up and there I was, eight metres in the air. If Dad had tried to climb the tree it would have snapped, so my uncle used the front end loader to lift him up high enough to grab me. I’d regularly scale that big fence around the homestead and go walkabout. Luckily, wherever I went, our Great Dane Harley went with me. Any time Mum realised I was gone, all she had to do was find the dog.</p>
        <p>The big smoke to us was Hillston, population of around 1000 people. It wasn’t exactly around the corner, either. Getting to school each day was an epic trek; first, Mum would drive us to the bus stop . . . which was 17 kilometres away. Then it was another 50-odd kilometres on the school bus. The bus didn’t have air-conditioning and it was regularly 35, 40, even 45 degrees out there. And because it was dirt roads almost the entire way to school, the bus driver wouldn’t let us open the windows. It was like a sauna on that old thing.</p>
        <p>Being so remote, there were little luxuries that were always out of reach for us. Like ice cream. The kids that lived in town could go and get an ice cream or milkshake whenever they wanted one. For us, it was a special thing to go into Bill Morgan’s cafe and have an ice cream. If I ever complained about wanting to get an ice cream Mum would say, ‘It’s a bit hard, Tobes. We live in the bush’. I heard that a lot as a kid. At least by the time I was born the electricity was connected and we had a freezer at home, so we could buy tubs of ice cream from the shops.</p>
        <p>We spent most of our time outdoors, but we did have one living-room tradition. Like most Australian households in the early 1990s, we always watched the Hey Hey It’s Satur-day variety show on the weekend. There was a character called Plucka Duck that would give away prizes to guests. Big prizes, too. Things like cars and family holidays. When I was five years old I decided I wanted to enter, so I sent in an envelope with my name on it. To be honest I always thought our mail never left Hillston. A few weeks later we were watching the show and the host Daryl Somers announced the next contestant for Plucka Duck. ‘Toby Price, we’ll be in touch soon.’ We were sitting there in complete shock. On the Monday afternoon the phone rang at home. It was a producer for Hey Hey, asking to speak to Toby.</p>
        <p>‘He’s at school,’ said Mum.</p>
        <p>‘What? He’s at school?’</p>
        <p>‘Yeah, he’s only five years old.’</p>
        <p>The producer just assumed I was an adult. What was a five-year-old doing trying to win a car? For me it seemed like the most normal thing in the world. They eventually agreed I could go to Melbourne for the filming. If I couldn’t physically spin the wheel around at least once, Dad would take my place. We did a practice spin, and it didn’t just make it all the way around, it landed on the new car! The cameras weren’t rolling yet, and I’d used up all my luck. In the recording I kept ending up with prizes that weren’t suitable for a five-year-old. There was a king-size bed set, $2000 worth of kitchen appliances, $3000 worth of ladies’ clothes . . . eventually I won a family holiday to the Gold Coast. Perfect. I think it was the longest ever Plucka Duck segment. When I got back to school at Hillston the next week, I was basically a movie star.</p>

          <strong>My Country</strong>
        </p>
        <p>The love of field and coppice<br>
Of green and shaded lanes,<br>
Of ordered woods and gardens<br>
Is running in your veins.<br>
Strong love of grey-blue distance,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;<br>
Brown streams and soft, dim skies<br>
I know, but cannot share it,<br>
My love is otherwise.</p>
        <p>I love a sunburnt country,<br>
A land of sweeping plains,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;10<br>
Of ragged mountain ranges,<br>
Of droughts and flooding rains.<br>
I love her far horizons,<br>
I love her jewel-sea,<br>
Her beauty and her terror&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 15&nbsp;<br>
The wide brown land for me!<br>
…</p>
        <p>Core of my heart, my country!<br>
Land of the rainbow gold,<br>
For flood and fire and famine<br>
She pays us back threefold.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;20<br>
Over the thirsty paddocks,<br>
Watch, after many days,<br>
The filmy veil of greenness<br>
That thickens as we gaze ...</p>
        <p>An opal-hearted country,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;25<br>
A wilful, lavish land<br>
All you who have not loved her,<br>
You will not understand<br>
though Earth holds many splendours,<br>
Wherever I may die,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;30&nbsp;<br>
I know to what brown country<br>
My homing thoughts will fly.</p>

          <br>
          <strong>Ghost Bat</strong>
        </p>
        <p>The Ghost bat is a flying mammal found in northern Australia. It is the only Australian bat that preys on large vertebrates such as birds, reptiles, and other mammals. The wing membrane and bare skin of the Ghost bat are pale in colour; its fur is light or dark grey over the back and paler at the front. <strong>1</strong> ............; the eyes are also large and dark in col-our.</p>
        <p>Ghost bats are native to Australia where they occur in the Northern Pilbara and Kimber-ley in Western Australia, the Top End of the continent, and in Queensland. They typically roost in caves, sheltered rock crevices, boulder piles, or disused mines, and only occa-sionally in abandoned buildings. <strong>2</strong> ............ They favour these caves with multiple en-trance ways as they are large enough to accommodate the greater wingspan of the spe-cies and allow an alternative exit when sensing a threat. Ghost bats require several suit-able sites for rest, feeding and reproduction, and change locations seasonally.</p>
        <p><strong>3</strong> ............ They also hunt other species of microbats such as sheathtails, bentwings, horseshoe bats, and the little cave eptesicus.</p>
        <p>Ghost bats are nocturnal creatures. They are inactive during daylight hours and do not hibernate. They live in colonies which size usually reduces in the austral winter and in-creases when bats gather to breed or females form maternity groups. <strong>4</strong> ............ They hunt via a ‘sit and wait’ technique while suspended from a tree or as low surveys over vegetation. Ghost bats detect their prey using acute sight and hearing, combined with echolocation. Prey may be taken at or to the ground. Once located, an animal is held down via the thumb claws and killed by a single bite to the neck. The prey is killed at the ground or in flight and taken to a perch to be consumed - feeding may be at an over-hanging rock or smaller cave for this purpose. Ghost bats are able to communicate with each other vocally. Their voice is audible to humans and transliterated as ‘dirrup dirrup’. This twittering call is given when the bat is excited or before leaving the roost to feed. A chirp uttered by the species resembles crickets. Ghost bats are generally quiet, but some vocalization is known in captivity when a squealing sound accompanies a squabble over food. <strong>5</strong> ............</p>
        <p>According to the IUCN Red List, the total population size of the Ghost bats is 4,000-6,000 mature individuals. Currently, this species is classified as Vulnerable (VU) on the IUCN Red List and its numbers today are decreasing.<br>
Ghost bats are vulnerable to several hazards, one of which is barbed wire fencing that accounts for many deaths when bats are snagged through the easily torn wing mem-brane while in flight. The damage caused by the barbed wire strands often left littering their environment, is greatly increased as the bat becomes entangled as it attempts to dislodge itself. <strong>6</strong> ............ Attempts to view at Ghost bats’ roosts are especially discour-aged due to the rapid decline in range and population.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>The Ghost bat is a flying mammal found in northern Australia. It is the only Australian bat that preys on large vertebrates such as birds, reptiles, and other mammals. The wing membrane and bare skin of the Ghost bat are pale in colour; its fur is light or dark grey over the back and paler at the front. <strong>1</strong> ............; the eyes are also large and dark in col-our.</p>
        <p>Ghost bats are native to Australia where they occur in the Northern Pilbara and Kimber-ley in Western Australia, the Top End of the continent, and in Queensland. They typically roost in caves, sheltered rock crevices, boulder piles, or disused mines, and only occa-sionally in abandoned buildings. <strong>2</strong> ............ They favour these caves with multiple en-trance ways as they are large enough to accommodate the greater wingspan of the spe-cies and allow an alternative exit when sensing a threat. Ghost bats require several suit-able sites for rest, feeding and reproduction, and change locations seasonally.</p>
        <p><strong>3</strong> ............ They also hunt other species of microbats such as sheathtails, bentwings, horseshoe bats, and the little cave eptesicus.</p>
        <p>Ghost bats are nocturnal creatures. They are inactive during daylight hours and do not hibernate. They live in colonies which size usually reduces in the austral winter and in-creases when bats gather to breed or females form maternity groups. <strong>4</strong> ............ They hunt via a ‘sit and wait’ technique while suspended from a tree or as low surveys over vegetation. Ghost bats detect their prey using acute sight and hearing, combined with echolocation. Prey may be taken at or to the ground. Once located, an animal is held down via the thumb claws and killed by a single bite to the neck. The prey is killed at the ground or in flight and taken to a perch to be consumed - feeding may be at an over-hanging rock or smaller cave for this purpose. Ghost bats are able to communicate with each other vocally. Their voice is audible to humans and transliterated as ‘dirrup dirrup’. This twittering call is given when the bat is excited or before leaving the roost to feed. A chirp uttered by the species resembles crickets. Ghost bats are generally quiet, but some vocalization is known in captivity when a squealing sound accompanies a squabble over food. <strong>5</strong> ............</p>
        <p>According to the IUCN Red List, the total population size of the Ghost bats is 4,000-6,000 mature individuals. Currently, this species is classified as Vulnerable (VU) on the IUCN Red List and its numbers today are decreasing.<br>
Ghost bats are vulnerable to several hazards, one of which is barbed wire fencing that accounts for many deaths when bats are snagged through the easily torn wing mem-brane while in flight. The damage caused by the barbed wire strands often left littering their environment, is greatly increased as the bat becomes entangled as it attempts to dislodge itself. <strong>6</strong> ............ Attempts to view at Ghost bats’ roosts are especially discour-aged due to the rapid decline in range and population.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Ghost Bat</strong>
        </p>
        <p>The Ghost bat is a flying mammal found in northern Australia. It is the only Australian bat that preys on large vertebrates such as birds, reptiles, and other mammals. The wing membrane and bare skin of the Ghost bat are pale in colour; its fur is light or dark grey over the back and paler at the front. <strong>1</strong> ............; the eyes are also large and dark in col-our.</p>
        <p>Ghost bats are native to Australia where they occur in the Northern Pilbara and Kimber-ley in Western Australia, the Top End of the continent, and in Queensland. They typically roost in caves, sheltered rock crevices, boulder piles, or disused mines, and only occa-sionally in abandoned buildings. <strong>2</strong> ............ They favour these caves with multiple en-trance ways as they are large enough to accommodate the greater wingspan of the spe-cies and allow an alternative exit when sensing a threat. Ghost bats require several suit-able sites for rest, feeding and reproduction, and change locations seasonally.</p>
        <p><strong>3</strong> ............ They also hunt other species of microbats such as sheathtails, bentwings, horseshoe bats, and the little cave eptesicus.</p>
        <p>Ghost bats are nocturnal creatures. They are inactive during daylight hours and do not hibernate. They live in colonies which size usually reduces in the austral winter and in-creases when bats gather to breed or females form maternity groups. <strong>4</strong> ............ They hunt via a ‘sit and wait’ technique while suspended from a tree or as low surveys over vegetation. Ghost bats detect their prey using acute sight and hearing, combined with echolocation. Prey may be taken at or to the ground. Once located, an animal is held down via the thumb claws and killed by a single bite to the neck. The prey is killed at the ground or in flight and taken to a perch to be consumed - feeding may be at an over-hanging rock or smaller cave for this purpose. Ghost bats are able to communicate with each other vocally. Their voice is audible to humans and transliterated as ‘dirrup dirrup’. This twittering call is given when the bat is excited or before leaving the roost to feed. A chirp uttered by the species resembles crickets. Ghost bats are generally quiet, but some vocalization is known in captivity when a squealing sound accompanies a squabble over food. <strong>5</strong> ............</p>
        <p>According to the IUCN Red List, the total population size of the Ghost bats is 4,000-6,000 mature individuals. Currently, this species is classified as Vulnerable (VU) on the IUCN Red List and its numbers today are decreasing.<br>
Ghost bats are vulnerable to several hazards, one of which is barbed wire fencing that accounts for many deaths when bats are snagged through the easily torn wing mem-brane while in flight. The damage caused by the barbed wire strands often left littering their environment, is greatly increased as the bat becomes entangled as it attempts to dislodge itself. <strong>6</strong> ............ Attempts to view at Ghost bats’ roosts are especially discour-aged due to the rapid decline in range and population.&nbsp;</p>

          <br>
          <strong>Ghost Bat</strong>
        </p>
        <p>The Ghost bat is a flying mammal found in northern Australia. It is the only Australian bat that preys on large vertebrates such as birds, reptiles, and other mammals. The wing membrane and bare skin of the Ghost bat are pale in colour; its fur is light or dark grey over the back and paler at the front. <strong>1</strong> ............; the eyes are also large and dark in col-our.</p>
        <p>Ghost bats are native to Australia where they occur in the Northern Pilbara and Kimber-ley in Western Australia, the Top End of the continent, and in Queensland. They typically roost in caves, sheltered rock crevices, boulder piles, or disused mines, and only occa-sionally in abandoned buildings. <strong>2</strong> ............ They favour these caves with multiple en-trance ways as they are large enough to accommodate the greater wingspan of the spe-cies and allow an alternative exit when sensing a threat. Ghost bats require several suit-able sites for rest, feeding and reproduction, and change locations seasonally.</p>
        <p><strong>3</strong> ............ They also hunt other species of microbats such as sheathtails, bentwings, horseshoe bats, and the little cave eptesicus.</p>
        <p>Ghost bats are nocturnal creatures. They are inactive during daylight hours and do not hibernate. They live in colonies which size usually reduces in the austral winter and in-creases when bats gather to breed or females form maternity groups. <strong>4</strong> ............ They hunt via a ‘sit and wait’ technique while suspended from a tree or as low surveys over vegetation. Ghost bats detect their prey using acute sight and hearing, combined with echolocation. Prey may be taken at or to the ground. Once located, an animal is held down via the thumb claws and killed by a single bite to the neck. The prey is killed at the ground or in flight and taken to a perch to be consumed - feeding may be at an over-hanging rock or smaller cave for this purpose. Ghost bats are able to communicate with each other vocally. Their voice is audible to humans and transliterated as ‘dirrup dirrup’. This twittering call is given when the bat is excited or before leaving the roost to feed. A chirp uttered by the species resembles crickets. Ghost bats are generally quiet, but some vocalization is known in captivity when a squealing sound accompanies a squabble over food. <strong>5</strong> ............</p>
        <p>According to the IUCN Red List, the total population size of the Ghost bats is 4,000-6,000 mature individuals. Currently, this species is classified as Vulnerable (VU) on the IUCN Red List and its numbers today are decreasing.<br>
Ghost bats are vulnerable to several hazards, one of which is barbed wire fencing that accounts for many deaths when bats are snagged through the easily torn wing mem-brane while in flight. The damage caused by the barbed wire strands often left littering their environment, is greatly increased as the bat becomes entangled as it attempts to dislodge itself. <strong>6</strong> ............ Attempts to view at Ghost bats’ roosts are especially discour-aged due to the rapid decline in range and population.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>An extract from The Adventures of Jerry Muskrat by Thornton Burges.</em><br><br>
The beautiful springtime had brought a great deal of happiness to the Smiling Pool, as it had to the Green Meadows and to the Green Forest. Great-Grandfather Frog, who had slept the long winter away in his own special bed way down in the mud, had woken up with an appetite so great that for a while it seemed as if he could think of nothing but his stomach. Jerry Muskrat had felt the spring fever in his bones and had gone up and down the Laughing Brook, poking into all kinds of places just for the fun of seeing new things. Little Joe Otter had been more full of fun than ever, if that were possible. Mr. and Mrs. Redwing had come back to the bulrushes from their winter home way down in the warm Southland. Everybody was happy, just as happy as could be.</p>
        <p>One sunny morning Jerry Muskrat sat on the Big Rock in the middle of the Smiling Pool, just thinking of how happy everybody was and laughing at Little Joe Otter, who was cutting up all sorts of capers in the water. Suddenly Jerry’s sharp eyes saw something that made him wrinkle his forehead in a puzzled frown and looked at the opposite bank. Finally, he called to Little Joe Otter.</p>
        <p>“Hi, Little Joe! Come over here!” shouted Jerry.</p>
        <p>“What for?” asked Little Joe, turning a somersault in the water.</p>
        <p>“I want you to see if there is anything wrong with my eyes,” replied Jerry.</p>
        <p>Little Joe Otter stopped swimming and stared up at Jerry Muskrat. “They look all right to me,” said he, as he started to climb up on the Big Rock.</p>
        <p>“Of course they look all right,” replied Jerry, “but what I want to know is if they see all right. Look over at that bank.”</p>
        <p>Little Joe Otter looked over at the bank. He stared and stared, but he didn’t see anything unusual. It looked just as it always did. He told Jerry Muskrat so.</p>
        <p>“Then it must be my eyes,” sighed Jerry. “It certainly must be my eyes. It looks to me as if the water does not come as high up on the bank as it did yesterday.”</p>
        <p>Little Joe Otter looked again and his eyes opened wide. “You are right, Jerry Muskrat!” he cried. “There’s nothing the matter with your eyes. The water is as low as it ever gets, even in the very middle of summer. What can it mean?”</p>
        <p>“I don’t know,” replied Jerry Muskrat. “It is queer! It certainly is very queer! Let’s go ask Grandfather Frog. You know he is very old and very wise, so perhaps he can tell us what it means.”</p>
        <p>Splash! Jerry Muskrat and Little Joe Otter dived into the Smiling Pool and started a race to see who could reach Grandfather Frog first. He was sitting among the bulrushes on the edge of the Smiling Pool, for the lily-pads were not yet big enough for him to sit on comfortably.</p>
        <p>“Oh, Grandfather Frog, what’s the matter with the Smiling Pool?” they shouted, as they came up quite out of breath.</p>
        <p>“Chugarum! There’s nothing the matter with the Smiling Pool; it’s the best place in all the world,” replied Grandfather Frog gruffly.</p>
        <p>“But there is something the matter,” insisted Jerry Muskrat, and then he told what he had discovered.</p>
        <p>“I don’t believe it,” said Grandfather Frog. “I never heard of such a thing in the springtime.”</p>
        <p>Grandfather Frog sat among the bulrushes on the edge of the Smiling Pool. Over his head Mr. Redwing was singing as if his heart would burst with the very joy of springtime.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Tra-la-la-lee, see me! See me!<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Happy am I as I can be!<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Happy am I the whole day long<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;And so I sing my gladsome song.”</p>
        <p>Of course Mr. Redwing was happy. Why shouldn’t he be? Here it was the beautiful springtime, the gladdest time of all the year, the time when happiness creeps into everybody’s heart. Grandfather Frog listened. He nodded his head. “Chugarum! I’m happy, too,” said Grandfather Frog. But even as he said it, a little worried look crept into his big goggly eyes and then down to the corners of his big mouth, which had been stretched in a smile. Little by little the smile grew smaller and smaller, until there wasn’t any smile. No, Sir, there wasn’t any smile. Instead of looking happy, as he said he felt, Grandfather Frog actually looked unhappy.</p>

        <p><em>An extract from The Adventures of Jerry Muskrat by Thornton Burges.</em><br><br>
The beautiful springtime had brought a great deal of happiness to the Smiling Pool, as it had to the Green Meadows and to the Green Forest. Great-Grandfather Frog, who had slept the long winter away in his own special bed way down in the mud, had woken up with an appetite so great that for a while it seemed as if he could think of nothing but his stomach. Jerry Muskrat had felt the spring fever in his bones and had gone up and down the Laughing Brook, poking into all kinds of places just for the fun of seeing new things. Little Joe Otter had been more full of fun than ever, if that were possible. Mr. and Mrs. Redwing had come back to the bulrushes from their winter home way down in the warm Southland. Everybody was happy, just as happy as could be.</p>
        <p>One sunny morning Jerry Muskrat sat on the Big Rock in the middle of the Smiling Pool, just thinking of how happy everybody was and laughing at Little Joe Otter, who was cutting up all sorts of capers in the water. Suddenly Jerry’s sharp eyes saw something that made him wrinkle his forehead in a puzzled frown and looked at the opposite bank. Finally, he called to Little Joe Otter.</p>
        <p>“Hi, Little Joe! Come over here!” shouted Jerry.</p>
        <p>“What for?” asked Little Joe, turning a somersault in the water.</p>
        <p>“I want you to see if there is anything wrong with my eyes,” replied Jerry.</p>
        <p>Little Joe Otter stopped swimming and stared up at Jerry Muskrat. “They look all right to me,” said he, as he started to climb up on the Big Rock.</p>
        <p>“Of course they look all right,” replied Jerry, “but what I want to know is if they see all right. Look over at that bank.”</p>
        <p>Little Joe Otter looked over at the bank. He stared and stared, but he didn’t see anything unusual. It looked just as it always did. He told Jerry Muskrat so.</p>
        <p>“Then it must be my eyes,” sighed Jerry. “It certainly must be my eyes. It looks to me as if the water does not come as high up on the bank as it did yesterday.”</p>
        <p>Little Joe Otter looked again and his eyes opened wide. “You are right, Jerry Muskrat!” he cried. “There’s nothing the matter with your eyes. The water is as low as it ever gets, even in the very middle of summer. What can it mean?”</p>
        <p>“I don’t know,” replied Jerry Muskrat. “It is queer! It certainly is very queer! Let’s go ask Grandfather Frog. You know he is very old and very wise, so perhaps he can tell us what it means.”</p>

        <p><em>An extract from The Adventures of Jerry Muskrat by Thornton Burges.</em><br><br>
The beautiful springtime had brought a great deal of happiness to the Smiling Pool, as it had to the Green Meadows and to the Green Forest. Great-Grandfather Frog, who had slept the long winter away in his own special bed way down in the mud, had woken up with an appetite so great that for a while it seemed as if he could think of nothing but his stomach. Jerry Muskrat had felt the spring fever in his bones and had gone up and down the Laughing Brook, poking into all kinds of places just for the fun of seeing new things. Little Joe Otter had been more full of fun than ever, if that were possible. Mr. and Mrs. Redwing had come back to the bulrushes from their winter home way down in the warm Southland. Everybody was happy, just as happy as could be.</p>
        <p>One sunny morning Jerry Muskrat sat on the Big Rock in the middle of the Smiling Pool, just thinking of how happy everybody was and laughing at Little Joe Otter, who was cutting up all sorts of capers in the water. Suddenly Jerry’s sharp eyes saw something that made him wrinkle his forehead in a puzzled frown and looked at the opposite bank. Finally, he called to Little Joe Otter.</p>
        <p>“Hi, Little Joe! Come over here!” shouted Jerry.</p>
        <p>“What for?” asked Little Joe, turning a somersault in the water.</p>
        <p>“I want you to see if there is anything wrong with my eyes,” replied Jerry.</p>
        <p>Little Joe Otter stopped swimming and stared up at Jerry Muskrat. “They look all right to me,” said he, as he started to climb up on the Big Rock.</p>
        <p>“Of course they look all right,” replied Jerry, “but what I want to know is if they see all right. Look over at that bank.”</p>
        <p>Little Joe Otter looked over at the bank. He stared and stared, but he didn’t see anything unusual. It looked just as it always did. He told Jerry Muskrat so.</p>
        <p>“Then it must be my eyes,” sighed Jerry. “It certainly must be my eyes. It looks to me as if the water does not come as high up on the bank as it did yesterday.”</p>
        <p>Little Joe Otter looked again and his eyes opened wide. “You are right, Jerry Muskrat!” he cried. “There’s nothing the matter with your eyes. The water is as low as it ever gets, even in the very middle of summer. What can it mean?”</p>
        <p>“I don’t know,” replied Jerry Muskrat. “It is queer! It certainly is very queer! Let’s go ask Grandfather Frog. You know he is very old and very wise, so perhaps he can tell us what it means.”</p>
        <p>Splash! Jerry Muskrat and Little Joe Otter dived into the Smiling Pool and started a race to see who could reach Grandfather Frog first. He was sitting among the bulrushes on the edge of the Smiling Pool, for the lily-pads were not yet big enough for him to sit on comfortably.</p>
        <p>“Oh, Grandfather Frog, what’s the matter with the Smiling Pool?” they shouted, as they came up quite out of breath.</p>
        <p>“Chugarum! There’s nothing the matter with the Smiling Pool; it’s the best place in all the world,” replied Grandfather Frog gruffly.</p>
        <p>“But there is something the matter,” insisted Jerry Muskrat, and then he told what he had discovered.</p>
        <p>“I don’t believe it,” said Grandfather Frog. “I never heard of such a thing in the springtime.”</p>
        <p>Grandfather Frog sat among the bulrushes on the edge of the Smiling Pool. Over his head Mr. Redwing was singing as if his heart would burst with the very joy of springtime.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Tra-la-la-lee, see me! See me!<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Happy am I as I can be!<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Happy am I the whole day long<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;And so I sing my gladsome song.”</p>
        <p>Of course Mr. Redwing was happy. Why shouldn’t he be? Here it was the beautiful springtime, the gladdest time of all the year, the time when happiness creeps into everybody’s heart. Grandfather Frog listened. He nodded his head. “Chugarum! I’m happy, too,” said Grandfather Frog. But even as he said it, a little worried look crept into his big goggly eyes and then down to the corners of his big mouth, which had been stretched in a smile. Little by little the smile grew smaller and smaller, until there wasn’t any smile. No, Sir, there wasn’t any smile. Instead of looking happy, as he said he felt, Grandfather Frog actually looked unhappy.</p>

        <p><em>An extract from The Adventures of Jerry Muskrat by Thornton Burges.</em><br><br>
The beautiful springtime had brought a great deal of happiness to the Smiling Pool, as it had to the Green Meadows and to the Green Forest. Great-Grandfather Frog, who had slept the long winter away in his own special bed way down in the mud, had woken up with an appetite so great that for a while it seemed as if he could think of nothing but his stomach. Jerry Muskrat had felt the spring fever in his bones and had gone up and down the Laughing Brook, poking into all kinds of places just for the fun of seeing new things. Little Joe Otter had been more full of fun than ever, if that were possible. Mr. and Mrs. Redwing had come back to the bulrushes from their winter home way down in the warm Southland. Everybody was happy, just as happy as could be.</p>
        <p>One sunny morning Jerry Muskrat sat on the Big Rock in the middle of the Smiling Pool, just thinking of how happy everybody was and laughing at Little Joe Otter, who was cutting up all sorts of capers in the water. Suddenly Jerry’s sharp eyes saw something that made him wrinkle his forehead in a puzzled frown and looked at the opposite bank. Finally, he called to Little Joe Otter.</p>
        <p>“Hi, Little Joe! Come over here!” shouted Jerry.</p>
        <p>“What for?” asked Little Joe, turning a somersault in the water.</p>
        <p>“I want you to see if there is anything wrong with my eyes,” replied Jerry.</p>
        <p>Little Joe Otter stopped swimming and stared up at Jerry Muskrat. “They look all right to me,” said he, as he started to climb up on the Big Rock.</p>
        <p>“Of course they look all right,” replied Jerry, “but what I want to know is if they see all right. Look over at that bank.”</p>
        <p>Little Joe Otter looked over at the bank. He stared and stared, but he didn’t see anything unusual. It looked just as it always did. He told Jerry Muskrat so.</p>
        <p>“Then it must be my eyes,” sighed Jerry. “It certainly must be my eyes. It looks to me as if the water does not come as high up on the bank as it did yesterday.”</p>
        <p>Little Joe Otter looked again and his eyes opened wide. “You are right, Jerry Muskrat!” he cried. “There’s nothing the matter with your eyes. The water is as low as it ever gets, even in the very middle of summer. What can it mean?”</p>
        <p>“I don’t know,” replied Jerry Muskrat. “It is queer! It certainly is very queer! Let’s go ask Grandfather Frog. You know he is very old and very wise, so perhaps he can tell us what it means.”</p>
        <p>Splash! Jerry Muskrat and Little Joe Otter dived into the Smiling Pool and started a race to see who could reach Grandfather Frog first. He was sitting among the bulrushes on the edge of the Smiling Pool, for the lily-pads were not yet big enough for him to sit on comfortably.</p>
        <p>“Oh, Grandfather Frog, what’s the matter with the Smiling Pool?” they shouted, as they came up quite out of breath.</p>
        <p>“Chugarum! There’s nothing the matter with the Smiling Pool; it’s the best place in all the world,” replied Grandfather Frog gruffly.</p>
        <p>“But there is something the matter,” insisted Jerry Muskrat, and then he told what he had discovered.</p>
        <p>“I don’t believe it,” said Grandfather Frog. “I never heard of such a thing in the springtime.”</p>
        <p>Grandfather Frog sat among the bulrushes on the edge of the Smiling Pool. Over his head Mr. Redwing was singing as if his heart would burst with the very joy of springtime.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Tra-la-la-lee, see me! See me!<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Happy am I as I can be!<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Happy am I the whole day long<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;And so I sing my gladsome song.”</p>
        <p>Of course Mr. Redwing was happy. Why shouldn’t he be? Here it was the beautiful springtime, the gladdest time of all the year, the time when happiness creeps into everybody’s heart. Grandfather Frog listened. He nodded his head. “Chugarum! I’m happy, too,” said Grandfather Frog. But even as he said it, a little worried look crept into his big goggly eyes and then down to the corners of his big mouth, which had been stretched in a smile. Little by little the smile grew smaller and smaller, until there wasn’t any smile. No, Sir, there wasn’t any smile. Instead of looking happy, as he said he felt, Grandfather Frog actually looked unhappy.</p>

        <p><em>An extract from The Adventures of Jerry Muskrat by Thornton Burges.</em><br><br>
The beautiful springtime had brought a great deal of happiness to the Smiling Pool, as it had to the Green Meadows and to the Green Forest. Great-Grandfather Frog, who had slept the long winter away in his own special bed way down in the mud, had woken up with an appetite so great that for a while it seemed as if he could think of nothing but his stomach. Jerry Muskrat had felt the spring fever in his bones and had gone up and down the Laughing Brook, poking into all kinds of places just for the fun of seeing new things. Little Joe Otter had been more full of fun than ever, if that were possible. Mr. and Mrs. Redwing had come back to the bulrushes from their winter home way down in the warm Southland. Everybody was happy, just as happy as could be.</p>
        <p>One sunny morning Jerry Muskrat sat on the Big Rock in the middle of the Smiling Pool, just thinking of how happy everybody was and laughing at Little Joe Otter, who was cutting up all sorts of capers in the water. Suddenly Jerry’s sharp eyes saw something that made him wrinkle his forehead in a puzzled frown and looked at the opposite bank. Finally, he called to Little Joe Otter.</p>
        <p>“Hi, Little Joe! Come over here!” shouted Jerry.</p>
        <p>“What for?” asked Little Joe, turning a somersault in the water.</p>
        <p>“I want you to see if there is anything wrong with my eyes,” replied Jerry.</p>
        <p>Little Joe Otter stopped swimming and stared up at Jerry Muskrat. “They look all right to me,” said he, as he started to climb up on the Big Rock.</p>
        <p>“Of course they look all right,” replied Jerry, “but what I want to know is if they see all right. Look over at that bank.”</p>
        <p>Little Joe Otter looked over at the bank. He stared and stared, but he didn’t see anything unusual. It looked just as it always did. He told Jerry Muskrat so.</p>
        <p>“Then it must be my eyes,” sighed Jerry. “It certainly must be my eyes. It looks to me as if the water does not come as high up on the bank as it did yesterday.”</p>
        <p>Little Joe Otter looked again and his eyes opened wide. “You are right, Jerry Muskrat!” he cried. “There’s nothing the matter with your eyes. The water is as low as it ever gets, even in the very middle of summer. What can it mean?”</p>
        <p>“I don’t know,” replied Jerry Muskrat. “It is queer! It certainly is very queer! Let’s go ask Grandfather Frog. You know he is very old and very wise, so perhaps he can tell us what it means.”</p>
        <p>Splash! Jerry Muskrat and Little Joe Otter dived into the Smiling Pool and started a race to see who could reach Grandfather Frog first. He was sitting among the bulrushes on the edge of the Smiling Pool, for the lily-pads were not yet big enough for him to sit on comfortably.</p>
        <p>“Oh, Grandfather Frog, what’s the matter with the Smiling Pool?” they shouted, as they came up quite out of breath.</p>
        <p>“Chugarum! There’s nothing the matter with the Smiling Pool; it’s the best place in all the world,” replied Grandfather Frog gruffly.</p>
        <p>“But there is something the matter,” insisted Jerry Muskrat, and then he told what he had discovered.</p>
        <p>“I don’t believe it,” said Grandfather Frog. “I never heard of such a thing in the springtime.”</p>
        <p>Grandfather Frog sat among the bulrushes on the edge of the Smiling Pool. Over his head Mr. Redwing was singing as if his heart would burst with the very joy of springtime.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Tra-la-la-lee, see me! See me!<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Happy am I as I can be!<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Happy am I the whole day long<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;And so I sing my gladsome song.”</p>
        <p>Of course Mr. Redwing was happy. Why shouldn’t he be? Here it was the beautiful springtime, the gladdest time of all the year, the time when happiness creeps into everybody’s heart. Grandfather Frog listened. He nodded his head. “Chugarum! I’m happy, too,” said Grandfather Frog. But even as he said it, a little worried look crept into his big goggly eyes and then down to the corners of his big mouth, which had been stretched in a smile. Little by little the smile grew smaller and smaller, until there wasn’t any smile. No, Sir, there wasn’t any smile. Instead of looking happy, as he said he felt, Grandfather Frog actually looked unhappy.</p>

        <strong>KEEP GOING</strong>
        <p>
          <em>By Edgar Guest&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>When things go wrong, as they sometimes will,<br>
When the road you’re trudging seems all up hill,<br>
When the funds are low and the debts are high,<br>
And you want to smile, but you have to sigh,<br>
When care is pressing you down a bit,<br>
Rest if you must—but don’t you quit.</p>
        <p>Life is queer with its <span class="txt-underline"><strong>twists and turns</strong></span>,<br>
As every one of us sometimes learns,<br>
And many a failure turns about<br>
When he might have won had he stuck it out;<br>
Don’t give up, though the pace seems slow—<br>
You may succeed with another blow.</p>
        <p>Often the goal is nearer than<br>
It seems to a faint and faltering man,<br>
Often the struggler has given up<br>
When he might have captured the victor’s cup,<br>
And he learned too late, when the night slipped down,<br>
How close he was to the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>golden crown</strong></span>.</p>
        <p>Success is failure turned inside out—<br>
<span class="txt-underline"><strong>The silver tint of the clouds of doubt</strong></span>,<br>
And you never can tell how close you are,<br>
It may be near when it seems afar;<br>
So stick to the fight when you’re hardest hit—<br>
It’s when things seem worst that you mustn’t quit.</p>

You may succeed with another blow.</p>
        <p>Often the goal is nearer than<br>
It seems to a faint and faltering man,<br>
Often the struggler has given up<br>
When he might have captured the victor’s cup,<br>
And he learned too late, when the night slipped down,<br>
How close he was to the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>golden crown</strong></span>.</p>
        <p>Success is failure turned inside out—<br>
<span class="txt-underline"><strong>The silver tint of the clouds of doubt</strong></span>,<br>
And you never can tell how close you are,<br>
It may be near when it seems afar;<br>
So stick to the fight when you’re hardest hit—<br>
It’s when things seem worst that you mustn’t quit.</p>
