          <em>by Vicki Feaver</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He can make sculptures</p>
        <p>and fabulous machines,</p>
        <p>invent games, tell jokes,</p>
        <p>give solemn, adult advice -</p>
        <p>but he is slow to read.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5</p>
        <p>When I take him on my knee</p>
        <p>with his Ladybird book</p>
        <p>he gazes into the air,</p>
        <p>sighing and shaking his head</p>
        <p>like an old man&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10</p>
        <p>who knows the mountains</p>
        <p>are impassable.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He toys with words,</p>
        <p>letting them go cold</p>
        <p>as <strong>gristly meat</strong>,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;15</p>
        <p>until I relent</p>
        <p>and let him wriggle free:</p>
        <p>a fish returning</p>
        <p>to its element,</p>
        <p>or a white-eyed colt – shying&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;20</p>
        <p>from the bit – who sees</p>
        <p>that if he takes it</p>
        <p>in his mouth</p>
        <p>he‘ll never run</p>

          <strong>Lion at School</strong>

          <em>by Alexander McCall Smith</em>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">_____________________________________</p>
        <p>Akimbo is a boy who lives in a part of Africa where wild animals still roam free. One day a lion cub is accidentally caught in his father’s trap. Akimbo names it Simba. Akimbo is allowed to care for Simba until the lion is older. They soon become friends.</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">_____________________________________</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; A few months after Simba’s arrival, Akimbo had gone to school one day later than usual, and he had been scolded by the teacher, who believed in strict punctuality. The day got off to a bad start.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was shortly after the children had had their break that it happened. Akimbo was&nbsp; sitting on his bench when he heard shouting outside.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;“A lion!” somebody yelled. “There’s a lion coming!”</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
                  <img width="100%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766022640/ayvhywazyaxp116gt3na.png" alt="STT07_RC_01">


        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole class rose to its feet and looked out of the window. There, coming along the path toward the school, trotting along with his head held high in the air, was Simba. For a moment or two, Akimbo did not recognize him—this lion looked much bigger than Simba—but when he saw the patch of dark fur under his chin, he knew immediately who it was.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher did not know what to do. He raised his hand and then he dropped it. Meanwhile, Simba had reached the edge of the clearing in which the school stood and was looking about him, sniffing at the air inquisitively.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything might have been all right had the teachers’ cook not come around the corner of the school building at the wrong time. She had not seen Simba, and she walked unsuspectingly into the middle of the school yard.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she stopped. For a moment, the two of them stood absolutely still. The woman&nbsp; seemed to have frozen to the spot, and as for Simba, he wondered why she had stopped walking. Did she want to play? Did she want him to chase her?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;As if suddenly pricked by a great pin, the woman screamed at the top of her voice and gave a leap backward. For Simba, this was a signal. So she did want to play after all! Bounding forward, he chased her, soon caught up with her, and leapt playfully onto her back.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside the classroom, the teacher shouted and began to dash for the door.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;“No!” called out Akimbo. “Let me go.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher tried to stop him, but Akimbo pushed past and was soon out in the yard. Simba was now standing on top of the woman, who was lying on the ground, moaning and sobbing with fright.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;“Simba!” called Akimbo. “Here! Here!”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;When Simba saw and heard his master, he was overjoyed. Leaving the poor woman&nbsp; where she was, he bounded across to Akimbo and began to lick joyfully at his knees and ankles. Akimbo bent down and ruffled the fur around the lion’s neck.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;“You’re not to come here,” he whispered.</p>
        <p>“You’ll get us both into trouble.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Akimbo was right. There was trouble, and an awful lot of it. The poor woman was unhurt but she was, of course, very angry, as was the teacher. Still keeping a good distance away from Simba, the teacher ordered&nbsp;Akimbo to take the lion back home and to wait there. He would come over later that day to speak to Akimbo’s father.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Akimbo walked back, sunk in unhappiness. Simba seemed perfectly cheerful, but then he didn’t know what trouble he had caused.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;“I hope they don’t try to take you away from me,” Akimbo said as they made their way home. “I couldn’t bear to lose you, Simba, I really couldn’t!”</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher tried to stop him, but Akimbo pushed past and was soon out in the yard. Simba was now standing on top of the woman, who was lying on the ground, moaning and sobbing with fright.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;“Simba!” called Akimbo. “Here! Here!”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;When Simba saw and heard his master, he was overjoyed. Leaving the poor woman&nbsp; where she was, he bounded across to Akimbo and began to lick joyfully at his knees and ankles. Akimbo bent down and ruffled the fur around the lion’s neck.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;“You’re not to come here,” he whispered.</p>
        <p>“You’ll get us both into trouble.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Akimbo was right. There was trouble, and an awful lot of it. The poor woman was unhurt but she was, of course, very angry, as was the teacher. Still keeping a good distance away from Simba, the teacher ordered&nbsp;Akimbo to take the lion back home and to wait there. He would come over later that day to speak to Akimbo’s father.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Akimbo walked back, sunk in unhappiness. Simba seemed perfectly cheerful, but then he didn’t know what trouble he had caused.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;“I hope they don’t try to take you away from me,” Akimbo said as they made their way home. “I couldn’t bear to lose you, Simba, I really couldn’t!”</p>

          <strong>Lion at School</strong>

          <em>by Alexander McCall Smith</em>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">_____________________________________</p>
        <p>Akimbo is a boy who lives in a part of Africa where wild animals still roam free. One day a lion cub is accidentally caught in his father’s trap. Akimbo names it Simba. Akimbo is allowed to care for Simba until the lion is older. They soon become friends.</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">_____________________________________</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; A few months after Simba’s arrival, Akimbo had gone to school one day later than usual, and he had been scolded by the teacher, who believed in strict punctuality. The day got off to a bad start.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was shortly after the children had had their break that it happened. Akimbo was&nbsp; sitting on his bench when he heard shouting outside.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;“A lion!” somebody yelled. “There’s a lion coming!”</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole class rose to its feet and looked out of the window. There, coming along the path toward the school, trotting along with his head held high in the air, was Simba. For a moment or two, Akimbo did not recognize him—this lion looked much bigger than Simba—but when he saw the patch of dark fur under his chin, he knew immediately who it was.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher did not know what to do. He raised his hand and then he dropped it. Meanwhile, Simba had reached the edge of the clearing in which the school stood and was looking about him, sniffing at the air inquisitively.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything might have been all right had the teachers’ cook not come around the corner of the school building at the wrong time. She had not seen Simba, and she walked unsuspectingly into the middle of the school yard.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she stopped. For a moment, the two of them stood absolutely still. The woman&nbsp; seemed to have frozen to the spot, and as for Simba, he wondered why she had stopped walking. Did she want to play? Did she want him to chase her?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;As if suddenly pricked by a great pin, the woman screamed at the top of her voice and gave a leap backward. For Simba, this was a signal. So she did want to play after all! Bounding forward, he chased her, soon caught up with her, and leapt playfully onto her back.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside the classroom, the teacher shouted and began to dash for the door.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;“No!” called out Akimbo. “Let me go.”</p>

          <strong>Lion at School</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <em>by Alexander McCall Smith</em>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">_____________________________________</p>
        <p>Akimbo is a boy who lives in a part of Africa where wild animals still roam free. One day a lion cub is accidentally caught in his father’s trap. Akimbo names it Simba. Akimbo is allowed to care for Simba until the lion is older. They soon become friends.</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">_____________________________________</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; A few months after Simba’s arrival, Akimbo had gone to school one day later than usual, and he had been scolded by the teacher, who believed in strict punctuality. The day got off to a bad start.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was shortly after the children had had their break that it happened. Akimbo was&nbsp; sitting on his bench when he heard shouting outside.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;“A lion!” somebody yelled. “There’s a lion coming!”</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
                  <img width="100%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766021006/qjl5ctln6tdmhnzylv1u.png" alt="STT07_RC_01">


        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole class rose to its feet and looked out of the window. There, coming along the path toward the school, trotting along with his head held high in the air, was Simba. For a moment or two, Akimbo did not recognize him—this lion looked much bigger than Simba—but when he saw the patch of dark fur under his chin, he knew immediately who it was.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher did not know what to do. He raised his hand and then he dropped it. Meanwhile, Simba had reached the edge of the clearing in which the school stood and was looking about him, sniffing at the air inquisitively.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything might have been all right had the teachers’ cook not come around the corner of the school building at the wrong time. She had not seen Simba, and she walked unsuspectingly into the middle of the school yard.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she stopped. For a moment, the two of them stood absolutely still. The woman&nbsp; seemed to have frozen to the spot, and as for Simba, he wondered why she had stopped walking. Did she want to play? Did she want him to chase her?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;As if suddenly pricked by a great pin, the woman screamed at the top of her voice and gave a leap backward. For Simba, this was a signal. So she did want to play after all! Bounding forward, he chased her, soon caught up with her, and leapt playfully onto her back.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside the classroom, the teacher shouted and began to dash for the door.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;“No!” called out Akimbo. “Let me go.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher tried to stop him, but Akimbo pushed past and was soon out in the yard. Simba was now standing on top of the woman, who was lying on the ground, moaning and sobbing with fright.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;“Simba!” called Akimbo. “Here! Here!”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;When Simba saw and heard his master, he was overjoyed. Leaving the poor woman&nbsp; where she was, he bounded across to Akimbo and began to lick joyfully at his knees and ankles. Akimbo bent down and ruffled the fur around the lion’s neck.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;“You’re not to come here,” he whispered.</p>
        <p>“You’ll get us both into trouble.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Akimbo was right. There was trouble, and an awful lot of it. The poor woman was unhurt but she was, of course, very angry, as was the teacher. Still keeping a good distance away from Simba, the teacher ordered&nbsp;Akimbo to take the lion back home and to wait there. He would come over later that day to speak to Akimbo’s father.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Akimbo walked back, sunk in unhappiness. Simba seemed perfectly cheerful, but then he didn’t know what trouble he had caused.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;“I hope they don’t try to take you away from me,” Akimbo said as they made their way home. “I couldn’t bear to lose you, Simba, I really couldn’t!”</p>

          <strong>A Boy Who Makes a Difference</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <em>by Diana Federman</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; One person can make a difference. Just ask Ryan Hreljac (pronounced <em>hurl-jack</em>), who is 15 and lives in Canada. Without his help, hundreds of wells&nbsp;that now provide fresh water for people in Africa, Central America, and India might never have been built. Ryan is what you might call a water ambassador. He travels the world to tell people how they can help solve a big problem: the lack of safe drinking water in many developing countries.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Everybody can do something,” Ryan says.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes African-born Jimmy Akana— who is like a brother to Ryan—travels with him to explain how water changed his life. The story of the two boys is the subject of a new children’s book, <em>Ryan and Jimmy and the Well in Africa That Brought Them Together</em>, written by Herb Shoveller and published by Kids Can Press.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Ryan’s efforts didn’t begin in a far-off place, though, but right at home in Kemptville, Ontario. In 1998, when he was 6 years old, Ryan learned from his teacher that children in Africa often must walk miles each day to find water. Some even die from drinking bad water, his teacher said.</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
                  <img width="94%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766026756/atdwrnjlxt3qmac4qxjz.png" alt="STT07_RC_11_1">


        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;So Ryan decided to act. He did chores for his parents, Susan and Mark, and for neighbors. He spoke to schools, churches, and clubs about his goal. The word spread, and donations began coming in. After several months of hard work, Ryan had raised $2,000, enough to dig one well.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;An organization called Canadian Physicians for Aid and Relief (CPAR) chose a location for the well in the village of Agweo, in Uganda (in central eastern Africa). Ryan began writing to a pen pal there—Jimmy—who was 9 and whose parents had disappeared in a civil war.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In 2000, CPAR arranged for Ryan to visit Uganda for the opening ceremony of the well. Ryan and Jimmy met then and formed a close friendship that took a dramatic turn in 2003. Jimmy’s life was in danger from the war, so Ryan’s parents obtained permission for him to come to Canada and join their family. That has been his home ever since.</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
                  <img width="91%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766026756/jllfhc9skw4u4ocvwrag.png" alt="STT07_RC_11_2">


        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After the first well, “the ripple effect took over,” Ryan says, “and one goal led to another.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;With adult help, he founded Ryan’s Well Foundation four years ago to educate people&nbsp;about the vital importance of water. Now the foundation has raised more than $1.5 million and built 255 wells that serve more than 427,000 people in 12 countries.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Its website (www.ryanswell.ca) lists some of the famous people Ryan has met and the awards he has received, such as the Order of Ontario, the province’s highest honor.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But Ryan isn’t bragging. “The most impressive people I’ve met are the other kids who want to help, too,” he says. “The only reason I accept awards is that each word I say when I get one might help one more person.”</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">* * *</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Asked if he ever feels discouraged that many people still lack good water, Ryan says, “It’s important to be an optimist. When people are dying on the other side of the world, to sit in your house and say, ‘I can’t really help,’ that’s not the person I want to be.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“I’m just a typical kid. I had a small dream, and I stayed with it. Everybody can do something."</p>

          <em>by Sherrill Kushner</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Would you like to be an actor, but aren’t the right age or physical type for the part? Don’t give up: There may be a place for you in the world of voice-acting.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-year-old Rickey D’Shon Collins brings Tucker Foley to life in the cartoon <em>Danny Phantom</em>. In addition to many appearances on television and in movies, Rickey is a voice-over actor, someone we hear but don’t see. Rickey has acted since he was 6, both on and off camera. After school, his grandmother—a manager and acting coach—helped him develop his skills by doing voice exercises and reading aloud.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Voice-over actors do many kinds of acting. They are the voices of cartoon characters on television, in movies and video games, and for interactive toys. In films, they dub conversations, replacing foreign languages with English. They create crowd noises, make commercials, act in radio plays, and record telephone instructions and public announcements. They narrate books on tape, television documentaries, and even recorded museum tours.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Like other actors, voice-over actors need to understand scripts, interpret characters, and breathe correctly. They have to master voice techniques, such as pacing (how fast or slow to speak), volume (how loud or soft), and range (how high or low). Sometimes they use their normal voices; other times they change their voices to create different characters or noises.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Rickey’s manager receives his <em>Danny Phantom</em> scripts a few days before he tapes each episode. She writes helpful notes on the script to guide Rickey on speaking his part. Rickey practices, then tapes at the recording studio. He and the other cast members sit in a soundproof booth, acting out their characters as they read their lines into the microphones.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“The cartoon gets created after we record the words, so we have to imagine everything in our mind,” says Rickey. Later, the recorded words, music, and sound effects are combined with the cartoon art to create the cartoon we enjoy on TV.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sound interesting? Maybe you can have a “voice” in acting after all!</p>
