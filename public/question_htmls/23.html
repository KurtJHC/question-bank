        <p>Nobody likes Parents’ Night, do they? It’s when the truth comes out. Your parents discover that you haven’t been wearing your nice maroon St Joseph’s blazer, you’ve only handed in one maths homework since September and you’re hanging out with a gang of scary Year Tens who have LOVE and HATE scrawled across their knuckles in black marker pen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That’s the kind of stuff most kids are stressing about, anyhow. Not me. I have a pretty good record when it comes to tests, homework and school uniform. My friends are sensible, reliable, hard-working. My teachers like me.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>What do I have to be worried about? Where do you want me to start? I’m not worried that my family will find out the truth about school – I’m more anxious that school will find out the truth about my family.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Parents’ Night? I hate it so much that when I was in Year Seven I threw away the letters inviting my family along and told them that St Joseph’s didn’t do them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Are you sure?’ Mum had asked, doubtfully. ‘That seems very strange.’</p>
        <p>‘Seriously. They think it’s old-fashioned.’</p>
        <p>Mum had raised an eyebrow, but I got away with it. I thought I might get away with it right through secondary school.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Of course, I was wrong.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, my form teacher, Miss Devlin, booked herself into the hairdressing salon where Mum works for a shampoo and set. ‘Special occasion?’ Mum had enquired, rolling a sliver of Miss Devlin’s mouse-brown hair on to a pink plastic curler. ‘Going somewhere nice?’</p>
        <p>‘Well,’ Miss Devlin had replied, ‘just the Year Eight Parents’ Night at St Joseph’s tomorrow.’</p>
        <p>That was that. My cover was blown, big style.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Why didn’t you tell us they’d reintroduced Parents’ Night?’ Mum wanted to know. ‘Just think, we might have missed it!’<br>
Mmm. Just think.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And they are here – all of them. Nightmare.<br>
I’m here too, watching the whole thing, fascinated, horrified. Being here is a kind of torture, obviously, but when Mr McGrath asked for volunteers to make the tea and coffee, my hand shot up instantly like the good Year Eight teacher-pleaser that I am. It’s a bit like the way moths get drawn to a flame. I can’t help myself, even though I know it will end in disaster and frazzled wings.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Still, dishing out the tea is one way to keep an eye on things.</p>
        <p>I take a deep breath, steady my tea tray and stride off into the scrum, handing out a few cups of milky tea and some dark, ominous flapjacks baked earlier today in the Home Ec. department. I glide to a halt beside Miss Devlin’s desk.</p>
        <p>[Description: MCj04040710000[1]]</p>
        <p>‘Tea?’ I ask brightly.</p>
        <p>Miss Devlin shoots me a helpless, wild-eyed look, but I have no sympathy. So far, she’s only met Mum. Worse is to come.</p>
        <p>‘Ah, Jude,’ Mum says, flicking her blonde razor-cut bob so we all get to see the dark red layer beneath. ‘Miss Devlin was just telling me that she runs the school drama club. Why ever didn’t you tell her I was in show business?’</p>
        <p>‘You’re a hairdresser, Mum,’ I mumble.</p>
        <p>‘Now I am,’ Mum says, exasperated. ‘But what about my musical past? I’ve played all the top venues – Filey, Minehead, Clacton-on-Sea.’</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She is talking about the weekly talent shows at various Butlins holiday camps where she holidayed as a teenager, but she leaves out that little detail.</p>
        <p>‘Mum,’ I hiss, dumping a cup of tea and a crumbling flapjack down on the tabletop. ‘I thought I’d better tell you that Dad and Victoria are here. They’re in the queue behind you.’</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘They are?’ Mum squeaks. ‘Oh! Nice chatting to you, Miss Devlin. I have to go now.’</p>
        <p>Mum and Dad are no longer together – they haven’t been for twelve years, but that doesn’t stop Mum from turning all drama queen if she happens to spot Dad with his girlfriend.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mum leans across the desk, dazzling Miss Devlin with her showbiz smile. ‘If you ever need some professional input with the drama club, I’d be only too pleased to offer my expertise!’</p>
        <p>Miss Devlin shuffles some papers. ‘Well . . . thanks, Ms Reilly,’ she says, weakly. ‘I’ll be sure to let you know if we need any . . . um, professional input.’</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mum stands up, flinging a pink pashmina scarf over her shoulder and almost taking out the eye of the woman behind. She stalks out of the hall without a backward glance.</p>
        <p>I swing back through the crowd, clutching my tea tray. I come across Gran and Grandad arguing with Mr McGrath. I’m not sure why. He’s not even one of my teachers.</p>
        <p>‘Hello, dear,’ Gran says blankly as I edge past. ‘D’you know, you look just like my granddaughter!’</p>
        <p>Perhaps because I am? I give her the last flapjack and hope it doesn’t get stuck in her teeth.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Nobody likes Parents’ Night, do they? It’s when the truth comes out. Your parents discover that you haven’t been wearing your nice maroon St Joseph’s blazer, you’ve only handed in one maths homework since September and you’re hanging out with a gang of scary Year Tens who have LOVE and HATE scrawled across their knuckles in black marker pen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That’s the kind of stuff most kids are stressing about, anyhow. Not me. I have a pretty good record when it comes to tests, homework and school uniform. My friends are sensible, reliable, hard-working. My teachers like me.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>What do I have to be worried about? Where do you want me to start? I’m not worried that my family will find out the truth about school – I’m more anxious that school will find out the truth about my family.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Parents’ Night? I hate it so much that when I was in Year Seven I threw away the letters inviting my family along and told them that St Joseph’s didn’t do them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Are you sure?’ Mum had asked, doubtfully. ‘That seems very strange.’</p>
        <p>‘Seriously. They think it’s old-fashioned.’</p>
        <p>Mum had raised an eyebrow, but I got away with it. I thought I might get away with it right through secondary school.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Of course, I was wrong.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, my form teacher, Miss Devlin, booked herself into the hairdressing salon where Mum works for a shampoo and set. ‘Special occasion?’ Mum had enquired, rolling a sliver of Miss Devlin’s mouse-brown hair on to a pink plastic curler. ‘Going somewhere nice?’</p>
        <p>‘Well,’ Miss Devlin had replied, ‘just the Year Eight Parents’ Night at St Joseph’s tomorrow.’</p>
        <p>That was that. My cover was blown, big style.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Why didn’t you tell us they’d reintroduced Parents’ Night?’ Mum wanted to know. ‘Just think, we might have missed it!’<br>
Mmm. Just think.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And they are here – all of them. Nightmare.<br>
I’m here too, watching the whole thing, fascinated, horrified. Being here is a kind of torture, obviously, but when Mr McGrath asked for volunteers to make the tea and coffee, my hand shot up instantly like the good Year Eight teacher-pleaser that I am. It’s a bit like the way moths get drawn to a flame. I can’t help myself, even though I know it will end in disaster and frazzled wings.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Nobody likes Parents’ Night, do they? It’s when the truth comes out. Your parents discover that you haven’t been wearing your nice maroon St Joseph’s blazer, you’ve only handed in one maths homework since September and you’re hanging out with a gang of scary Year Tens who have LOVE and HATE scrawled across their knuckles in black marker pen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That’s the kind of stuff most kids are stressing about, anyhow. Not me. I have a pretty good record when it comes to tests, homework and school uniform. My friends are sensible, reliable, hard-working. My teachers like me.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>What do I have to be worried about? Where do you want me to start? I’m not worried that my family will find out the truth about school – I’m more anxious that school will find out the truth about my family.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Parents’ Night? I hate it so much that when I was in Year Seven I threw away the letters inviting my family along and told them that St Joseph’s didn’t do them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Are you sure?’ Mum had asked, doubtfully. ‘That seems very strange.’</p>
        <p>‘Seriously. They think it’s old-fashioned.’</p>
        <p>Mum had raised an eyebrow, but I got away with it. I thought I might get away with it right through secondary school.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Of course, I was wrong.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, my form teacher, Miss Devlin, booked herself into the hairdressing salon where Mum works for a shampoo and set. ‘Special occasion?’ Mum had enquired, rolling a sliver of Miss Devlin’s mouse-brown hair on to a pink plastic curler. ‘Going somewhere nice?’</p>
        <p>‘Well,’ Miss Devlin had replied, ‘just the Year Eight Parents’ Night at St Joseph’s tomorrow.’</p>
        <p>That was that. My cover was blown, big style.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Why didn’t you tell us they’d reintroduced Parents’ Night?’ Mum wanted to know. ‘Just think, we might have missed it!’<br>
Mmm. Just think.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And they are here – all of them. Nightmare.<br>
I’m here too, watching the whole thing, fascinated, horrified. Being here is a kind of torture, obviously, but when Mr McGrath asked for volunteers to make the tea and coffee, my hand shot up instantly like the good Year Eight teacher-pleaser that I am. It’s a bit like the way moths get drawn to a flame. I can’t help myself, even though I know it will end in disaster and frazzled wings.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Still, dishing out the tea is one way to keep an eye on things.</p>
        <p>I take a deep breath, steady my tea tray and stride off into the scrum, handing out a few cups of milky tea and some dark, ominous flapjacks baked earlier today in the Home Ec. department. I glide to a halt beside Miss Devlin’s desk.</p>
        <p>[Description: MCj04040710000[1]]</p>
        <p>‘Tea?’ I ask brightly.</p>
        <p>Miss Devlin shoots me a helpless, wild-eyed look, but I have no sympathy. So far, she’s only met Mum. Worse is to come.</p>
        <p>‘Ah, Jude,’ Mum says, flicking her blonde razor-cut bob so we all get to see the dark red layer beneath. ‘Miss Devlin was just telling me that she runs the school drama club. Why ever didn’t you tell her I was in show business?’</p>
        <p>‘You’re a hairdresser, Mum,’ I mumble.</p>
        <p>‘Now I am,’ Mum says, exasperated. ‘But what about my musical past? I’ve played all the top venues – Filey, Minehead, Clacton-on-Sea.’</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She is talking about the weekly talent shows at various Butlins holiday camps where she holidayed as a teenager, but she leaves out that little detail.</p>
        <p>‘Mum,’ I hiss, dumping a cup of tea and a crumbling flapjack down on the tabletop. ‘I thought I’d better tell you that Dad and Victoria are here. They’re in the queue behind you.’</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘They are?’ Mum squeaks. ‘Oh! Nice chatting to you, Miss Devlin. I have to go now.’</p>
        <p>Mum and Dad are no longer together – they haven’t been for twelve years, but that doesn’t stop Mum from turning all drama queen if she happens to spot Dad with his girlfriend.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mum leans across the desk, dazzling Miss Devlin with her showbiz smile. ‘If you ever need some professional input with the drama club, I’d be only too pleased to offer my expertise!’</p>
        <p>Miss Devlin shuffles some papers. ‘Well . . . thanks, Ms Reilly,’ she says, weakly. ‘I’ll be sure to let you know if we need any . . . um, professional input.’</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mum stands up, flinging a pink pashmina scarf over her shoulder and almost taking out the eye of the woman behind. She stalks out of the hall without a backward glance.</p>
        <p>I swing back through the crowd, clutching my tea tray. I come across Gran and Grandad arguing with Mr McGrath. I’m not sure why. He’s not even one of my teachers.</p>
        <p>‘Hello, dear,’ Gran says blankly as I edge past. ‘D’you know, you look just like my granddaughter!’</p>
        <p>Perhaps because I am? I give her the last flapjack and hope it doesn’t get stuck in her teeth.</p>

          <strong>Tiff &amp; The Trout</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by David Metzenthen.</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>About trout, swings, and other things</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“…I, Tiffany Jane Porter, know about trout. The rainbow trout comes from America – well, I'm pretty sure it does, and the brown trout comes from England. They are really good fish, trout. They're speedy, smart, and beautiful. And both rainbow and brown trout live in the two rivers here in Tilgong, which is where I catch them</p>
        <p>The wildest river around here is called the Warrigal and the quietest river is called the Brumby Run. I live in a small wooden house above them. Our house, like a lot of the houses in Tilgong, is painted light green. This is because all the houses were made and painted exactly the same for the workers on the hydro-electricity power station – and although the workers left years ago, most of the houses are still painted that delightful light green</p>
        <p>As I was saying about the trout, well, my dad and I pretty much always let them go when we catch them. We fish with flies made of feathers and fur and stuff, which can be tricky, but I love it. Every time I go fishing it's like re-reading one of my favourite stories because I basically know what will happen, but with fishing, I never know exactly what will happen. Otherwise, what's the point</p>
        <p>Trout face upstream. If you're careful, you can see them in clear water. They hover, waiting for insects to come down with the current. Rainbow trout have a stripe down their sides like smudged red lipstick. Brown trout can have backs that are golden-brown or olive-green, depending on where they live. And trout have spots. Whether or not they're like freckles I don't know.</p>
        <p>My dad and I used to go fishing nearly every weekend in summer, but since he's left, we only go when he visits. We fish in the Brumby Run River because it's nowhere near as dangerous as the Warrigal. The flies we use are supposed to look like insects a trout would eat, and, like real insects, some flies float and some flies sink</p>
        <p>My dad teaches English at Mittavale High School down the mountain. He says about ninety per cent of the kids are taller than him, but that's not true. Whatever, they don't seem to give him any trouble. Dad hardly ever yells – but now that he and Nathan live down the mountain, it's quiet all the time at home</p>
        <p>I don't feel like the whole complete me without them. The world seems different when your family breaks up. Not so safe. But at least I have a kind of emergency family – Cass's mum, dad and brother. I know them and they know me. And I can go there whenever I want and stay for as long as I like. Which is lucky, because sometimes if I didn't have a different place to go, I'd go mad.</p>
        <p><br>
One funny thing is Cass's house and my houses are exactly the same. Same size, same rooms, same front steps, same green, same everything, except perhaps tidiness. So when I'm there I kind of feel like I'm at home anyway. It's just at Cass's house there's more noise, bigger people, more stuff not put away, and Wally the dopey dog – but I never feel like I'm not welcome</p>
        <p>There was another girl in our class whose parents split up. Her name was Hildy Brooking and she lived with her mum up in the Mount Kennedy ski village. Her dad was an American guy who ran the ski lifts, but he went back to America a year ago. Then one day Hildy didn't come to school. She and her mum disappeared from their flat on the mountain. Mrs Petrucci, our teacher, told us that they had just moved away. I wasn't so sure</p>
        <p>'Well, people do that,' my mum said. 'Although it would've been better if they'd told somebody.'</p>
        <p>I could tell my mum didn't like talking about it.</p>
        <p>'I'm sure she's safe,' Mum says, whenever I mention Hildy's name. 'Wherever she is.'</p>
        <p>I hope so, because I have the feeling that whatever happened to Hildy could happen to me.</p>

          <strong>Tiff &amp; The Trout</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by David Metzenthen.</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>About trout, swings, and other things</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“…I, Tiffany Jane Porter, know about trout. The rainbow trout comes from America – well, I'm pretty sure it does, and the brown trout comes from England. They are really good fish, trout. They're speedy, smart, and beautiful. And both rainbow and brown trout live in the two rivers here in Tilgong, which is where I catch them</p>
        <p>The wildest river around here is called the Warrigal and the quietest river is called the Brumby Run. I live in a small wooden house above them. Our house, like a lot of the houses in Tilgong, is painted light green. This is because all the houses were made and painted exactly the same for the workers on the hydro-electricity power station – and although the workers left years ago, most of the houses are still painted that delightful light green</p>
        <p>As I was saying about the trout, well, my dad and I pretty much always let them go when we catch them. We fish with flies made of feathers and fur and stuff, which can be tricky, but I love it. Every time I go fishing it's like re-reading one of my favourite stories because I basically know what will happen, but with fishing, I never know exactly what will happen. Otherwise, what's the point</p>
        <p>Trout face upstream. If you're careful, you can see them in clear water. They hover, waiting for insects to come down with the current. Rainbow trout have a stripe down their sides like smudged red lipstick. Brown trout can have backs that are golden-brown or olive-green, depending on where they live. And trout have spots. Whether or not they're like freckles I don't know.</p>
        <p>My dad and I used to go fishing nearly every weekend in summer, but since he's left, we only go when he visits. We fish in the Brumby Run River because it's nowhere near as dangerous as the Warrigal. The flies we use are supposed to look like insects a trout would eat, and, like real insects, some flies float and some flies sink</p>
        <p>My dad teaches English at Mittavale High School down the mountain. He says about ninety per cent of the kids are taller than him, but that's not true. Whatever, they don't seem to give him any trouble. Dad hardly ever yells – but now that he and Nathan live down the mountain, it's quiet all the time at home</p>
        <p>I don't feel like the whole complete me without them. The world seems different when your family breaks up. Not so safe. But at least I have a kind of emergency family – Cass's mum, dad and brother. I know them and they know me. And I can go there whenever I want and stay for as long as I like. Which is lucky, because sometimes if I didn't have a different place to go, I'd go mad.</p>
        <p><br>
One funny thing is Cass's house and my houses are exactly the same. Same size, same rooms, same front steps, same green, same everything, except perhaps tidiness. So when I'm there I kind of feel like I'm at home anyway. It's just at Cass's house there's more noise, bigger people, more stuff not put away, and Wally the dopey dog – but I never feel like I'm not welcome</p>
        <p>There was another girl in our class whose parents split up. Her name was Hildy Brooking and she lived with her mum up in the Mount Kennedy ski village. Her dad was an American guy who ran the ski lifts, but he went back to America a year ago. Then one day Hildy didn't come to school. She and her mum disappeared from their flat on the mountain. Mrs Petrucci, our teacher, told us that they had just moved away. I wasn't so sure</p>
        <p>'Well, people do that,' my mum said. 'Although it would've been better if they'd told somebody.'</p>
        <p>I could tell my mum didn't like talking about it.</p>
        <p>'I'm sure she's safe,' Mum says, whenever I mention Hildy's name. 'Wherever she is.'</p>
        <p>I hope so, because I have the feeling that whatever happened to Hildy could happen to me.</p>

          <strong>Tiff &amp; The Trout</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by David Metzenthen.</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>About trout, swings, and other things</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“…I, Tiffany Jane Porter, know about trout. The rainbow trout comes from America – well, I'm pretty sure it does, and the brown trout comes from England. They are really good fish, trout. They're speedy, smart, and beautiful. And both rainbow and brown trout live in the two rivers here in Tilgong, which is where I catch them</p>
        <p>The wildest river around here is called the Warrigal and the quietest river is called the Brumby Run. I live in a small wooden house above them. Our house, like a lot of the houses in Tilgong, is painted light green. This is because all the houses were made and painted exactly the same for the workers on the hydro-electricity power station – and although the workers left years ago, most of the houses are still painted that delightful light green</p>
        <p>As I was saying about the trout, well, my dad and I pretty much always let them go when we catch them. We fish with flies made of feathers and fur and stuff, which can be tricky, but I love it. Every time I go fishing it's like re-reading one of my favourite stories because I basically know what will happen, but with fishing, I never know exactly what will happen. Otherwise, what's the point</p>
        <p>Trout face upstream. If you're careful, you can see them in clear water. They hover, waiting for insects to come down with the current. Rainbow trout have a stripe down their sides like smudged red lipstick. Brown trout can have backs that are golden-brown or olive-green, depending on where they live. And trout have spots. Whether or not they're like freckles I don't know.</p>
        <p>My dad and I used to go fishing nearly every weekend in summer, but since he's left, we only go when he visits. We fish in the Brumby Run River because it's nowhere near as dangerous as the Warrigal. The flies we use are supposed to look like insects a trout would eat, and, like real insects, some flies float and some flies sink</p>
        <p>My dad teaches English at Mittavale High School down the mountain. He says about ninety per cent of the kids are taller than him, but that's not true. Whatever, they don't seem to give him any trouble. Dad hardly ever yells – but now that he and Nathan live down the mountain, it's quiet all the time at home</p>
        <p>I don't feel like the whole complete me without them. The world seems different when your family breaks up. Not so safe. But at least I have a kind of emergency family – Cass's mum, dad and brother. I know them and they know me. And I can go there whenever I want and stay for as long as I like. Which is lucky, because sometimes if I didn't have a different place to go, I'd go mad.</p>
        <p><br>
One funny thing is Cass's house and my houses are exactly the same. Same size, same rooms, same front steps, same green, same everything, except perhaps tidiness. So when I'm there I kind of feel like I'm at home anyway. It's just at Cass's house there's more noise, bigger people, more stuff not put away, and Wally the dopey dog – but I never feel like I'm not welcome</p>
        <p>There was another girl in our class whose parents split up. Her name was Hildy Brooking and she lived with her mum up in the Mount Kennedy ski village. Her dad was an American guy who ran the ski lifts, but he went back to America a year ago. Then one day Hildy didn't come to school. She and her mum disappeared from their flat on the mountain. Mrs Petrucci, our teacher, told us that they had just moved away. I wasn't so sure</p>
        <p>'Well, people do that,' my mum said. 'Although it would've been better if they'd told somebody.'</p>
        <p>I could tell my mum didn't like talking about it.</p>
        <p>'I'm sure she's safe,' Mum says, whenever I mention Hildy's name. 'Wherever she is.'</p>
        <p>I hope so, because I have the feeling that whatever happened to Hildy could happen to me.</p>

        <p>My dad and I used to go fishing nearly every weekend in summer, but since he's left, we only go when he visits. We fish in the Brumby Run River because it's nowhere near as dangerous as the Warrigal. The flies we use are supposed to look like insects a trout would eat, and, like real insects, some flies float and some flies sink</p>
        <p>My dad teaches English at Mittavale High School down the mountain. He says about ninety per cent of the kids are taller than him, but that's not true. Whatever, they don't seem to give him any trouble. Dad hardly ever yells – but now that he and Nathan live down the mountain, it's quiet all the time at home</p>
        <p>I don't feel like the whole complete me without them. The world seems different when your family breaks up. Not so safe. But at least I have a kind of emergency family – Cass's mum, dad and brother. I know them and they know me. And I can go there whenever I want and stay for as long as I like. Which is lucky, because sometimes if I didn't have a different place to go, I'd go mad.</p>
        <p><br>
One funny thing is Cass's house and my houses are exactly the same. Same size, same rooms, same front steps, same green, same everything, except perhaps tidiness. So when I'm there I kind of feel like I'm at home anyway. It's just at Cass's house there's more noise, bigger people, more stuff not put away, and Wally the dopey dog – but I never feel like I'm not welcome</p>
        <p>There was another girl in our class whose parents split up. Her name was Hildy Brooking and she lived with her mum up in the Mount Kennedy ski village. Her dad was an American guy who ran the ski lifts, but he went back to America a year ago. Then one day Hildy didn't come to school. She and her mum disappeared from their flat on the mountain. Mrs Petrucci, our teacher, told us that they had just moved away. I wasn't so sure</p>
        <p>'Well, people do that,' my mum said. 'Although it would've been better if they'd told somebody.'</p>
        <p>I could tell my mum didn't like talking about it.</p>
        <p>'I'm sure she's safe,' Mum says, whenever I mention Hildy's name. 'Wherever she is.'</p>
        <p>I hope so, because I have the feeling that whatever happened to Hildy could happen to me.</p>

          <strong>Sydney</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Today's Sydney is a mixture of modern skyscrapers and old buildings from the British colonial period. The city centre is near Sydney Harbour, which is the modern name used for the old Port Jackson.</p>
        <p>The harbour is crossed by one of the city's most famous landmarks – Sydney Harbour Bridge. Opened in 1932, this is one of the longest and widest single-arch bridges in the world. It links north Sydney with the southern and eastern suburbs.</p>
        <p>Not far from the south side of the bridge, at Bennelong Point, lies the city's most famous building – Sydney Opera House. This unique structure was designed by the Danish architect Jørn Utzon, who won an international competition for his proposed design. The white, shell-shaped roofs of the Opera House look like giant sails, so they are in a perfect setting.</p>
        <p>Though it is not the capital of Australia (the much smaller city of Canberra is), Sydney is certainly the country's leading centre of industry, business, finance and tourism. Because of this, Sydney constantly attracts newcomers, both from other parts of Australia and abroad. In recent years the city has expanded and its outer suburbs cover a very large area.</p>
        <p>The people of Sydney enjoy a wide range of parks and beaches, all within easy reach of the city centre. The most famous open space is Hyde Park, at the southern end of famous old Macquarie Street. The two best-known beaches are Bondi and Manly. Here and at other spots around the harbour, Sydney siders enjoy swimming, surfing and sailing, as well as many other outdoor sports.</p>
        <p>Sydney came under the world's gaze in 2000, when the Olympic Games were held there. A new stadium and other sporting facilities were built and the Games were a great success.</p>

          <strong>Sydney</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Today's Sydney is a mixture of modern skyscrapers and old buildings from the British colonial period. The city centre is near Sydney Harbour, which is the modern name used for the old Port Jackson.</p>
        <p>The harbour is crossed by one of the city's most famous landmarks – Sydney Harbour Bridge. Opened in 1932, this is one of the longest and widest single-arch bridges in the world. It links north Sydney with the southern and eastern suburbs.</p>
        <p>Not far from the south side of the bridge, at Bennelong Point, lies the city's most famous building – Sydney Opera House. This unique structure was designed by the Danish architect Jørn Utzon, who won an international competition for his proposed design. The white, shell-shaped roofs of the Opera House look like giant sails, so they are in a perfect setting.</p>
        <p>Though it is not the capital of Australia (the much smaller city of Canberra is), Sydney is certainly the country's leading centre of industry, business, finance and tourism. Because of this, Sydney constantly attracts newcomers, both from other parts of Australia and abroad. In recent years the city has expanded and its outer suburbs cover a very large area.</p>
        <p>The people of Sydney enjoy a wide range of parks and beaches, all within easy reach of the city centre. The most famous open space is Hyde Park, at the southern end of famous old Macquarie Street. The two best-known beaches are Bondi and Manly. Here and at other spots around the harbour, Sydney siders enjoy swimming, surfing and sailing, as well as many other outdoor sports.</p>
        <p>Sydney came under the world's gaze in 2000, when the Olympic Games were held there. A new stadium and other sporting facilities were built and the Games were a great success.</p>

        <p>The harbour is crossed by one of the city's most famous landmarks – Sydney Harbour Bridge. Opened in 1932, this is one of the longest and widest single-arch bridges in the world. It links north Sydney with the southern and eastern suburbs.</p>
        <p>Not far from the south side of the bridge, at Bennelong Point, lies the city's most famous building – Sydney Opera House. This unique structure was designed by the Danish architect Jørn Utzon, who won an international competition for his proposed design. The white, shell-shaped roofs of the Opera House look like giant sails, so they are in a perfect setting.</p>
        <p>Though it is not the capital of Australia (the much smaller city of Canberra is), Sydney is certainly the country's leading centre of industry, business, finance and tourism. Because of this, Sydney constantly attracts newcomers, both from other parts of Australia and abroad. In recent years the city has expanded and its outer suburbs cover a very large area.</p>
        <p>The people of Sydney enjoy a wide range of parks and beaches, all within easy reach of the city centre. The most famous open space is Hyde Park, at the southern end of famous old Macquarie Street. The two best-known beaches are Bondi and Manly. Here and at other spots around the harbour, Sydney siders enjoy swimming, surfing and sailing, as well as many other outdoor sports.</p>
        <p>Sydney came under the world's gaze in 2000, when the Olympic Games were held there. A new stadium and other sporting facilities were built and the Games were a great success.</p>

His name, as I ought to have told you before,<br>
Is really Asparagus. That's such a fuss<br>
To pronounce, that we usually call him just Gus.<br>
His coat's very shabby, he's thin as a rake,<br>
And he suffers from palsy that makes his paw shake.<br>
Yet he was, in his youth, quite the smartest of Cats--<br>
But no longer a terror to mice and to rats.<br>
For he isn't the Cat that he was in his prime;<br>
Though his name was quite famous, he says, in its time.<br>
And whenever he joins his friends at their club<br>
(Which takes place at the back of the neighbouring pub)<br>
He loves to regale them, if someone else pays,<br>
With anecdotes drawn from his palmiest days.<br>
For he once was a Star of the highest degree--<br>
He has acted with Irving, he's acted with Tree.<br>
And he likes to relate his success on the Halls,<br>
Where the Gallery once gave him seven cat-calls.<br>
But his grandest creation, as he loves to tell,<br>
Was Firefrorefiddle, the Fiend of the Fell.</p>

His name, as I ought to have told you before,<br>
Is really Asparagus. That's such a fuss<br>
To pronounce, that we usually call him just Gus.<br>
His coat's very shabby, he's thin as a rake,<br>
And he suffers from palsy that makes his paw shake.<br>
Yet he was, in his youth, quite the smartest of Cats--<br>
But no longer a terror to mice and to rats.<br>
For he isn't the Cat that he was in his prime;<br>
Though his name was quite famous, he says, in its time.<br>
And whenever he joins his friends at their club<br>
(Which takes place at the back of the neighbouring pub)<br>
He loves to regale them, if someone else pays,<br>
With anecdotes drawn from his palmiest days.<br>
For he once was a Star of the highest degree--<br>
He has acted with Irving, he's acted with Tree.<br>
And he likes to relate his success on the Halls,<br>
Where the Gallery once gave him seven cat-calls.<br>
But his grandest creation, as he loves to tell,<br>
Was Firefrorefiddle, the Fiend of the Fell.</p>

        <p class="txt-ctr">Gus is the Cat at the Theatre Door.<br>
His name, as I ought to have told you before,<br>
Is really Asparagus. That's such a fuss<br>
To pronounce, that we usually call him just Gus.<br>
His coat's very shabby, he's thin as a rake,<br>
And he suffers from palsy that makes his paw shake.<br>
Yet he was, in his youth, quite the smartest of Cats--<br>
But no longer a terror to mice and to rats.<br>
For he isn't the Cat that he was in his prime;<br>
Though his name was quite famous, he says, in its time.<br>
And whenever he joins his friends at their club<br>
(Which takes place at the back of the neighbouring pub)<br>
He loves to regale them, if someone else pays,<br>
With anecdotes drawn from his palmiest days.<br>
For he once was a Star of the highest degree--<br>
He has acted with Irving, he's acted with Tree.<br>
And he likes to relate his success on the Halls,<br>
Where the Gallery once gave him seven cat-calls.<br>
But his grandest creation, as he loves to tell,<br>
Was Firefrorefiddle, the Fiend of the Fell.</p>

          <strong>Alexander the Great</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Philip and His Son</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If the Greek cities had stayed friends and allies, like they were when they fought against the Persians, Greece would have been a strong country.&nbsp; But instead, Sparta and Athens fought.&nbsp; They were like brothers who were too busy arguing with each other to notice that a bully is coming!</p>
        <p><br>
In this case, the bully was a king named Philip, who ruled a country called Macedonia.&nbsp; Philip noticed that Athens and Sparta had become weaker and weaker after years of battle.&nbsp; And so he came down into Greece with his army and conquered the Greek cities.&nbsp; They barely had enough energy to resist.</p>
        <p><br>
Now Philip ruled Macedonia and Greece.&nbsp; But he wanted even more cities.&nbsp; He wanted to sail across the Aegean Sea to Asia Minor and take over the Persian Empire as well.&nbsp; But before he could attack Persia, Philip died.&nbsp; And his son Alexander took over his throne.</p>
        <p><br>
Do you know what the name “Alexander” means?&nbsp; It means “Ruler of men.”&nbsp; Alexander became one of the most famous “rulers of men” ever.&nbsp; He was known by the whole world as “Alexander the Great.”</p>
        <p><br>
Alexander had always been an unusual boy.&nbsp; Even as a child, he was strong and brave.&nbsp; Nothing scared him!&nbsp; When he was still a small boy, he went with his father Philip to look at a warhorse that Philip wanted to buy.&nbsp; The horse, a huge black stallion named Bucephalas, bucked and kicked constantly.&nbsp; No one could ride him.</p>
        <p><br>
“He’s too wild,” King Philip said.&nbsp; “I don’t want him.&nbsp; I would never be able to manage him.”</p>
        <p><br>
“I can ride him!” Alexander said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;“Nonsense!” Philip said.&nbsp; “You’re too little.”</p>
        <p><br>
“But I can!” Alexander insisted.</p>
        <p>“If you can ride him, I’ll buy him for you,” Philip promised.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Alexander had been watching Bucephalas carefully.&nbsp; He noticed the horse kicked and reared whenever the sun threw his shadow on the ground in front of him.&nbsp; Alexander thought that the huge stallion was frightened of his shadow.&nbsp; So he walked fearlessly up to the horse, took his bridle, and turned him so that he couldn’t see his shadow.&nbsp; Instantly, Bucephalas stood still.&nbsp; He allowed Alexander to mount him and ride him around.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;<br>
Philip bought the horse for Alexander.&nbsp; And when Alexander became king after his father’s death, the great black stallion Bucephalas always carried him into battle.&nbsp; He even named a city after his horse – he called it Bucephela!</p>
        <p><br>
Alexander had many opportunities to ride his warhorse into battle.&nbsp; His father Philip had conquered Greece, but Alexander had even larger goals in mind.&nbsp; He wanted to rule Persia.&nbsp; The Persians had given up trying to conquer Greece, but their empire was still the largest in the world – it stretched all the way from Asia Minor to India.&nbsp; And Alexander wanted it.</p>
        <p><br>
When Alexander met the Persian army in Asia Minor, he used his cavalry – soldiers riding on horseback – to push the Persians back.&nbsp; Asia Minor was now his!&nbsp; But could he conquer the rest of the Persian Empire?</p>
        <p><br>
According to one story, Alexander stopped at a city in Asia Minor and saw there, in the city’s centre, a chariot tied to its axle with a huge, complicated knot of rope, larger than a man’s head.&nbsp; “What is that?” he asked.</p>
        <p><br>
“That is the Gordian Knot,” the people told him.&nbsp; “We have a legend about it.&nbsp; The man who loosens that knot will rule all the rest of Asia.&nbsp; But it is impossible to untie the knot.&nbsp; Hundreds of men have tried, and no one has ever succeeded!”</p>
        <p><br>
Alexander studied the knot carefully.&nbsp; Then he took out his sword and sliced the knot in half.</p>
        <p><br>
“There,” he said.&nbsp; “I have loosened the knot.”</p>
        <p><br>
No one had ever thought of doing that before!&nbsp; But the prophecy of the knot came true.&nbsp; Alexander conquered all the rest of Asia.&nbsp; He went south into Egypt and was crowned the pharaoh of Egypt.&nbsp; And then he came back up into Mesopotamia and took over the rest of the Persian Empire.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;<br>
Now Alexander was king of more land than anyone else had ever ruled.&nbsp; He was truly “Alexander the Great” – the ruler of the greatest empire the world had ever seen.</p>

        <p><br>
Alexander had always been an unusual boy.&nbsp; Even as a child, he was strong and brave.&nbsp; Nothing scared him!&nbsp; When he was still a small boy, he went with his father Philip to look at a warhorse that Philip wanted to buy.&nbsp; The horse, a huge black stallion named Bucephalas, bucked and kicked constantly.&nbsp; No one could ride him.</p>
        <p><br>
“He’s too wild,” King Philip said.&nbsp; “I don’t want him.&nbsp; I would never be able to manage him.”</p>
        <p><br>
“I can ride him!” Alexander said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;“Nonsense!” Philip said.&nbsp; “You’re too little.”</p>
        <p><br>
“But I can!” Alexander insisted.</p>
        <p>“If you can ride him, I’ll buy him for you,” Philip promised.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Alexander had been watching Bucephalas carefully.&nbsp; He noticed the horse kicked and reared whenever the sun threw his shadow on the ground in front of him.&nbsp; Alexander thought that the huge stallion was frightened of his shadow.&nbsp; So he walked fearlessly up to the horse, took his bridle, and turned him so that he couldn’t see his shadow.&nbsp; Instantly, Bucephalas stood still.&nbsp; He allowed Alexander to mount him and ride him around.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;<br>
Philip bought the horse for Alexander.&nbsp; And when Alexander became king after his father’s death, the great black stallion Bucephalas always carried him into battle.&nbsp; He even named a city after his horse – he called it Bucephela!</p>
        <p><br>
Alexander had many opportunities to ride his warhorse into battle.&nbsp; His father Philip had conquered Greece, but Alexander had even larger goals in mind.&nbsp; He wanted to rule Persia.&nbsp; The Persians had given up trying to conquer Greece, but their empire was still the largest in the world – it stretched all the way from Asia Minor to India.&nbsp; And Alexander wanted it.</p>
        <p><br>
When Alexander met the Persian army in Asia Minor, he used his cavalry – soldiers riding on horseback – to push the Persians back.&nbsp; Asia Minor was now his!&nbsp; But could he conquer the rest of the Persian Empire?</p>
        <p><br>
According to one story, Alexander stopped at a city in Asia Minor and saw there, in the city’s centre, a chariot tied to its axle with a huge, complicated knot of rope, larger than a man’s head.&nbsp; “What is that?” he asked.</p>
        <p><br>
“That is the Gordian Knot,” the people told him.&nbsp; “We have a legend about it.&nbsp; The man who loosens that knot will rule all the rest of Asia.&nbsp; But it is impossible to untie the knot.&nbsp; Hundreds of men have tried, and no one has ever succeeded!”</p>
        <p><br>
Alexander studied the knot carefully.&nbsp; Then he took out his sword and sliced the knot in half.</p>
        <p><br>
“There,” he said.&nbsp; “I have loosened the knot.”</p>
        <p><br>
No one had ever thought of doing that before!&nbsp; But the prophecy of the knot came true.&nbsp; Alexander conquered all the rest of Asia.&nbsp; He went south into Egypt and was crowned the pharaoh of Egypt.&nbsp; And then he came back up into Mesopotamia and took over the rest of the Persian Empire.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;<br>
Now Alexander was king of more land than anyone else had ever ruled.&nbsp; He was truly “Alexander the Great” – the ruler of the greatest empire the world had ever seen.</p>

          <strong>Alexander the Great</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Philip and His Son</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If the Greek cities had stayed friends and allies, like they were when they fought against the Persians, Greece would have been a strong country.&nbsp; But instead, Sparta and Athens fought.&nbsp; They were like brothers who were too busy arguing with each other to notice that a bully is coming!</p>
        <p><br>
In this case, the bully was a king named Philip, who ruled a country called Macedonia.&nbsp; Philip noticed that Athens and Sparta had become weaker and weaker after years of battle.&nbsp; And so he came down into Greece with his army and conquered the Greek cities.&nbsp; They barely had enough energy to resist.</p>
        <p><br>
Now Philip ruled Macedonia and Greece.&nbsp; But he wanted even more cities.&nbsp; He wanted to sail across the Aegean Sea to Asia Minor and take over the Persian Empire as well.&nbsp; But before he could attack Persia, Philip died.&nbsp; And his son Alexander took over his throne.</p>
        <p><br>
Do you know what the name “Alexander” means?&nbsp; It means “Ruler of men.”&nbsp; Alexander became one of the most famous “rulers of men” ever.&nbsp; He was known by the whole world as “Alexander the Great.”</p>
