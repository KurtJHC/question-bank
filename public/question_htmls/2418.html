This is the Incredible True Story of How King George VI Overcame His Stutter for His 1939 Speech. <strong>(A)</strong>………. But that's exactly what happened when his older brother, Edward VIII, abdicated the throne in December 1936. He did this in order to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson. Despite the non-traditional start to his reign, George VI went on to become a symbol of strength and hope for the British people throughout World War II and beyond. This reignited their faith in the country's monarchy. It's this rise and reign of the unexpected King that is chronicled in the second episode of CNN docuseries The Windsors: Inside the Royal Dynasty, which airs on Sunday at 10 p.m.</p>
        <p>Unsurprisingly, the journey to becoming a successful and beloved King wasn't an easy one for George VI. <strong>(B)</strong>………. But his anxiety about taking on the role was only compounded by the stammer he had struggled with ever since he was a young boy.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As is shown in the Oscar-winning 2010 movie, The King's Speech, George VI (who was known as Albert or "Bertie" to those closest to him) struggled with a stutter from a young age. After being named the Duke of York in 1920 (but long before he became King), he feared that his stutter would prevent him from effectively giving important speeches to his people. <strong>(C)</strong>……….&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>(D)</strong>………. There are no logs of what, exactly, Lionel and the King did during their sessions. Therefore we can't be sure of what exercises the speech therapist had George VI practise. (What you see in the movie is based on writer David Seidler's own experiences with speech therapy.) What the records do show, however, is that for some time, the King was meeting with Lionel for an hour every day, weekends included.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, George VI became King and later gave his first big radio address on September 3, 1939. This was when he announced that England would be going to war against Germany. <strong>(E)</strong>………. He believed it was absolutely imperative that he give the best speech he could — with as few stutters and stammers as possible.</p>
        <p>A copy of the speech now belongs to Lionel's grandson, Mark Logue. It shows that Lionel and the King marked up a physical copy of the address for him to reference, highlighting places where he should consider pausing or swapping words for something easier to pronounce. <strong>(F)</strong>………. It's now considered one of his most iconic addresses. Of course, after giving this well-known speech, King George VI went on to act as a beloved leader for more than a decade longer. He held the British throne until his death on February 6, 1952.&nbsp;</p>

<br>
The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn follows the life of a young adventurous boy (Huck Finn) as he runs away from both his guardian, the Widow Douglas and his father Pap. He accidentally teams up with another runaway, a slave named Jim. As the two set off they hope to find freedom from different things; Huck from both the thought of being “civilised” and his drunken father, and Jim from his current life. Jim is a slave and is running away to become a free man, so he can in turn, free his family from slavery.<br>
<br>
The two unlikely friends journey down the Mississippi river in what turns out to be a series of adventures filled with death, disguise and eventually the growth and maturity of their friendship and of Huck himself. The river is an important symbol and is the agent that brings the two closer to their destination.<br>
<br>
The Mississippi is the fourth largest river in the world and stretches over ten US states. Twain retells his experiences on the Mississippi river in a memoir published in 1883, ‘Life on the Mississippi’, centered on his life as a steamboat pilot. It follows his journeys on the&nbsp;Mississippi from St Louis to New Orleans. His own experiences were what inspired the 1834 novel. Twain’s recount of Huck’s journey along the river maps the road to the young boy discovering himself. Twain’s love for the Mississippi river is no doubt evident in the novel. It is portrayed as not just a long and winding trail that leads out of town and away from potential conflicts, but also a path that enables one to find oneself.&nbsp;<br>
<br>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of rivers. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
There’s a reason why the sound of a river or a creek calms your soul. Even the sight of it calms you. It is because the river has come to teach us all one of the most powerful lessons on earth: No one’s words or thoughts can derail us from our goals.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The river is a great teacher. Round up every high school bully, every negative person who wants the worst for others and have them congregate around the river. Then, have them look downward into its clear moving water. As they look down they can see their faces looking back up at them. They begin chanting at the river with every fibre of their mind and spirit: “You’re not good enough.” “You’re wasting your time, you’ll never make it.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
What other negative things might they be saying? Yet, even while all of this profound negativity is being channelled toward the river, <strong>it continues to flow</strong>. The river moves no matter what the atmosphere. If it’s raining, lightning or grey – it moves. The river channels all of its mind, body and spirit into the direction of its dreams. When the river goes through a break up with its beloved – it doesn’t stop moving. It flows. It’s relentless. It’s wise.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
One thing you can be certain of about the river is that it never dwells on the past. <strong>Ever</strong>. Do you hear the sound of the water rushing over the rocks? Tell me… when you hear the babbling water, when are you hearing it; in the past or the future? Neither. It’s only possible to hear this precious sound in the now. The river understands by letting go of the past entirely, allows for its potential in the present to reach its absolute zenith. We all can take away great wisdom from the river. It personifies the truth that <strong>moving while challenged is at the core of what wisdom really is</strong>.&nbsp;<br>

<br>
NSW floods are unmatched in scale and rainfall, but history shows there have been worse. It's been called many things. A "once-in-100-year flood", "unprecedented" and "chaotic". Thousands of people were ordered to evacuate, a home floated down the Manning River on the Mid-North Coast and one person died after becoming trapped in their car in Sydney's north-west.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
So how do NSW's most recent floods stack up against others in the state? Experts say what makes this flood event a stand-out is the vast area affected. "It’s just the sheer scale of having it from the border all the way down south of Sydney and now heading west as well," said Fiona Johnson, a hydrologist from the water research centre at UNSW. The three largest coastal catchments, the Hawkesbury-Nepean, Clarence and Hunter rivers,&nbsp;are all flooded. Tens of thousands of people were ordered to evacuate from the Hawkesbury-Nepean River area in Sydney. The valley, which has a catchment of 21,400 square kilometres, has experienced 130 moderate to major floods since records began in the 1790s.&nbsp;<br>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of rivers. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Rivers, as the source of life are reflected in the myths and beliefs of the multitude of cultures. In many parts of the world rivers are called “mothers”. Narmadai River in India, “Mother Narmada”; Volga River in Russia is Mat Rodnaya, “Mother Earth”. The Thai word ‘mae nan’ is translated as “water mother”.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There is something poetic in the life of rivers. It is too complex to describe the spiritual connection between a person and a river. The melting snow and pouring rain on tops of mountains and hills, form beautiful mountain streams that flow in the high grounds. As the streams power down the tributaries, they gain their volume and become a river. As they leave the high grounds, rivers slow down and begin to meander, seeking the path of least resistance through wide valleys. Finally, the river flows into a lake or ocean.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
All the big milestones in the human history have taken place around riverbanks. The first civilisation emerged +/- 3000 BC along the Euphrates, Tigris, Nile, and Indus; and later along the Yellow River. The industrial revolution occurred along rivers in northern England which contributed to the development of industry. Most large cities in the world are located on a river. An interesting fact is that 65% of the water we drink comes from a surrounding river. It is another great reason to keep them clean.<br>

        <p><strong>Read the text below. Six sentences have been removed from this text so that there are six gaps.</strong><br><br><strong>Africa’s not-so-big Two</strong><br><br>
YOU already know about Africa’s big five – the lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo and rhino. They’re the heroes of safari, celebrated for decades by gun-toting game hunters looking for the worthiest of foes. These days, the fearsome five serve a more useful marketing purpose, encouraging tourists to “tick and click” their way through the game parks of southern Africa. I’ve been fortunate to visit many game parks and have dutifully done the five. They’re big and beautiful, noble and regal and, in the case of the leopard, a right royal tease. <strong>(A)</strong>………. They’re the animals with bad manners and poor personal hygiene, the critters that are less than lovely on the eye, display unpalatable behaviour and are, in some cases, loathed. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you my Bestial Best Two.</p>
        <p>Warthogs are rare in the animal world in that even their babies are ugly. <strong>(B)</strong>………. But pretty? No. The facial end of the warthog looks like it’s made with a bunch of stuff that no other animal wanted. It has two sets of tusks, tiny eyes, stiff whiskers and “warts”, the fatty protuberances that poke from either side of a ridiculously long face.</p>
        <p>But warthogs are good value precisely because they look so alien. They’re the gatekeepers of your African safari, telling you that you’ve arrived in the Dark Continent to encounter animal species you’ve only ever dreamt about. Chances are you’ll see the “pig of the plains” early in your trip, since they’re welcome guests in safari lodges. Warthog groundskeepers can be seen on the job 24/7, shuffling around on their front wrists (their front feet are tucked away, a sight in itself) to keep the lawns looking lovely. Despite those tusks and a quite evil-looking razorback mane, they muddle along OK with human beings and will let you get close enough for truly brilliant photos. <strong>(C)</strong>………. Last year, on a trip to Botswana, I discovered another reason to revere warthogs: they are absolutely delicious. Their meat is velvety smooth and baby-pink, a super-sweet pork that melts in your mouth. The first person in Australia to sell warthog meat will make a million.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The other creature I admire is the Dung Beetle. On the Zambian side of Victoria Falls is Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park, which is home to the country’s only white rhinos. I saw one of them quite close – it charged the long-chassis Land Cruiser, stuck its horn under the rear wing and lifted us about half a metre into the air. The damage to the vehicle was substantial, but nothing to the damage wrought upon the hapless driver by his lodge owner for having failed to see a rhino behind a small bush. <strong>(D)</strong>………. Nothing – except that you get none of this sort of trouble with a dung beetle. It is an ever-so-admirable and industrious little thing that spends its life quietly pushing excrement uphill.</p>
        <p>That said, a safari vehicle will pull up if the guide sees a dung beetle. Why? Because these insects are really impressive and visitors are always intrigued by their antics. Only 3cm long, they’re capable of converting a mountain of elephant poop to perfect golf-ball sized spheres and rolling them away. <strong>(E)</strong>………. The male does the rolling (the female clings on to the side of the ball) though sometimes they both roll together. The ball is eventually buried, eggs are laid and the larvae camps inside to feed.</p>
        <p>The Egyptians worshipped them (they’re part of the scarab family), cattle farmers still worship them (dung beetles are introduced to farmland, so good are they at mucking out). And in 2013, it was confirmed that dung beetles are the only known insect to navigate using the Milky Way. <strong>(F)</strong>………. So, when you see a dung beetle pushing its ball slowly through the warm dust, show it some proper respect – and drop to your knees and say hello.</p>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of endurance and perseverance. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Almost every successful person, whether in sport, business, family or leisure, possesses mental toughness attributes. Although they may not view themselves entirely that way, they almost certainly have a more positive and disciplined mindset than most other people. This mindset enables them to focus on achieving the outcomes they want, rather than be distracted or diverted by external factors or their own internal mental obstacles.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
It has been scientifically proven that mentally tough people are more successful, more positive and better able to manage their stress than those who aren’t as mentally tough. The good news is that Mental Toughness, which comprises both resilience (defined as the ability to bounce back from setbacks and failures) and confidence (defined as the ability to spot and seize opportunities) can be measured and then developed through a series of simple mental exercises – like going to the gym but for your mind.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of endurance and perseverance. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
What are the types of physical endurance training? Endurance is the ability to do physical activity that increases your heart rate by 50% for as long as you can without getting tired.<br>
<br>
There are two types of endurance: Specific endurance is when you fight against fatigue in sport-specific conditions. For example, if you run 1 500m you would use a specific combination of endurance training to excel in your 1 500m race. You might not be able to push yourself to do a 10 000m race if you have specifically focused on 1 500m.<br>
<br>
General endurance is when you fight against fatigue when doing different kinds of exercises. For example, if you run 1 500m, you can also run a 10 000m race without becoming fatigued. But if you compete against 10 000m runners who have done specific training for that distance, they would be able to outperform you.&nbsp;<br>
<br>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of endurance and perseverance. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
[Winston Churchill speaking to students at his old school.] But for everyone, surely, what we have gone through in this period [the start of World War 2] -- I am addressing myself to the school -- surely from this period of ten months, this is the lesson: Never give in. Never give in. Never, never, never, never -- in nothing, great or small, large or petty -- never give in, except to convictions of honour and good sense.<br>
<br>
Never yield to force. Never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy. We stood all alone a year ago, and, to many countries, it seemed that our account was closed, we were finished … we now find ourselves in a position where I say that we can be sure that we have only to persevere to conquer.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of endurance and perseverance. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Bear Grylls said he had “tears in his eyes regularly” while filming his new Amazon TV series. The adventurer hosts World’s Toughest Race: Eco-Challenge Fiji, which sees 66 teams from 30 countries race non-stop for 11 days, 24 hours a day, across hundreds of miles of rugged Fijian terrain complete with mountains, jungles and oceans. They cover 671 kilometres of terrain in a test of physical and mental endurance, in a bid to cross the finish line.<br>
<br>
Speaking from north Wales, Grylls said the series was “a reminder for me in an era when the world desperately needs inspiration”. He added: “It was a reminder of the power of friendships and what you can do together and when you help each other and when you’re honest and vulnerable with each other. But also, a reminder of the power of just the human spirit, that resilience, that fire inside of all of us that it can conquer everything when everything is against you and you think the human body is incapable of it, mind and body and spirit is what really counts, that will always count more than the outer muscles, that fire and spirit can conquer all.”&nbsp;<br>

        <p><strong>Read the text below. Six sentences have been removed from this text so that there are six gaps.</strong><br><br><strong>Fiordland in New Zealand</strong><br><br>
Fiordland is one of the most dramatic and beautiful parts of New Zealand, made entirely by nature. <strong>(A)</strong>………. Absorb the breathtaking treasures of this region by water, air or hiking. The landscape is one where waterfalls cascade hundreds of metres into deep black fiords. Here ancient rainforests cling to mountains and shimmering lakes and granite peaks look as they did a thousand years ago.</p>
        <p>Fiordland National Park is a World Heritage Site and includes Milford, Dusky and Doubtful Sounds. Famously described by Rudyard Kipling as the 'eighth wonder of the world', Milford Sound remains ever so beautiful. <strong>(B)</strong>………. These cliffs scrape the sky and waterfalls cascade downwards from as high as 1000 metres.</p>
        <p>When it rains in Milford Sound, and it often does, those waterfalls multiply with magnificent effect. Milford Sound is where plunging cliffs and raging waterfalls meet inky dark waters. It is situated on the west coast of the South Island, hours from the nearest town. <strong>(C)</strong>……….</p>
        <p>Some of the fiords can be explored by kayak but if you’d like to see the less accessible fiords, eco-tours can be arranged. But this really is the place for hiking. Fiordland National Park has three of New Zealand’s ‘great walks’, the Milford, Kepler and Routeburn Tracks. <strong>(D)</strong>………. Starting in Te Anau, it takes you over 53 kilometres through the most breath taking scenery: mountains, lakes and enormous valleys right up to the Sutherland Falls, the tallest waterfall in New Zealand.</p>
        <p>The road into Milford Sound is almost as beautiful as the fiord itself. <strong>(E)</strong>………. This includes short walks such as the Mirror Lakes, the Lake Gunn Nature Walk, and Monkey Creek. The small village of Milford Sound also has limited places to stay so pre-booking is advised or choose from the many options in Te Anau or Manapouri. If you're hungry there's a café in the village, or you can enjoy food and drink onboard your boat cruise.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Fiordland is one of the wettest areas of New Zealand. It is notorious for high rainfall and can have cool temperatures all year round. On average, Milford Sound receives rain 182 days of the year. In summer, temperatures are usually around 18 degrees Celsius and 4 degrees Celsius in winter. No matter when you choose to visit, wear warm layers and bring a waterproof jacket.</p>
        <p>Milford Sound is even more beautiful in the rain. More rainfall means the waterfalls are spectacular. <strong>(F)</strong>………. You're likely to get splashed with water when on a Milford Sound cruise anyway, so put on your raincoat and some waterproof shoes and embrace the weather!&nbsp;</p>

<br>
Miscommunication happens often enough face to face. But it happens far more frequently over text messages.<br>
<br>
Alice was texting back and forth with her friend when suddenly she went silent after a simple question. In the middle of a meeting, John received a three-page text message from his wife. Sandy accidently sent a personal text message to the wrong person causing a series of awkward responses. All of these misunderstandings could be avoided by following a few simple guidelines.<br>
<br>
Here are the top texting rules: Know your audience. Double check everything. Text alone. Texting is casual conversation only, not serious. Always respond, but don’t open a text message unless you intend to respond immediately. Know the difference between useful and non-useful texting. Remember that pictures are not secure and don’t presume that texting is confidential.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of phones. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
In 2021, buying the best phone means looking for something that should last you a few years. Smartphones’ upgrade cycles are slowing down for a reason. Even at lower prices, it’s getting harder and harder to buy a lemon. In other words, you don’t have to spend a huge amount to get something great, as a bunch of great smartphones are available for around $800.<br>
<br>
It’s harder than ever to decide between everything in that range, but for most people, our pick for the best phone is the Apple iPhone 12. Luckily, if you’re looking for a no compromise smartphone at any price, the choices over a thousand dollars are much clearer. If you like Android, the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra is incredibly good. And if you want to get the best smartphone on a budget, you can find something really good for under $500 or even under $400.&nbsp;<br>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of phones. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
By texting less and calling more, I was reminded that people are always nicer on the phone than on text. Face to face they are even nicer than that. Arguments are resolved more quickly. But talking on the phone scares people. Technology has created a new rigidity when it comes to conversation. Calling is usually planned and scheduled. I still text all the time. But I am calling more too. I am back in the habit, and for me, it is infinitely more satisfying to have a conversation that is two sided and flexible and unpredictable. No device will be ever able to replace personal conversation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of phones. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Should a young child have a mobile? Most mobiles offer almost complete access to the internet and are much harder to filter and control than your home computer. A mobile also gives the outside world, including undesirables, another way to communicate with a child.<br>
<br>
Mobiles also put your child at risk for getting in trouble if limits aren’t in place. Or a child might make prank calls or be blamed for them if a classmate takes their phone and uses it to make inappropriate calls.<br>
<br>
Whether or not your child is ready for or needs a mobile is something you will have to decide for yourself. Make sure that your child can handle the responsibility for a mobile before you buy one. When getting your younger child, a mobile, consider putting some limits in place.&nbsp;<br>

        <p><strong>Read the text below. Six sentences have been removed from this text so that there are six gaps.</strong><br><br><strong>Dolphins and Porpoises&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Dolphins and porpoises delight us with their playful antics and warm our hearts with their friendly faces. Marine species are the most well-known, but there are several species that live in freshwater rivers. All are air-breathing, warm-blooded mammals that nurse their young. <strong>(A)</strong>………. Dolphins have longer snouts, bigger mouths, more curved dorsal fins, and longer, leaner bodies than porpoises.</p>
        <p>People use the terms dolphins, porpoises, and whales to describe marine mammals belonging to the order Cetacea (from the Greek work ketos, “large sea creature”). <strong>(B)</strong>…… The orca, or killer whale, for example, is actually the largest member of the dolphin family. Dolphins and porpoises are at the top of the food chain and have an important role in the overall balance of the marine environment. They can tell us a lot about the health of the ocean. This includes the presence of pollution or the decline in fish. They are also very popular with tourists.</p>
        <p>Dolphins are by far more prevalent than porpoises. Most scientists agree that there are 32 dolphin species (plus five closely related species of river dolphin) and only six porpoise species. The harbour porpoise, for example, has small, pointed flippers and no beak. The dorsal fin is small and triangular-shaped. <strong>(C)</strong>………. Both have large, complex brains and a structure in their foreheads, called the melon. With this they generate sonar (sound waves) to navigate their underwater world.</p>
        <p><strong>(D)</strong>………. Dolphins and porpoises differ in their faces, fins, and body shapes. Dolphins have longer noses, bigger mouths, more curved dorsal fins, and longer, leaner bodies than porpoises. The Northeastern Spotted Dolphin has a falcate, or sickle-shaped dorsal fin and light spotting on the belly.</p>
        <p>Other differences also include their faces (who can forget Flipper’s famous “grin”?), their fins, and their figures. Dolphins tend to have prominent, elongated “beaks”, while porpoises have smaller mouths. But the central distinguishing feature is actually their teeth. Dolphins all have cone-shaped teeth, whereas porpoises have flat, spade- shaped teeth. While this distinction may be apparent on a skull in a museum, it’s a tricky one to make in the field. <strong>(E)</strong>………. The dolphin’s hooked or curved dorsal fin (the one in the middle of the animal’s back) also differs from the porpoise’s triangular dorsal fin. Generally speaking, dolphin bodies are leaner, and porpoises’ bodies are portly.</p>
        <p>Dolphins are also more talkative than porpoises. Dolphins make whistling sounds through their blowholes to communicate with one another underwater. Scientists are pretty sure that porpoises do not do this. <strong>(F)</strong>………. It is likely that more (or fewer) differences&nbsp;between dolphins and porpoises will be revealed as researchers continue to investigate these intriguing sentinels of the sea.&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of kids’ movies. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
What makes a good kids’ movie? Well, for me, a good kids’ movie has to appeal to people of all ages, and not just kids. Yes, you need an interesting story and characters, but you can say that about every film project.<br>
<br>
The special kids’ / family films have heart and most of them also have an important message to teach. Need examples? How about the early animated Disney films? Were Snow White and Pinocchio and Bambi kids’ films? I would say yes. But, of course, they were much more than that. Everything about these movies is memorable – scenes, characters, dialogue. And while they were thought to be only for kids, as they were cartoons, parents and other adults loved them just as much as the youngsters back when they were first released, and still do today.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of kids’ movies. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Currently, Pixar is the leading studio when it comes to great kids’ movies. ‘Toy Story’, ‘Ratatouille’ and ‘Up’ are among the Pixar films that work for both adults and kids. And, once again, it’s because of their interesting stories and characters.<br>
<br>
DreamWorks and Blue Sky are two other studios who have figured this out, while others continue to try and fail. Hollywood produces so many bad kids’ comedies each year, and most of them have the same things in common: too much slapstick and bathroom humour; silly plots; and unlikeable and unbelievable characters. All of these elements are clearly present in the latest bad kids’ film – ‘Furry Vengeance’ – but you can also find them in ‘Diary of a Wimpy Kid’, ‘Shorts’ and other recent live-action family comedies.<br>

Disney's Africa-set family classic, ‘The Lion King’ has been voted the best animated film of all time - as if that will come as any surprise to you, as it's a stone-cold classic. Yep, now Simba's not only the king of Pride Rock, he's also top dog (or cat) of the animated movie world, having been awarded the number one spot by voters on Ranker.<br>
<br>
"The best animated films of all time are an assortment of animated movies that rank among the best movies of all time," the site says. "While the characters might be brightly coloured and possess abilities most real people could only wish to ever have, the stories and imagery speak to everyone and have set these movies up to become the best animated films ever." The film was followed in the runner-up spots by 1995's Toy Story and 2003's Finding Nemo in second and third place, respectively.<br>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of kids’ movies. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Popular Hollywood kids’ movies traditionally follow a three-act formula. Consider the beginning of Ratatouille, when Remy the rat, lost in the Parisian underground, sniffs his way into the kitchen of legendary restaurant Gusteau’s. In this first act, we uncover the furry protagonist’s central conflict: he yearns to cook, but being a rodent makes it tricky!<br>
<br>
Films can break the three-act structure. James Bonnet, a film writing instructor, says if a movie simply focuses on two elements – the action creating the problem, and the action resolving it – it will still work. Regardless of how many acts a movie has, it must have events that advance the plot, or main story – which screenplay consultant Michael Hauge calls turning points – as well as a likable but complex protagonist, or primary character, who has a problem to solve.<br>

<br>
The story of the sad elephants is a true story that still has no explanation. It just happened and we still have no idea why.<br>
<br>
A man named Anthony Lawrence was given a herd of elephants that nobody wanted because they were so wild. Nana, the matriarch of the herd continually tried to tear down the fence around the reserve. According to the story of the sad elephants, Lawrence would stand in front of them and explain the dangers they would face if they left the reserve. At first, Nana became curious but later that curiosity gave way to love. As a result, they stopped being a herd of rebellious elephants and became great friends with their caretaker, Anthony.<br>
<br>
In 2012, Anthony Lawrence died from a heart attack. Thus began a most amazing event. Two days after his death, the wild elephants began to arrive at his home. They were all there within a day. A total of 31 elephants walked more than 20 kilometres to get there. They surrounded the house, and stayed there for two days, without eating or drinking during that time. Maybe this was their way of saying goodbye to their great friend. On the third day, they left with the same solemnity with which they had arrived.<br>
Nobody can explain how they found out about Anthony’s death.<br>

Modoc: The True Story of the Greatest Elephant That Ever Lived<br>
<br>
A captivating true story of loyalty, friendship, and high adventure that spans several decades and three continents, Modoc is one of the most remarkable true stories ever told, perfect for fans of The Zookeeper's Wife or Water for Elephants.<br>
<br>
Raised together in a small German circus town, a boy and an elephant formed a bond that would last their entire lives, and would be tested time and again: through a near-fatal shipwreck in the Indian Ocean, an apprenticeship with the legendary Mahout elephant trainers in the Indian teak forests, and their eventual rise to circus stardom in 1940s New York City.<br>
<br>
"Once I started this incomparable story, I couldn't put it down, and I cannot get it out of my mind--nor will I ever. The message of what can be accomplished by training through affection and joy will thrill all animal lovers." -- Betty White.<br>
As the African Sun-Times put it, Modoc is "heartwarming... probably the greatest love story ever told."<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of elephants. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
The more I read about the massive elephant brain, the more convinced I've become, as Graeme Shannon of Sussex University says, "there seems to be something going on there". He was talking about elephants in Kenya being able to distinguish between different languages – English, safe, the language of tourists clicking cameras; Maa – potentially dangerous, the language of the Maasai warriors who occasionally kill elephants; and Swahili, generally safe. The elephants seemed anxious when someone spoke Maa; the moment she switched to Swahili, they became calm.<br>
<br>
Animal psychologist Karen McComb, also at Sussex, played back elephant sounds – to discover how many individual voices one animal could recognise. The answer? More than 100. Research in Japan suggests they can count, too.<br>
<br>
But it is the empathy of elephants that stands out, that makes them seem so alike to humans. "What elephants share with humans is that they live in an elaborate and complex network in which support, empathy, and help for others are critical for survival." Prof. Byrne.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of elephants. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
If you want to survive an elephant attack, firstly, look at its ears. If the elephant's ears are pinned back flat, it's about to charge you for real. If an elephant's ears are relaxed, it is probably making a mock charge. Ears that are fanned out are likewise indicative of a mock charge.<br>
<br>
Most charges made by elephants are mock charges. That is, the elephant is pretending to charge but is actually testing you out to see if you're aggressive or a non-threat. Look at the elephant's trunk to see if it's curled inward in attack position. During a genuine charge, an elephant will curl its trunk up and inward. If its trunk is hanging loosely down, on the other hand, the elephant is probably only making a mock charge.<br>
<br>
Being able to recognise the difference between an elephant who is making a mock charge and an elephant who is about to trample you may save your life. Start running in a zig-zag pattern if you've noticed the signs of a real charge. A charging elephant can run much faster than you, but if you zig-zag, you might be able to evade it.<br>

          <strong>The Wind in the Willows&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Kenneth Grahame&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p><em>[Rat takes his friend Mole to meet Toad.]&nbsp;</em><br><br>
‘Now, look here. Let's be sensible.’ said Toad. ‘You are the very animals I wanted. You've got to help me. It's most important! I've discovered the real thing, the only genuine occupation for a lifetime. I propose to devote the remainder of mine to it, and can only regret the wasted years that lie behind me, squandered in trivialities. Come with me, dear Ratty, and your amiable friend also, if he will be so very good, just as far as the stableyard, and you shall see what you shall see!’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He led the way to the stable-yard accordingly, the Rat following with a most mistrustful expression; and there, drawn out of the coach-house into the open, they saw a gipsy caravan, shining with newness, painted a canary-yellow picked out with green, and red wheels.</p>
        <p>‘There you are!’ cried the Toad, <span class="txt-underline"><strong>straddling and expanding himself</strong></span>. ‘There's real life for you, embodied in that little cart. The open road, the dusty highway, the heath, the common, the hedgerows, the rolling downs! Camps, villages, towns, cities! Here to-day, up and off to somewhere else to-morrow! Travel, change, interest, excitement! The whole world before you, and a horizon that's always changing! And mind! This is the very finest cart of its sort that was ever built, without any exception. Come inside and look at the arrangements. Planned 'em all myself, I did!’</p>
        <p>The Mole was tremendously interested and excited, and followed him eagerly up the steps and into the interior of the caravan. <span class="txt-underline"><strong>The Rat only snorted and thrust his hands deep into his pockets, remaining where he was</strong></span>.</p>
        <p>It was indeed very compact and comfortable. Little sleeping bunks—a little table that folded up against the wall—a cooking-stove, lockers, book-shelves, a bird-cage with a bird in it; and pots, pans, jugs, and kettles of every size and variety.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘All complete!’ said the Toad triumphantly, pulling open a locker. ‘You see—biscuits, potted lobster, sardines—everything you can possibly want. Soda-water here—baccy there— letter-paper, bacon, jam, cards, and dominoes—you'll find,’ he continued, as they descended the steps again, ‘you'll find that nothing whatever has been forgotten, when we make our start this afternoon.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘I beg your pardon,’ said the Rat slowly, as he chewed a straw, ‘but did I overhear you say something about <em>we</em> and <em>start</em> and <em>this</em> <em>afternoon</em>?</p>
        <p>‘Now, you dear good old Ratty,’ said Toad imploringly, ‘don't begin talking in that stiff and sniffy sort of way, because you know you've got to come. I can't possibly manage without you, so please consider it settled, and don't argue—it's the one thing I can't stand. You surely don't mean to stick to your dull fusty old river all your life, and just live in a hole in a bank, and boat? I want to show you the world! I'm going to make an animal of you, my boy!’</p>
        <p>‘I don't care,’ said the Rat doggedly. ‘I'm not coming, and that's flat. And I am going to stick to my old river, and live in a hole, and boat, as I've always done. And what's more, Mole's going to stick to me and do as I do, aren't you, Mole?’</p>
        <p>‘Of course, I am,’ said the Mole, loyally. ‘I'll always stick to you, Rat, and what you say is to be—has got to be. All the same, it sounds as if it might have been—well, rather fun, you know!’ he added wistfully. Poor Mole! The Life Adventurous was so new a thing to him, and so thrilling; and this fresh aspect of it was so tempting; and he had fallen in love at first sight with the canary-coloured cart and all its little fitments.</p>
        <p>The Rat saw what was passing in his mind and wavered. He hated disappointing people, and he was fond of the Mole, and would do almost anything to oblige him. Toad was watching both of them closely.</p>
        <p>‘Come along in, and have some lunch,’ he said, diplomatically, ‘and we'll talk it over. We needn't decide anything in a hurry. Of course, I don't really care. I only want to give pleasure to you fellows. “Live for others!” That's my motto in life.’&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>The Wind in the Willows&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Kenneth Grahame&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p><em>[Rat takes his friend Mole to meet Toad.]&nbsp;</em><br><br>
‘Now, look here. Let's be sensible.’ said Toad. ‘You are the very animals I wanted. You've got to help me. It's most important! I've discovered the real thing, the only genuine occupation for a lifetime. I propose to devote the remainder of mine to it, and can only regret the wasted years that lie behind me, squandered in trivialities. Come with me, dear Ratty, and your amiable friend also, if he will be so very good, just as far as the stableyard, and you shall see what you shall see!’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He led the way to the stable-yard accordingly, the Rat following with a most mistrustful expression; and there, drawn out of the coach-house into the open, they saw a gipsy caravan, shining with newness, painted a canary-yellow picked out with green, and red wheels.</p>
        <p>‘There you are!’ cried the Toad, <span class="txt-underline"><strong>straddling and expanding himself</strong></span>. ‘There's real life for you, embodied in that little cart. The open road, the dusty highway, the heath, the common, the hedgerows, the rolling downs! Camps, villages, towns, cities! Here to-day, up and off to somewhere else to-morrow! Travel, change, interest, excitement! The whole world before you, and a horizon that's always changing! And mind! This is the very finest cart of its sort that was ever built, without any exception. Come inside and look at the arrangements. Planned 'em all myself, I did!’</p>
        <p>The Mole was tremendously interested and excited, and followed him eagerly up the steps and into the interior of the caravan. <span class="txt-underline"><strong>The Rat only snorted and thrust his hands deep into his pockets, remaining where he was</strong></span>.</p>
        <p>It was indeed very compact and comfortable. Little sleeping bunks—a little table that folded up against the wall—a cooking-stove, lockers, book-shelves, a bird-cage with a bird in it; and pots, pans, jugs, and kettles of every size and variety.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘All complete!’ said the Toad triumphantly, pulling open a locker. ‘You see—biscuits, potted lobster, sardines—everything you can possibly want. Soda-water here—baccy there— letter-paper, bacon, jam, cards, and dominoes—you'll find,’ he continued, as they descended the steps again, ‘you'll find that nothing whatever has been forgotten, when we make our start this afternoon.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘I beg your pardon,’ said the Rat slowly, as he chewed a straw, ‘but did I overhear you say something about <em>we</em> and <em>start</em> and <em>this</em> <em>afternoon</em>?</p>
        <p>‘Now, you dear good old Ratty,’ said Toad imploringly, ‘don't begin talking in that stiff and sniffy sort of way, because you know you've got to come. I can't possibly manage without you, so please consider it settled, and don't argue—it's the one thing I can't stand. You surely don't mean to stick to your dull fusty old river all your life, and just live in a hole in a bank, and boat? I want to show you the world! I'm going to make an animal of you, my boy!’</p>
        <p>‘I don't care,’ said the Rat doggedly. ‘I'm not coming, and that's flat. And I am going to stick to my old river, and live in a hole, and boat, as I've always done. And what's more, Mole's going to stick to me and do as I do, aren't you, Mole?’</p>
        <p>‘Of course, I am,’ said the Mole, loyally. ‘I'll always stick to you, Rat, and what you say is to be—has got to be. All the same, it sounds as if it might have been—well, rather fun, you know!’ he added wistfully. Poor Mole! The Life Adventurous was so new a thing to him, and so thrilling; and this fresh aspect of it was so tempting; and he had fallen in love at first sight with the canary-coloured cart and all its little fitments.</p>
        <p>The Rat saw what was passing in his mind and wavered. He hated disappointing people, and he was fond of the Mole, and would do almost anything to oblige him. Toad was watching both of them closely.</p>
        <p>‘Come along in, and have some lunch,’ he said, diplomatically, ‘and we'll talk it over. We needn't decide anything in a hurry. Of course, I don't really care. I only want to give pleasure to you fellows. “Live for others!” That's my motto in life.’&nbsp;</p>
