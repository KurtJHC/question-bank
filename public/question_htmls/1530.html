&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Byron Bay</strong><br>
<br>
Byron Bay is not what it used to be. No shade intended: This small town on the north coast of the Australian state of New South Wales has always shifted with the times, and that’s no less true now. Byron Bay is known as an epicentre of Australia’s counter-culture. <strong>15 ……...</strong> Locals, for instance, stopped McDonald’s from setting up its golden arches. But it wasn’t always this way: before the New Agers unfurled their prayer flags in the 1970s, it had a less romantic reputation as a hub of sand-mining, cedar-cutting, abattoirs and whaling.<br>
<br>
The Bundjalung nation of the Arakwal Australian Aboriginal people had been living along the coast of Byron Bay for more than 20,000 years when the cape was encountered in 1770 by Capt. James Cook, who named it for Commodore (later Admiral) John Byron, grandfather of the poet Lord Byron. Byron Bay was founded in 1860 as a timber port. It was declared a town in 1896 and a shire in 1906. Before coastal shipping declined, Byron Bay was the principal port between Newcastle (about 630km south) and Brisbane (140km north-northwest). Over the years, Byron Bay’s local economy underwent a dramatic evolution. <strong>16 ……….</strong> For roughly 20 years gold was painstakingly extracted from the black sand as “poor man’s diggings”, which yielded a measure of profit for most who undertook its mining but did not bestow a fortune on anyone. In the mid-1930s it was learned that the sand that had been discarded by the prospectors, contained the valuable minerals rutile and zircon, which became the focus of a sand-mining industry that flourished until the early 1970s.<br>
<br>
Byron—or the Bay, as locals call it—is evolving again. It’s still a magnet for backpackers and surfers. However, these days it also attracts cashed-up visitors, and entrepreneurs who boast about ‘board meetings’ on the water. <strong>17 ……….</strong> But its main selling points—a laid-back pace and beautiful beaches—are still just as appealing.<br>
<br>
To get there, we suggest you take the back road. There are two airports that service Byron Bay. The easiest option is to fly into Ballina Byron Gateway Airport (daily flights from Sydney, Melbourne and Newcastle) and book a transfer to Byron Bay. This will take you via the Coast Road, a scenic, 30-minute intro to the area that winds past windswept beaches, soft tea-tree forests, and cane fields before meandering into town through the lush back door of Broken Head. Alternatively, you’ll find more flight options at Gold Coast Airport, but a longer and less joy-sparking transfer via the freeway. On the upside, if you arrive this way you’ll get to see the famous “Cheer up, slow down, chill out” welcome sign, and the jaunty new silver lighthouse sculpture. Book ahead… Byron is busy year-round these days, so plan well ahead for accommodation. <strong>18 ……….</strong> If you’re on a budget, the recently revamped Byron Bay YHA hostel is a good, cheap, and centrally located option. The Bower’s beach-chic suites and circular pool will rate highly on social media feeds.<br>
Also, more than 17 percent of Byron’s housing is listed on holiday rental platforms like Airbnb, so you should have plenty to choose from.<br>
<br>
And plan your trip. Byron Bay is part of the greater Byron Shire. Byron Bay is small; the Shire is large. <strong>19 ……….</strong> Take The Byron at Byron Resort &amp; Spa, for instance—it sounds like it’s in the centre of Byron, but it’s actually in the suburb Suffolk Park, a 10-minute drive from town. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing—in fact, it can be a blessing to be able to retreat from the Byron bubble—just something to bear in mind when booking. Skip summer. Summer has northerly winds, week-long downpours, and throngs of tourists. The best time to visit is during autumn and winter (March to August), when the weather is great, the surf is at its best, and the crowds ease off (a little). From May to October you’ll also be able to spot humpback whales cruising past on their annual migration.<br>
<br>
Get up early and walk. It’s worth it to soak up the sunrise from Cape Byron, the most easterly point of Australia. You can save time and drive up to the historic lighthouse (there are limited parking spaces and entry is AUD$8). <strong>20 ……….</strong> It winds through rare littoral rainforest, past pristine beaches and across grass-covered cliffs to reach the stately 1901 lighthouse on the headland and sweeping views of the ocean. The full loop is 3.7km and takes around two hours to complete, but don’t be tempted to take the shortcut down the road on the way back—the second half of the track along Tallow Ridge is equally special.</p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Byron Bay</strong><br>
<br>
Byron Bay is not what it used to be. No shade intended: This small town on the north coast of the Australian state of New South Wales has always shifted with the times, and that’s no less true now. Byron Bay is known as an epicentre of Australia’s counter-culture. <strong>15 ……...</strong> Locals, for instance, stopped McDonald’s from setting up its golden arches. But it wasn’t always this way: before the New Agers unfurled their prayer flags in the 1970s, it had a less romantic reputation as a hub of sand-mining, cedar-cutting, abattoirs and whaling.<br>
<br>
The Bundjalung nation of the Arakwal Australian Aboriginal people had been living along the coast of Byron Bay for more than 20,000 years when the cape was encountered in 1770 by Capt. James Cook, who named it for Commodore (later Admiral) John Byron, grandfather of the poet Lord Byron. Byron Bay was founded in 1860 as a timber port. It was declared a town in 1896 and a shire in 1906. Before coastal shipping declined, Byron Bay was the principal port between Newcastle (about 630km south) and Brisbane (140km north-northwest). Over the years, Byron Bay’s local economy underwent a dramatic evolution. <strong>16 ……….</strong> For roughly 20 years gold was painstakingly extracted from the black sand as “poor man’s diggings”, which yielded a measure of profit for most who undertook its mining but did not bestow a fortune on anyone. In the mid-1930s it was learned that the sand that had been discarded by the prospectors, contained the valuable minerals rutile and zircon, which became the focus of a sand-mining industry that flourished until the early 1970s.<br>
<br>
Byron—or the Bay, as locals call it—is evolving again. It’s still a magnet for backpackers and surfers. However, these days it also attracts cashed-up visitors, and entrepreneurs who boast about ‘board meetings’ on the water. <strong>17 ……….</strong> But its main selling points—a laid-back pace and beautiful beaches—are still just as appealing.<br>
<br>
To get there, we suggest you take the back road. There are two airports that service Byron Bay. The easiest option is to fly into Ballina Byron Gateway Airport (daily flights from Sydney, Melbourne and Newcastle) and book a transfer to Byron Bay. This will take you via the Coast Road, a scenic, 30-minute intro to the area that winds past windswept beaches, soft tea-tree forests, and cane fields before meandering into town through the lush back door of Broken Head. Alternatively, you’ll find more flight options at Gold Coast Airport, but a longer and less joy-sparking transfer via the freeway. On the upside, if you arrive this way you’ll get to see the famous “Cheer up, slow down, chill out” welcome sign, and the jaunty new silver lighthouse sculpture. Book ahead… Byron is busy year-round these days, so plan well ahead for accommodation. <strong>18 ……….</strong> If you’re on a budget, the recently revamped Byron Bay YHA hostel is a good, cheap, and centrally located option. The Bower’s beach-chic suites and circular pool will rate highly on social media feeds.<br>
Also, more than 17 percent of Byron’s housing is listed on holiday rental platforms like Airbnb, so you should have plenty to choose from.<br>
<br>
And plan your trip. Byron Bay is part of the greater Byron Shire. Byron Bay is small; the Shire is large. <strong>19 ……….</strong> Take The Byron at Byron Resort &amp; Spa, for instance—it sounds like it’s in the centre of Byron, but it’s actually in the suburb Suffolk Park, a 10-minute drive from town. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing—in fact, it can be a blessing to be able to retreat from the Byron bubble—just something to bear in mind when booking. Skip summer. Summer has northerly winds, week-long downpours, and throngs of tourists. The best time to visit is during autumn and winter (March to August), when the weather is great, the surf is at its best, and the crowds ease off (a little). From May to October you’ll also be able to spot humpback whales cruising past on their annual migration.<br>
<br>
Get up early and walk. It’s worth it to soak up the sunrise from Cape Byron, the most easterly point of Australia. You can save time and drive up to the historic lighthouse (there are limited parking spaces and entry is AUD$8). <strong>20 ……….</strong> It winds through rare littoral rainforest, past pristine beaches and across grass-covered cliffs to reach the stately 1901 lighthouse on the headland and sweeping views of the ocean. The full loop is 3.7km and takes around two hours to complete, but don’t be tempted to take the shortcut down the road on the way back—the second half of the track along Tallow Ridge is equally special.</p>

Byron—or the Bay, as locals call it—is evolving again. It’s still a magnet for backpackers and surfers. However, these days it also attracts cashed-up visitors, and entrepreneurs who boast about ‘board meetings’ on the water. <strong>17 ……….</strong> But its main selling points—a laid-back pace and beautiful beaches—are still just as appealing.<br>
<br>
To get there, we suggest you take the back road. There are two airports that service Byron Bay. The easiest option is to fly into Ballina Byron Gateway Airport (daily flights from Sydney, Melbourne and Newcastle) and book a transfer to Byron Bay. This will take you via the Coast Road, a scenic, 30-minute intro to the area that winds past windswept beaches, soft tea-tree forests, and cane fields before meandering into town through the lush back door of Broken Head. Alternatively, you’ll find more flight options at Gold Coast Airport, but a longer and less joy-sparking transfer via the freeway. On the upside, if you arrive this way you’ll get to see the famous “Cheer up, slow down, chill out” welcome sign, and the jaunty new silver lighthouse sculpture. Book ahead… Byron is busy year-round these days, so plan well ahead for accommodation. <strong>18 ……….</strong> If you’re on a budget, the recently revamped Byron Bay YHA hostel is a good, cheap, and centrally located option. The Bower’s beach-chic suites and circular pool will rate highly on social media feeds.<br>
Also, more than 17 percent of Byron’s housing is listed on holiday rental platforms like Airbnb, so you should have plenty to choose from.<br>
<br>
And plan your trip. Byron Bay is part of the greater Byron Shire. Byron Bay is small; the Shire is large. <strong>19 ……….</strong> Take The Byron at Byron Resort &amp; Spa, for instance—it sounds like it’s in the centre of Byron, but it’s actually in the suburb Suffolk Park, a 10-minute drive from town. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing—in fact, it can be a blessing to be able to retreat from the Byron bubble—just something to bear in mind when booking. Skip summer. Summer has northerly winds, week-long downpours, and throngs of tourists. The best time to visit is during autumn and winter (March to August), when the weather is great, the surf is at its best, and the crowds ease off (a little). From May to October you’ll also be able to spot humpback whales cruising past on their annual migration.<br>
<br>
Get up early and walk. It’s worth it to soak up the sunrise from Cape Byron, the most easterly point of Australia. You can save time and drive up to the historic lighthouse (there are limited parking spaces and entry is AUD$8). <strong>20 ………. </strong>It winds through rare littoral rainforest, past pristine beaches and across grass-covered cliffs to reach the stately 1901 lighthouse on the headland and sweeping views of the ocean. The full loop is 3.7km and takes around two hours to complete, but don’t be tempted to take the shortcut down the road on the way back—the second half of the track along Tallow Ridge is equally special.</p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Byron Bay</strong><br>
<br>
Byron Bay is not what it used to be. No shade intended: This small town on the north coast of the Australian state of New South Wales has always shifted with the times, and that’s no less true now. Byron Bay is known as an epicentre of Australia’s counter-culture. <strong>15 ……...</strong> Locals, for instance, stopped McDonald’s from setting up its golden arches. But it wasn’t always this way: before the New Agers unfurled their prayer flags in the 1970s, it had a less romantic reputation as a hub of sand-mining, cedar-cutting, abattoirs and whaling.<br>
<br>
The Bundjalung nation of the Arakwal Australian Aboriginal people had been living along the coast of Byron Bay for more than 20,000 years when the cape was encountered in 1770 by Capt. James Cook, who named it for Commodore (later Admiral) John Byron, grandfather of the poet Lord Byron. Byron Bay was founded in 1860 as a timber port. It was declared a town in 1896 and a shire in 1906. Before coastal shipping declined, Byron Bay was the principal port between Newcastle (about 630km south) and Brisbane (140km north-northwest). Over the years, Byron Bay’s local economy underwent a dramatic evolution. <strong>16 ……….</strong> For roughly 20 years gold was painstakingly extracted from the black sand as “poor man’s diggings”, which yielded a measure of profit for most who undertook its mining but did not bestow a fortune on anyone. In the mid-1930s it was learned that the sand that had been discarded by the prospectors, contained the valuable minerals rutile and zircon, which became the focus of a sand-mining industry that flourished until the early 1970s.<br>
<br>
Byron—or the Bay, as locals call it—is evolving again. It’s still a magnet for backpackers and surfers. However, these days it also attracts cashed-up visitors, and entrepreneurs who boast about ‘board meetings’ on the water. <strong>17 ……….</strong> But its main selling points—a laid-back pace and beautiful beaches—are still just as appealing.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Byron Bay</strong><br>
<br>
Byron Bay is not what it used to be. No shade intended: This small town on the north coast of the Australian state of New South Wales has always shifted with the times, and that’s no less true now. Byron Bay is known as an epicentre of Australia’s counter-culture. <strong>15 ……...</strong> Locals, for instance, stopped McDonald’s from setting up its golden arches. But it wasn’t always this way: before the New Agers unfurled their prayer flags in the 1970s, it had a less romantic reputation as a hub of sand-mining, cedar-cutting, abattoirs and whaling.<br>
<br>
The Bundjalung nation of the Arakwal Australian Aboriginal people had been living along the coast of Byron Bay for more than 20,000 years when the cape was encountered in 1770 by Capt. James Cook, who named it for Commodore (later Admiral) John Byron, grandfather of the poet Lord Byron. Byron Bay was founded in 1860 as a timber port. It was declared a town in 1896 and a shire in 1906. Before coastal shipping declined, Byron Bay was the principal port between Newcastle (about 630km south) and Brisbane (140km north-northwest). Over the years, Byron Bay’s local economy underwent a dramatic evolution. <strong>16 ……….</strong> For roughly 20 years gold was painstakingly extracted from the black sand as “poor man’s diggings”, which yielded a measure of profit for most who undertook its mining but did not bestow a fortune on anyone. In the mid-1930s it was learned that the sand that had been discarded by the prospectors, contained the valuable minerals rutile and zircon, which became the focus of a sand-mining industry that flourished until the early 1970s.<br>
<br>
Byron—or the Bay, as locals call it—is evolving again. It’s still a magnet for backpackers and surfers. However, these days it also attracts cashed-up visitors, and entrepreneurs who boast about ‘board meetings’ on the water. <strong>17 ………. </strong>But its main selling points—a laid-back pace and beautiful beaches—are still just as appealing.<br>
<br>
To get there, we suggest you take the back road. There are two airports that service Byron Bay. The easiest option is to fly into Ballina Byron Gateway Airport (daily flights from Sydney, Melbourne and Newcastle) and book a transfer to Byron Bay. This will take you via the Coast Road, a scenic, 30-minute intro to the area that winds past windswept beaches, soft tea-tree forests, and cane fields before meandering into town through the lush back door of Broken Head. Alternatively, you’ll find more flight options at Gold Coast Airport, but a longer and less joy-sparking transfer via the freeway. On the upside, if you arrive this way you’ll get to see the famous “Cheer up, slow down, chill out” welcome sign, and the jaunty new silver lighthouse sculpture. Book ahead… Byron is busy year-round these days, so plan well ahead for accommodation. <strong>18 ……….</strong> If you’re on a budget, the recently revamped Byron Bay YHA hostel is a good, cheap, and centrally located option. The Bower’s beach-chic suites and circular pool will rate highly on social media feeds.<br>
Also, more than 17 percent of Byron’s housing is listed on holiday rental platforms like Airbnb, so you should have plenty to choose from.<br>
<br>
And plan your trip. Byron Bay is part of the greater Byron Shire. Byron Bay is small; the Shire is large. <strong>19 ………. </strong>Take The Byron at Byron Resort &amp; Spa, for instance—it sounds like it’s in the centre of Byron, but it’s actually in the suburb Suffolk Park, a 10-minute drive from town. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing—in fact, it can be a blessing to be able to retreat from the Byron bubble—just something to bear in mind when booking. Skip summer. Summer has northerly winds, week-long downpours, and throngs of tourists. The best time to visit is during autumn and winter (March to August), when the weather is great, the surf is at its best, and the crowds ease off (a little). From May to October you’ll also be able to spot humpback whales cruising past on their annual migration.<br>
<br>
Get up early and walk. It’s worth it to soak up the sunrise from Cape Byron, the most easterly point of Australia. You can save time and drive up to the historic lighthouse (there are limited parking spaces and entry is AUD$8). <strong>20 ……….</strong> It winds through rare littoral rainforest, past pristine beaches and across grass-covered cliffs to reach the stately 1901 lighthouse on the headland and sweeping views of the ocean. The full loop is 3.7km and takes around two hours to complete, but don’t be tempted to take the shortcut down the road on the way back—the second half of the track along Tallow Ridge is equally special.</p>

        <p><em>Read the four extracts below on the theme of international travel.</em><br><br><br><strong>Extract A</strong><br><br>
When you’ve had your fill of history, culture and man-made wonders, sometimes sun, sea and sand are all you need. Desert islands like Fiji and Maui top the bucket lists of many a traveller, with all the ingredients for the perfect exotic holiday: tropical climates, swaying palms and blissful white-sand beaches. Closer to home, the Canary Island of Fuerteventura and Vis in Croatia make getting away from it all as easy as pie. Whether you're after some serious escapism or want to marvel at mother nature, Lucy McGuire picks some of the most exotic places to travel in the world. Her number one pick is Maui, Hawaii. With a legendary surf scene and golden crescent beaches that span more than 193km, there are attractions everywhere you turn in Hawaii. Maui, known as "the Valley Isle", is a favourite for its misty peaks, gorgeous sunsets and bamboo forests. Relax on Kaanapali Beach or see the red sands at Kaihalulu – it’s like no other beach in the world. Maui is a tropical wonderland, laced with tremendous trails and hiking routes. Do the 5-hour Waterfall and Rainforest Hike to take in a range of breathtaking 10–40m-high waterfalls. You'll have the chance to swim in natural pools, enjoy a fresh picnic lunch and learn all about the culture, flora and fauna of the area from your experienced naturalist guide.<br>
<br>
<strong>Extract B</strong><br>
<br>
With approximately 85 million bed nights in 2019, London was the most popular European city destination in the ECM benchmarking report. International visitors to London had continually increased over the past decade. In second place was London’s competitor, Paris. The French capital accounted for around 52 million bed nights. But London is not necessarily the most attractive city. In the hospitality industry, a bed night measures the occupancy of one person (assigned to one bed) for one night. While London ranked first in terms of bed nights, the United Kingdom received a Travel &amp; Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI) score of 5.2 out of 7.0 in 2019, taking only the fourth place on the list. The TTCI takes into consideration factors such as a country's infrastructure and its policy and enabling conditions. Comparatively, Spain ranked first on the TTCI, but its capital city Madrid ranked only at sixth place in terms of bed nights, with approximately 21 million in 2019 and an increase in bed nights of 4.3 percent over the previous year.<br>
<br>
<strong>Extract C</strong><br>
<br>
Just hours after Prime Minister, Scott Morrison announced on October 1 that he would soon reopen Australia’s international border, Madhu Tamilarasan was online booking a flight to London. “The law still doesn’t allow me to actually leave but I’ve taken a punt to book a ridiculously expensive flight,” she says. She hasn’t seen her parents for three and a half years.<br>
<br>
Australia closed its border in March 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic started its race around the globe. Just 1.1 million passengers flew in or out of the country in the 2021 financial year, compared to 42 million in 2019, government data shows. But what’s it going to be like to travel overseas again? Where can we go? And what should you take?<br>
<br>
Businessman, Thornton, travelled to Europe earlier this year for business, carrying a “wad of paper” to get through border checks. The experience was not as hard as he expected, but it was time-consuming. “It’s going to be a lot of forms, a lot of box-ticking and a lot of checking,” he says. He had to arrive for his Eurostar train ride from London to Lille, for example, two hours before departure rather than 45 minutes in pre-COVID times. “There’s just a lot more rigour in terms of checking at passport control and immigration,” Thornton says.<br>
<br>
<strong>Extract D</strong><br>
<br>
Getting out to see the world is a fantastic opportunity for you to explore and learn more about other cultures. However, it is important for authorities to screen for pests, diseases and weeds which may have travelled with you. To help protect our agricultural industries, unique environment and the health of all Australians, the department assesses all incoming air and sea travellers and screens baggage using X-ray machines, detector dogs and physical inspection. Unsure? Just declare it. You must declare certain food, plant material (including wooden articles) and animal products on your Incoming Passenger Card. Anything you declare will be assessed by a biosecurity officer, who will determine the risk associated with the goods and whether an inspection is required. If you are unsure, just declare it. Depending on the risk, you may be required to pay for the goods to be treated (e.g. fumigation or gamma irradiation), pay to export the goods from Australia or give up your goods for destruction. You will not face a penalty if you declare all goods, even if they are not allowed into Australia.<br>

When you’ve had your fill of history, culture and man-made wonders, sometimes sun, sea and sand are all you need. Desert islands like Fiji and Maui top the bucket lists of many a traveller, with all the ingredients for the perfect exotic holiday: tropical climates, swaying palms and blissful white-sand beaches. Closer to home, the Canary Island of Fuerteventura and Vis in Croatia make getting away from it all as easy as pie. Whether you're after some serious escapism or want to marvel at mother nature, Lucy McGuire picks some of the most exotic places to travel in the world. Her number one pick is Maui, Hawaii. With a legendary surf scene and golden crescent beaches that span more than 193km, there are attractions everywhere you turn in Hawaii. Maui, known as "the Valley Isle", is a favourite for its misty peaks, gorgeous sunsets and bamboo forests. Relax on Kaanapali Beach or see the red sands at Kaihalulu – it’s like no other beach in the world. Maui is a tropical wonderland, laced with tremendous trails and hiking routes. Do the 5-hour Waterfall and Rainforest Hike to take in a range of breathtaking 10–40m-high waterfalls. You'll have the chance to swim in natural pools, enjoy a fresh picnic lunch and learn all about the culture, flora and fauna of the area from your experienced naturalist guide.<br>

With approximately 85 million bed nights in 2019, London was the most popular European city destination in the ECM benchmarking report. International visitors to London had continually increased over the past decade. In second place was London’s competitor, Paris. The French capital accounted for around 52 million bed nights. But London is not necessarily the most attractive city. In the hospitality industry, a bed night measures the occupancy of one person (assigned to one bed) for one night. While London ranked first in terms of bed nights, the United Kingdom received a Travel &amp; Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI) score of 5.2 out of 7.0 in 2019, taking only the fourth place on the list. The TTCI takes into consideration factors such as a country's infrastructure and its policy and enabling conditions. Comparatively, Spain ranked first on the TTCI, but its capital city Madrid ranked only at sixth place in terms of bed nights, with approximately 21 million in 2019 and an increase in bed nights of 4.3 percent over the previous year.<br>

Just hours after Prime Minister, Scott Morrison announced on October 1 that he would soon reopen Australia’s international border, Madhu Tamilarasan was online booking a flight to London. “The law still doesn’t allow me to actually leave but I’ve taken a punt to book a ridiculously expensive flight,” she says. She hasn’t seen her parents for three and a half years.<br>
<br>
Australia closed its border in March 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic started its race around the globe. Just 1.1 million passengers flew in or out of the country in the 2021 financial year, compared to 42 million in 2019, government data shows. But what’s it going to be like to travel overseas again? Where can we go? And what should you take?<br>
<br>
Businessman, Thornton, travelled to Europe earlier this year for business, carrying a “wad of paper” to get through border checks. The experience was not as hard as he expected, but it was time-consuming. “It’s going to be a lot of forms, a lot of box-ticking and a lot of checking,” he says. He had to arrive for his Eurostar train ride from London to Lille, for example, two hours before departure rather than 45 minutes in pre-COVID times. “There’s just a lot more rigour in terms of checking at passport control and immigration,” Thornton says.<br>

Getting out to see the world is a fantastic opportunity for you to explore and learn more about other cultures. However, it is important for authorities to screen for pests, diseases and weeds which may have travelled with you. To help protect our agricultural industries, unique environment and the health of all Australians, the department assesses all incoming air and sea travellers and screens baggage using X-ray machines, detector dogs and physical inspection. Unsure? Just declare it. You must declare certain food, plant material (including wooden articles) and animal products on your Incoming Passenger Card. Anything you declare will be assessed by a biosecurity officer, who will determine the risk associated with the goods and whether an inspection is required. If you are unsure, just declare it. Depending on the risk, you may be required to pay for the goods to be treated (e.g. fumigation or gamma irradiation), pay to export the goods from Australia or give up your goods for destruction. You will not face a penalty if you declare all goods, even if they are not allowed into Australia.<br>

International visitors to London had continually increased over the past decade. In second place was London’s competitor, Paris. The French capital accounted for around 52 million bed nights. But London is not necessarily the most attractive city. In the hospitality industry, a bed night measures the occupancy of one person (assigned to one bed) for one night. While London ranked first in terms of bed nights, the United Kingdom received a Travel &amp; Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI) score of 5.2 out of 7.0 in 2019, taking only the fourth place on the list. The TTCI takes into consideration factors such as a country's infrastructure and its policy and enabling conditions. Comparatively, Spain ranked first on the TTCI, but its capital city Madrid ranked only at sixth place in terms of bed nights, with approximately 21 million in 2019 and an increase in bed nights of 4.3 percent over the previous year.<br>

Just hours after Prime Minister, Scott Morrison announced on October 1 that he would soon reopen Australia’s international border, Madhu Tamilarasan was online booking a flight to London. “The law still doesn’t allow me to actually leave but I’ve taken a punt to book a ridiculously expensive flight,” she says. She hasn’t seen her parents for three and a half years.<br>

Australia closed its border in March 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic started its race around the globe. Just 1.1 million passengers flew in or out of the country in the 2021 financial year, compared to 42 million in 2019, government data shows. But what’s it going to be like to travel overseas again? Where can we go? And what should you take?<br>
<br>
Businessman, Thornton, travelled to Europe earlier this year for business, carrying a “wad of paper” to get through border checks. The experience was not as hard as he expected, but it was time-consuming. “It’s going to be a lot of forms, a lot of box-ticking and a lot of checking,” he says. He had to arrive for his Eurostar train ride from London to Lille, for example, two hours before departure rather than 45 minutes in pre-COVID times. “There’s just a lot more rigour in terms of checking at passport control and immigration,” Thornton says.<br>

Getting out to see the world is a fantastic opportunity for you to explore and learn more about other cultures. However, it is important for authorities to screen for pests, diseases and weeds which may have travelled with you. To help protect our agricultural industries, unique environment and the health of all Australians, the department assesses all incoming air and sea travellers and screens baggage using X-ray machines, detector dogs and physical inspection. Unsure? Just declare it. You must declare certain food, plant material (including wooden articles) and animal products on your Incoming Passenger Card. Anything you declare will be assessed by a biosecurity officer, who will determine the risk associated with the goods and whether an inspection is required. If you are unsure, just declare it. Depending on the risk, you may be required to pay for the goods to be treated (e.g. fumigation or gamma irradiation), pay to export the goods from Australia or give up your goods for destruction. You will not face a penalty if you declare all goods, even if they are not allowed into Australia.<br>

When you’ve had your fill of history, culture and man-made wonders, sometimes sun, sea and sand are all you need. Desert islands like Fiji and Maui top the bucket lists of many a traveller, with all the ingredients for the perfect exotic holiday: tropical climates, swaying palms and blissful white-sand beaches. Closer to home, the Canary Island of Fuerteventura and Vis in Croatia make getting away from it all as easy as pie. Whether you're after some serious escapism or want to marvel at mother nature, Lucy McGuire picks some of the most exotic places to travel in the world. Her number one pick is Maui, Hawaii. With a legendary surf scene and golden crescent beaches that span more than 193km, there are attractions everywhere you turn in Hawaii. Maui, known as "the Valley Isle", is a favourite for its misty peaks, gorgeous sunsets and bamboo forests. Relax on Kaanapali Beach or see the red sands at Kaihalulu – it’s like no other beach in the world. Maui is a tropical wonderland, laced with tremendous trails and hiking routes. Do the 5-hour Waterfall and Rainforest Hike to take in a range of breathtaking 10–40m-high waterfalls. You'll have the chance to swim in natural pools, enjoy a fresh picnic lunch and learn all about the culture, flora and fauna of the area from your experienced naturalist guide.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp;Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having&nbsp;nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had&nbsp;no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice “without&nbsp;<br>
pictures or conversations?”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? “I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Presently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?” (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy curtseying as you’re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? “I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Presently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?” (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy curtseying as you’re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp;Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having&nbsp;nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had&nbsp;no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice “without&nbsp;<br>
pictures or conversations?”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? “I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp;Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having&nbsp;nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had&nbsp;no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice “without&nbsp;<br>
pictures or conversations?”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? “I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Presently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?” (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy curtseying as you’re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp;Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having&nbsp;nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had&nbsp;no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice “without&nbsp;<br>
pictures or conversations?”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? “I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Presently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?” (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy curtseying as you’re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”<br>

The minnow I caught<br>
Lived for a few days in a jar<br>
Then floated side-up on the surface.<br>
We buried them beneath the hedge.<br>
I didn't cry,<br>

And when she died<br>
I went to the funeral<br>
With relations dressed in black.<br>
They cried, and so did I.<br>
Salty tears ran down my face.<br>
Oh, how I cried.<br>
Yes, I thought<br>
I could deal with funerals<br>
That is<br>
Until Gran died.<br>
She was buried in a graveyard<br>
And even the sky wept that day.<br>
Rain fell and fell and fell<br>
And thunder sobbed far away across the town.<br>
I cried<br>
And I cried.<br>
I thought<br>

The minnow I caught<br>
Lived for a few days in a jar<br>
Then floated side-up on the surface.<br>
We buried them beneath the hedge.<br>
I didn't cry,<br>
But felt sad inside.<br>
I thought<br>
I could deal with funerals<br>
That is<br>
Until Gran died.<br>
The goldfish I kept in a bowl<br>
Passed away with old age.<br>
Mum wrapped him in a newspaper<br>
And we buried him next to the rose bush<br>
I didn't cry,<br>
But felt sad inside.<br>
I thought<br>
I could deal with funerals<br>
That is<br>
Until Gran died.<br>
My cat lay stiff in a shoebox<br>
After being hit by a car.<br>
Dad dug a hole and we buried her<br>
Under the apple tree.<br>
I didn't cry,<br>
But felt very sad inside.<br>
I thought<br>
I could deal with funerals<br>
That is<br>
Until Gran died.<br>
<br>
And when she died<br>
I went to the funeral<br>
With relations dressed in black.<br>
They cried, and so did I.<br>
Salty tears ran down my face.<br>
Oh, how I cried.<br>
Yes, I thought<br>
I could deal with funerals<br>
That is<br>
Until Gran died.<br>
She was buried in a graveyard<br>
And even the sky wept that day.<br>
Rain fell and fell and fell<br>
And thunder sobbed far away across the town.<br>
I cried<br>
And I cried.<br>
I thought<br>
I could deal with funerals<br>
That is<br>
Until Gran died.</div>
