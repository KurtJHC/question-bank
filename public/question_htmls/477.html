        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There he was. I watched him from the doorway. He was in the last of the beds on the left. It was a small ward, just a handful of people, and the air was tangy and sweet with the smell of ointment and iodine. He was sitting up, but collapsed into his pillows. Was he smaller than I remembered? Or was the bed just bigger? In his hands he held the mask of his nebuliser, although the tube had fallen out, and he was trying to fix it. His fingers looked pale, even from the door. Those matchwood fingers. <em>Still perfectly shaped. Don’t wrinkle your brow. Is it so hard?</em> <em>A square peg for a round hole?</em> He looked momentarily boyish. A nurse sped past me. People spoke and coughed. An alarm sounded elsewhere.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; I walked across the room and stood at the foot of his bed. He hadn’t seen me yet. I could hear his breathing now; it was a flimsy wheeze of air; a faint wind whistling through a crack in an upstairs door. His blue pyjama jacket was misbuttoned and stretched open. Beautiful curls of white chest hair showed against the <span class="txt-underline">sallow</span> droop of old skin, all soft and furrowed and smooth. An image came to me of marram grass and sand dunes the colour of a lion’s mane; and I pictured empty motor-oil bottles on the tideline, a stretch of beach, salt time, gulls squabbling by a barnacled breakwater strewn with kelp, blasted shards of bleached timber and the winter sea at Climping in West Sussex where we’d spent some of my childhood weekends in a borrowed cottage.</p>

          <strong>The Marble Champ</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <em>by Gary Soto</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lupe Medrano, a shy girl who spoke in whispers, was the school’s spelling bee champion, winner of the reading contest at the public library three summers in a row, blue ribbon awardee in the science fair, the top student at her piano recital, and the playground grand champion in chess. She was a straight-A student and—not counting kindergarten, when she had been stung by a wasp—never missed one day of elementary school. She had received a small trophy for this honor and had been congratulated by the mayor.</p>
        <p>2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But though Lupe had a razor-sharp mind, she could not make her body, no matter how much she tried, run as fast as the other girls’. She begged her body to move faster, but could never beat anyone in the fifty-yard dash.</p>
        <p>3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth was that Lupe was no good in sports. She could not catch a pop-up or figure out in which direction to kick the soccer ball. One time she kicked the ball at her own goal and scored a point for the other team. She was no good at baseball or basketball either, and even had a hard time making a hula hoop stay on her hips.</p>
        <p>4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn’t until last year, when she was eleven years old, that she learned how to ride a bike. And even then she had to use training wheels. She could walk in the swimming pool but couldn’t swim, and chanced roller skating only when her father held her hand.</p>
        <p>5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I’ll never be good at sports,” she fumed one rainy day as she lay on her bed gazing at the shelf her father had made to hold her awards. “I wish I could win something, anything, even marbles.”</p>
        <p>6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the word “marbles,” she sat up. “That’s it. Maybe I could be good at playing marbles.” She hopped out of bed and rummaged through the closet until she found a can full of her brother’s marbles. She poured the rich glass treasure on her bed and picked five of the most beautiful marbles.</p>
        <p>7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smoothed her bedspread and practiced shooting, softly at first so that her aim would be accurate. The marble rolled from her thumb and clicked against the targeted marble. But the target wouldn’t budge. She tried again and again. Her aim became accurate, but the power from her thumb made the marble move only an inch or two. Then she realized that the bedspread was slowing the marbles. She also had to admit that her thumb was weaker than the neck of a newborn chick.</p>
        <p>8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked out the window. The rain was letting up, but the ground was too muddy to play. She sat cross-legged on the bed, rolling her five marbles between her palms. Yes, she thought, I could play marbles, and marbles is a sport. At that moment she realized that she had only two weeks to practice. The playground championship, the same one her brother had entered the previous year, was coming up. She had a lot to do.</p>
        <p>9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To strengthen her wrists, she decided to do twenty push-ups on her fingertips, five at a time. “One, two, three . . .” she groaned. By the end of the first set she was breathing hard, and her muscles burned from exhaustion. She did one more set and decided that was enough push-ups for the first day.</p>
        <p>10 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She squeezed a rubber eraser one hundred times, hoping it would strengthen her thumb. This seemed to work because the next day her thumb was sore. She could hardly hold a marble in her hand, let alone send it flying with power. So Lupe rested that day and listened to her brother, who gave her tips on how to shoot: get low, aim with one eye, and place one knuckle on the ground.</p>
        <p>11 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Think ‘eye and thumb’—and let it rip!” he said.</p>
        <p>12 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After school the next day she left her homework in her backpack and practiced three hours straight, taking time only to eat a candy bar for energy. With a popsicle stick, she drew an odd-shaped circle and tossed in four marbles. She used her shooter, a milky agate with hypnotic swirls, to blast them. Her thumb had become stronger.</p>
        <p>13 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After practice, she squeezed the eraser for an hour. She ate dinner with her left hand to spare her shooting hand and said nothing to her parents about her dreams of athletic glory.</p>
        <p>14 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Practice, practice, practice. Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze. Lupe got better and beat her brother and Alfonso, a neighbor kid who was supposed to be a champ.</p>
        <p>15 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Man, she’s bad!” Alfonso said. “She can beat the other girls for sure. I think.” The weeks passed quickly. Lupe worked so hard that one day, while she was drying dishes, her mother asked why her thumb was swollen.</p>
        <p>16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weeks passed quickly. Lupe worked so hard that one day, while she was drying dishes, her mother asked why her thumb was swollen.</p>
        <p>17 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s muscle,” Lupe explained. “I’ve been practicing for the marbles championship.”</p>
        <p>18 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You, honey?” Her mother knew Lupe was no good at sports.</p>
        <p>19 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yeah. I beat Alfonso, and he’s pretty good.”</p>
        <p>20 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That night, over dinner, Mrs. Medrano said, “Honey, you should see Lupe’s thumb.”</p>
        <p>21 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Huh?” Mr. Medrano said, wiping his mouth and looking at his daughter.</p>
        <p>22 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Show your father.”</p>
        <p>23 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do I have to?” an embarrassed Lupe asked.</p>
        <p>24 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Go on, show your father.”</p>
        <p>25 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reluctantly, Lupe raised her hand and flexed her thumb. You could see the muscle.</p>
        <p>26 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father put down his fork and asked, “What happened?”</p>
        <p>27 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Dad, I’ve been working out. I’ve been squeezing an eraser.”</p>
        <p>28 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Why?”</p>
        <p>29 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I’m going to enter the marbles championship.”</p>
        <p>30 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her father looked at her mother and then back at his daughter. “When is it, honey?”</p>
        <p>31 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This Saturday. Can you come?”</p>
        <p>32 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father had been planning to play racquetball with a friend Saturday, but he said he would be there. He knew his daughter thought she was no good at sports and he wanted to encourage her. He even rigged some lights in the backyard so she could practice after dark. He squatted with one knee on the ground, entranced by the sight of his daughter easily beating her brother.</p>
        <p>33 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day of the championship began with a cold blustery sky. The sun was a silvery light behind slate clouds.</p>
        <p>34 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I hope it clears up,” her father said, rubbing his hands together as he returned from getting the newspaper. They ate breakfast, paced nervously around the house waiting for 10:00 to arrive, and walked the two blocks to the playground (though Mr. Medrano wanted to drive so Lupe wouldn’t get tired). She signed up and was assigned her first match on baseball diamond number three.</p>
        <p>35 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lupe, walking between her brother and her father, shook from the cold, not nerves. She took off her mittens, and everyone stared at her thumb. Someone asked, “How can you play with a broken thumb?” Lupe smiled and said nothing.</p>
        <p>36 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She beat her first opponent easily, and felt sorry for the girl because she didn’t have anyone to cheer for her. Except for her sack of marbles, she was all alone. Lupe invited the girl, whose name was Rachel, to stay with them. She smiled and said, “OK.” The four of them walked to a card table in the middle of the outfield, where Lupe was assigned another opponent.</p>
        <p>37 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also beat this girl, a fifth-grader named Yolanda, and asked her to join their group. They proceeded to more matches and more wins, and soon there was a crowd of people following Lupe to the finals to play a girl in a baseball cap. This girl seemed dead serious. She never even looked at Lupe.</p>

        <p>1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lupe Medrano, a shy girl who spoke in whispers, was the school’s spelling bee champion, winner of the reading contest at the public library three summers in a row, blue ribbon awardee in the science fair, the top student at her piano recital, and the playground grand champion in chess.

        <p>30 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her father looked at her mother and then back at his daughter. “When is it, honey?”</p>
        <p>31 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This Saturday. Can you come?”</p>
        <p>32 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father had been planning to play racquetball with a friend Saturday, but he said he would be there. He knew his daughter thought she was no good at sports and he wanted to encourage her. He even rigged some lights in the backyard so she could practice after dark. He squatted with one knee on the ground, entranced by the sight of his daughter easily beating her brother.</p>
        <p>33 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day of the championship began with a cold blustery sky. The sun was a silvery light behind slate clouds.</p>
        <p>34 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I hope it clears up,” her father said, rubbing his hands together as he returned from getting the newspaper. They ate breakfast, paced nervously around the house waiting for 10:00 to arrive, and walked the two blocks to the playground (though Mr. Medrano wanted to drive so Lupe wouldn’t get tired). She signed up and was assigned her first match on baseball diamond number three.</p>
        <p>35 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lupe, walking between her brother and her father, shook from the cold, not nerves. She took off her mittens, and everyone stared at her thumb. Someone asked, “How can you play with a broken thumb?” Lupe smiled and said nothing.</p>
        <p>36 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She beat her first opponent easily, and felt sorry for the girl because she didn’t have anyone to cheer for her. Except for her sack of marbles, she was all alone. Lupe invited the girl, whose name was Rachel, to stay with them. She smiled and said, “OK.” The four of them walked to a card table in the middle of the outfield, where Lupe was assigned another opponent.</p>
        <p>37 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also beat this girl, a fifth-grader named Yolanda, and asked her to join their group. They proceeded to more matches and more wins, and soon there was a crowd of people following Lupe to the finals to play a girl in a baseball cap. This girl seemed dead serious. She never even looked at Lupe.</p>

          <strong>The Marble Champ</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <em>by Gary Soto</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lupe Medrano, a shy girl who spoke in whispers, was the school’s spelling bee champion, winner of the reading contest at the public library three summers in a row, blue ribbon awardee in the science fair, the top student at her piano recital, and the playground grand champion in chess. She was a straight-A student and—not counting kindergarten, when she had been stung by a wasp—never missed one day of elementary school. She had received a small trophy for this honor and had been congratulated by the mayor.</p>
        <p>2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But though Lupe had a razor-sharp mind, she could not make her body, no matter how much she tried, run as fast as the other girls’. She begged her body to move faster, but could never beat anyone in the fifty-yard dash.</p>
        <p>3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth was that Lupe was no good in sports. She could not catch a pop-up or figure out in which direction to kick the soccer ball. One time she kicked the ball at her own goal and scored a point for the other team. She was no good at baseball or basketball either, and even had a hard time making a hula hoop stay on her hips.</p>
        <p>4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn’t until last year, when she was eleven years old, that she learned how to ride a bike. And even then she had to use training wheels. She could walk in the swimming pool but couldn’t swim, and chanced roller skating only when her father held her hand.</p>
        <p>5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I’ll never be good at sports,” she fumed one rainy day as she lay on her bed gazing at the shelf her father had made to hold her awards. “I wish I could win something, anything, even marbles.”</p>
        <p>6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the word “marbles,” she sat up. “That’s it. Maybe I could be good at playing marbles.” She hopped out of bed and rummaged through the closet until she found a can full of her brother’s marbles. She poured the rich glass treasure on her bed and picked five of the most beautiful marbles.</p>
        <p>7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smoothed her bedspread and practiced shooting, softly at first so that her aim would be accurate. The marble rolled from her thumb and clicked against the targeted marble. But the target wouldn’t budge. She tried again and again. Her aim became accurate, but the power from her thumb made the marble move only an inch or two. Then she realized that the bedspread was slowing the marbles. She also had to admit that her thumb was weaker than the neck of a newborn chick.</p>
        <p>8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked out the window. The rain was letting up, but the ground was too muddy to play. She sat cross-legged on the bed, rolling her five marbles between her palms. Yes, she thought, I could play marbles, and marbles is a sport. At that moment she realized that she had only two weeks to practice. The playground championship, the same one her brother had entered the previous year, was coming up. She had a lot to do.</p>
        <p>9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To strengthen her wrists, she decided to do twenty push-ups on her fingertips, five at a time. “One, two, three . . .” she groaned. By the end of the first set she was breathing hard, and her muscles burned from exhaustion. She did one more set and decided that was enough push-ups for the first day.</p>
        <p>10 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She squeezed a rubber eraser one hundred times, hoping it would strengthen her thumb. This seemed to work because the next day her thumb was sore. She could hardly hold a marble in her hand, let alone send it flying with power. So Lupe rested that day and listened to her brother, who gave her tips on how to shoot: get low, aim with one eye, and place one knuckle on the ground.</p>
        <p>11 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Think ‘eye and thumb’—and let it rip!” he said.</p>
        <p>12 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After school the next day she left her homework in her backpack and practiced three hours straight, taking time only to eat a candy bar for energy. With a popsicle stick, she drew an odd-shaped circle and tossed in four marbles. She used her shooter, a milky agate with hypnotic swirls, to blast them. Her thumb had become stronger.</p>
        <p>13 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After practice, she squeezed the eraser for an hour. She ate dinner with her left hand to spare her shooting hand and said nothing to her parents about her dreams of athletic glory.</p>
        <p>14 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Practice, practice, practice. Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze. Lupe got better and beat her brother and Alfonso, a neighbor kid who was supposed to be a champ.</p>
        <p>15 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Man, she’s bad!” Alfonso said. “She can beat the other girls for sure. I think.” The weeks passed quickly. Lupe worked so hard that one day, while she was drying dishes, her mother asked why her thumb was swollen.</p>
        <p>16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weeks passed quickly. Lupe worked so hard that one day, while she was drying dishes, her mother asked why her thumb was swollen.</p>
        <p>17 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s muscle,” Lupe explained. “I’ve been practicing for the marbles championship.”</p>
        <p>18 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You, honey?” Her mother knew Lupe was no good at sports.</p>
        <p>19 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yeah. I beat Alfonso, and he’s pretty good.”</p>
        <p>20 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That night, over dinner, Mrs. Medrano said, “Honey, you should see Lupe’s thumb.”</p>
        <p>21 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Huh?” Mr. Medrano said, wiping his mouth and looking at his daughter.</p>
        <p>22 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Show your father.”</p>
        <p>23 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do I have to?” an embarrassed Lupe asked.</p>
        <p>24 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Go on, show your father.”</p>
        <p>25 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reluctantly, Lupe raised her hand and flexed her thumb. You could see the muscle.</p>
        <p>26 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father put down his fork and asked, “What happened?”</p>
        <p>27 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Dad, I’ve been working out. I’ve been squeezing an eraser.”</p>
        <p>28 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Why?”</p>
        <p>29 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I’m going to enter the marbles championship.”</p>
        <p>30 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her father looked at her mother and then back at his daughter. “When is it, honey?”</p>
        <p>31 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This Saturday. Can you come?”</p>

          <strong>The Marble Champ</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <em>by Gary Soto</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lupe Medrano, a shy girl who spoke in whispers, was the school’s spelling bee champion, winner of the reading contest at the public library three summers in a row, blue ribbon awardee in the science fair, the top student at her piano recital, and the playground grand champion in chess. She was a straight-A student and—not counting kindergarten, when she had been stung by a wasp—never missed one day of elementary school. She had received a small trophy for this honor and had been congratulated by the mayor.</p>
        <p>2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But though Lupe had a razor-sharp mind, she could not make her body, no matter how much she tried, run as fast as the other girls’. She begged her body to move faster, but could never beat anyone in the fifty-yard dash.</p>
        <p>3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth was that Lupe was no good in sports. She could not catch a pop-up or figure out in which direction to kick the soccer ball. One time she kicked the ball at her own goal and scored a point for the other team. She was no good at baseball or basketball either, and even had a hard time making a hula hoop stay on her hips.</p>
        <p>4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn’t until last year, when she was eleven years old, that she learned how to ride a bike. And even then she had to use training wheels. She could walk in the swimming pool but couldn’t swim, and chanced roller skating only when her father held her hand.</p>
        <p>5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I’ll never be good at sports,” she fumed one rainy day as she lay on her bed gazing at the shelf her father had made to hold her awards. “I wish I could win something, anything, even marbles.”</p>
        <p>6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the word “marbles,” she sat up. “That’s it. Maybe I could be good at playing marbles.” She hopped out of bed and rummaged through the closet until she found a can full of her brother’s marbles. She poured the rich glass treasure on her bed and picked five of the most beautiful marbles.</p>
        <p>7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smoothed her bedspread and practiced shooting, softly at first so that her aim would be accurate. The marble rolled from her thumb and clicked against the targeted marble. But the target wouldn’t budge. She tried again and again. Her aim became accurate, but the power from her thumb made the marble move only an inch or two. Then she realized that the bedspread was slowing the marbles. She also had to admit that her thumb was weaker than the neck of a newborn chick.</p>
        <p>8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked out the window. The rain was letting up, but the ground was too muddy to play. She sat cross-legged on the bed, rolling her five marbles between her palms. Yes, she thought, I could play marbles, and marbles is a sport. At that moment she realized that she had only two weeks to practice. The playground championship, the same one her brother had entered the previous year, was coming up. She had a lot to do.</p>
        <p>9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To strengthen her wrists, she decided to do twenty push-ups on her fingertips, five at a time. “One, two, three . . .” she groaned. By the end of the first set she was breathing hard, and her muscles burned from exhaustion. She did one more set and decided that was enough push-ups for the first day.</p>
        <p>10 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She squeezed a rubber eraser one hundred times, hoping it would strengthen her thumb. This seemed to work because the next day her thumb was sore. She could hardly hold a marble in her hand, let alone send it flying with power. So Lupe rested that day and listened to her brother, who gave her tips on how to shoot: get low, aim with one eye, and place one knuckle on the ground.</p>
        <p>11 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Think ‘eye and thumb’—and let it rip!” he said.</p>
        <p>12 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After school the next day she left her homework in her backpack and practiced three hours straight, taking time only to eat a candy bar for energy. With a popsicle stick, she drew an odd-shaped circle and tossed in four marbles. She used her shooter, a milky agate with hypnotic swirls, to blast them. Her thumb had become stronger.</p>
        <p>13 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After practice, she squeezed the eraser for an hour. She ate dinner with her left hand to spare her shooting hand and said nothing to her parents about her dreams of athletic glory.</p>
        <p>14 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Practice, practice, practice. Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze. Lupe got better and beat her brother and Alfonso, a neighbor kid who was supposed to be a champ.</p>
        <p>15 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Man, she’s bad!” Alfonso said. “She can beat the other girls for sure. I think.” The weeks passed quickly. Lupe worked so hard that one day, while she was drying dishes, her mother asked why her thumb was swollen.</p>
        <p>16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weeks passed quickly. Lupe worked so hard that one day, while she was drying dishes, her mother asked why her thumb was swollen.</p>
        <p>17 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s muscle,” Lupe explained. “I’ve been practicing for the marbles championship.”</p>
        <p>18 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You, honey?” Her mother knew Lupe was no good at sports.</p>
        <p>19 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yeah. I beat Alfonso, and he’s pretty good.”</p>
        <p>20 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That night, over dinner, Mrs. Medrano said, “Honey, you should see Lupe’s thumb.”</p>
        <p>21 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Huh?” Mr. Medrano said, wiping his mouth and looking at his daughter.</p>
        <p>22 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Show your father.”</p>
        <p>23 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do I have to?” an embarrassed Lupe asked.</p>
        <p>24 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Go on, show your father.”</p>
        <p>25 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reluctantly, Lupe raised her hand and flexed her thumb. You could see the muscle.</p>
        <p>26 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father put down his fork and asked, “What happened?”</p>
        <p>27 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Dad, I’ve been working out. I’ve been squeezing an eraser.”</p>
        <p>28 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Why?”</p>
        <p>29 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I’m going to enter the marbles championship.”</p>
        <p>30 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her father looked at her mother and then back at his daughter. “When is it, honey?”</p>
        <p>31 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This Saturday. Can you come?”</p>
        <p>32 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father had been planning to play racquetball with a friend Saturday, but he said he would be there. He knew his daughter thought she was no good at sports and he wanted to encourage her. He even rigged some lights in the backyard so she could practice after dark. He squatted with one knee on the ground, entranced by the sight of his daughter easily beating her brother.</p>
        <p>33 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day of the championship began with a cold blustery sky. The sun was a silvery light behind slate clouds.</p>
        <p>34 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I hope it clears up,” her father said, rubbing his hands together as he returned from getting the newspaper. They ate breakfast, paced nervously around the house waiting for 10:00 to arrive, and walked the two blocks to the playground (though Mr. Medrano wanted to drive so Lupe wouldn’t get tired). She signed up and was assigned her first match on baseball diamond number three.</p>
        <p>35 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lupe, walking between her brother and her father, shook from the cold, not nerves. She took off her mittens, and everyone stared at her thumb. Someone asked, “How can you play with a broken thumb?” Lupe smiled and said nothing.</p>
        <p>36 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She beat her first opponent easily, and felt sorry for the girl because she didn’t have anyone to cheer for her. Except for her sack of marbles, she was all alone. Lupe invited the girl, whose name was Rachel, to stay with them. She smiled and said, “OK.” The four of them walked to a card table in the middle of the outfield, where Lupe was assigned another opponent.</p>
        <p>37 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also beat this girl, a fifth-grader named Yolanda, and asked her to join their group. They proceeded to more matches and more wins, and soon there was a crowd of people following Lupe to the finals to play a girl in a baseball cap. This girl seemed dead serious. She never even looked at Lupe.</p>

        <p>33 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day of the championship began with a cold blustery sky. The sun was a silvery light behind slate clouds.</p>
        <p>34 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I hope it clears up,” her father said, rubbing his hands together as he returned from getting the newspaper. They ate breakfast, paced nervously around the house waiting for 10:00 to arrive, and walked the two blocks to the playground (though Mr. Medrano wanted to drive so Lupe wouldn’t get tired). She signed up and was assigned her first match on baseball diamond number three.</p>
        <p>35 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lupe, walking between her brother and her father, shook from the cold, not nerves. She took off her mittens, and everyone stared at her thumb. Someone asked, “How can you play with a broken thumb?” Lupe smiled and said nothing.</p>
        <p>36 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She beat her first opponent easily, and felt sorry for the girl because she didn’t have anyone to cheer for her. Except for her sack of marbles, she was all alone. Lupe invited the girl, whose name was Rachel, to stay with them. She smiled and said, “OK.” The four of them walked to a card table in the middle of the outfield, where Lupe was assigned another opponent.</p>
        <p>37 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also beat this girl, a fifth-grader named Yolanda, and asked her to join their group. They proceeded to more matches and more wins, and soon there was a crowd of people following Lupe to the finals to play a girl in a baseball cap. This girl seemed dead serious. She never even looked at Lupe.</p>

          <strong>The Marble Champ</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <em>by Gary Soto</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lupe Medrano, a shy girl who spoke in whispers, was the school’s spelling bee champion, winner of the reading contest at the public library three summers in a row, blue ribbon awardee in the science fair, the top student at her piano recital, and the playground grand champion in chess. She was a straight-A student and—not counting kindergarten, when she had been stung by a wasp—never missed one day of elementary school. She had received a small trophy for this honor and had been congratulated by the mayor.</p>
        <p>2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But though Lupe had a razor-sharp mind, she could not make her body, no matter how much she tried, run as fast as the other girls’. She begged her body to move faster, but could never beat anyone in the fifty-yard dash.</p>
        <p>3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth was that Lupe was no good in sports. She could not catch a pop-up or figure out in which direction to kick the soccer ball. One time she kicked the ball at her own goal and scored a point for the other team. She was no good at baseball or basketball either, and even had a hard time making a hula hoop stay on her hips.</p>
        <p>4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn’t until last year, when she was eleven years old, that she learned how to ride a bike. And even then she had to use training wheels. She could walk in the swimming pool but couldn’t swim, and chanced roller skating only when her father held her hand.</p>
        <p>5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I’ll never be good at sports,” she fumed one rainy day as she lay on her bed gazing at the shelf her father had made to hold her awards. “I wish I could win something, anything, even marbles.”</p>
        <p>6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the word “marbles,” she sat up. “That’s it. Maybe I could be good at playing marbles.” She hopped out of bed and rummaged through the closet until she found a can full of her brother’s marbles. She poured the rich glass treasure on her bed and picked five of the most beautiful marbles.</p>
        <p>7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smoothed her bedspread and practiced shooting, softly at first so that her aim would be accurate. The marble rolled from her thumb and clicked against the targeted marble. But the target wouldn’t budge. She tried again and again. Her aim became accurate, but the power from her thumb made the marble move only an inch or two. Then she realized that the bedspread was slowing the marbles. She also had to admit that her thumb was weaker than the neck of a newborn chick.</p>
        <p>8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked out the window. The rain was letting up, but the ground was too muddy to play. She sat cross-legged on the bed, rolling her five marbles between her palms. Yes, she thought, I could play marbles, and marbles is a sport. At that moment she realized that she had only two weeks to practice. The playground championship, the same one her brother had entered the previous year, was coming up. She had a lot to do.</p>
        <p>9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To strengthen her wrists, she decided to do twenty push-ups on her fingertips, five at a time. “One, two, three . . .” she groaned. By the end of the first set she was breathing hard, and her muscles burned from exhaustion. She did one more set and decided that was enough push-ups for the first day.</p>
        <p>10 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She squeezed a rubber eraser one hundred times, hoping it would strengthen her thumb. This seemed to work because the next day her thumb was sore. She could hardly hold a marble in her hand, let alone send it flying with power. So Lupe rested that day and listened to her brother, who gave her tips on how to shoot: get low, aim with one eye, and place one knuckle on the ground.</p>
        <p>11 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Think ‘eye and thumb’—and let it rip!” he said.</p>
        <p>12 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After school the next day she left her homework in her backpack and practiced three hours straight, taking time only to eat a candy bar for energy. With a popsicle stick, she drew an odd-shaped circle and tossed in four marbles. She used her shooter, a milky agate with hypnotic swirls, to blast them. Her thumb had become stronger.</p>
        <p>13 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After practice, she squeezed the eraser for an hour. She ate dinner with her left hand to spare her shooting hand and said nothing to her parents about her dreams of athletic glory.</p>
        <p>14 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Practice, practice, practice. Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze. Lupe got better and beat her brother and Alfonso, a neighbor kid who was supposed to be a champ.</p>
        <p>15 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Man, she’s bad!” Alfonso said. “She can beat the other girls for sure. I think.” The weeks passed quickly. Lupe worked so hard that one day, while she was drying dishes, her mother asked why her thumb was swollen.</p>
        <p>16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weeks passed quickly. Lupe worked so hard that one day, while she was drying dishes, her mother asked why her thumb was swollen.</p>
        <p>17 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s muscle,” Lupe explained. “I’ve been practicing for the marbles championship.”</p>
        <p>18 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You, honey?” Her mother knew Lupe was no good at sports.</p>
        <p>19 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yeah. I beat Alfonso, and he’s pretty good.”</p>
        <p>20 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That night, over dinner, Mrs. Medrano said, “Honey, you should see Lupe’s thumb.”</p>
        <p>21 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Huh?” Mr. Medrano said, wiping his mouth and looking at his daughter.</p>
        <p>22 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Show your father.”</p>
        <p>23 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do I have to?” an embarrassed Lupe asked.</p>
        <p>24 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Go on, show your father.”</p>
        <p>25 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reluctantly, Lupe raised her hand and flexed her thumb. You could see the muscle.</p>
        <p>26 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father put down his fork and asked, “What happened?”</p>
        <p>27 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Dad, I’ve been working out. I’ve been squeezing an eraser.”</p>
        <p>28 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Why?”</p>
        <p>29 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I’m going to enter the marbles championship.”</p>
        <p>30 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her father looked at her mother and then back at his daughter. “When is it, honey?”</p>
        <p>31 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This Saturday. Can you come?”</p>
        <p>32 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father had been planning to play racquetball with a friend Saturday, but he said he would be there. He knew his daughter thought she was no good at sports and he wanted to encourage her. He even rigged some lights in the backyard so she could practice after dark. He squatted with one knee on the ground, entranced by the sight of his daughter easily beating her brother.</p>
        <p>33 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day of the championship began with a cold blustery sky. The sun was a silvery light behind slate clouds.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lupe Medrano, a shy girl who spoke in whispers, was the school’s spelling bee champion, winner of the reading contest at the public library three summers in a row, blue ribbon awardee in the science fair, the top student at her piano recital, and the playground grand champion in chess. She was a straight-A student and—not counting kindergarten, when she had been stung by a wasp—never missed one day of elementary school. She had received a small trophy for this honor and had been congratulated by the mayor.</p>
        <p>2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But though Lupe had a razor-sharp mind, she could not make her body, no matter how much she tried, run as fast as the other girls’. She begged her body to move faster, but could never beat anyone in the fifty-yard dash.</p>
        <p>3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth was that Lupe was no good in sports. She could not catch a pop-up or figure out in which direction to kick the soccer ball. One time she kicked the ball at her own goal and scored a point for the other team. She was no good at baseball or basketball either, and even had a hard time making a hula hoop stay on her hips.</p>
        <p>4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn’t until last year, when she was eleven years old, that she learned how to ride a bike. And even then she had to use training wheels. She could walk in the swimming pool but couldn’t swim, and chanced roller skating only when her father held her hand.</p>
        <p>5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I’ll never be good at sports,” she fumed one rainy day as she lay on her bed gazing at the shelf her father had made to hold her awards. “I wish I could win something, anything, even marbles.”</p>
        <p>6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the word “marbles,” she sat up. “That’s it. Maybe I could be good at playing marbles.” She hopped out of bed and rummaged through the closet until she found a can full of her brother’s marbles. She poured the rich glass treasure on her bed and picked five of the most beautiful marbles.</p>
        <p>7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smoothed her bedspread and practiced shooting, softly at first so that her aim would be accurate. The marble rolled from her thumb and clicked against the targeted marble. But the target wouldn’t budge. She tried again and again. Her aim became accurate, but the power from her thumb made the marble move only an inch or two. Then she realized that the bedspread was slowing the marbles. She also had to admit that her thumb was weaker than the neck of a newborn chick.</p>
        <p>8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked out the window. The rain was letting up, but the ground was too muddy to play. She sat cross-legged on the bed, rolling her five marbles between her palms. Yes, she thought, I could play marbles, and marbles is a sport. At that moment she realized that she had only two weeks to practice. The playground championship, the same one her brother had entered the previous year, was coming up. She had a lot to do.</p>
        <p>9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To strengthen her wrists, she decided to do twenty push-ups on her fingertips, five at a time. “One, two, three . . .” she groaned. By the end of the first set she was breathing hard, and her muscles burned from exhaustion. She did one more set and decided that was enough push-ups for the first day.</p>
        <p>10 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She squeezed a rubber eraser one hundred times, hoping it would strengthen her thumb. This seemed to work because the next day her thumb was sore. She could hardly hold a marble in her hand, let alone send it flying with power. So Lupe rested that day and listened to her brother, who gave her tips on how to shoot: get low, aim with one eye, and place one knuckle on the ground.</p>
        <p>11 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Think ‘eye and thumb’—and let it rip!” he said.</p>
        <p>12 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After school the next day she left her homework in her backpack and practiced three hours straight, taking time only to eat a candy bar for energy. With a popsicle stick, she drew an odd-shaped circle and tossed in four marbles. She used her shooter, a milky agate with hypnotic swirls, to blast them. Her thumb had become stronger.</p>
        <p>13 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After practice, she squeezed the eraser for an hour. She ate dinner with her left hand to spare her shooting hand and said nothing to her parents about her dreams of athletic glory.</p>
        <p>14 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Practice, practice, practice. Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze. Lupe got better and beat her brother and Alfonso, a neighbor kid who was supposed to be a champ.</p>
        <p>15 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Man, she’s bad!” Alfonso said. “She can beat the other girls for sure. I think.” The weeks passed quickly. Lupe worked so hard that one day, while she was drying dishes, her mother asked why her thumb was swollen.</p>
        <p>16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weeks passed quickly. Lupe worked so hard that one day, while she was drying dishes, her mother asked why her thumb was swollen.</p>
        <p>17 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s muscle,” Lupe explained. “I’ve been practicing for the marbles championship.”</p>
        <p>18 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You, honey?” Her mother knew Lupe was no good at sports.</p>
        <p>19 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yeah. I beat Alfonso, and he’s pretty good.”</p>
        <p>20 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That night, over dinner, Mrs. Medrano said, “Honey, you should see Lupe’s thumb.”</p>
        <p>21 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Huh?” Mr. Medrano said, wiping his mouth and looking at his daughter.</p>
        <p>22 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Show your father.”</p>
        <p>23 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do I have to?” an embarrassed Lupe asked.</p>
        <p>24 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Go on, show your father.”</p>
        <p>25 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reluctantly, Lupe raised her hand and flexed her thumb. You could see the muscle.</p>
        <p>26 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father put down his fork and asked, “What happened?”</p>
        <p>27 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Dad, I’ve been working out. I’ve been squeezing an eraser.”</p>
        <p>28 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Why?”</p>
        <p>29 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I’m going to enter the marbles championship.”</p>
        <p>30 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her father looked at her mother and then back at his daughter. “When is it, honey?”</p>
        <p>31 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This Saturday. Can you come?”</p>
        <p>32 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father had been planning to play racquetball with a friend Saturday, but he said he would be there. He knew his daughter thought she was no good at sports and he wanted to encourage her. He even rigged some lights in the backyard so she could practice after dark. He squatted with one knee on the ground, entranced by the sight of his daughter easily beating her brother.</p>
        <p>33 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day of the championship began with a cold blustery sky. The sun was a silvery light behind slate clouds.</p>
        <p>34 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I hope it clears up,” her father said, rubbing his hands together as he returned from getting the newspaper. They ate breakfast, paced nervously around the house waiting for 10:00 to arrive, and walked the two blocks to the playground (though Mr. Medrano wanted to drive so Lupe wouldn’t get tired). She signed up and was assigned her first match on baseball diamond number three.</p>
        <p>35 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lupe, walking between her brother and her father, shook from the cold, not nerves. She took off her mittens, and everyone stared at her thumb. Someone asked, “How can you play with a broken thumb?” Lupe smiled and said nothing.</p>
        <p>36 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She beat her first opponent easily, and felt sorry for the girl because she didn’t have anyone to cheer for her. Except for her sack of marbles, she was all alone. Lupe invited the girl, whose name was Rachel, to stay with them. She smiled and said, “OK.” The four of them walked to a card table in the middle of the outfield, where Lupe was assigned another opponent.</p>
        <p>37 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also beat this girl, a fifth-grader named Yolanda, and asked her to join their group. They proceeded to more matches and more wins, and soon there was a crowd of people following Lupe to the finals to play a girl in a baseball cap. This girl seemed dead serious. She never even looked at Lupe.</p>

          <strong>Red Dog and the Dreaded Cribbages</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back in the time when there were almost no houses and only two caravan parks in Karratha, Red Dog liked to call in on the caravans that belonged to his many friends and providers. He would expect to be washed, de-ticked, and fed, and then he would stay a couple of days until he felt like setting off on his travels once more.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Red Dog particularly liked one of the parks, because that was where his mate Red Cat lived, as well as Nancy and Patsy, but, and it was a big BUT, there was one small problem. Actually, the truth is that there were two big problems, and they were married to each other.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr and Mrs Cribbage were the caretakers of the caravan park. They lived off pigsnout sandwiches, sweet milky tea, and cigarettes, and it was their duty to keep the place tidy and neat. They would sort out any difficulties that people might have with water-supply or electricity. If the bulbs blew in the dunnies*, Mr Cribbage would sigh with irritation and change them. If Red Cat raided a bin and overturned it, it was Mrs Cribbage who would sigh with irritation and set it upright. This is all to say that they were fairly typical caretakers, who were seldom pleased when their leisure was interrupted by their jobs, or when their cups of tea had to be abandoned in mid-sip.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The unfortunate thing about Mr and Mrs Cribbage was that they were pernickety about enforcing the rules, even the stupid ones that any normal person would ignore, and one of these rules was ‘NO DOGS’.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first time that Mrs Cribbage met Red Dog, he was just about to scratch on the door of Patsy’s caravan. ‘Hey, you!’ she called, rushing up to him and waving a dishcloth in his face. ‘Be off with you! Shoo! Shoo!’</p>
        <p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Red Dog looked at this fat woman and her dishcloth, and decided that she was probably mad. He ignored her politely, and scratched once more on Patsy’s door.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘Off! Away!’ shouted Mrs Cribbage, and at that moment Patsy opened her door. She looked from the dog to the woman, and asked, ‘What’s up?’</p>
        <p>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘NO DOGS!’ announced Mrs Cribbage.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Patsy regarded her pityingly and told her, ‘This isn’t any old dog. This is Red Dog.’</p>
        <p>10&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘A dog’s a dog,’ replied Mrs Cribbage, ‘and I don’t care if it’s one of the Queen’s bloody corgis. This is a dog, and that’s that. NO DOGS.’ It occurred to Patsy that Mrs Cribbage’s voice sounded rather like a kookaburra.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘Red Dog has privileges,’ said Patsy. ‘Everyone knows that.’</p>
        <p>12&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘If you don’t get rid of that dog,’ said Mrs Cribbage, her voice rising still further, ‘you’ll have me and Mr Cribbage to answer to.’</p>
        <p>13&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘If you try to get rid of Red Dog, you’ll have the whole of the Pilbara to answer to,’ replied Nancy, ‘so if I were you I wouldn’t get my knickers in a knot.’</p>
        <p>14&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Cribbage huffed, ‘And if you don’t get rid of that dog, we’ll shoot it, and evict you too. So don’t say you didn’t get warned.’</p>
        <p>15&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Cribbage turned her back and walked away importantly, confident that she, and only she, was queen in this little kingdom. Over the next few days, however, she kept thinking that she saw Red Dog out of the corner of her eye, and she mentioned it several times to Mr Cribbage, who was a small man with a toothbrush moustache rather like Hitler’s. His moustache and his fingers were a nasty shade of yellowy-brown, rather like a pub ceiling, because he liked to smoke all the time, rolling himself tiny, tight little cigarettes. When he finished smoking one, he would open the butt-end and take out the unsmoked tobacco so that he could use it again in another cigarette. He had become hollow-chested, and you always knew when he was coming, because of his perpetual dry cough.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp;&nbsp; The couple went into Dampier and bought a stencil from the stationer’s in the mall, and then they spent a happy morning making lots of notices and signboards that said ‘NO DOGS’. These they stuck up on every available tree in the caravan park, after which they felt that they had done a good day’s work indeed. The people in the park shook their heads, and agreed that from now on they would have a coded alarm, so that the caretakers would never catch them out when Red Dog was about. Patsy proposed that their code-word should be ‘pussycats’, and this was soon adopted. Mr and Mrs Cribbage wondered for quite a while why it was that people shouted ‘pussycats’, without provocation, every time that they passed by with their buckets and bins. ‘I reckon they’re all barking mad,’ observed Mr Cribbage.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘Talking of barking, I still keep seeing that dog,’ said his wife.</p>

          <strong>Red Dog and the Dreaded Cribbages</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back in the time when there were almost no houses and only two caravan parks in Karratha, Red Dog liked to call in on the caravans that belonged to his many friends and providers. He would expect to be washed, de-ticked, and fed, and then he would stay a couple of days until he felt like setting off on his travels once more.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Red Dog particularly liked one of the parks, because that was where his mate Red Cat lived, as well as Nancy and Patsy, but, and it was a big BUT, there was one small problem. Actually, the truth is that there were two big problems, and they were married to each other.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr and Mrs Cribbage were the caretakers of the caravan park. They lived off pigsnout sandwiches, sweet milky tea, and cigarettes, and it was their duty to keep the place tidy and neat. They would sort out any difficulties that people might have with water-supply or electricity. If the bulbs blew in the dunnies*, Mr Cribbage would sigh with irritation and change them. If Red Cat raided a bin and overturned it, it was Mrs Cribbage who would sigh with irritation and set it upright. This is all to say that they were fairly typical caretakers, who were seldom pleased when their leisure was interrupted by their jobs, or when their cups of tea had to be abandoned in mid-sip.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The unfortunate thing about Mr and Mrs Cribbage was that they were pernickety about enforcing the rules, even the stupid ones that any normal person would ignore, and one of these rules was ‘NO DOGS’.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first time that Mrs Cribbage met Red Dog, he was just about to scratch on the door of Patsy’s caravan. ‘Hey, you!’ she called, rushing up to him and waving a dishcloth in his face. ‘Be off with you! Shoo! Shoo!’</p>
        <p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Red Dog looked at this fat woman and her dishcloth, and decided that she was probably mad. He ignored her politely, and scratched once more on Patsy’s door.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘Off! Away!’ shouted Mrs Cribbage, and at that moment Patsy opened her door. She looked from the dog to the woman, and asked, ‘What’s up?’</p>
        <p>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘NO DOGS!’ announced Mrs Cribbage.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Patsy regarded her pityingly and told her, ‘This isn’t any old dog. This is Red Dog.’</p>
        <p>10&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘A dog’s a dog,’ replied Mrs Cribbage, ‘and I don’t care if it’s one of the Queen’s bloody corgis. This is a dog, and that’s that. NO DOGS.’ It occurred to Patsy that Mrs Cribbage’s voice sounded rather like a kookaburra.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘Red Dog has privileges,’ said Patsy. ‘Everyone knows that.’</p>
        <p>12&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘If you don’t get rid of that dog,’ said Mrs Cribbage, her voice rising still further, ‘you’ll have me and Mr Cribbage to answer to.’</p>
        <p>13&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘If you try to get rid of Red Dog, you’ll have the whole of the Pilbara to answer to,’ replied Nancy, ‘so if I were you I wouldn’t get my knickers in a knot.’</p>
        <p>14&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Cribbage huffed, ‘And if you don’t get rid of that dog, we’ll shoot it, and evict you too. So don’t say you didn’t get warned.’</p>
        <p>15&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Cribbage turned her back and walked away importantly, confident that she, and only she, was queen in this little kingdom. Over the next few days, however, she kept thinking that she saw Red Dog out of the corner of her eye, and she mentioned it several times to Mr Cribbage, who was a small man with a toothbrush moustache rather like Hitler’s. His moustache and his fingers were a nasty shade of yellowy-brown, rather like a pub ceiling, because he liked to smoke all the time, rolling himself tiny, tight little cigarettes. When he finished smoking one, he would open the butt-end and take out the unsmoked tobacco so that he could use it again in another cigarette. He had become hollow-chested, and you always knew when he was coming, because of his perpetual dry cough.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp;&nbsp; The couple went into Dampier and bought a stencil from the stationer’s in the mall, and then they spent a happy morning making lots of notices and signboards that said ‘NO DOGS’. These they stuck up on every available tree in the caravan park, after which they felt that they had done a good day’s work indeed. The people in the park shook their heads, and agreed that from now on they would have a coded alarm, so that the caretakers would never catch them out when Red Dog was about. Patsy proposed that their code-word should be ‘pussycats’, and this was soon adopted. Mr and Mrs Cribbage wondered for quite a while why it was that people shouted ‘pussycats’, without provocation, every time that they passed by with their buckets and bins. ‘I reckon they’re all barking mad,’ observed Mr Cribbage.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘Talking of barking, I still keep seeing that dog,’ said his wife.</p>

          <strong>Red Dog and the Dreaded Cribbages</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back in the time when there were almost no houses and only two caravan parks in Karratha, Red Dog liked to call in on the caravans that belonged to his many friends and providers. He would expect to be washed, de-ticked, and fed, and then he would stay a couple of days until he felt like setting off on his travels once more.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Red Dog particularly liked one of the parks, because that was where his mate Red Cat lived, as well as Nancy and Patsy, but, and it was a big BUT, there was one small problem. Actually, the truth is that there were two big problems, and they were married to each other.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr and Mrs Cribbage were the caretakers of the caravan park. They lived off pigsnout sandwiches, sweet milky tea, and cigarettes, and it was their duty to keep the place tidy and neat. They would sort out any difficulties that people might have with water-supply or electricity. If the bulbs blew in the dunnies*, Mr Cribbage would sigh with irritation and change them. If Red Cat raided a bin and overturned it, it was Mrs Cribbage who would sigh with irritation and set it upright. This is all to say that they were fairly typical caretakers, who were seldom pleased when their leisure was interrupted by their jobs, or when their cups of tea had to be abandoned in mid-sip.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The unfortunate thing about Mr and Mrs Cribbage was that they were pernickety about enforcing the rules, even the stupid ones that any normal person would ignore, and one of these rules was ‘NO DOGS’.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first time that Mrs Cribbage met Red Dog, he was just about to scratch on the door of Patsy’s caravan. ‘Hey, you!’ she called, rushing up to him and waving a dishcloth in his face. ‘Be off with you! Shoo! Shoo!’</p>
        <p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Red Dog looked at this fat woman and her dishcloth, and decided that she was probably mad. He ignored her politely, and scratched once more on Patsy’s door.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘Off! Away!’ shouted Mrs Cribbage, and at that moment Patsy opened her door. She looked from the dog to the woman, and asked, ‘What’s up?’</p>
        <p>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘NO DOGS!’ announced Mrs Cribbage.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Patsy regarded her pityingly and told her, ‘This isn’t any old dog. This is Red Dog.’</p>
        <p>10&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘A dog’s a dog,’ replied Mrs Cribbage, ‘and I don’t care if it’s one of the Queen’s bloody corgis. This is a dog, and that’s that. NO DOGS.’ It occurred to Patsy that Mrs Cribbage’s voice sounded rather like a kookaburra.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘Red Dog has privileges,’ said Patsy. ‘Everyone knows that.’</p>
        <p>12&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘If you don’t get rid of that dog,’ said Mrs Cribbage, her voice rising still further, ‘you’ll have me and Mr Cribbage to answer to.’</p>
        <p>13&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘If you try to get rid of Red Dog, you’ll have the whole of the Pilbara to answer to,’ replied Nancy, ‘so if I were you I wouldn’t get my knickers in a knot.’</p>
        <p>14&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Cribbage huffed, ‘And if you don’t get rid of that dog, we’ll shoot it, and evict you too. So don’t say you didn’t get warned.’</p>
        <p>15&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Cribbage turned her back and walked away importantly, confident that she, and only she, was queen in this little kingdom. Over the next few days, however, she kept thinking that she saw Red Dog out of the corner of her eye, and she mentioned it several times to Mr Cribbage, who was a small man with a toothbrush moustache rather like Hitler’s. His moustache and his fingers were a nasty shade of yellowy-brown, rather like a pub ceiling, because he liked to smoke all the time, rolling himself tiny, tight little cigarettes. When he finished smoking one, he would open the butt-end and take out the unsmoked tobacco so that he could use it again in another cigarette. He had become hollow-chested, and you always knew when he was coming, because of his perpetual dry cough.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp;&nbsp; The couple went into Dampier and bought a stencil from the stationer’s in the mall, and then they spent a happy morning making lots of notices and signboards that said ‘NO DOGS’. These they stuck up on every available tree in the caravan park, after which they felt that they had done a good day’s work indeed. The people in the park shook their heads, and agreed that from now on they would have a coded alarm, so that the caretakers would never catch them out when Red Dog was about. Patsy proposed that their code-word should be ‘pussycats’, and this was soon adopted. Mr and Mrs Cribbage wondered for quite a while why it was that people shouted ‘pussycats’, without provocation, every time that they passed by with their buckets and bins. ‘I reckon they’re all barking mad,’ observed Mr Cribbage.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘Talking of barking, I still keep seeing that dog,’ said his wife.</p>

          <strong>Red Dog and the Dreaded Cribbages</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back in the time when there were almost no houses and only two caravan parks in Karratha, Red Dog liked to call in on the caravans that belonged to his many friends and providers. He would expect to be washed, de-ticked, and fed, and then he would stay a couple of days until he felt like setting off on his travels once more.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Red Dog particularly liked one of the parks, because that was where his mate Red Cat lived, as well as Nancy and Patsy, but, and it was a big BUT, there was one small problem. Actually, the truth is that there were two big problems, and they were married to each other.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr and Mrs Cribbage were the caretakers of the caravan park. They lived off pigsnout sandwiches, sweet milky tea, and cigarettes, and it was their duty to keep the place tidy and neat. They would sort out any difficulties that people might have with water-supply or electricity. If the bulbs blew in the dunnies*, Mr Cribbage would sigh with irritation and change them. If Red Cat raided a bin and overturned it, it was Mrs Cribbage who would sigh with irritation and set it upright. This is all to say that they were fairly typical caretakers, who were seldom pleased when their leisure was interrupted by their jobs, or when their cups of tea had to be abandoned in mid-sip.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The unfortunate thing about Mr and Mrs Cribbage was that they were pernickety about enforcing the rules, even the stupid ones that any normal person would ignore, and one of these rules was ‘NO DOGS’.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first time that Mrs Cribbage met Red Dog, he was just about to scratch on the door of Patsy’s caravan. ‘Hey, you!’ she called, rushing up to him and waving a dishcloth in his face. ‘Be off with you! Shoo! Shoo!’</p>
        <p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Red Dog looked at this fat woman and her dishcloth, and decided that she was probably mad. He ignored her politely, and scratched once more on Patsy’s door.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘Off! Away!’ shouted Mrs Cribbage, and at that moment Patsy opened her door. She looked from the dog to the woman, and asked, ‘What’s up?’</p>
        <p>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘NO DOGS!’ announced Mrs Cribbage.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Patsy regarded her pityingly and told her, ‘This isn’t any old dog. This is Red Dog.’</p>
        <p>10&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘A dog’s a dog,’ replied Mrs Cribbage, ‘and I don’t care if it’s one of the Queen’s bloody corgis. This is a dog, and that’s that. NO DOGS.’ It occurred to Patsy that Mrs Cribbage’s voice sounded rather like a kookaburra.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘Red Dog has privileges,’ said Patsy. ‘Everyone knows that.’</p>
        <p>12&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘If you don’t get rid of that dog,’ said Mrs Cribbage, her voice rising still further, ‘you’ll have me and Mr Cribbage to answer to.’</p>
        <p>13&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘If you try to get rid of Red Dog, you’ll have the whole of the Pilbara to answer to,’ replied Nancy, ‘so if I were you I wouldn’t get my knickers in a knot.’</p>
        <p>14&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Cribbage huffed, ‘And if you don’t get rid of that dog, we’ll shoot it, and evict you too. So don’t say you didn’t get warned.’</p>
        <p>15&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Cribbage turned her back and walked away importantly, confident that she, and only she, was queen in this little kingdom. Over the next few days, however, she kept thinking that she saw Red Dog out of the corner of her eye, and she mentioned it several times to Mr Cribbage, who was a small man with a toothbrush moustache rather like Hitler’s. His moustache and his fingers were a nasty shade of yellowy-brown, rather like a pub ceiling, because he liked to smoke all the time, rolling himself tiny, tight little cigarettes. When he finished smoking one, he would open the butt-end and take out the unsmoked tobacco so that he could use it again in another cigarette. He had become hollow-chested, and you always knew when he was coming, because of his perpetual dry cough.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp;&nbsp; The couple went into Dampier and bought a stencil from the stationer’s in the mall, and then they spent a happy morning making lots of notices and signboards that said ‘NO DOGS’. These they stuck up on every available tree in the caravan park, after which they felt that they had done a good day’s work indeed. The people in the park shook their heads, and agreed that from now on they would have a coded alarm, so that the caretakers would never catch them out when Red Dog was about. Patsy proposed that their code-word should be ‘pussycats’, and this was soon adopted. Mr and Mrs Cribbage wondered for quite a while why it was that people shouted ‘pussycats’, without provocation, every time that they passed by with their buckets and bins. ‘I reckon they’re all barking mad,’ observed Mr Cribbage.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp;&nbsp; ‘Talking of barking, I still keep seeing that dog,’ said his wife.</p>
