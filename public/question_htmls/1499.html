          <strong>History of London&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>London is situated on the banks of the River Thames. It is the seat of the Government of the United Kingdom and the country’s financial centre. The city has used its privileged location in south-eastern England to its advantage, having always been a densely populated and wealthy area. <strong>15 ………. </strong>Whitehall is lined with government departments and ministries. To the north, Trafalgar Square marks the beginning of London’s West End, an area with a great night life. Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, Westminster Cathedral and Westminster Palace are found in these two areas.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The city of London was founded by the Romans and their rule extended from 43 AD to the fifth century AD, when the Empire fell. During the third century, Londinium, the Roman town, had a population of 50,000, mainly due to the influence of its major port. <strong>16 ………. </strong>During the eighth century it became the capital of the Kingdom of Essex. During the ninth century, the town suffered numerous Viking attacks, but then Danish settlers arrived in the area, encouraging trade and opening businesses in the town, transforming it into the first urban centre of England. The town’s wealth and power attracted the Danish Great Heathen Army, which besieged the city until it was captured by King Alfred the Great in 886.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In 1067, after the Norman invasion of England, the newly crowned King of England, William Duke of Normandy established the city's existing rights, laws and privileges, and the Tower of London was built. <strong>17 ………. </strong>For many years, England had no capital city, but the institutions of central government were moved to Westminster, close to London. This and the rise of trade in the area were two decisive factors in London's emergence as the capital of England.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>During the fourteenth century, London’s port became a European hub for the distribution of goods. This was strengthened during the fifteenth century by its textile industry. From the sixteenth to mid-seventeenth century, London benefited from its maritime trade expansion. During Henry VIII’s reign, London had 100,000 inhabitants. In mid-seventeenth century it had over 500,000. In 1665, the city was still held inside the ancient walls although large-scale urban planning had already started. The population’s poor living conditions were responsible for the Great Plague, killing 70,000 people, and the following year, a huge fire burnt down most of the city. <strong>18 ……….</strong> The architect Christopher Wren’s masterpieces such as St. Paul’s Cathedral increased the appeal of London, and thus the capital became the centre of English social life with palaces, halls, theatres, societies (Royal Society, 1662) and museums (British Museum, 1753)</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>London continued to grow thanks to the foundation of the Bank of England in 1694. It was the second central bank in the world, rapidly following the Swedish Sveriges Riksbank, and arguably the most successful. It provided the financial flexibility which would be the foundation of the empire's power and whose vestiges can be seen today in London's preeminence as a financial centre. Most of current London is from the Victorian period. The Industrial Revolution drew millions of people to London, expanding the city. <strong>19 ………. </strong>Another was the great stink of 1858, with the hottest months of summer, worsening the smell of the sewers dumped in the River Thames, which even led to the suspension of the parliament.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>From 1750, the population increased from 700,000 to over 4,500,000 in 1901. <strong>20 ……….</strong> The administrative needs of a city with so much commercial activity led the creation of a new autonomous territorial unit in 1888, the County of London, ruled by the "London county council". This county was divided into twenty-nine electoral units (the city and 28 metropolitan boroughs), but the progressive expansion soon overflowed outside the county boundaries to the suburban areas. After a steady period, the population of the capital began to decline at the end of World War I and fell below 3.5 million by 1950. In contrast, the suburban area grew steadily. In 1963 a new division of London was made, comprising the old town and 32 metropolitan boroughs, and these are the divisions which can be seen today.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>History of London&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>London is situated on the banks of the River Thames. It is the seat of the Government of the United Kingdom and the country’s financial centre. The city has used its privileged location in south-eastern England to its advantage, having always been a densely populated and wealthy area. <strong>15 ………. </strong>Whitehall is lined with government departments and ministries. To the north, Trafalgar Square marks the beginning of London’s West End, an area with a great night life. Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, Westminster Cathedral and Westminster Palace are found in these two areas.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The city of London was founded by the Romans and their rule extended from 43 AD to the fifth century AD, when the Empire fell. During the third century, Londinium, the Roman town, had a population of 50,000, mainly due to the influence of its major port. <strong>16 ………. </strong>During the eighth century it became the capital of the Kingdom of Essex. During the ninth century, the town suffered numerous Viking attacks, but then Danish settlers arrived in the area, encouraging trade and opening businesses in the town, transforming it into the first urban centre of England. The town’s wealth and power attracted the Danish Great Heathen Army, which besieged the city until it was captured by King Alfred the Great in 886.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In 1067, after the Norman invasion of England, the newly crowned King of England, William Duke of Normandy established the city's existing rights, laws and privileges, and the Tower of London was built. <strong>17 ………. </strong>For many years, England had no capital city, but the institutions of central government were moved to Westminster, close to London. This and the rise of trade in the area were two decisive factors in London's emergence as the capital of England.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>During the fourteenth century, London’s port became a European hub for the distribution of goods. This was strengthened during the fifteenth century by its textile industry. From the sixteenth to mid-seventeenth century, London benefited from its maritime trade expansion. During Henry VIII’s reign, London had 100,000 inhabitants. In mid-seventeenth century it had over 500,000. In 1665, the city was still held inside the ancient walls although large-scale urban planning had already started. The population’s poor living conditions were responsible for the Great Plague, killing 70,000 people, and the following year, a huge fire burnt down most of the city. <strong>18 ……….</strong> The architect Christopher Wren’s masterpieces such as St. Paul’s Cathedral increased the appeal of London, and thus the capital became the centre of English social life with palaces, halls, theatres, societies (Royal Society, 1662) and museums (British Museum, 1753)</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>London continued to grow thanks to the foundation of the Bank of England in 1694. It was the second central bank in the world, rapidly following the Swedish Sveriges Riksbank, and arguably the most successful. It provided the financial flexibility which would be the foundation of the empire's power and whose vestiges can be seen today in London's preeminence as a financial centre. Most of current London is from the Victorian period. The Industrial Revolution drew millions of people to London, expanding the city. <strong>19 ………. </strong>Another was the great stink of 1858, with the hottest months of summer, worsening the smell of the sewers dumped in the River Thames, which even led to the suspension of the parliament.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>From 1750, the population increased from 700,000 to over 4,500,000 in 1901. <strong>20 ……….</strong> The administrative needs of a city with so much commercial activity led the creation of a new autonomous territorial unit in 1888, the County of London, ruled by the "London county council". This county was divided into twenty-nine electoral units (the city and 28 metropolitan boroughs), but the progressive expansion soon overflowed outside the county boundaries to the suburban areas. After a steady period, the population of the capital began to decline at the end of World War I and fell below 3.5 million by 1950. In contrast, the suburban area grew steadily. In 1963 a new division of London was made, comprising the old town and 32 metropolitan boroughs, and these are the divisions which can be seen today.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>The city of London was founded by the Romans and their rule extended from 43 AD to the fifth century AD, when the Empire fell. During the third century, Londinium, the Roman town, had a population of 50,000, mainly due to the influence of its major port. <strong>16 ………. </strong>During the eighth century it became the capital of the Kingdom of Essex. During the ninth century, the town suffered numerous Viking attacks, but then Danish settlers arrived in the area, encouraging trade and opening businesses in the town, transforming it into the first urban centre of England. The town’s wealth and power attracted the Danish Great Heathen Army, which besieged the city until it was captured by King Alfred the Great in 886.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In 1067, after the Norman invasion of England, the newly crowned King of England, William Duke of Normandy established the city's existing rights, laws and privileges, and the Tower of London was built. <strong>17 ………. </strong>For many years, England had no capital city, but the institutions of central government were moved to Westminster, close to London. This and the rise of trade in the area were two decisive factors in London's emergence as the capital of England.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>During the fourteenth century, London’s port became a European hub for the distribution of goods. This was strengthened during the fifteenth century by its textile industry. From the sixteenth to mid-seventeenth century, London benefited from its maritime trade expansion. During Henry VIII’s reign, London had 100,000 inhabitants. In mid-seventeenth century it had over 500,000. In 1665, the city was still held inside the ancient walls although large-scale urban planning had already started. The population’s poor living conditions were responsible for the Great Plague, killing 70,000 people, and the following year, a huge fire burnt down most of the city. <strong>18 ……….</strong> The architect Christopher Wren’s masterpieces such as St. Paul’s Cathedral increased the appeal of London, and thus the capital became the centre of English social life with palaces, halls, theatres, societies (Royal Society, 1662) and museums (British Museum, 1753)</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>London continued to grow thanks to the foundation of the Bank of England in 1694. It was the second central bank in the world, rapidly following the Swedish Sveriges Riksbank, and arguably the most successful. It provided the financial flexibility which would be the foundation of the empire's power and whose vestiges can be seen today in London's preeminence as a financial centre. Most of current London is from the Victorian period. The Industrial Revolution drew millions of people to London, expanding the city. <strong>19 ………. </strong>Another was the great stink of 1858, with the hottest months of summer, worsening the smell of the sewers dumped in the River Thames, which even led to the suspension of the parliament.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>From 1750, the population increased from 700,000 to over 4,500,000 in 1901. <strong>20 ……….</strong> The administrative needs of a city with so much commercial activity led the creation of a new autonomous territorial unit in 1888, the County of London, ruled by the "London county council". This county was divided into twenty-nine electoral units (the city and 28 metropolitan boroughs), but the progressive expansion soon overflowed outside the county boundaries to the suburban areas. After a steady period, the population of the capital began to decline at the end of World War I and fell below 3.5 million by 1950. In contrast, the suburban area grew steadily. In 1963 a new division of London was made, comprising the old town and 32 metropolitan boroughs, and these are the divisions which can be seen today.&nbsp;</p>

At the tail end of 1963 in America, the Beach Boys were playing on the radio, the Vietnam War had begun to draw in US involvement, high school kids were on their Christmas break and two teenagers were planning an experiment that would capture the nation’s attention. It ended on 8 January 1964; 17-year-old Randy Gardner had managed to stay awake for 11 days and 25 minutes. Bruce McAllister, one of the high school students who came up with the idea, says it stemmed from the simple need to come up with a science fair project. We decided on the effect of sleep deprivation on cognitive abilities, such as performance on the basketball court. Randy’s results from the hospital were sent off to Arizona to be studied. McAllister says the results concluded that “his brain had been catnapping the entire time… parts of it would be asleep parts of it would be awake.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
A number of people tried to break Gardner’s record for the longest time anyone had stayed awake in the following years – but the Guinness Book of Records stopped&nbsp;certifying attempts, believing it could be dangerous to people's health. The boy who hadn’t slept for 11 days somehow managed to be philosophical about his endeavour. “It’s just mind over matter,” he said.&nbsp;<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
When thinking about getting the sleep you need, it’s normal to focus on how many hours of sleep you get. While sleep duration is undoubtedly important, it’s not the only part of the equation. It’s also critical to think about sleep quality and whether the time spent sleeping is actually restorative. Progressing smoothly multiple times through the sleep cycle (composed of four separate sleep stages) is a vital part of getting truly high-quality rest. Each sleep stage plays a part in allowing your mind and body to wake up refreshed. Understanding the sleep cycle also helps explain how certain sleep disorders, including insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea can impact a person’s sleep and health. Sleep is not uniform. Instead, over the course of the night, your total sleep is made up of several rounds of the sleep cycle. On average, each cycle lasts about 90 minutes. There are four sleep stages in a cycle; one for rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and three that form nonREM (NREM) sleep, N1, N2 and lastly, N3, which is the deep sleep stage.&nbsp;<br>

In Johannesburg, in the late 1980s, when he was 12-years old, Martin Pistorius fell into a coma where he remained in a vegetative state for 12 years. Doctors in South Africa were not sure what caused his illness, but suspect it was cryptococcal meningitis. His condition grew worse and eventually he lost all ability to move and speak and make eye contact with his family.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Physicians said he would die, but his family proceeded with a routine. Every morning his father would get up at 5 a.m., dress Martin and take him to the care centre. At the end of the day, he’d give him a bath, feed him dinner and put him to bed. His parents set an alarm to go off every two hours to turn Martin’s body, so he wouldn’t get bed sores. It was their life for 12 years.<br>
<br>
Today, Martin is able to talk again. He uses a computer to speak and is mobile with a wheelchair. His awareness has fully returned. In his book, ‘Ghost Boy: My Escape from A Life Locked Inside My Own Body’, Martin tells what he remembers from those 12 years. He says he thinks he began to wake up about two years into his coma. He remembers many things from that time, when everyone around him thought he couldn’t hear them and thought he didn’t know what was going on. “Everyone was so used to me not being there that they didn’t notice when I began to be present again,” he told National Public Radio. Stuck in his body, without the ability to move or communicate, he felt doomed. “It was especially bad when the care centre would sit patients in front of the television all day, to ‘watch’ children’s shows.” Martin said that he cannot even express how much he hated ‘Barney’, the purple dinosaur show.<br>

Scientific research makes clear that sleep is essential at any age. Sleep powers the mind, restores the body, and fortifies virtually every system in the body. But how much sleep do we really need in order to get these benefits? National Sleep Foundation guidelines advise that healthy adults need between 7 and 9 hours of sleep per night. Babies, young children, and teens need even more sleep to enable their growth and development. People over 65 should also get 7 to 8 hours of sleep per night. Knowing the general recommendations for how much sleep you need is a first step. Then it’s important to reflect on your individual needs based on factors like your activity level and overall health. And finally, of course, it’s necessary to apply healthy sleep tips, so that you can actually get the full night’s sleep that’s recommended.<br>

At the tail end of 1963 in America, the Beach Boys were playing on the radio, the Vietnam War had begun to draw in US involvement, high school kids were on their Christmas break and two teenagers were planning an experiment that would capture the nation’s attention. It ended on 8 January 1964; 17-year-old Randy Gardner had managed to stay awake for 11 days and 25 minutes. Bruce McAllister, one of the high school students who came up with the idea, says it stemmed from the simple need to come up with a science fair project. We decided on the effect of sleep deprivation on cognitive abilities, such as performance on the basketball court. Randy’s results from the hospital were sent off to Arizona to be studied. McAllister says the results concluded that “his brain had been catnapping the entire time… parts of it would be asleep parts of it would be awake.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
A number of people tried to break Gardner’s record for the longest time anyone had stayed awake in the following years – but the Guinness Book of Records stopped&nbsp;certifying attempts, believing it could be dangerous to people's health. The boy who hadn’t slept for 11 days somehow managed to be philosophical about his endeavour. “It’s just mind over matter,” he said.&nbsp;<br>

When thinking about getting the sleep you need, it’s normal to focus on how many hours of sleep you get. While sleep duration is undoubtedly important, it’s not the only part of the equation. It’s also critical to think about sleep quality and whether the time spent sleeping is actually restorative. Progressing smoothly multiple times through the sleep cycle (composed of four separate sleep stages) is a vital part of getting truly high-quality rest. Each sleep stage plays a part in allowing your mind and body to wake up refreshed. Understanding the sleep cycle also helps explain how certain sleep disorders, including insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea can impact a person’s sleep and health. Sleep is not uniform. Instead, over the course of the night, your total sleep is made up of several rounds of the sleep cycle. On average, each cycle lasts about 90 minutes. There are four sleep stages in a cycle; one for rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and three that form nonREM (NREM) sleep, N1, N2 and lastly, N3, which is the deep sleep stage.&nbsp;<br>

In Johannesburg, in the late 1980s, when he was 12-years old, Martin Pistorius fell into a coma where he remained in a vegetative state for 12 years. Doctors in South Africa were not sure what caused his illness, but suspect it was cryptococcal meningitis. His condition grew worse and eventually he lost all ability to move and speak and make eye contact with his family.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Physicians said he would die, but his family proceeded with a routine. Every morning his father would get up at 5 a.m., dress Martin and take him to the care centre. At the end of the day, he’d give him a bath, feed him dinner and put him to bed. His parents set an alarm to go off every two hours to turn Martin’s body, so he wouldn’t get bed sores. It was their life for 12 years.<br>
<br>
Today, Martin is able to talk again. He uses a computer to speak and is mobile with a wheelchair. His awareness has fully returned. In his book, ‘Ghost Boy: My Escape from A Life Locked Inside My Own Body’, Martin tells what he remembers from those 12 years. He says he thinks he began to wake up about two years into his coma. He remembers many things from that time, when everyone around him thought he couldn’t hear them and thought he didn’t know what was going on. “Everyone was so used to me not being there that they didn’t notice when I began to be present again,” he told National Public Radio. Stuck in his body, without the ability to move or communicate, he felt doomed. “It was especially bad when the care centre would sit patients in front of the television all day, to ‘watch’ children’s shows.” Martin said that he cannot even express how much he hated ‘Barney’, the purple dinosaur show.<br>

Scientific research makes clear that sleep is essential at any age. Sleep powers the mind, restores the body, and fortifies virtually every system in the body. But how much sleep do we really need in order to get these benefits? National Sleep Foundation guidelines advise that healthy adults need between 7 and 9 hours of sleep per night. Babies, young children, and teens need even more sleep to enable their growth and development. People over 65 should also get 7 to 8 hours of sleep per night. Knowing the general recommendations for how much sleep you need is a first step. Then it’s important to reflect on your individual needs based on factors like your activity level and overall health. And finally, of course, it’s necessary to apply healthy sleep tips, so that you can actually get the full night’s sleep that’s recommended.<br>

At the tail end of 1963 in America, the Beach Boys were playing on the radio, the Vietnam War had begun to draw in US involvement, high school kids were on their Christmas break and two teenagers were planning an experiment that would capture the nation’s attention. It ended on 8 January 1964; 17-year-old Randy Gardner had managed to stay awake for 11 days and 25 minutes. Bruce McAllister, one of the high school students who came up with the idea, says it stemmed from the simple need to come up with a science fair project. We decided on the effect of sleep deprivation on cognitive abilities, such as performance on the basketball court. Randy’s results from the hospital were sent off to Arizona to be studied. McAllister says the results concluded that “his brain had been catnapping the entire time… parts of it would be asleep parts of it would be awake.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
A number of people tried to break Gardner’s record for the longest time anyone had stayed awake in the following years – but the Guinness Book of Records stopped&nbsp;certifying attempts, believing it could be dangerous to people's health. The boy who hadn’t slept for 11 days somehow managed to be philosophical about his endeavour. “It’s just mind over matter,” he said.&nbsp;<br>

When thinking about getting the sleep you need, it’s normal to focus on how many hours of sleep you get. While sleep duration is undoubtedly important, it’s not the only part of the equation. It’s also critical to think about sleep quality and whether the time spent sleeping is actually restorative. Progressing smoothly multiple times through the sleep cycle (composed of four separate sleep stages) is a vital part of getting truly high-quality rest. Each sleep stage plays a part in allowing your mind and body to wake up refreshed. Understanding the sleep cycle also helps explain how certain sleep disorders, including insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea can impact a person’s sleep and health. Sleep is not uniform. Instead, over the course of the night, your total sleep is made up of several rounds of the sleep cycle. On average, each cycle lasts about 90 minutes. There are four sleep stages in a cycle; one for rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and three that form nonREM (NREM) sleep, N1, N2 and lastly, N3, which is the deep sleep stage.&nbsp;<br>

In Johannesburg, in the late 1980s, when he was 12-years old, Martin Pistorius fell into a coma where he remained in a vegetative state for 12 years. Doctors in South Africa were not sure what caused his illness, but suspect it was cryptococcal meningitis. His condition grew worse and eventually he lost all ability to move and speak and make eye contact with his family.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Physicians said he would die, but his family proceeded with a routine. Every morning his father would get up at 5 a.m., dress Martin and take him to the care centre. At the end of the day, he’d give him a bath, feed him dinner and put him to bed. His parents set an alarm to go off every two hours to turn Martin’s body, so he wouldn’t get bed sores. It was their life for 12 years.<br>
<br>
Today, Martin is able to talk again. He uses a computer to speak and is mobile with a wheelchair. His awareness has fully returned. In his book, ‘Ghost Boy: My Escape from A Life Locked Inside My Own Body’, Martin tells what he remembers from those 12 years. He says he thinks he began to wake up about two years into his coma. He remembers many things from that time, when everyone around him thought he couldn’t hear them and thought he didn’t know what was going on. “Everyone was so used to me not being there that they didn’t notice when I began to be present again,” he told National Public Radio. Stuck in his body, without the ability to move or communicate, he felt doomed. “It was especially bad when the care centre would sit patients in front of the television all day, to ‘watch’ children’s shows.” Martin said that he cannot even express how much he hated ‘Barney’, the purple dinosaur show.<br>

Scientific research makes clear that sleep is essential at any age. Sleep powers the mind, restores the body, and fortifies virtually every system in the body. But how much sleep do we really need in order to get these benefits? National Sleep Foundation guidelines advise that healthy adults need between 7 and 9 hours of sleep per night. Babies, young children, and teens need even more sleep to enable their growth and development. People over 65 should also get 7 to 8 hours of sleep per night. Knowing the general recommendations for how much sleep you need is a first step. Then it’s important to reflect on your individual needs based on factors like your activity level and overall health. And finally, of course, it’s necessary to apply healthy sleep tips, so that you can actually get the full night’s sleep that’s recommended.<br>

        <p>After a while Ryl made her way to the dining-car. Dusty had brought sandwiches with him, and refused to indulge himself in a formal dinner.</p>
        <p>“That’s nothing but a waste of money,” he grumbled to her.&nbsp;</p>
