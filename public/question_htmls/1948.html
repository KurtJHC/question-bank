          <strong>Rescue at Pea Island</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Tracey E. Fern</em>
        </p>
        <p>Station Keeper Richard Etheridge peered from the lookout tower of the Pea Island life-saving station. Fog swirled around his face, and it was pitch-dark. Huge waves crashed onto the beach, and hurricane-force winds hurled sand and sea spray into the air.</p>
        <p>On that night back in October 1896, the worst storm in almost fifty years was battering the North Carolina coast. Moments earlier, one of Etheridge’s surfmen, Theodore Meekins, had spotted a faint red glimmer in the distance. Could it have been a flare from a ship in distress?</p>
        <p>Etheridge quickly lit a flare and held it high over his head until the flame died out. Then he saw it—a dull red light flickered to the south. That could mean only one thing: shipwreck.</p>
        <p><strong>The Keeper of the Station</strong><br>
Rescuing ships in distress was nothing new for Etheridge. He had been keeper of this life-saving station since 1880. Etheridge had grown up swimming, fishing, and boating on nearby Roanoke Island. He eventually became known as one of the best surfmen and lifesavers in North Carolina. But Etheridge was also known for something else: he was the Life-Saving Service’s first African American station chief.</p>
        <p>White surfmen refused to work under Etheridge. So Etheridge and the Life-Saving Service recruited a crew of African American rescuers to work with him.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Etheridge’s men trained for ten hours a day, seven days a week. They swam in the rough surf and patrolled the beach. They performed life-saving drills and tugged their 1,500-pound surfboat and equipment for miles through the sand. But the wreck on the night of October 1896 put all of the crew’s practice to the test.</p>
        <p><strong>Rescuing the Wreck</strong><br>
As soon as Etheridge and Meekins spotted the red flare, they woke up the other five surfmen on duty. The crew quickly hitched up a team of mules. Then they pushed and pulled their surfboat and equipment cart down the beach for two miles.</p>
        <p>“The storm was raging fearfully,” Etheridge later wrote, “and . . . the team was often brought to a standstill by the sweeping current.” But the crew kept trudging through the knee-deep sand and icy water. Finally, they spotted the wreck.</p>
        <p>The schooner E.S. <em>Newman </em>had blown aground 30 yards offshore. The storm had ripped off the ship’s sails and demolished her deck. Now the battered ship was rolling and tossing in the surf. All nine of the passengers and crew, including the captain’s wife and three-year-old child, were trapped onboard.</p>
        <p>“It seemed impossible under such circumstances to render any assistance,” Etheridge later wrote.</p>
        <p>But unless someone did something soon, the passengers would probably be swept out to sea, die from exposure, or be crushed when the <em>Newman </em>broke apart in the surf. So Etheridge came up with a daring plan.</p>
        <p>His men would try to swim to the ship. Meekins and another surfman volunteered for the first attempt. They lashed themselves together with a rope. Then they grabbed one end of a life-saving line while the rest of the crew held the other end of the line securely to the beach.</p>
        <p>Meekins and the other surfman slowly waded farther out into the chilly water. They struggled through the currents and against the undertow in total darkness.</p>
        <p>Onboard the <em>Newman</em>, the captain lowered a ladder over the side of the broken ship. Finally the surfmen reached the ship.</p>
        <p>“The voice of gladden[ed] hearts greeted the arrival of the station crew,” Etheridge later wrote.</p>
        <p>One passenger climbed carefully down the ladder. Meekins knotted the end of the rope around him. Slowly they carried him through the churning water to safety. Then two other surfmen headed back to the <em>Newman</em>.</p>
        <p>Next, they carried the child to shore. Then they returned to rescue the captain’s wife. Again and again, the surfmen took turns swimming in pairs through the sea to the wreck. After six grueling hours, the <em>Newman </em>was destroyed, but all nine passengers were safely onshore.</p>
        <p><strong>Life After the Rescue</strong><br>
The captain of the <em>Newman </em>was so grateful that he gave Etheridge and his crew the ship’s name board. But for many years, this was the only award that the surfmen received. Pea Island Station was closed in 1947, and everyone seemed to forget the courageous crew.</p>
        <p>Finally, in 1996 Etheridge and his men were awarded the Coast Guard’s highest honor, the Gold Lifesaving Medal, for their “extreme and heroic daring.” One hundred years after the <em>Newman </em>rescue, the men of the Pea Island Station were recognized for what they were—heroes.<br>

        <p>Kate Burkart, an eighth-grader from North Carolina, helped to “rescue” the Pea Island crew. She wrote letters to her senator and President Clinton.<br>
With Coast Guard officer Stephen Rochon and graduate students David Wright and David Zoby, Burkart submitted a report to the Coast Guard about the crew.<br>
Their hard work paid off. Burkart was at the Navy Memorial when the Gold Lifesaving Medal was awarded to the Pea Island crew.</p>

          <strong>Rescue at Pea Island</strong>

          <strong>Rescue at Pea Island</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Tracey E. Fern</em>
        </p>
        <p>Station Keeper Richard Etheridge peered from the lookout tower of the Pea Island life-saving station. Fog swirled around his face, and it was pitch-dark. Huge waves crashed onto the beach, and hurricane-force winds hurled sand and sea spray into the air.</p>
        <p>On that night back in October 1896, the worst storm in almost fifty years was battering the North Carolina coast. Moments earlier, one of Etheridge’s surfmen, Theodore Meekins, had spotted a faint red glimmer in the distance. Could it have been a flare from a ship in distress?</p>
        <p>Etheridge quickly lit a flare and held it high over his head until the flame died out. Then he saw it—a dull red light flickered to the south. That could mean only one thing: shipwreck.</p>
        <p><strong>The Keeper of the Station</strong><br>
Rescuing ships in distress was nothing new for Etheridge. He had been keeper of this life-saving station since 1880. Etheridge had grown up swimming, fishing, and boating on nearby Roanoke Island. He eventually became known as one of the best surfmen and lifesavers in North Carolina. But Etheridge was also known for something else: he was the Life-Saving Service’s first African American station chief.</p>
        <p>White surfmen refused to work under Etheridge. So Etheridge and the Life-Saving Service recruited a crew of African American rescuers to work with him.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Etheridge’s men trained for ten hours a day, seven days a week. They swam in the rough surf and patrolled the beach. They performed life-saving drills and tugged their 1,500-pound surfboat and equipment for miles through the sand. But the wreck on the night of October 1896 put all of the crew’s practice to the test.</p>
        <p><strong>Rescuing the Wreck</strong><br>
As soon as Etheridge and Meekins spotted the red flare, they woke up the other five surfmen on duty. The crew quickly hitched up a team of mules. Then they pushed and pulled their surfboat and equipment cart down the beach for two miles.</p>
        <p>“The storm was raging fearfully,” Etheridge later wrote, “and . . . the team was often brought to a standstill by the sweeping current.” But the crew kept trudging through the knee-deep sand and icy water. Finally, they spotted the wreck.</p>
        <p>The schooner E.S. <em>Newman </em>had blown aground 30 yards offshore. The storm had ripped off the ship’s sails and demolished her deck. Now the battered ship was rolling and tossing in the surf. All nine of the passengers and crew, including the captain’s wife and three-year-old child, were trapped onboard.</p>
        <p>“It seemed impossible under such circumstances to render any assistance,” Etheridge later wrote.</p>
        <p>But unless someone did something soon, the passengers would probably be swept out to sea, die from exposure, or be crushed when the <em>Newman </em>broke apart in the surf. So Etheridge came up with a daring plan.</p>
        <p>His men would try to swim to the ship. Meekins and another surfman volunteered for the first attempt. They lashed themselves together with a rope. Then they grabbed one end of a life-saving line while the rest of the crew held the other end of the line securely to the beach.</p>
        <p>Meekins and the other surfman slowly waded farther out into the chilly water. They struggled through the currents and against the undertow in total darkness.</p>
        <p>Onboard the <em>Newman</em>, the captain lowered a ladder over the side of the broken ship. Finally the surfmen reached the ship.</p>
        <p>“The voice of gladden[ed] hearts greeted the arrival of the station crew,” Etheridge later wrote.</p>
        <p>One passenger climbed carefully down the ladder. Meekins knotted the end of the rope around him. Slowly they carried him through the churning water to safety. Then two other surfmen headed back to the <em>Newman</em>.</p>
        <p>Next, they carried the child to shore. Then they returned to rescue the captain’s wife. Again and again, the surfmen took turns swimming in pairs through the sea to the wreck. After six grueling hours, the <em>Newman </em>was destroyed, but all nine passengers were safely onshore.</p>
        <p><strong>Life After the Rescue</strong><br>
The captain of the <em>Newman </em>was so grateful that he gave Etheridge and his crew the ship’s name board. But for many years, this was the only award that the surfmen received. Pea Island Station was closed in 1947, and everyone seemed to forget the courageous crew.</p>
        <p>Finally, in 1996 Etheridge and his men were awarded the Coast Guard’s highest honor, the Gold Lifesaving Medal, for their “extreme and heroic daring.” One hundred years after the <em>Newman </em>rescue, the men of the Pea Island Station were recognized for what they were—heroes.<br>

        <p>Kate Burkart, an eighth-grader from North Carolina, helped to “rescue” the Pea Island crew. She wrote letters to her senator and President Clinton.<br>
With Coast Guard officer Stephen Rochon and graduate students David Wright and David Zoby, Burkart submitted a report to the Coast Guard about the crew.<br>
Their hard work paid off. Burkart was at the Navy Memorial when the Gold Lifesaving Medal was awarded to the Pea Island crew.</p>

          <strong>Rescue at Pea Island</strong>

          <br>
          <em>by Tracey E. Fern</em>
        </p>
        <p>Station Keeper Richard Etheridge peered from the lookout tower of the Pea Island life-saving station. Fog swirled around his face, and it was pitch-dark. Huge waves crashed onto the beach, and hurricane-force winds hurled sand and sea spray into the air.</p>
        <p>On that night back in October 1896, the worst storm in almost fifty years was battering the North Carolina coast. Moments earlier, one of Etheridge’s surfmen, Theodore Meekins, had spotted a faint red glimmer in the distance. Could it have been a flare from a ship in distress?</p>
        <p>Etheridge quickly lit a flare and held it high over his head until the flame died out. Then he saw it—a dull red light flickered to the south. That could mean only one thing: shipwreck.</p>
        <p><strong>The Keeper of the Station</strong><br>
Rescuing ships in distress was nothing new for Etheridge. He had been keeper of this life-saving station since 1880. Etheridge had grown up swimming, fishing, and boating on nearby Roanoke Island. He eventually became known as one of the best surfmen and lifesavers in North Carolina. But Etheridge was also known for something else: he was the Life-Saving Service’s first African American station chief.</p>
        <p>White surfmen refused to work under Etheridge. So Etheridge and the Life-Saving Service recruited a crew of African American rescuers to work with him.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Etheridge’s men trained for ten hours a day, seven days a week. They swam in the rough surf and patrolled the beach. They performed life-saving drills and tugged their 1,500-pound surfboat and equipment for miles through the sand. But the wreck on the night of October 1896 put all of the crew’s practice to the test.</p>
        <p><strong>Rescuing the Wreck</strong><br>
As soon as Etheridge and Meekins spotted the red flare, they woke up the other five surfmen on duty. The crew quickly hitched up a team of mules. Then they pushed and pulled their surfboat and equipment cart down the beach for two miles.</p>
        <p>“The storm was raging fearfully,” Etheridge later wrote, “and . . . the team was often brought to a standstill by the sweeping current.” But the crew kept trudging through the knee-deep sand and icy water. Finally, they spotted the wreck.</p>
        <p>The schooner E.S. <em>Newman </em>had blown aground 30 yards offshore. The storm had ripped off the ship’s sails and demolished her deck. Now the battered ship was rolling and tossing in the surf. All nine of the passengers and crew, including the captain’s wife and three-year-old child, were trapped onboard.</p>
        <p>“It seemed impossible under such circumstances to render any assistance,” Etheridge later wrote.</p>
        <p>But unless someone did something soon, the passengers would probably be swept out to sea, die from exposure, or be crushed when the <em>Newman </em>broke apart in the surf. So Etheridge came up with a daring plan.</p>
        <p>His men would try to swim to the ship. Meekins and another surfman volunteered for the first attempt. They lashed themselves together with a rope. Then they grabbed one end of a life-saving line while the rest of the crew held the other end of the line securely to the beach.</p>
        <p>Meekins and the other surfman slowly waded farther out into the chilly water. They struggled through the currents and against the undertow in total darkness.</p>
        <p>Onboard the <em>Newman</em>, the captain lowered a ladder over the side of the broken ship. Finally the surfmen reached the ship.</p>
        <p>“The voice of gladden[ed] hearts greeted the arrival of the station crew,” Etheridge later wrote.</p>
        <p>One passenger climbed carefully down the ladder. Meekins knotted the end of the rope around him. Slowly they carried him through the churning water to safety. Then two other surfmen headed back to the <em>Newman</em>.</p>
        <p>Next, they carried the child to shore. Then they returned to rescue the captain’s wife. Again and again, the surfmen took turns swimming in pairs through the sea to the wreck. After six grueling hours, the <em>Newman </em>was destroyed, but all nine passengers were safely onshore.</p>
        <p><strong>Life After the Rescue</strong><br>
The captain of the <em>Newman </em>was so grateful that he gave Etheridge and his crew the ship’s name board. But for many years, this was the only award that the surfmen received. Pea Island Station was closed in 1947, and everyone seemed to forget the courageous crew.</p>
        <p>Finally, in 1996 Etheridge and his men were awarded the Coast Guard’s highest honor, the Gold Lifesaving Medal, for their “extreme and heroic daring.” One hundred years after the <em>Newman </em>rescue, the men of the Pea Island Station were recognized for what they were—heroes.<br>

          <strong>Coming to the Crew’s Rescue</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Kate Burkart, an eighth-grader from North Carolina, helped to “rescue” the Pea Island crew. She wrote letters to her senator and President Clinton.<br>
With Coast Guard officer Stephen Rochon and graduate students David Wright and David Zoby, Burkart submitted a report to the Coast Guard about the crew.<br>
Their hard work paid off. Burkart was at the Navy Memorial when the Gold Lifesaving Medal was awarded to the Pea Island crew.</p>

          <strong>The Wolf at My Window</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Diane L. Burns<br>
drawing by Sal Catalano</em><br><br>
Wolf! Hank thought. The boy stared out the cabin window at the lone creature. It was sitting a stone’s throw away in the moonlight. The wolf howled; Hank shivered. For the first time, he felt truly alone in these Idaho mountains.<br>
<br>
It had felt so good to be allowed to come along with Dad. Dad was a scientist who studied wild animals. Together, Hank and Dad had followed the tracks of mountain sheep, goats, and cougars. Through binoculars, they’d studied coyotes and mule deer. And they’d carefully recorded all the information in Dad’s logbook every night in their tent. Dad planned to share the information with other wildlife scientists.<br>
<br>
Then, two days ago, they had moved into an empty cabin. Here, Dad would write a report about what he had found. But they discovered that dozens and dozens of mice had taken over the cabin. The little rodents scurried in and out through lots of tiny holes in the walls... Worst of all, the mice had gotten into the supplies of dried food and ruined almost everything.<br>
<br>
Now, because most of the food was gone, Dad had left overnight to get new supplies from town. Hank had insisted on staying behind.<br>
<br>
The Wolf. Its howl sounded again. Hank opened the logbook to write about it, but his hand shook. Dad had never mentioned having any trouble with wolves. But Hank’s friend Jill had once told him of a shopkeeper in Montana who’d faced a whole pack of wolves during a hard winter long ago. He’d been alone in his cabin, Jill had said.<br>
<br>
Like I am now, Hank thought with a nervous gulp. The wolves had chewed right through a solid door, Jill had said, to get a smoked ham hanging from the ceiling.<br>
<br>
But . . . Hank took a deep breath and forced down his fright. How could such a story be true? Dad had told him many times that wolves were smart but shy, staying many miles away from people. The big, bad wolf was just a fairy tale, Hank thought. A 13-year-old boy was too old for such<br>
things.<br>
<br>
Hank closed the logbook and put it on the table. Quickly he looked around for something he could use as a weapon—just in case. He grabbed a poker from the fireplace, went to the door, and took a deep breath. Then he opened the door, waved the poker, and yelled with all his might: “Go away, wolf! Go away!”<br>
<br>
Startled, the wolf sprang up—and started trotting away. Hank closed the door and leaned back&nbsp;with a gasp. When he’d caught his breath, he turned back to the window. Oh, no! There was the wolf, sitting right where it had sat before.<br>
<br>
Hank stared at the wolf. The wolf stared right back at him. Hank was staring into the eyes of a hunter. He knew, like all creatures, the wolf needed to eat. Hank’s dad had said wolves play their part in the environment by eating deer, elk, rabbits, and other animals. But maybe, like the hungry mice that were frisking about Hank’s feet, wolves go for any food they can find.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, the wolf sprang! Hank ducked, expecting to hear the window glass shattering above him. Instead, he heard a muffled snuffling along the ground outside. The wolf wanted a way in! Hank shuddered. His heart pounded. If only Dad were here!<br>
<br>
Now came a scratching sound—the sound of pawing at the cabin walls. And then, over the hammering of his heart, Hank heard a high-pitched, tiny . . . SQUEAK!<br>
<br>
Squeak? Holding his breath, Hank raised his head to see. The wolf was below the window, holding on to a small something. Then it lay in the grass and gulped down its prize—a mouse!<br>
<br>
The wolf stood up to pounce, stiff-legged, on another. Hank’s breath rushed out. The wolf was hungry all right. But just for the kind of food it should eat, as Dad had said.<br>
<br>
As the wolf pounced again, Hank opened the logbook. He began to write, neatly and carefully, every detail of his evening with the wolf. The story would be waiting for Dad when he returned in the morning—long after the smart, shy wolf had moved on in search of bigger animals to eat.<br>

          <strong>The Wolf at My Window</strong>

But . . . Hank took a deep breath and forced down his fright. How could such a story be true? Dad had told him many times that wolves were smart but shy, staying many miles away from people. The big, bad wolf was just a fairy tale, Hank thought. A 13-year-old boy was too old for such<br>
things.<br>
<br>
Hank closed the logbook and put it on the table. Quickly he looked around for something he could use as a weapon—just in case. He grabbed a poker from the fireplace, went to the door, and took a deep breath. Then he opened the door, waved the poker, and yelled with all his might: “Go away, wolf! Go away!”<br>
<br>
Startled, the wolf sprang up—and started trotting away. Hank closed the door and leaned back&nbsp;with a gasp. When he’d caught his breath, he turned back to the window. Oh, no! There was the wolf, sitting right where it had sat before.<br>
<br>
Hank stared at the wolf. The wolf stared right back at him. Hank was staring into the eyes of a hunter. He knew, like all creatures, the wolf needed to eat. Hank’s dad had said wolves play their part in the environment by eating deer, elk, rabbits, and other animals. But maybe, like the hungry mice that were frisking about Hank’s feet, wolves go for any food they can find.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, the wolf sprang! Hank ducked, expecting to hear the window glass shattering above him. Instead, he heard a muffled snuffling along the ground outside. The wolf wanted a way in! Hank shuddered. His heart pounded. If only Dad were here!<br>
<br>
Now came a scratching sound—the sound of pawing at the cabin walls. And then, over the hammering of his heart, Hank heard a high-pitched, tiny . . . SQUEAK!<br>
<br>
Squeak? Holding his breath, Hank raised his head to see. The wolf was below the window, holding on to a small something. Then it lay in the grass and gulped down its prize—a mouse!<br>
<br>
The wolf stood up to pounce, stiff-legged, on another. Hank’s breath rushed out. The wolf was hungry all right. But just for the kind of food it should eat, as Dad had said.<br>
<br>
As the wolf pounced again, Hank opened the logbook. He began to write, neatly and carefully, every detail of his evening with the wolf. The story would be waiting for Dad when he returned in the morning—long after the smart, shy wolf had moved on in search of bigger animals to eat.<br>

          <strong>The Wolf at My Window</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Diane L. Burns<br>
drawing by Sal Catalano</em><br><br>
Wolf! Hank thought. The boy stared out the cabin window at the lone creature. It was sitting a stone’s throw away in the moonlight. The wolf howled; Hank shivered. For the first time, he felt truly alone in these Idaho mountains.<br>
<br>
It had felt so good to be allowed to come along with Dad. Dad was a scientist who studied wild animals. Together, Hank and Dad had followed the tracks of mountain sheep, goats, and cougars. Through binoculars, they’d studied coyotes and mule deer. And they’d carefully recorded all the information in Dad’s logbook every night in their tent. Dad planned to share the information with other wildlife scientists.<br>
<br>
Then, two days ago, they had moved into an empty cabin. Here, Dad would write a report about what he had found. But they discovered that dozens and dozens of mice had taken over the cabin. The little rodents scurried in and out through lots of tiny holes in the walls... Worst of all, the mice had gotten into the supplies of dried food and ruined almost everything.<br>
<br>
Now, because most of the food was gone, Dad had left overnight to get new supplies from town. Hank had insisted on staying behind.<br>
<br>
The Wolf. Its howl sounded again. Hank opened the logbook to write about it, but his hand shook. Dad had never mentioned having any trouble with wolves. But Hank’s friend Jill had once told him of a shopkeeper in Montana who’d faced a whole pack of wolves during a hard winter long ago. He’d been alone in his cabin, Jill had said.<br>
<br>
Like I am now, Hank thought with a nervous gulp. The wolves had chewed right through a solid door, Jill had said, to get a smoked ham hanging from the ceiling.<br>
<br>
But . . . Hank took a deep breath and forced down his fright. How could such a story be true? Dad had told him many times that wolves were smart but shy, staying many miles away from people. The big, bad wolf was just a fairy tale, Hank thought. A 13-year-old boy was too old for such<br>
things.<br>
<br>
Hank closed the logbook and put it on the table. Quickly he looked around for something he could use as a weapon—just in case. He grabbed a poker from the fireplace, went to the door, and took a deep breath. Then he opened the door, waved the poker, and yelled with all his might: “Go away, wolf! Go away!”<br>
<br>
Startled, the wolf sprang up—and started trotting away. Hank closed the door and leaned back&nbsp;with a gasp. When he’d caught his breath, he turned back to the window. Oh, no! There was the wolf, sitting right where it had sat before.<br>
<br>
Hank stared at the wolf. The wolf stared right back at him. Hank was staring into the eyes of a hunter. He knew, like all creatures, the wolf needed to eat. Hank’s dad had said wolves play their part in the environment by eating deer, elk, rabbits, and other animals. But maybe, like the hungry mice that were frisking about Hank’s feet, wolves go for any food they can find.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, the wolf sprang! Hank ducked, expecting to hear the window glass shattering above him. Instead, he heard a muffled snuffling along the ground outside. The wolf wanted a way in! Hank shuddered. His heart pounded. If only Dad were here!<br>
<br>

          <strong>The Wolf at My Window</strong>

          <strong>The Wolf at My Window</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Diane L. Burns<br>
drawing by Sal Catalano</em><br><br>
Wolf! Hank thought. The boy stared out the cabin window at the lone creature. It was sitting a stone’s throw away in the moonlight. The wolf howled; Hank shivered. For the first time, he felt truly alone in these Idaho mountains.<br>
<br>
It had felt so good to be allowed to come along with Dad. Dad was a scientist who studied wild animals. Together, Hank and Dad had followed the tracks of mountain sheep, goats, and cougars. Through binoculars, they’d studied coyotes and mule deer. And they’d carefully recorded all the information in Dad’s logbook every night in their tent. Dad planned to share the information with other wildlife scientists.<br>
<br>
Then, two days ago, they had moved into an empty cabin. Here, Dad would write a report about what he had found. But they discovered that dozens and dozens of mice had taken over the cabin. The little rodents scurried in and out through lots of tiny holes in the walls... Worst of all, the mice had gotten into the supplies of dried food and ruined almost everything.<br>
<br>
Now, because most of the food was gone, Dad had left overnight to get new supplies from town. Hank had insisted on staying behind.<br>
<br>
The Wolf. Its howl sounded again. Hank opened the logbook to write about it, but his hand shook. Dad had never mentioned having any trouble with wolves. But Hank’s friend Jill had once told him of a shopkeeper in Montana who’d faced a whole pack of wolves during a hard winter long ago. He’d been alone in his cabin, Jill had said.<br>
<br>
Like I am now, Hank thought with a nervous gulp. The wolves had chewed right through a solid door, Jill had said, to get a smoked ham hanging from the ceiling.<br>
<br>
But . . . Hank took a deep breath and forced down his fright. How could such a story be true? Dad had told him many times that wolves were smart but shy, staying many miles away from people. The big, bad wolf was just a fairy tale, Hank thought. A 13-year-old boy was too old for such<br>
things.<br>
<br>
Hank closed the logbook and put it on the table. Quickly he looked around for something he could use as a weapon—just in case. He grabbed a poker from the fireplace, went to the door, and took a deep breath. Then he opened the door, waved the poker, and yelled with all his might: “Go away, wolf! Go away!”<br>
<br>
Startled, the wolf sprang up—and started trotting away. Hank closed the door and leaned back&nbsp;with a gasp. When he’d caught his breath, he turned back to the window. Oh, no! There was the wolf, sitting right where it had sat before.<br>
<br>
Hank stared at the wolf. The wolf stared right back at him. Hank was staring into the eyes of a hunter. He knew, like all creatures, the wolf needed to eat. Hank’s dad had said wolves play their part in the environment by eating deer, elk, rabbits, and other animals. But maybe, like the hungry mice that were frisking about Hank’s feet, wolves go for any food they can find.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, the wolf sprang! Hank ducked, expecting to hear the window glass shattering above him. Instead, he heard a muffled snuffling along the ground outside. The wolf wanted a way in! Hank shuddered. His heart pounded. If only Dad were here!<br>
<br>
Now came a scratching sound—the sound of pawing at the cabin walls. And then, over the hammering of his heart, Hank heard a high-pitched, tiny . . . SQUEAK!<br>
<br>
Squeak? Holding his breath, Hank raised his head to see. The wolf was below the window, holding on to a small something. Then it lay in the grass and gulped down its prize—a mouse!<br>
<br>
The wolf stood up to pounce, stiff-legged, on another. Hank’s breath rushed out. The wolf was hungry all right. But just for the kind of food it should eat, as Dad had said.<br>
<br>
As the wolf pounced again, Hank opened the logbook. He began to write, neatly and carefully, every detail of his evening with the wolf. The story would be waiting for Dad when he returned in the morning—long after the smart, shy wolf had moved on in search of bigger animals to eat.<br>

          <strong>The Wolf at My Window</strong>

        <p><strong>The Beagle Brigade</strong><br><em>by Kathiann M. Kowalski</em><br><br>
Return to the United States from a trip abroad, and your luggage will get inspected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Beagle Brigade. Working with human canine officer partners, the beagles sniff out potential threats to American agriculture.<br>
<br>
An orange or apple, for example, might harbor a Mediterranean fruit fly. Ham could carry a disease such as hog cholera. These and other pests could devastate farmers’ crops and livestock. “Once we introduce something that is not part of the environment, there may not be any<br>
controls for it in the environment,” notes USDA’s Lisa Davis at the National Dog Detector Training Center in Orlando, Florida. “The best thing for us to do is to prevent it from coming across the border and becoming established.”<br>
<br>
When a beagle sniffs specific food odors, it signals its partner by sitting. The human officer then investigates. When the dog is right—which happens 90 percent of the time—it gets an edible treat.<br>
<br>
“The dog is not out there working,” explains Davis. “It’s out there playing. It’s a game to the dog.” The handlers give the beagles plenty of food and loving. They make sure they get first- class medical attention, too. When the dogs finally retire after 9 to 11 years, the USDA finds caring homes for them. It’s a dog’s life indeed!<br>
<br>
Their people partners work and study somewhat harder. As specialized quarantine officers, most hold degrees in the biological sciences or related sciences.<br>
<br>
How well does the Beagle Brigade do its job? “On the average,” notes Davis, “each year our 54 teams intercept around 75,000 prohibited, restricted items.” Since even one infested item could cause widespread destruction, that’s a great result for America’s agricultural environment. Let’s hear it for Snoopy!<br>

        <p><strong>The Beagle Brigade</strong><br><em>by Kathiann M. Kowalski</em><br><br>
Return to the United States from a trip abroad, and your luggage will get inspected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Beagle Brigade. Working with human canine officer partners, the beagles sniff out potential threats to American agriculture.<br>
<br>
An orange or apple, for example, might harbor a Mediterranean fruit fly. Ham could carry a disease such as hog cholera. These and other pests could devastate farmers’ crops and livestock. “Once we introduce something that is not part of the environment, there may not be any<br>
controls for it in the environment,” notes USDA’s Lisa Davis at the National Dog Detector Training Center in Orlando, Florida. “The best thing for us to do is to prevent it from coming across the border and becoming established.”<br>
<br>
When a beagle sniffs specific food odors, it signals its partner by sitting. The human officer then investigates. When the dog is right—which happens 90 percent of the time—it gets an edible treat.<br>
<br>
“The dog is not out there working,” explains Davis. “It’s out there playing. It’s a game to the dog.” The handlers give the beagles plenty of food and loving. They make sure they get first- class medical attention, too. When the dogs finally retire after 9 to 11 years, the USDA finds caring homes for them. It’s a dog’s life indeed!<br>
<br>
Their people partners work and study somewhat harder. As specialized quarantine officers, most hold degrees in the biological sciences or related sciences.<br>
<br>
How well does the Beagle Brigade do its job? “On the average,” notes Davis, “each year our 54 teams intercept around 75,000 prohibited, restricted items.” Since even one infested item could cause widespread destruction, that’s a great result for America’s agricultural environment. Let’s hear it for Snoopy!<br>
