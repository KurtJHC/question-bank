          <strong>The Hatmakers&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Tamzin Merchant&nbsp;</em><br><br>
It was a wild and lightning-struck night. The kind of night that changes everything.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jagged forks of light ripped across the sky and thunder rolled in tidal waves over the rooftops and spires of London. With the rain lashing down and the clouds crashing above, it felt like the whole city was under the sea.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But Cordelia Hatmaker was not afraid. In her candle-lit room at the very top of Hatmaker House, she was pretending to be aboard the Jolly Bonnet. The ship was being tossed by massive waves as she staggered across the deck (really her hearthrug), fighting a howling wind.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>BOOM.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Batten down those hatches, Fortescue!’ she yelled. ‘I’ve got to lash myself to the wheel!’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A tin soldier stared blankly from the mantel. ‘<span class="txt-underline"><strong>Aye, aye, Cap’n!</strong></span>’ Cordelia squeaked, out of the corner of her mouth.</p>
        <p>BOOM.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Enemy fire!’ Cordelia cried, seizing the back of her wooden chair and heaving. Under her hands it became a greatship’s wheel.</p>
        <p>BOOM.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A violent gust of wind blew the window open. The candle sputtered out and Cordelia was plunged into darkness.</p>
        <p>BOOM, BOOM, BOOM.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Echoing up the five storeys of Hatmaker House came the sound of somebody pounding on the front door.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>- - -</p>
        <p>Cordelia scrambled down the ladder from her bedroom and galloped along the top corridor. Aunt Ariadne emerged from her chamber, wrapped in a plum-coloured velvet dressing gown. Uncle Tiberius appeared, grizzle-headed from sleep.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Father!’ Cordelia cried, skidding past them. ‘My father’s home!’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>BOOM, BOOM, BOOM.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Cordelia raced down the spiral staircase that twisted through the middle of Hatmaker House. She hurtled past Great-aunt Petronella, snoozing in front of the flickering lilac fire in her Alchemy Parlour. She rushed past the tall doors of the Hatmaking Workshop and, deciding that sliding down the corkscrew bannister would be quickest, in three heartbeats she reached the bottom floor.</p>
        <p>Her bare feet slapped the cold tiles of the hallway. She shook her head to chase away the dizziness and ran (in not quite a straight line because she was still a little giddy) across the wide hall to the door.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>White light flared across the sky as she turned the hefty key in the lock. A tall figure loomed through the pebbly window.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Thunder clapped overhead as she pulled open the heavy oak door.</p>
        <p>A crack of lightning split the sky in two.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A man stood on the front step of Hatmaker House. He was drenched, ragged and gasping in the wind.</p>
        <p>It was not her father.&nbsp;</p>

          <br>
          <strong>The Hatmakers&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Tamzin Merchant&nbsp;</em><br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was a wild and lightning-struck night. The kind of night that changes everything.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jagged forks of light ripped across the sky and thunder rolled in tidal waves over the rooftops and spires of London. With the rain lashing down and the clouds crashing above, it felt like the whole city was under the sea.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But Cordelia Hatmaker was not afraid. In her candle-lit room at the very top of Hatmaker House, she was pretending to be aboard the Jolly Bonnet. The ship was being tossed by massive waves as she staggered across the deck (really her hearthrug), fighting a howling wind.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>BOOM.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Batten down those hatches, Fortescue!’ she yelled. ‘I’ve got to lash myself to the wheel!’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A tin soldier stared blankly from the mantel. ‘<span class="txt-underline"><strong>Aye, aye, Cap’n</strong></span>!’ Cordelia squeaked, out of the corner of her mouth.</p>
        <p>BOOM.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Enemy fire!’ Cordelia cried, seizing the back of her wooden chair and heaving. Under her hands it became a greatship’s wheel.</p>
        <p>BOOM.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A violent gust of wind blew the window open. The candle sputtered out and Cordelia was plunged into darkness.</p>
        <p>BOOM, BOOM, BOOM.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Echoing up the five storeys of Hatmaker House came the sound of somebody pounding on the front door.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>- - -</p>
        <p>Cordelia scrambled down the ladder from her bedroom and galloped along the top corridor. Aunt Ariadne emerged from her chamber, wrapped in a plum-coloured velvet dressing gown. Uncle Tiberius appeared, grizzle-headed from sleep.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Father!’ Cordelia cried, skidding past them. ‘My father’s home!’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>BOOM, BOOM, BOOM.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Cordelia raced down the spiral staircase that twisted through the middle of Hatmaker House. She hurtled past Great-aunt Petronella, snoozing in front of the flickering lilac fire in her Alchemy Parlour. She rushed past the tall doors of the Hatmaking Workshop and, deciding that sliding down the corkscrew bannister would be quickest, in three heartbeats she reached the bottom floor.</p>
        <p>Her bare feet slapped the cold tiles of the hallway. She shook her head to chase away the dizziness and ran (in not quite a straight line because she was still a little giddy) across the wide hall to the door.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>White light flared across the sky as she turned the hefty key in the lock. A tall figure loomed through the pebbly window.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Thunder clapped overhead as she pulled open the heavy oak door.</p>
        <p>A crack of lightning split the sky in two.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A man stood on the front step of Hatmaker House. He was drenched, ragged and gasping in the wind.</p>
        <p>It was not her father.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>The Hatmakers&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Tamzin Merchant&nbsp;</em><br><br>
It was a wild and lightning-struck night. The kind of night that changes everything.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jagged forks of light ripped across the sky and thunder rolled in tidal waves over the rooftops and spires of London. With the rain lashing down and the clouds crashing above, it felt like the whole city was under the sea.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But Cordelia Hatmaker was not afraid. In her candle-lit room at the very top of Hatmaker House, she was pretending to be aboard the Jolly Bonnet. The ship was being tossed by massive waves as she staggered across the deck (really her hearthrug), fighting a howling wind.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>BOOM.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Batten down those hatches, Fortescue!’ she yelled. ‘I’ve got to lash myself to the wheel!’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A tin soldier stared blankly from the mantel. ‘<span class="txt-underline"><strong>Aye, aye, Cap’n</strong></span>!’ Cordelia squeaked, out of the corner of her mouth.</p>
        <p>BOOM.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Enemy fire!’ Cordelia cried, seizing the back of her wooden chair and heaving. Under her hands it became a greatship’s wheel.</p>
        <p>BOOM.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A violent gust of wind blew the window open. The candle sputtered out and Cordelia was plunged into darkness.</p>
        <p>BOOM, BOOM, BOOM.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Echoing up the five storeys of Hatmaker House came the sound of somebody pounding on the front door.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>- - -</p>
        <p>Cordelia scrambled down the ladder from her bedroom and galloped along the top corridor. Aunt Ariadne emerged from her chamber, wrapped in a plum-coloured velvet dressing gown. Uncle Tiberius appeared, grizzle-headed from sleep.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Father!’ Cordelia cried, skidding past them. ‘My father’s home!’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>BOOM, BOOM, BOOM.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Cordelia raced down the spiral staircase that twisted through the middle of Hatmaker House. She hurtled past Great-aunt Petronella, snoozing in front of the flickering lilac fire in her Alchemy Parlour. She rushed past the tall doors of the Hatmaking Workshop and, deciding that sliding down the corkscrew bannister would be quickest, in three heartbeats she reached the bottom floor.</p>
        <p>Her bare feet slapped the cold tiles of the hallway. She shook her head to chase away the dizziness and ran (in not quite a straight line because she was still a little giddy) across the wide hall to the door.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>White light flared across the sky as she turned the hefty key in the lock. A tall figure loomed through the pebbly window.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Thunder clapped overhead as she pulled open the heavy oak door.</p>
        <p>A crack of lightning split the sky in two.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A man stood on the front step of Hatmaker House. He was drenched, ragged and gasping in the wind.</p>
        <p>It was not her father.&nbsp;</p>

Remember when you used to settle down in front of the TV for the evening, watching the news, current affairs programs and whatever else free-to-air TV had to throw at you? <strong>15……….</strong> No, we don’t either!</p>
        <p>Pay TV and streaming sites have radically changed the way we engage with media and how we watch our favourite TV shows, movies and even sport. Cast your mind back to early 2015 when Foxtel was the only subscription TV service of any real note, <strong>16 ………. </strong>– or even four-figures depending on your chosen package. <strong>17 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>But the entire TV landscape changed in early 2015, with the arrival of streaming heavyweights Netflix and Stan, <strong>18 ……….</strong>, before numerous other streaming providers started to buck their ideas up. Pandora’s box was blown wide open – and there’s no going back now!&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This left Aussies with more Pay TV services than ever before. <strong>19 ……….</strong>, but we’ve still come a long way! So, five years on from the arrival of Netflix, which pay TV and content streaming services do we now have access to – <strong>20 ……….</strong></p>

Remember when you used to settle down in front of the TV for the evening, watching the news, current affairs programs and whatever else free-to-air TV had to throw at you? <strong>15……….</strong> No, we don’t either!</p>
        <p>Pay TV and streaming sites have radically changed the way we engage with media and how we watch our favourite TV shows, movies and even sport. Cast your mind back to early 2015 when Foxtel was the only subscription TV service of any real note, <strong>16 ………. </strong>– or even four-figures depending on your chosen package. <strong>17 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>But the entire TV landscape changed in early 2015, with the arrival of streaming heavyweights Netflix and Stan, <strong>18 ……….</strong>, before numerous other streaming providers started to buck their ideas up. Pandora’s box was blown wide open – and there’s no going back now!&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This left Aussies with more Pay TV services than ever before. <strong>19 ……….</strong>, but we’ve still come a long way! So, five years on from the arrival of Netflix, which pay TV and content streaming services do we now have access to – <strong>20 ……….</strong></p>

            <p>Overpopulation. It is a word that makes politicians wince and is often described as the "elephant in the room" in discussions about the future of the planet. You often hear people citing overpopulation as the single biggest threat to the Earth. But can we really single out population growth in this way? Are there really too many people on our planet? It is clear to all of us that the planet is not expanding. There is only so much space on Earth, not to mention only so many resources – food, water and energy – that can support a human population. So, a growing human population must pose some kind of a threat to the wellbeing of planet Earth, mustn't it? Not necessarily.</p>

            <p>"It is not the number of people on the planet that is the issue – but the number of consumers and the scale and nature of their consumption," says David Satterthwaite, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Environment and Development in London. He quotes Gandhi: "The world has enough for everyone's need, but not enough for everyone's greed." The number of "modern human beings" (<em>Homo sapiens</em>) on Earth has been comparatively small until very recently. Just 10,000 years ago there might have been no more than a few million people on the planet. The one billion mark was not passed until the early 1800s; the two billion mark not until the 1920s. As it stands now, though, the world's population is over 7.3 billion. According to United Nations predictions it could reach 9.7 billion people by 2050, and over 11 billion by 2100.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Population growth has been so rapid that there is no real precedent we can turn to for clues about the possible consequences. In other words, while the planet might hold over 11 billion people by the end of the century, our current level of knowledge does not allow us to predict whether such a large population is sustainable, simply because it has never happened before. We can get clues, though, by considering where population growth is expected to be strongest in the years ahead. Satterthwaite says that most of the growth over the next two decades is predicted to be in urban centres in what are currently low and middle-income countries. On the face of it, the global impact of adding several billion people to these urban centres might be surprisingly small. This is because urbanites in low- and middle-income countries have historically consumed little. The emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases give us a good indication of how high consumption is in a city. "We know of cities in low-income nations that emit less than one tonne CO2-equivalent per person per year," says Satterthwaite. "Cities in high-income nations [can] have six to 30 tonnes CO2- equivalent per person per year."&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Citizens of more affluent nations leave a much greater footprint on our planet than people living in poorer countries – although there are exceptions. Copenhagen is the capital of a high-income nation – Denmark – while Porto Alegre is in upper-middle-income Brazil. Living standards are high in both cities, yet per capita emissions are relatively low. Satterthwaite goes on to say that if we look at an individual's lifestyle, the differences between wealthy and non-wealthy groups are even more dramatic. There are many low-income urban dwellers whose consumption is so low that they contribute almost nothing to greenhouse gas emissions. So, a world with a human population of 11 billion might put comparatively little extra strain on our planet's resources. But the world is changing. Low-income urban centres may not continue on low-carbon development trajectories. The real concern would be if the people living in these areas decided to demand the lifestyles and consumption rates currently considered normal in high-income nations; something many would argue is only fair. If they do, the impact of urban population growth could be much larger.</p>

            <p>"It is not the number of people on the planet that is the issue – but the number of consumers and the scale and nature of their consumption," says David Satterthwaite, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Environment and Development in London. He quotes Gandhi: "The world has enough for everyone's need, but not enough for everyone's greed." The number of "modern human beings" (<em>Homo sapiens</em>) on Earth has been comparatively small until very recently. Just 10,000 years ago there might have been no more than a few million people on the planet. The one billion mark was not passed until the early 1800s; the two billion mark not until the 1920s. As it stands now, though, the world's population is over 7.3 billion. According to United Nations predictions it could reach 9.7 billion people by 2050, and over 11 billion by 2100.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Population growth has been so rapid that there is no real precedent we can turn to for clues about the possible consequences. In other words, while the planet might hold over 11 billion people by the end of the century, our current level of knowledge does not allow us to predict whether such a large population is sustainable, simply because it has never happened before. We can get clues, though, by considering where population growth is expected to be strongest in the years ahead. Satterthwaite says that most of the growth over the next two decades is predicted to be in urban centres in what are currently low and middle-income countries. On the face of it, the global impact of adding several billion people to these urban centres might be surprisingly small. This is because urbanites in low- and middle-income countries have historically consumed little. The emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases give us a good indication of how high consumption is in a city. "We know of cities in low-income nations that emit less than one tonne CO2-equivalent per person per year," says Satterthwaite. "Cities in high-income nations [can] have six to 30 tonnes CO2- equivalent per person per year."&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Citizens of more affluent nations leave a much greater footprint on our planet than people living in poorer countries – although there are exceptions. Copenhagen is the capital of a high-income nation – Denmark – while Porto Alegre is in upper-middle-income Brazil. Living standards are high in both cities, yet per capita emissions are relatively low. Satterthwaite goes on to say that if we look at an individual's lifestyle, the differences between wealthy and non-wealthy groups are even more dramatic. There are many low-income urban dwellers whose consumption is so low that they contribute almost nothing to greenhouse gas emissions. So, a world with a human population of 11 billion might put comparatively little extra strain on our planet's resources. But the world is changing. Low-income urban centres may not continue on low-carbon development trajectories. The real concern would be if the people living in these areas decided to demand the lifestyles and consumption rates currently considered normal in high-income nations; something many would argue is only fair. If they do, the impact of urban population growth could be much larger.</p>

            <p>Overpopulation. It is a word that makes politicians wince and is often described as the "elephant in the room" in discussions about the future of the planet. You often hear people citing overpopulation as the single biggest threat to the Earth. But can we really single out population growth in this way? Are there really too many people on our planet? It is clear to all of us that the planet is not expanding. There is only so much space on Earth, not to mention only so many resources – food, water and energy – that can support a human population. So, a growing human population must pose some kind of a threat to the wellbeing of planet Earth, mustn't it? Not necessarily.</p>

            <p>Population growth has been so rapid that there is no real precedent we can turn to for clues about the possible consequences. In other words, while the planet might hold over 11 billion people by the end of the century, our current level of knowledge does not allow us to predict whether such a large population is sustainable, simply because it has never happened before. We can get clues, though, by considering where population growth is expected to be strongest in the years ahead. Satterthwaite says that most of the growth over the next two decades is predicted to be in urban centres in what are currently low and middle-income countries. On the face of it, the global impact of adding several billion people to these urban centres might be surprisingly small. This is because urbanites in low- and middle-income countries have historically consumed little. The emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases give us a good indication of how high consumption is in a city. "We know of cities in low-income nations that emit less than one tonne CO2-equivalent per person per year," says Satterthwaite. "Cities in high-income nations [can] have six to 30 tonnes CO2- equivalent per person per year."&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Citizens of more affluent nations leave a much greater footprint on our planet than people living in poorer countries – although there are exceptions. Copenhagen is the capital of a high-income nation – Denmark – while Porto Alegre is in upper-middle-income Brazil. Living standards are high in both cities, yet per capita emissions are relatively low. Satterthwaite goes on to say that if we look at an individual's lifestyle, the differences between wealthy and non-wealthy groups are even more dramatic. There are many low-income urban dwellers whose consumption is so low that they contribute almost nothing to greenhouse gas emissions. So, a world with a human population of 11 billion might put comparatively little extra strain on our planet's resources. But the world is changing. Low-income urban centres may not continue on low-carbon development trajectories. The real concern would be if the people living in these areas decided to demand the lifestyles and consumption rates currently considered normal in high-income nations; something many would argue is only fair. If they do, the impact of urban population growth could be much larger.</p>

            <p>Overpopulation. It is a word that makes politicians wince and is often described as the "elephant in the room" in discussions about the future of the planet. You often hear people citing overpopulation as the single biggest threat to the Earth. But can we really single out population growth in this way? Are there really too many people on our planet? It is clear to all of us that the planet is not expanding. There is only so much space on Earth, not to mention only so many resources – food, water and energy – that can support a human population. So, a growing human population must pose some kind of a threat to the wellbeing of planet Earth, mustn't it? Not necessarily.</p>

            <p>"It is not the number of people on the planet that is the issue – but the number of consumers and the scale and nature of their consumption," says David Satterthwaite, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Environment and Development in London. He quotes Gandhi: "The world has enough for everyone's need, but not enough for everyone's greed." The number of "modern human beings" (<em>Homo sapiens</em>) on Earth has been comparatively small until very recently. Just 10,000 years ago there might have been no more than a few million people on the planet. The one billion mark was not passed until the early 1800s; the two billion mark not until the 1920s. As it stands now, though, the world's population is over 7.3 billion. According to United Nations predictions it could reach 9.7 billion people by 2050, and over 11 billion by 2100.&nbsp;</p>

There are many low-income urban dwellers whose consumption is so low that they contribute almost nothing to greenhouse gas emissions. So, a world with a human population of 11 billion might put comparatively little extra strain on our planet's resources. But the world is changing. Low-income urban centres may not continue on low-carbon development trajectories. The real concern would be if the people living in these areas decided to demand the lifestyles and consumption rates currently considered normal in high-income nations; something many would argue is only fair. If they do, the impact of urban population growth could be much larger.</p>

            <p>Overpopulation. It is a word that makes politicians wince and is often described as the "elephant in the room" in discussions about the future of the planet. You often hear people citing overpopulation as the single biggest threat to the Earth. But can we really single out population growth in this way? Are there really too many people on our planet? It is clear to all of us that the planet is not expanding. There is only so much space on Earth, not to mention only so many resources – food, water and energy – that can support a human population. So, a growing human population must pose some kind of a threat to the wellbeing of planet Earth, mustn't it? Not necessarily.</p>

            <p>"It is not the number of people on the planet that is the issue – but the number of consumers and the scale and nature of their consumption," says David Satterthwaite, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Environment and Development in London. He quotes Gandhi: "The world has enough for everyone's need, but not enough for everyone's greed." The number of "modern human beings" (<em>Homo sapiens</em>) on Earth has been comparatively small until very recently. Just 10,000 years ago there might have been no more than a few million people on the planet. The one billion mark was not passed until the early 1800s; the two billion mark not until the 1920s. As it stands now, though, the world's population is over 7.3 billion. According to United Nations predictions it could reach 9.7 billion people by 2050, and over 11 billion by 2100.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Population growth has been so rapid that there is no real precedent we can turn to for clues about the possible consequences. In other words, while the planet might hold over 11 billion people by the end of the century, our current level of knowledge does not allow us to predict whether such a large population is sustainable, simply because it has never happened before. We can get clues, though, by considering where population growth is expected to be strongest in the years ahead. Satterthwaite says that most of the growth over the next two decades is predicted to be in urban centres in what are currently low and middle-income countries. On the face of it, the global impact of adding several billion people to these urban centres might be surprisingly small. This is because urbanites in low- and middle-income countries have historically consumed little. The emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases give us a good indication of how high consumption is in a city. "We know of cities in low-income nations that emit less than one tonne CO2-equivalent per person per year," says Satterthwaite. "Cities in high-income nations [can] have six to 30 tonnes CO2- equivalent per person per year."&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Citizens of more affluent nations leave a much greater footprint on our planet than people living in poorer countries – although there are exceptions. Copenhagen is the capital of a high-income nation – Denmark – while Porto Alegre is in upper-middle-income Brazil.

            <p>Overpopulation. It is a word that makes politicians wince and is often described as the "elephant in the room" in discussions about the future of the planet. You often hear people citing overpopulation as the single biggest threat to the Earth. But can we really single out population growth in this way? Are there really too many people on our planet? It is clear to all of us that the planet is not expanding. There is only so much space on Earth, not to mention only so many resources – food, water and energy – that can support a human population. So, a growing human population must pose some kind of a threat to the wellbeing of planet Earth, mustn't it? Not necessarily.</p>

            <p>"It is not the number of people on the planet that is the issue – but the number of consumers and the scale and nature of their consumption," says David Satterthwaite, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Environment and Development in London. He quotes Gandhi: "The world has enough for everyone's need, but not enough for everyone's greed." The number of "modern human beings" (<em>Homo sapiens</em>) on Earth has been comparatively small until very recently. Just 10,000 years ago there might have been no more than a few million people on the planet. The one billion mark was not passed until the early 1800s; the two billion mark not until the 1920s. As it stands now, though, the world's population is over 7.3 billion. According to United Nations predictions it could reach 9.7 billion people by 2050, and over 11 billion by 2100.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Population growth has been so rapid that there is no real precedent we can turn to for clues about the possible consequences. In other words, while the planet might hold over 11 billion people by the end of the century, our current level of knowledge does not allow us to predict whether such a large population is sustainable, simply because it has never happened before. We can get clues, though, by considering where population growth is expected to be strongest in the years ahead. Satterthwaite says that most of the growth over the next two decades is predicted to be in urban centres in what are currently low and middle-income countries. On the face of it, the global impact of adding several billion people to these urban centres might be surprisingly small. This is because urbanites in low- and middle-income countries have historically consumed little. The emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases give us a good indication of how high consumption is in a city. "We know of cities in low-income nations that emit less than one tonne CO2-equivalent per person per year," says Satterthwaite. "Cities in high-income nations [can] have six to 30 tonnes CO2- equivalent per person per year."&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Citizens of more affluent nations leave a much greater footprint on our planet than people living in poorer countries – although there are exceptions. Copenhagen is the capital of a high-income nation – Denmark – while Porto Alegre is in upper-middle-income Brazil. Living standards are high in both cities, yet per capita emissions are relatively low. Satterthwaite goes on to say that if we look at an individual's lifestyle, the differences between wealthy and non-wealthy groups are even more dramatic. There are many low-income urban dwellers whose consumption is so low that they contribute almost nothing to greenhouse gas emissions. So, a world with a human population of 11 billion might put comparatively little extra strain on our planet's resources. But the world is changing. Low-income urban centres may not continue on low-carbon development trajectories. The real concern would be if the people living in these areas decided to demand the lifestyles and consumption rates currently considered normal in high-income nations; something many would argue is only fair. If they do, the impact of urban population growth could be much larger.</p>
