        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Would you like to be an actor, but aren’t the right age or physical type for the part? Don’t give up: There may be a place for you in the world of voice-acting.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-year-old Rickey D’Shon Collins brings Tucker Foley to life in the cartoon <em>Danny Phantom</em>. In addition to many appearances on television and in movies, Rickey is a voice-over actor, someone we hear but don’t see. Rickey has acted since he was 6, both on and off camera. After school, his grandmother—a manager and acting coach—helped him develop his skills by doing voice exercises and reading aloud.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Voice-over actors do many kinds of acting. They are the voices of cartoon characters on television, in movies and video games, and for interactive toys. In films, they dub conversations, replacing foreign languages with English. They create crowd noises, make commercials, act in radio plays, and record telephone instructions and public announcements. They narrate books on tape, television documentaries, and even recorded museum tours.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Like other actors, voice-over actors need to understand scripts, interpret characters, and breathe correctly. They have to master voice techniques, such as pacing (how fast or slow to speak), volume (how loud or soft), and range (how high or low). Sometimes they use their normal voices; other times they change their voices to create different characters or noises.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Rickey’s manager receives his <em>Danny Phantom</em> scripts a few days before he tapes each episode. She writes helpful notes on the script to guide Rickey on speaking his part. Rickey practices, then tapes at the recording studio. He and the other cast members sit in a soundproof booth, acting out their characters as they read their lines into the microphones.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“The cartoon gets created after we record the words, so we have to imagine everything in our mind,” says Rickey. Later, the recorded words, music, and sound effects are combined with the cartoon art to create the cartoon we enjoy on TV.</p>

        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Americans talk about “the great lakes” they are usually referring to the five Great Lakes: Superior, Michigan, Huron, Ontario, and Erie. In Russia, however, there is a lake called Lake Baikal, and while it may not be one of the American Great Lakes, it certainly is the great lake. Although the surface area of other lakes in the world may be greater, in terms of sheer physical volume of water, Lake Baikal has no equal. The volume of water in the lake is <span class="txt-underline">staggering</span>, and could meet the water needs of the entire population of earth for the next 20 years. The volume of water in the lake is so great that if the lake were to be emptied, it would take all of the rivers on Earth a full year to fill it up again. The water in the lake represents nearly 20 percent of all the fresh water on the planet.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>A Remote Natural Wonder</strong>
        </p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lake Baikal is located in southern Siberia, in the region of Irkutsk, Russia. It is a lake of unimaginable size. In terms of surface dimension, the lake is about 30 miles wide. Its length is almost 400 miles, longer than Lake Superior and nearly equivalent to the drive between Winnipeg, Manitoba, and the Twin Cities. However, its plunging depth is what makes Lake Baikal so extraordinarily immense. This is the deepest lake on Earth, measuring more than 3,000 feet from the surface to the lake floor.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Creatures of the Deep Blue Lake</strong>
        </p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lake Baikal contains some of the clearest water on Earth, so clear that a person can walk on the lake’s frozen surface and see the sloping lake bottom more than 40 feet down. The lake is far deeper than that, of course, and at every level are animals that make their home in the water.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Perhaps the most interesting of these—and the most common fish in the lake—is the golomyanka or “oil fish.” During the day, this fish lives near the surface. At night, it dives to great depths, not at all bothered by the tremendous water pressure. The ability of the oil fish to swim freely at the bottom of the lake is amazing when one considers the following fact. The water pressure is so great that if a loaded cannon were to be placed on the lake floor and fired toward the surface, nothing would happen. The pressure of the water would be more than a match for the force of the explosion designed to fire the cannon’s missile toward the surface. This water pressure is so great that it is capable of twisting steel out of shape.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Another interesting creature found in Lake Baikal is a tiny freshwater shrimp called the “epishura.” Although golomyanka are the most common fish in the lake, the epishura are the most commonly-found living organisms in general. In some places, there can be more than 300,000 epishura in a single cubic foot of water. These tiny shrimp live near the surface of the lake and eat algae. They function as a living filter, cleansing the water of the lake. In fact, the cleansing done by the epishura is actually much more effective in keeping the lake clean than the fresh water brought in by all of the feeder streams to Baikal. This filtering is especially important because during the era of the Soviet Union, industrial plants were built along the shores of the lake and damaged the ecosystem.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Land and Animals Around the Lake</strong>
        </p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The landscape around Lake Baikal is varied. In some places it resembles the Lake Superior region, with forests of fir and spruce trees. In other places it is mountainous. It is in a lonely part of the world, where winter rules over all of the other seasons. Even so, this landscape supports a variety of animals, including moose, fox, lynx, and rabbit. More than 1,000 species are found that exist nowhere else on Earth. One unique bird is the Baikal tern. The lake is also home to the only freshwater seal in the world, the nerpa seal. In winter, nerpa seals can be seen basking on the ice or diving into the water in search of food. In the summer, they can be seen frisking in the water or <span class="txt-underline">lounging</span> on the rocks, just like the tourists who visit this amazing lake every year.</p>

        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Americans talk about “the great lakes” they are usually referring to the five Great Lakes: Superior, Michigan, Huron, Ontario, and Erie. In Russia, however, there is a lake called Lake Baikal, and while it may not be one of the American Great Lakes, it certainly is the great lake. Although the surface area of other lakes in the world may be greater, in terms of sheer physical volume of water, Lake Baikal has no equal. The volume of water in the lake is <span class="txt-underline">staggering</span>, and could meet the water needs of the entire population of earth for the next 20 years. The volume of water in the lake is so great that if the lake were to be emptied, it would take all of the rivers on Earth a full year to fill it up again. The water in the lake represents nearly 20 percent of all the fresh water on the planet.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>A Remote Natural Wonder</strong>
        </p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lake Baikal is located in southern Siberia, in the region of Irkutsk, Russia. It is a lake of unimaginable size. In terms of surface dimension, the lake is about 30 miles wide. Its length is almost 400 miles, longer than Lake Superior and nearly equivalent to the drive between Winnipeg, Manitoba, and the Twin Cities. However, its plunging depth is what makes Lake Baikal so extraordinarily immense. This is the deepest lake on Earth, measuring more than 3,000 feet from the surface to the lake floor.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Creatures of the Deep Blue Lake</strong>
        </p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lake Baikal contains some of the clearest water on Earth, so clear that a person can walk on the lake’s frozen surface and see the sloping lake bottom more than 40 feet down. The lake is far deeper than that, of course, and at every level are animals that make their home in the water.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Perhaps the most interesting of these—and the most common fish in the lake—is the golomyanka or “oil fish.” During the day, this fish lives near the surface. At night, it dives to great depths, not at all bothered by the tremendous water pressure. The ability of the oil fish to swim freely at the bottom of the lake is amazing when one considers the following fact. The water pressure is so great that if a loaded cannon were to be placed on the lake floor and fired toward the surface, nothing would happen. The pressure of the water would be more than a match for the force of the explosion designed to fire the cannon’s missile toward the surface. This water pressure is so great that it is capable of twisting steel out of shape.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Another interesting creature found in Lake Baikal is a tiny freshwater shrimp called the “epishura.” Although golomyanka are the most common fish in the lake, the epishura are the most commonly-found living organisms in general. In some places, there can be more than 300,000 epishura in a single cubic foot of water. These tiny shrimp live near the surface of the lake and eat algae. They function as a living filter, cleansing the water of the lake. In fact, the cleansing done by the epishura is actually much more effective in keeping the lake clean than the fresh water brought in by all of the feeder streams to Baikal. This filtering is especially important because during the era of the Soviet Union, industrial plants were built along the shores of the lake and damaged the ecosystem.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Land and Animals Around the Lake</strong>
        </p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The landscape around Lake Baikal is varied. In some places it resembles the Lake Superior region, with forests of fir and spruce trees. In other places it is mountainous. It is in a lonely part of the world, where winter rules over all of the other seasons. Even so, this landscape supports a variety of animals, including moose, fox, lynx, and rabbit. More than 1,000 species are found that exist nowhere else on Earth. One unique bird is the Baikal tern. The lake is also home to the only freshwater seal in the world, the nerpa seal. In winter, nerpa seals can be seen basking on the ice or diving into the water in search of food. In the summer, they can be seen frisking in the water or <span class="txt-underline">lounging</span> on the rocks, just like the tourists who visit this amazing lake every year.</p>

        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Americans talk about “the great lakes” they are usually referring to the five Great Lakes: Superior, Michigan, Huron, Ontario, and Erie. In Russia, however, there is a lake called Lake Baikal, and while it may not be one of the American Great Lakes, it certainly is the great lake. Although the surface area of other lakes in the world may be greater, in terms of sheer physical volume of water, Lake Baikal has no equal. The volume of water in the lake is <span class="txt-underline">staggering</span>, and could meet the water needs of the entire population of earth for the next 20 years. The volume of water in the lake is so great that if the lake were to be emptied, it would take all of the rivers on Earth a full year to fill it up again. The water in the lake represents nearly 20 percent of all the fresh water on the planet.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>A Remote Natural Wonder</strong>
        </p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lake Baikal is located in southern Siberia, in the region of Irkutsk, Russia. It is a lake of unimaginable size. In terms of surface dimension, the lake is about 30 miles wide. Its length is almost 400 miles, longer than Lake Superior and nearly equivalent to the drive between Winnipeg, Manitoba, and the Twin Cities. However, its plunging depth is what makes Lake Baikal so extraordinarily immense. This is the deepest lake on Earth, measuring more than 3,000 feet from the surface to the lake floor.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Creatures of the Deep Blue Lake</strong>
        </p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lake Baikal contains some of the clearest water on Earth, so clear that a person can walk on the lake’s frozen surface and see the sloping lake bottom more than 40 feet down. The lake is far deeper than that, of course, and at every level are animals that make their home in the water.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Perhaps the most interesting of these—and the most common fish in the lake—is the golomyanka or “oil fish.” During the day, this fish lives near the surface. At night, it dives to great depths, not at all bothered by the tremendous water pressure. The ability of the oil fish to swim freely at the bottom of the lake is amazing when one considers the following fact. The water pressure is so great that if a loaded cannon were to be placed on the lake floor and fired toward the surface, nothing would happen. The pressure of the water would be more than a match for the force of the explosion designed to fire the cannon’s missile toward the surface. This water pressure is so great that it is capable of twisting steel out of shape.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Another interesting creature found in Lake Baikal is a tiny freshwater shrimp called the “epishura.” Although golomyanka are the most common fish in the lake, the epishura are the most commonly-found living organisms in general. In some places, there can be more than 300,000 epishura in a single cubic foot of water. These tiny shrimp live near the surface of the lake and eat algae. They function as a living filter, cleansing the water of the lake. In fact, the cleansing done by the epishura is actually much more effective in keeping the lake clean than the fresh water brought in by all of the feeder streams to Baikal. This filtering is especially important because during the era of the Soviet Union, industrial plants were built along the shores of the lake and damaged the ecosystem.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Land and Animals Around the Lake</strong>
        </p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The landscape around Lake Baikal is varied. In some places it resembles the Lake Superior region, with forests of fir and spruce trees. In other places it is mountainous. It is in a lonely part of the world, where winter rules over all of the other seasons. Even so, this landscape supports a variety of animals, including moose, fox, lynx, and rabbit. More than 1,000 species are found that exist nowhere else on Earth. One unique bird is the Baikal tern. The lake is also home to the only freshwater seal in the world, the nerpa seal. In winter, nerpa seals can be seen basking on the ice or diving into the water in search of food. In the summer, they can be seen frisking in the water or <span class="txt-underline">lounging</span> on the rocks, just like the tourists who visit this amazing lake every year.</p>

        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Americans talk about “the great lakes” they are usually referring to the five Great Lakes: Superior, Michigan, Huron, Ontario, and Erie. In Russia, however, there is a lake called Lake Baikal, and while it may not be one of the American Great Lakes, it certainly is the great lake. Although the surface area of other lakes in the world may be greater, in terms of sheer physical volume of water, Lake Baikal has no equal. The volume of water in the lake is <span class="txt-underline">staggering</span>, and could meet the water needs of the entire population of earth for the next 20 years. The volume of water in the lake is so great that if the lake were to be emptied, it would take all of the rivers on Earth a full year to fill it up again. The water in the lake represents nearly 20 percent of all the fresh water on the planet.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>A Remote Natural Wonder</strong>
        </p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lake Baikal is located in southern Siberia, in the region of Irkutsk, Russia. It is a lake of unimaginable size. In terms of surface dimension, the lake is about 30 miles wide. Its length is almost 400 miles, longer than Lake Superior and nearly equivalent to the drive between Winnipeg, Manitoba, and the Twin Cities. However, its plunging depth is what makes Lake Baikal so extraordinarily immense. This is the deepest lake on Earth, measuring more than 3,000 feet from the surface to the lake floor.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Creatures of the Deep Blue Lake</strong>
        </p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lake Baikal contains some of the clearest water on Earth, so clear that a person can walk on the lake’s frozen surface and see the sloping lake bottom more than 40 feet down. The lake is far deeper than that, of course, and at every level are animals that make their home in the water.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Perhaps the most interesting of these—and the most common fish in the lake—is the golomyanka or “oil fish.” During the day, this fish lives near the surface. At night, it dives to great depths, not at all bothered by the tremendous water pressure. The ability of the oil fish to swim freely at the bottom of the lake is amazing when one considers the following fact. The water pressure is so great that if a loaded cannon were to be placed on the lake floor and fired toward the surface, nothing would happen. The pressure of the water would be more than a match for the force of the explosion designed to fire the cannon’s missile toward the surface. This water pressure is so great that it is capable of twisting steel out of shape.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Another interesting creature found in Lake Baikal is a tiny freshwater shrimp called the “epishura.” Although golomyanka are the most common fish in the lake, the epishura are the most commonly-found living organisms in general. In some places, there can be more than 300,000 epishura in a single cubic foot of water. These tiny shrimp live near the surface of the lake and eat algae. They function as a living filter, cleansing the water of the lake. In fact, the cleansing done by the epishura is actually much more effective in keeping the lake clean than the fresh water brought in by all of the feeder streams to Baikal. This filtering is especially important because during the era of the Soviet Union, industrial plants were built along the shores of the lake and damaged the ecosystem.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Land and Animals Around the Lake</strong>
        </p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The landscape around Lake Baikal is varied. In some places it resembles the Lake Superior region, with forests of fir and spruce trees. In other places it is mountainous. It is in a lonely part of the world, where winter rules over all of the other seasons. Even so, this landscape supports a variety of animals, including moose, fox, lynx, and rabbit. More than 1,000 species are found that exist nowhere else on Earth. One unique bird is the Baikal tern. The lake is also home to the only freshwater seal in the world, the nerpa seal. In winter, nerpa seals can be seen basking on the ice or diving into the water in search of food. In the summer, they can be seen frisking in the water or <span class="txt-underline">lounging</span> on the rocks, just like the tourists who visit this amazing lake every year.</p>
