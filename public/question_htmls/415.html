        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; It’s a rainy, gloomy day again and there’s nothing to do. You don’t feel like sitting quietly but you’re not allowed to make a lot of noise. What can you do for fun? Try balloon volleyball.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Items needed for this game:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>a balloon (or two, in case the first one bursts)</li>
          <li>some string or yarn</li>
          <li>two chairs</li>
          <li>at least two people and a room</li>
        </ul>
        <p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Set up the room. If you’re in the living room, or a family room, be sure to move all the furniture out of the way. Get two chairs and set them in the middle, outer edges of the room. They should be at the same place you would put a volleyball net. Turn them so that the seat is facing the wall, not the “playing” space. Tie the string or yarn onto the top of one chair, and run the rest of the string to the other chair. Now tie it on this chair at the same place as the first chair. You can decide the “out-of-bounds” lines, if you want to have them, but they really are not necessary in this game.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Blow up the balloon. Choose sides. You will play this game on your knees (at least until they start hurting and you want to stand). Each side must get the balloon over the string in three hits. If it does not get over, the other side gets the balloon and a point. This game becomes more difficult because you must play without talking.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;You can also add other rules to make it more difficult; for example, you can only use your left hand or only your right hand to hit the balloon.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Continue playing until one side gets 10 points. You can make your game longer or shorter by changing the number of points it takes to win.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This is a fun way to get your energy out, have fun, and not make too much noise on a rainy, stay-in-the-house day!</p>

        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mrs. Radcliff wasn't really as mean as everyone said. At least that’s what Jordan kept telling himself on the way to ring the doorbell at the scariest-looking house in the neighborhood. He had picked Mrs. Radcliff’s house because he figured no one else would come here to ask for work. Looking at the house, Jordan decided that Mrs. Radcliff could use his help. The place was a mess.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As he got closer to Mrs. Radcliff’s house, Jordan started thinking about the other jobs his grandmother said he could do around the neighborhood: mow lawns, rake leaves, plant flowers. He thought about turning around and walking in the opposite direction, but he knew that the bicycle he wanted cost a lot of money. He told himself that he should at least talk to Mrs. Radcliff.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The gate into Mrs. Radcliff ’s yard opened with a scary squeak. “That’s all right,” Jordan said to himself as he felt his heart beating faster. “I can fix that.”</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The path leading to the house was overgrown with weeds and bushes. “That’s O.K.,” Jordan thought. “I can trim the bushes and pull those weeds.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Jordan climbed the stairs up to the front porch, the second step creaked. He stopped and thought about leaving. Instead, he whispered, “That’s O.K., too. Maybe I can fix the boards. I’ll do anything for the bike. Anything for the bike.”</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Taking a deep breath, Jordan knocked on the old door. When he heard rustling inside, he took a step back. “If I’m really quick,” Jordan thought, “I can be gone before the door opens.” But the&nbsp;doorknob rattled, and Jordan’s feet seemed to be frozen on the porch. The door opened just a little, and somebody said, “Yes?”</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jordan was afraid of what he would see. The kids in the neighborhood told stories about Mrs. Radcliff. It was said that no one came to see her and that she never went out. As the yard inside the fence had grown wilder over the last year, so had the stories. Soon the kids had begun talking about dogs and cats disappearing and strange lights being on at all hours of the night.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The door opened all the way. Jordan swallowed when he saw that shadows covered the woman’s face. “Yes?” she said again.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jordan had trouble moving his mouth. Finally he licked his lips and cleared his throat. “My name is Jordan Wells,” he said in a shaky voice. “I live with my grandma down the street. I was wondering whether you had any work I could do around here.”</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You’re Lillian Wells’s grandson,” Mrs. Radcliff said in a quiet voice. Then she turned her head toward her yard. “Well, yes, I guess I could use some help. Please come in.”</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jordan didn’t know whether he really wanted to go inside. “Anything for the bike,” he reminded himself. Mrs. Radcliff stepped back and held open the door. Jordan watched her closely as he stepped inside the dark house. “Sorry it’s so dark,” she said, looking upward. “I guess that bulb is burned out.”</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jordan wondered whether she was just trying to make her house scarier than it already was.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Come into the kitchen,” Mrs. Radcliff said as she walked in the dark. Jordan stood still, letting his eyes adjust to the darkness. When he could see, he noticed that all the furniture was covered with sheets. At least he thought it was furniture.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Coming?” Mrs. Radcliff said.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Yes, ma’am,” Jordan said nervously, not sure what he had gotten himself into. “Anything for the bike,” he mumbled to himself.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then Jordan heard a <span class="txt-underline">shrill</span> noise that sounded like a scream. The loud noise scared him so badly that he couldn’t take another step. He felt as if he were a tree with its roots stuck deep in the ground. “You’re just in time!” Mrs. Radcliff said.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mrs. Radcliff swung open the kitchen door. The room was bright and cheerful inside. A teakettle on the stove was whistling. Mrs. Radcliff smiled, and Jordan was reminded of his grandmother.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You know, I used to go to school with your grandmother when we were little,” she said. “That was a long time ago. It’s been a little difficult for me to do everything around here since my children moved away.”</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jordan looked at the woman and smiled. “What kind of work can I help you with?” he asked.</p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Well,” she said, getting out another cup, “I always have a cup of hot chocolate this time of day. How about starting with that?”</p>

        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You’re Lillian Wells’s grandson,” Mrs. Radcliff said in a quiet voice. Then she turned her head toward her yard. “Well, yes, I guess I could use some help. Please come in.”</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jordan didn’t know whether he really wanted to go inside. “Anything for the bike,” he reminded himself. Mrs. Radcliff stepped back and held open the door. Jordan watched her closely as he stepped inside the dark house. “Sorry it’s so dark,” she said, looking upward. “I guess that bulb is burned out.”</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jordan wondered whether she was just trying to make her house scarier than it already was.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Come into the kitchen,” Mrs. Radcliff said as she walked in the dark. Jordan stood still, letting his eyes adjust to the darkness. When he could see, he noticed that all the furniture was covered with sheets. At least he thought it was furniture.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Coming?” Mrs. Radcliff said.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Yes, ma’am,” Jordan said nervously, not sure what he had gotten himself into. “Anything for the bike,” he mumbled to himself.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then Jordan heard a <span class="txt-underline">shrill</span> noise that sounded like a scream. The loud noise scared him so badly that he couldn’t take another step. He felt as if he were a tree with its roots stuck deep in the ground. “You’re just in time!” Mrs. Radcliff said.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mrs. Radcliff swung open the kitchen door. The room was bright and cheerful inside. A teakettle on the stove was whistling. Mrs. Radcliff smiled, and Jordan was reminded of his grandmother.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You know, I used to go to school with your grandmother when we were little,” she said. “That was a long time ago. It’s been a little difficult for me to do everything around here since my children moved away.”</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jordan looked at the woman and smiled. “What kind of work can I help you with?” he asked.</p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Well,” she said, getting out another cup, “I always have a cup of hot chocolate this time of day. How about starting with that?”</p>

        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mrs. Radcliff wasn't really as mean as everyone said. At least that’s what Jordan kept telling himself on the way to ring the doorbell at the scariest-looking house in the neighborhood. He had picked Mrs. Radcliff’s house because he figured no one else would come here to ask for work. Looking at the house, Jordan decided that Mrs. Radcliff could use his help. The place was a mess.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As he got closer to Mrs. Radcliff’s house, Jordan started thinking about the other jobs his grandmother said he could do around the neighborhood: mow lawns, rake leaves, plant flowers. He thought about turning around and walking in the opposite direction, but he knew that the bicycle he wanted cost a lot of money. He told himself that he should at least talk to Mrs. Radcliff.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The gate into Mrs. Radcliff ’s yard opened with a scary squeak. “That’s all right,” Jordan said to himself as he felt his heart beating faster. “I can fix that.”</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The path leading to the house was overgrown with weeds and bushes. “That’s O.K.,” Jordan thought. “I can trim the bushes and pull those weeds.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Jordan climbed the stairs up to the front porch, the second step creaked. He stopped and thought about leaving. Instead, he whispered, “That’s O.K., too. Maybe I can fix the boards. I’ll do anything for the bike. Anything for the bike.”</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Taking a deep breath, Jordan knocked on the old door. When he heard rustling inside, he took a step back. “If I’m really quick,” Jordan thought, “I can be gone before the door opens.” But the&nbsp;doorknob rattled, and Jordan’s feet seemed to be frozen on the porch. The door opened just a little, and somebody said, “Yes?”</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jordan was afraid of what he would see. The kids in the neighborhood told stories about Mrs. Radcliff. It was said that no one came to see her and that she never went out. As the yard inside the fence had grown wilder over the last year, so had the stories. Soon the kids had begun talking about dogs and cats disappearing and strange lights being on at all hours of the night.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The door opened all the way. Jordan swallowed when he saw that shadows covered the woman’s face. “Yes?” she said again.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jordan had trouble moving his mouth. Finally he licked his lips and cleared his throat. “My name is Jordan Wells,” he said in a shaky voice. “I live with my grandma down the street. I was wondering whether you had any work I could do around here.”</p>

Jordan watched her closely as he stepped inside the dark house. “Sorry it’s so dark,” she said, looking upward. “I guess that bulb is burned out.”</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jordan wondered whether she was just trying to make her house scarier than it already was.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Come into the kitchen,” Mrs. Radcliff said as she walked in the dark. Jordan stood still, letting his eyes adjust to the darkness. When he could see, he noticed that all the furniture was covered with sheets. At least he thought it was furniture.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Coming?” Mrs. Radcliff said.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Yes, ma’am,” Jordan said nervously, not sure what he had gotten himself into. “Anything for the bike,” he mumbled to himself.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then Jordan heard a <span class="txt-underline">shrill</span> noise that sounded like a scream. The loud noise scared him so badly that he couldn’t take another step. He felt as if he were a tree with its roots stuck deep in the ground. “You’re just in time!” Mrs. Radcliff said.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mrs. Radcliff swung open the kitchen door. The room was bright and cheerful inside. A teakettle on the stove was whistling. Mrs. Radcliff smiled, and Jordan was reminded of his grandmother.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You know, I used to go to school with your grandmother when we were little,” she said. “That was a long time ago. It’s been a little difficult for me to do everything around here since my children moved away.”</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jordan looked at the woman and smiled. “What kind of work can I help you with?” he asked.</p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Well,” she said, getting out another cup, “I always have a cup of hot chocolate this time of day. How about starting with that?”</p>

          <strong>Anything for the Bike</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mrs. Radcliff wasn't really as mean as everyone said. At least that’s what Jordan kept telling himself on the way to ring the doorbell at the scariest-looking house in the neighborhood. He had picked Mrs. Radcliff’s house because he figured no one else would come here to ask for work. Looking at the house, Jordan decided that Mrs. Radcliff could use his help. The place was a mess.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As he got closer to Mrs. Radcliff’s house, Jordan started thinking about the other jobs his grandmother said he could do around the neighborhood: mow lawns, rake leaves, plant flowers. He thought about turning around and walking in the opposite direction, but he knew that the bicycle he wanted cost a lot of money. He told himself that he should at least talk to Mrs. Radcliff.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The gate into Mrs. Radcliff ’s yard opened with a scary squeak. “That’s all right,” Jordan said to himself as he felt his heart beating faster. “I can fix that.”</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The path leading to the house was overgrown with weeds and bushes. “That’s O.K.,” Jordan thought. “I can trim the bushes and pull those weeds.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Jordan climbed the stairs up to the front porch, the second step creaked. He stopped and thought about leaving. Instead, he whispered, “That’s O.K., too. Maybe I can fix the boards. I’ll do anything for the bike. Anything for the bike.”</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Taking a deep breath, Jordan knocked on the old door. When he heard rustling inside, he took a step back. “If I’m really quick,” Jordan thought, “I can be gone before the door opens.” But the&nbsp;doorknob rattled, and Jordan’s feet seemed to be frozen on the porch. The door opened just a little, and somebody said, “Yes?”</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jordan was afraid of what he would see. The kids in the neighborhood told stories about Mrs. Radcliff. It was said that no one came to see her and that she never went out. As the yard inside the fence had grown wilder over the last year, so had the stories. Soon the kids had begun talking about dogs and cats disappearing and strange lights being on at all hours of the night.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The door opened all the way. Jordan swallowed when he saw that shadows covered the woman’s face. “Yes?” she said again.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jordan had trouble moving his mouth. Finally he licked his lips and cleared his throat. “My name is Jordan Wells,” he said in a shaky voice. “I live with my grandma down the street. I was wondering whether you had any work I could do around here.”</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You’re Lillian Wells’s grandson,” Mrs. Radcliff said in a quiet voice. Then she turned her head toward her yard. “Well, yes, I guess I could use some help. Please come in.”</p>

        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Come into the kitchen,” Mrs. Radcliff said as she walked in the dark. Jordan stood still, letting his eyes adjust to the darkness. When he could see, he noticed that all the furniture was covered with sheets. At least he thought it was furniture.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Coming?” Mrs. Radcliff said.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Yes, ma’am,” Jordan said nervously, not sure what he had gotten himself into. “Anything for the bike,” he mumbled to himself.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then Jordan heard a <span class="txt-underline">shrill</span> noise that sounded like a scream. The loud noise scared him so badly that he couldn’t take another step. He felt as if he were a tree with its roots stuck deep in the ground. “You’re just in time!” Mrs. Radcliff said.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mrs. Radcliff swung open the kitchen door. The room was bright and cheerful inside. A teakettle on the stove was whistling. Mrs. Radcliff smiled, and Jordan was reminded of his grandmother.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You know, I used to go to school with your grandmother when we were little,” she said. “That was a long time ago. It’s been a little difficult for me to do everything around here since my children moved away.”</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jordan looked at the woman and smiled. “What kind of work can I help you with?” he asked.</p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Well,” she said, getting out another cup, “I always have a cup of hot chocolate this time of day. How about starting with that?”</p>

          <strong>Anything for the Bike</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mrs. Radcliff wasn't really as mean as everyone said. At least that’s what Jordan kept telling himself on the way to ring the doorbell at the scariest-looking house in the neighborhood. He had picked Mrs. Radcliff’s house because he figured no one else would come here to ask for work. Looking at the house, Jordan decided that Mrs. Radcliff could use his help. The place was a mess.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As he got closer to Mrs. Radcliff’s house, Jordan started thinking about the other jobs his grandmother said he could do around the neighborhood: mow lawns, rake leaves, plant flowers. He thought about turning around and walking in the opposite direction, but he knew that the bicycle he wanted cost a lot of money. He told himself that he should at least talk to Mrs. Radcliff.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The gate into Mrs. Radcliff ’s yard opened with a scary squeak. “That’s all right,” Jordan said to himself as he felt his heart beating faster. “I can fix that.”</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The path leading to the house was overgrown with weeds and bushes. “That’s O.K.,” Jordan thought. “I can trim the bushes and pull those weeds.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Jordan climbed the stairs up to the front porch, the second step creaked. He stopped and thought about leaving. Instead, he whispered, “That’s O.K., too. Maybe I can fix the boards. I’ll do anything for the bike. Anything for the bike.”</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Taking a deep breath, Jordan knocked on the old door. When he heard rustling inside, he took a step back. “If I’m really quick,” Jordan thought, “I can be gone before the door opens.” But the&nbsp;doorknob rattled, and Jordan’s feet seemed to be frozen on the porch. The door opened just a little, and somebody said, “Yes?”</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jordan was afraid of what he would see. The kids in the neighborhood told stories about Mrs. Radcliff. It was said that no one came to see her and that she never went out. As the yard inside the fence had grown wilder over the last year, so had the stories. Soon the kids had begun talking about dogs and cats disappearing and strange lights being on at all hours of the night.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The door opened all the way. Jordan swallowed when he saw that shadows covered the woman’s face. “Yes?” she said again.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jordan had trouble moving his mouth. Finally he licked his lips and cleared his throat. “My name is Jordan Wells,” he said in a shaky voice. “I live with my grandma down the street. I was wondering whether you had any work I could do around here.”</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You’re Lillian Wells’s grandson,” Mrs. Radcliff said in a quiet voice. Then she turned her head toward her yard. “Well, yes, I guess I could use some help. Please come in.”</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jordan didn’t know whether he really wanted to go inside. “Anything for the bike,” he reminded himself. Mrs. Radcliff stepped back and held open the door. Jordan watched her closely as he stepped inside the dark house. “Sorry it’s so dark,” she said, looking upward. “I guess that bulb is burned out.”</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jordan wondered whether she was just trying to make her house scarier than it already was.</p>

        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then Jordan heard a <span class="txt-underline">shrill</span> noise that sounded like a scream. The loud noise scared him so badly that he couldn’t take another step. He felt as if he were a tree with its roots stuck deep in the ground. “You’re just in time!” Mrs. Radcliff said.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mrs. Radcliff swung open the kitchen door. The room was bright and cheerful inside. A teakettle on the stove was whistling. Mrs. Radcliff smiled, and Jordan was reminded of his grandmother.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You know, I used to go to school with your grandmother when we were little,” she said. “That was a long time ago. It’s been a little difficult for me to do everything around here since my children moved away.”</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jordan looked at the woman and smiled. “What kind of work can I help you with?” he asked.</p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Well,” she said, getting out another cup, “I always have a cup of hot chocolate this time of day. How about starting with that?”</p>

        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mrs. Radcliff wasn't really as mean as everyone said. At least that’s what Jordan kept telling himself on the way to ring the doorbell at the scariest-looking house in the neighborhood. He had picked Mrs. Radcliff’s house because he figured no one else would come here to ask for work. Looking at the house, Jordan decided that Mrs. Radcliff could use his help. The place was a mess.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As he got closer to Mrs. Radcliff’s house, Jordan started thinking about the other jobs his grandmother said he could do around the neighborhood: mow lawns, rake leaves, plant flowers. He thought about turning around and walking in the opposite direction, but he knew that the bicycle he wanted cost a lot of money. He told himself that he should at least talk to Mrs. Radcliff.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The gate into Mrs. Radcliff ’s yard opened with a scary squeak. “That’s all right,” Jordan said to himself as he felt his heart beating faster. “I can fix that.”</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The path leading to the house was overgrown with weeds and bushes. “That’s O.K.,” Jordan thought. “I can trim the bushes and pull those weeds.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Jordan climbed the stairs up to the front porch, the second step creaked. He stopped and thought about leaving. Instead, he whispered, “That’s O.K., too. Maybe I can fix the boards. I’ll do anything for the bike. Anything for the bike.”</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Taking a deep breath, Jordan knocked on the old door. When he heard rustling inside, he took a step back. “If I’m really quick,” Jordan thought, “I can be gone before the door opens.” But the&nbsp;doorknob rattled, and Jordan’s feet seemed to be frozen on the porch. The door opened just a little, and somebody said, “Yes?”</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jordan was afraid of what he would see. The kids in the neighborhood told stories about Mrs. Radcliff. It was said that no one came to see her and that she never went out. As the yard inside the fence had grown wilder over the last year, so had the stories. Soon the kids had begun talking about dogs and cats disappearing and strange lights being on at all hours of the night.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The door opened all the way. Jordan swallowed when he saw that shadows covered the woman’s face. “Yes?” she said again.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jordan had trouble moving his mouth. Finally he licked his lips and cleared his throat. “My name is Jordan Wells,” he said in a shaky voice. “I live with my grandma down the street. I was wondering whether you had any work I could do around here.”</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You’re Lillian Wells’s grandson,” Mrs. Radcliff said in a quiet voice. Then she turned her head toward her yard. “Well, yes, I guess I could use some help. Please come in.”</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jordan didn’t know whether he really wanted to go inside. “Anything for the bike,” he reminded himself. Mrs. Radcliff stepped back and held open the door. Jordan watched her closely as he stepped inside the dark house. “Sorry it’s so dark,” she said, looking upward. “I guess that bulb is burned out.”</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jordan wondered whether she was just trying to make her house scarier than it already was.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Come into the kitchen,” Mrs. Radcliff said as she walked in the dark. Jordan stood still, letting his eyes adjust to the darkness. When he could see, he noticed that all the furniture was covered with sheets. At least he thought it was furniture.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Coming?” Mrs. Radcliff said.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Yes, ma’am,” Jordan said nervously, not sure what he had gotten himself into. “Anything for the bike,” he mumbled to himself.</p>

        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mrs. Radcliff swung open the kitchen door. The room was bright and cheerful inside. A teakettle on the stove was whistling. Mrs. Radcliff smiled, and Jordan was reminded of his grandmother.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You know, I used to go to school with your grandmother when we were little,” she said. “That was a long time ago. It’s been a little difficult for me to do everything around here since my children moved away.”</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jordan looked at the woman and smiled. “What kind of work can I help you with?” he asked.</p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Well,” she said, getting out another cup, “I always have a cup of hot chocolate this time of day. How about starting with that?”</p>

        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mrs. Radcliff wasn't really as mean as everyone said. At least that’s what Jordan kept telling himself on the way to ring the doorbell at the scariest-looking house in the neighborhood. He had picked Mrs. Radcliff’s house because he figured no one else would come here to ask for work. Looking at the house, Jordan decided that Mrs. Radcliff could use his help. The place was a mess.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As he got closer to Mrs. Radcliff’s house, Jordan started thinking about the other jobs his grandmother said he could do around the neighborhood: mow lawns, rake leaves, plant flowers. He thought about turning around and walking in the opposite direction, but he knew that the bicycle he wanted cost a lot of money. He told himself that he should at least talk to Mrs. Radcliff.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The gate into Mrs. Radcliff ’s yard opened with a scary squeak. “That’s all right,” Jordan said to himself as he felt his heart beating faster. “I can fix that.”</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The path leading to the house was overgrown with weeds and bushes. “That’s O.K.,” Jordan thought. “I can trim the bushes and pull those weeds.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Jordan climbed the stairs up to the front porch, the second step creaked. He stopped and thought about leaving. Instead, he whispered, “That’s O.K., too. Maybe I can fix the boards. I’ll do anything for the bike. Anything for the bike.”</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Taking a deep breath, Jordan knocked on the old door. When he heard rustling inside, he took a step back. “If I’m really quick,” Jordan thought, “I can be gone before the door opens.” But the&nbsp;doorknob rattled, and Jordan’s feet seemed to be frozen on the porch. The door opened just a little, and somebody said, “Yes?”</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jordan was afraid of what he would see. The kids in the neighborhood told stories about Mrs. Radcliff. It was said that no one came to see her and that she never went out. As the yard inside the fence had grown wilder over the last year, so had the stories. Soon the kids had begun talking about dogs and cats disappearing and strange lights being on at all hours of the night.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The door opened all the way. Jordan swallowed when he saw that shadows covered the woman’s face. “Yes?” she said again.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jordan had trouble moving his mouth. Finally he licked his lips and cleared his throat. “My name is Jordan Wells,” he said in a shaky voice. “I live with my grandma down the street. I was wondering whether you had any work I could do around here.”</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You’re Lillian Wells’s grandson,” Mrs. Radcliff said in a quiet voice. Then she turned her head toward her yard. “Well, yes, I guess I could use some help. Please come in.”</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jordan didn’t know whether he really wanted to go inside. “Anything for the bike,” he reminded himself. Mrs. Radcliff stepped back and held open the door. Jordan watched her closely as he stepped inside the dark house. “Sorry it’s so dark,” she said, looking upward. “I guess that bulb is burned out.”</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jordan wondered whether she was just trying to make her house scarier than it already was.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Come into the kitchen,” Mrs. Radcliff said as she walked in the dark. Jordan stood still, letting his eyes adjust to the darkness. When he could see, he noticed that all the furniture was covered with sheets. At least he thought it was furniture.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Coming?” Mrs. Radcliff said.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Yes, ma’am,” Jordan said nervously, not sure what he had gotten himself into. “Anything for the bike,” he mumbled to himself.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then Jordan heard a <span class="txt-underline">shrill</span> noise that sounded like a scream. The loud noise scared him so badly that he couldn’t take another step. He felt as if he were a tree with its roots stuck deep in the ground. “You’re just in time!” Mrs. Radcliff said.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mrs. Radcliff swung open the kitchen door. The room was bright and cheerful inside. A teakettle on the stove was whistling. Mrs. Radcliff smiled, and Jordan was reminded of his grandmother.</p>

        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mrs. Radcliff wasn't really as mean as everyone said. At least that’s what Jordan kept telling himself on the way to ring the doorbell at the scariest-looking house in the neighborhood. He had picked Mrs. Radcliff’s house because he figured no one else would come here to ask for work. Looking at the house, Jordan decided that Mrs. Radcliff could use his help. The place was a mess.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As he got closer to Mrs. Radcliff’s house, Jordan started thinking about the other jobs his grandmother said he could do around the neighborhood: mow lawns, rake leaves, plant flowers. He thought about turning around and walking in the opposite direction, but he knew that the bicycle he wanted cost a lot of money. He told himself that he should at least talk to Mrs. Radcliff.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The gate into Mrs. Radcliff ’s yard opened with a scary squeak. “That’s all right,” Jordan said to himself as he felt his heart beating faster. “I can fix that.”</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The path leading to the house was overgrown with weeds and bushes. “That’s O.K.,” Jordan thought. “I can trim the bushes and pull those weeds.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Jordan climbed the stairs up to the front porch, the second step creaked. He stopped and thought about leaving. Instead, he whispered, “That’s O.K., too. Maybe I can fix the boards. I’ll do anything for the bike. Anything for the bike.”</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Taking a deep breath, Jordan knocked on the old door. When he heard rustling inside, he took a step back. “If I’m really quick,” Jordan thought, “I can be gone before the door opens.” But the&nbsp;doorknob rattled, and Jordan’s feet seemed to be frozen on the porch. The door opened just a little, and somebody said, “Yes?”</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jordan was afraid of what he would see. The kids in the neighborhood told stories about Mrs. Radcliff. It was said that no one came to see her and that she never went out. As the yard inside the fence had grown wilder over the last year, so had the stories. Soon the kids had begun talking about dogs and cats disappearing and strange lights being on at all hours of the night.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The door opened all the way. Jordan swallowed when he saw that shadows covered the woman’s face. “Yes?” she said again.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jordan had trouble moving his mouth. Finally he licked his lips and cleared his throat. “My name is Jordan Wells,” he said in a shaky voice. “I live with my grandma down the street. I was wondering whether you had any work I could do around here.”</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You’re Lillian Wells’s grandson,” Mrs. Radcliff said in a quiet voice. Then she turned her head toward her yard. “Well, yes, I guess I could use some help. Please come in.”</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jordan didn’t know whether he really wanted to go inside. “Anything for the bike,” he reminded himself. Mrs. Radcliff stepped back and held open the door. Jordan watched her closely as he stepped inside the dark house. “Sorry it’s so dark,” she said, looking upward. “I guess that bulb is burned out.”</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jordan wondered whether she was just trying to make her house scarier than it already was.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Come into the kitchen,” Mrs. Radcliff said as she walked in the dark. Jordan stood still, letting his eyes adjust to the darkness. When he could see, he noticed that all the furniture was covered with sheets. At least he thought it was furniture.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Coming?” Mrs. Radcliff said.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Yes, ma’am,” Jordan said nervously, not sure what he had gotten himself into. “Anything for the bike,” he mumbled to himself.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then Jordan heard a <span class="txt-underline">shrill</span> noise that sounded like a scream. The loud noise scared him so badly that he couldn’t take another step. He felt as if he were a tree with its roots stuck deep in the ground. “You’re just in time!” Mrs. Radcliff said.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mrs. Radcliff swung open the kitchen door. The room was bright and cheerful inside. A teakettle on the stove was whistling. Mrs. Radcliff smiled, and Jordan was reminded of his grandmother.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You know, I used to go to school with your grandmother when we were little,” she said. “That was a long time ago. It’s been a little difficult for me to do everything around here since my children moved away.”</p>

        <p class="txt-ctr"><strong>Training Luke</strong><br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Luke almost always keeps his brown eyes on his owner Kathy. When she raises her right thumb, Luke knows he’s been good. When Kathy holds her right hand in front of Luke, he sits. Kathy uses hand signals to train Luke because he is deaf.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Training a deaf dog can take more time than teaching a hearing dog. An owner must use signs to communicate commands. Some owners use American Sign Language, and others make up their own signs. Like hearing dogs, deaf dogs should first learn to sit, lie down, stay, come, and stop. Other commands can then be added one at a time. Luke is just one year old, and he knows 20 commands!</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To get Luke’s attention in the house, Kathy stomps her foot. The dog can feel the vibrations through the floor. Outdoors, during daylight hours, Kathy waves at Luke until he notices her. If Luke is in the backyard at night, Kathy calls him by turning the porch light off and on. Luke also wears a bell on his collar so that Kathy can monitor where he is.</p>

        </p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Deaf dogs can be startled easily. Since Luke can’t hear someone walking up behind him, the surprise would often scare him when he was a puppy. To solve this&nbsp;problem, Kathy used treats. She would walk up behind Luke without his seeing her. After gently touching the dog, Kathy would quickly feed him a treat. That way, Luke learned that being touched <span class="txt-underline">unexpectedly</span> is okay.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It’s also important to know how to wake up a deaf dog. To wake Luke, Kathy holds her hand in front of his nose. She lets her smell wake him up so that he won’t be startled. If Luke is sleeping when people visit, Kathy asks them not to wake him.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Like most deaf dogs, Luke gets <span class="txt-underline">anxious</span> if he doesn’t know where his owner is. He’ll pad from room to room, searching for Kathy. Before leaving a room, Kathy makes sure to get Luke’s attention. Sometimes Luke follows her, but other times he just sighs and goes back to sleep.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kathy and Luke spend about 15 minutes every day working on old and new commands. With his tail wagging and nose wiggling, Luke looks as if he’s playing instead of working.</p>

        <p class="txt-ctr"><strong>Saddle Up!</strong><br>
by Mark Samson</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Two years ago Claire was scared of horses. Now she looks forward to her riding lessons on Star. Claire was born with an illness that made her muscles weak and left her with poor balance. Riding Star has helped Claire’s muscles become stronger. Her balance has also improved.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claire and Star are part of a program called hippotherapy. The Greek word hippos means “horse.” Since the 1960s hippotherapy has been used to help disabled children. The rolling gait, or walk, of a horse can help a rider’s muscles develop. A trainer walks beside the horse to keep the rider safe.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hippotherapy came about because of a woman named Lis Hartel, who loved riding horses. Hartel became ill with polio, a disease that made her unable to move her legs. Although she used a wheelchair, Hartel resolved to get back on her horse Jubilee. She made up her mind that she would ride again. She had to be lifted into the saddle, but the more she rode, the stronger she became. In 1952 and 1956&nbsp;Hartel won Olympic silver medals for riding. Her success gave doctors the idea to put disabled people on horses.</p>

        </p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Every Wednesday Claire heads out to the stable where Star lives. After putting on her helmet, Claire is helped onto Star by&nbsp;Annie, the trainer. Annie leads Claire and Star around the ring several times. Then they move to the trails near the stable. This is Claire’s favorite part of the ride. She loves the feeling of being tall in the saddle. She feels as if she’s walking easily through the woods.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the lesson is over, Claire receives <span class="txt-underline">assistance</span> from Annie in getting down from the horse. Then Claire and Annie brush Star. Finally Claire gives her horse and trainer big hugs. Claire’s balance is so good now that she usually hops on one foot out of the barn. Sometimes she even jumps rope for Annie and Star. Last year Claire wasn’t able to do either of those things.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Riding horses is also a great way to build self-confidence. Claire has learned how to&nbsp;control Star’s movements and her own as well. She’s also built a trusting relationship with the horse. One of Claire’s dreams is to ride in the Olympics. Annie thinks she just might make it.</p>

        <p class="txt-ctr"><strong>Saddle Up!</strong><br>
by Mark Samson</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Two years ago Claire was scared of horses. Now she looks forward to her riding lessons on Star. Claire was born with an illness that made her muscles weak and left her with poor balance. Riding Star has helped Claire’s muscles become stronger. Her balance has also improved.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claire and Star are part of a program called hippotherapy. The Greek word hippos means “horse.” Since the 1960s hippotherapy has been used to help disabled children. The rolling gait, or walk, of a horse can help a rider’s muscles develop. A trainer walks beside the horse to keep the rider safe.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hippotherapy came about because of a woman named Lis Hartel, who loved riding horses. Hartel became ill with polio, a disease that made her unable to move her legs. Although she used a wheelchair, Hartel resolved to get back on her horse Jubilee. She made up her mind that she would ride again. She had to be lifted into the saddle, but the more she rode, the stronger she became. In 1952 and 1956&nbsp;Hartel won Olympic silver medals for riding. Her success gave doctors the idea to put disabled people on horses.</p>

        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Every Wednesday Claire heads out to the stable where Star lives. After putting on her helmet, Claire is helped onto Star by&nbsp;Annie, the trainer. Annie leads Claire and Star around the ring several times. Then they move to the trails near the stable. This is Claire’s favorite part of the ride. She loves the feeling of being tall in the saddle. She feels as if she’s walking easily through the woods.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the lesson is over, Claire receives <span class="txt-underline">assistance</span> from Annie in getting down from the horse. Then Claire and Annie brush Star. Finally Claire gives her horse and trainer big hugs. Claire’s balance is so good now that she usually hops on one foot out of the barn. Sometimes she even jumps rope for Annie and Star. Last year Claire wasn’t able to do either of those things.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Riding horses is also a great way to build self-confidence. Claire has learned how to&nbsp;control Star’s movements and her own as well. She’s also built a trusting relationship with the horse. One of Claire’s dreams is to ride in the Olympics. Annie thinks she just might make it.</p>

Annie leads Claire and Star around the ring several times. Then they move to the trails near the stable. This is Claire’s favorite part of the ride. She loves the feeling of being tall in the saddle. She feels as if she’s walking easily through the woods.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the lesson is over, Claire receives <span class="txt-underline">assistance</span> from Annie in getting down from the horse. Then Claire and Annie brush Star. Finally Claire gives her horse and trainer big hugs. Claire’s balance is so good now that she usually hops on one foot out of the barn. Sometimes she even jumps rope for Annie and Star. Last year Claire wasn’t able to do either of those things.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Riding horses is also a great way to build self-confidence. Claire has learned how to&nbsp;control Star’s movements and her own as well. She’s also built a trusting relationship with the horse. One of Claire’s dreams is to ride in the Olympics. Annie thinks she just might make it.</p>
