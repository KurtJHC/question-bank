        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>The Hundred Dresses</strong><br><em>by Eleanor Estes</em><br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;AFTER Peggy and Maddie stopped feeling like intruders in a class that had already begun; they looked across the room and noticed that Wanda was not in her seat. Furthermore her desk was dusty and looked as though she hadn’t been there yesterday either. Come to think of it, they hadn’t seen her yesterday. They had waited for her a little while but had forgotten about her when they reached school.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;They often waited for Wanda Petronski—to have fun with her. Wanda lived way up on&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline"><strong>Boggins Heights</strong></span>, and&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline"><strong>Bog-gins Heights</strong></span>&nbsp;was no place to live. It was a good place to go and pick wild flowers in the summer, but you always held your breath till you got safely past old man Svenson’s yellow house. People in the town said old man Svenson was no good. He didn’t work and, worse still, his house and yard were disgracefully dirty, with rusty-tin cans strewn about and even an old straw hat. He lived alone with his dog and his cat. No wonder, said the people of the town. Who would live with him? And many stories circulated about him and the stories were the kind that made people scurry past his house even in broad day light and hope not to meet him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond Svenson’s there were a few small scattered frame houses, and in one of these Wanda Petronski lived with her father and her brother Jake. Wanda Petronski. Most of the children in Room 13 didn’t have names like that. They had names easy to say, like Thomas, Smith, or Allen. There was one boy named Bounce, Willie Bounce, and people thought that was funny but not funny in the same way that Petronski was.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Wanda didn’t have any friends. She came to school alone and went home alone. She always wore a faded blue dress that didn’t hang right. It was clean, but it looked as though it had never been ironed properly. She didn’t have any friends, but a lot of girls talked to her. They waited for her under the maple trees on the corner of Oliver Street. Or they surrounded her in the school yard as she stood watching some little girls play hopscotch on the worn hard ground. “Wanda,” Peggy would say in a most courteous manner, as though she were talking to Miss Mason or to the principal perhaps. “Wanda,” she’d say, giving one of her friends a nudge, “tell us. How many dresses did you say you had hanging up in your closet?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“A hundred,” said Wanda.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“A hundred!” exclaimed all the girls incredulously, and the little girls would stop playing hopscotch and listen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Yeah, a hundred, all lined up,” said Wanda. Then her thin lips drew together in silence.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“What are they like? All silk, I bet,” said Peggy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Yeah, all silk, all colours.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Velvet too?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Yeah, velvet too. A hundred dresses,” repeated Wanda stolidly. “All lined up in my closet.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Then they’d let her go. And then before she’d gone very far, they couldn’t help bursting into shrieks and peals of laughter. A hundred dresses! Obviously, the only dress Wanda had was the blue one she wore every day. So what did she say she had a hundred for? What a story! And the girls laughed derisively, while Wanda moved over to the sunny place by the ivy-covered brick wall of the school building where she usually stood and waited for the bell to ring. But if the girls had met her at the corner of Oliver Street, they’d carry her along with them for a way, stopping every few feet for more incredulous questions. And it wasn’t always dresses they talked about. Sometimes it was hats, or coats, or even shoes. “How many shoes did you say you had?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Sixty.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Sixty! Sixty pairs or sixty shoes?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Sixty pairs. All lined up in my closet.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Yesterday you said fifty.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Now I got sixty.” Cries of exaggerated politeness greeted this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“All alike?” said the girls.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh, no. Every pair is different. All colours. All lined up.” And Wanda would shift her eyes quickly from Peggy to a distant spot, as though she were looking far ahead, looking but not seeing anything. Then the outer fringe of the crowd of girls would break away gradually, laughing, and little by little, in pairs, the group would disperse.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy, who had thought up this game, and Maddie, her inseparable friend, were always the last to leave. And finally, Wanda would move up the street, her eyes dull and her mouth closed tight, hitching her left shoulder every now and then, finishing the walk to school alone.&nbsp;</p>

It was a good place to go and pick wild flowers in the summer, but you always held your breath till you got safely past old man Svenson’s yellow house. People in the town said old man Svenson was no good. He didn’t work and, worse still, his house and yard were disgracefully dirty, with rusty-tin cans strewn about and even an old straw hat. He lived alone with his dog and his cat. No wonder, said the people of the town. Who would live with him? And many stories circulated about him and the stories were the kind that made people scurry past his house even in broad day light and hope not to meet him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond Svenson’s there were a few small scattered frame houses, and in one of these Wanda Petronski lived with her father and her brother Jake. Wanda Petronski. Most of the children in Room 13 didn’t have names like that. They had names easy to say, like Thomas, Smith, or Allen. There was one boy named Bounce, Willie Bounce, and people thought that was funny but not funny in the same way that Petronski was.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Wanda didn’t have any friends. She came to school alone and went home alone. She always wore a faded blue dress that didn’t hang right. It was clean, but it looked as though it had never been ironed properly. She didn’t have any friends, but a lot of girls talked to her. They waited for her under the maple trees on the corner of Oliver Street. Or they surrounded her in the school yard as she stood watching some little girls play hopscotch on the worn hard ground. “Wanda,” Peggy would say in a most courteous manner, as though she were talking to Miss Mason or to the principal perhaps. “Wanda,” she’d say, giving one of her friends a nudge, “tell us. How many dresses did you say you had hanging up in your closet?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“A hundred,” said Wanda.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“A hundred!” exclaimed all the girls incredulously, and the little girls would stop playing hopscotch and listen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Yeah, a hundred, all lined up,” said Wanda. Then her thin lips drew together in silence.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“What are they like? All silk, I bet,” said Peggy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Yeah, all silk, all colours.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Velvet too?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Yeah, velvet too. A hundred dresses,” repeated Wanda stolidly. “All lined up in my closet.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Then they’d let her go. And then before she’d gone very far, they couldn’t help bursting into shrieks and peals of laughter. A hundred dresses! Obviously, the only dress Wanda had was the blue one she wore every day. So what did she say she had a hundred for? What a story! And the girls laughed derisively, while Wanda moved over to the sunny place by the ivy-covered brick wall of the school building where she usually stood and waited for the bell to ring. But if the girls had met her at the corner of Oliver Street, they’d carry her along with them for a way, stopping every few feet for more incredulous questions. And it wasn’t always dresses they talked about. Sometimes it was hats, or coats, or even shoes. “How many shoes did you say you had?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Sixty.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Sixty! Sixty pairs or sixty shoes?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Sixty pairs. All lined up in my closet.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Yesterday you said fifty.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Now I got sixty.” Cries of exaggerated politeness greeted this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“All alike?” said the girls.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh, no. Every pair is different. All colours. All lined up.” And Wanda would shift her eyes quickly from Peggy to a distant spot, as though she were looking far ahead, looking but not seeing anything. Then the outer fringe of the crowd of girls would break away gradually, laughing, and little by little, in pairs, the group would disperse.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy, who had thought up this game, and Maddie, her inseparable friend, were always the last to leave. And finally, Wanda would move up the street, her eyes dull and her mouth closed tight, hitching her left shoulder every now and then, finishing the walk to school alone.&nbsp;</p>

It was clean, but it looked as though it had never been ironed properly. She didn’t have any friends, but a lot of girls talked to her. They waited for her under the maple trees on the corner of Oliver Street. Or they surrounded her in the school yard as she stood watching some little girls play hopscotch on the worn hard ground. “Wanda,” Peggy would say in a most courteous manner, as though she were talking to Miss Mason or to the principal perhaps. “Wanda,” she’d say, giving one of her friends a nudge, “tell us. How many dresses did you say you had hanging up in your closet?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“A hundred,” said Wanda.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“A hundred!” exclaimed all the girls incredulously, and the little girls would stop playing hopscotch and listen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Yeah, a hundred, all lined up,” said Wanda. Then her thin lips drew together in silence.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“What are they like? All silk, I bet,” said Peggy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Yeah, all silk, all colours.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Velvet too?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Yeah, velvet too. A hundred dresses,” repeated Wanda stolidly. “All lined up in my closet.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Then they’d let her go. And then before she’d gone very far, they couldn’t help bursting into shrieks and peals of laughter. A hundred dresses! Obviously, the only dress Wanda had was the blue one she wore every day. So what did she say she had a hundred for? What a story! And the girls laughed derisively, while Wanda moved over to the sunny place by the ivy-covered brick wall of the school building where she usually stood and waited for the bell to ring. But if the girls had met her at the corner of Oliver Street, they’d carry her along with them for a way, stopping every few feet for more incredulous questions. And it wasn’t always dresses they talked about. Sometimes it was hats, or coats, or even shoes. “How many shoes did you say you had?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Sixty.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Sixty! Sixty pairs or sixty shoes?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Sixty pairs. All lined up in my closet.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Yesterday you said fifty.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Now I got sixty.” Cries of exaggerated politeness greeted this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“All alike?” said the girls.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh, no. Every pair is different. All colours. All lined up.” And Wanda would shift her eyes quickly from Peggy to a distant spot, as though she were looking far ahead, looking but not seeing anything. Then the outer fringe of the crowd of girls would break away gradually, laughing, and little by little, in pairs, the group would disperse.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Peggy, who had thought up this game, and Maddie, her inseparable friend, were always the last to leave. And finally, Wanda would move up the street, her eyes dull and her mouth closed tight, hitching her left shoulder every now and then, finishing the walk to school alone.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>The Silver Chair</strong><br><br><em>by C.S.Lewis</em><br><br>
Without a glance at Jill the lion rose to its feet and gave one last blow. Then, as if satisfied with its work, it turned and stalked slowly away, back into the forest.<br>
<br>
"It must be a dream, it must, it must," said Jill to herself. "I'll wake up in a moment." But it wasn't, and she didn't.<br>
<br>
"I do wish we'd never come to this dreadful place," said Jill. "I don't believe Scrubb knew any more about it than I do. Or if he did, he had no business to bring me here without warning me what it was like. It's not my fault he fell over that cliff. If he'd left me alone we should both be all right." Then she remembered again the scream that Scrubb had given when he fell, and burst into tears.<br>
<br>
Crying is all right in its way while it lasts. But you have to stop sooner or later and then you still have to decide what to do. When Jill stopped, she found she was dreadfully thirsty. She had been lying face downward, and now she sat up. The birds had ceased singing and there was perfect silence except for one small persistent sound which seemed to come a good distance away. She listened carefully and felt almost sure it was the sound of running water.<br>
<br>
Jill got up and looked round her very carefully. There was no sign of the lion; but there were so many trees about that it might easily be quite close without her seeing it. For all she knew, there might be several lions. But her thirst was very bad now, and she plucked up her courage to go and look for that running water. She went on tip-toes, stealing cautiously from tree to tree, and stopping to peer round her at every step.<br>
<br>
The wood was so still that it was not difficult to decide where the sound was coming from. It grew clearer every moment and, sooner than she expected, she came to an open glade and saw the stream, bright as glass, running across the turf a stone's throw away from her. But although the sight of the water made her feel ten times thirstier than before, she didn't rush forward and drink. She stood as still as if she had been turned into stone, with her mouth wide open. And she had a very good reason; just on this side of the stream lay the lion.<br>
<br>
It lay with its head raised and its two fore-paws out in front of it, like the lions in Trafalgar Square. She knew at once that it had seen her, for its eyes looked straight into hers for a moment and then turned away—as if it knew her quite well and didn't think much of her.<br>
<br>
"If I run away, it'll be after me in a moment," thought Jill. "And if I go on, I shall run straight into its mouth." Anyway, she couldn't have moved if she had tried, and she couldn't take her eyes off it. How long this lasted, she could not be sure; it seemed like hours. And the thirst became so bad that she almost felt she would not mind being eaten by the lion if only she could be sure of getting a mouthful of water first.<br>
<br>
"If you're thirsty, you may drink."<br>
<br>
They were the first words she had heard since Scrubb had spoken to her on the edge of the cliff. For a second she stared here and there, wondering who had spoken. Then the voice said again, "If you are thirsty, come and drink," and of course she remembered what Scrubb had said about animals talking in that other world, and realised that it was the lion speaking. Anyway, she had seen its lips move this time, and the voice was not like a man's. It was deeper, wilder, and stronger; a sort of heavy, golden voice. It did not make her any less frightened than she had been before, but it made her frightened in rather a different way.<br>
<br>
"Are you not thirsty?" said the Lion.<br>
<br>
"I'm dying of thirst," said Jill.<br>
<br>
"Then drink," said the Lion.<br>
<br>
"May I—could I—would you mind going away while do?" said Jill.<br>
<br>
The Lion answered this only by a look and a very low growl. And as Jill gazed at its motionless bulk, she realised that she might as well have asked the whole mountain to move aside for her convenience.<br>
<br>
The delicious rippling noise of the stream was driving her nearly frantic.<br>
<br>
"Will you promise not to—do anything to me, if I do come?" said Jill.<br>
<br>
"I make no promise," said the Lion.<br>
<br>
Jill was so thirsty now that, without noticing it, she had come a step nearer.<br>
<br>
"Do you eat girls?" she said.<br>
<br>
"I have swallowed up girls and boys, women and men, kings and emperors, cities and realms," said the Lion. It didn't say this as if it were boasting, nor as if it were sorry, nor as if it were angry. It just said it.<br>
<br>
"I daren't come and drink," said Jill.<br>
<br>
"Then you will die of thirst," said the Lion.<br>
<br>
"Oh dear!" said Jill, coming another step nearer. "I suppose I must go and look for another stream then."<br>
<br>
"There is no other stream," said the Lion.<br>
<br>
It never occurred to Jill to disbelieve the Lion—no one who had seen his stern face could do that—and her mind suddenly made itself up. It was the worst thing she had ever had to do, but she went forward to the stream, knelt down, and began scooping up water in her hand. It was the coldest, most refreshing water she had ever tasted. You didn't need to drink much of it, for it quenched your thirst at once. Before she tasted it she had been intending to make a dash away from the Lion the moment she had finished. Now, she realised that this would be on the whole the most dangerous thing of all. She got up and stood there with her lips still wet from drinking.<br>

A free bird leaps<br>
on the back of the wind<br>

till the current ends<br>
and dips his wing<br>
in the orange sun rays<br>
and <span class="txt-underline"><strong>dares to claim the sky.</strong></span><br>

But a bird that stalks<br>
down his narrow cage<br>
can seldom see through<br>
his bars of rage<br>
his wings are clipped and<br>
his feet are tied<br>
so he opens his throat to sing.<br>
<br>
The caged bird sings<br>
with a fearful trill<br>
of things unknown<br>
but longed for still<br>
and his tune is heard<br>
on the distant hill<br>
for the caged bird<br>
sings of freedom.<br>
<br>
The free bird thinks of another breeze<br>
and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees<br>
and the fat worms waiting on a dawn bright lawn<br>
and he names the sky his own.<br>
<br>
<span class="txt-underline"><strong>But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams</strong></span><br>
his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream<br>
his wings are clipped and his feet are tied<br>
so he opens his throat to sing.<br>

A free bird leaps<br>
on the back of the wind<br>

till the current ends<br>
and dips his wing<br>
in the orange sun rays<br>
and <span class="txt-underline"><strong>dares to claim the sky.</strong></span><br>

But a bird that stalks<br>
down his narrow cage<br>
can seldom see through<br>
his bars of rage<br>
his wings are clipped and<br>
his feet are tied<br>
so he opens his throat to sing.<br>
<br>
The caged bird sings<br>
with a fearful trill<br>
of things unknown<br>
but longed for still<br>
and his tune is heard<br>
on the distant hill<br>
for the caged bird<br>
sings of freedom.<br>
<br>
The free bird thinks of another breeze<br>
and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees<br>
and the fat worms waiting on a dawn bright lawn<br>
and he names the sky his own.<br>
<br>
<span class="txt-underline"><strong>But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams</strong></span><br>
his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream<br>
his wings are clipped and his feet are tied<br>

No matter what the season, tea can be a tasty beverage since it can be served iced or hot. But its benefits go far beyond refreshment.&nbsp;<strong>(A)</strong>&nbsp;………. The newest study, published Thursday in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, involved more than 100,000 adults in China and found those who regularly drank tea were less likely to develop cardiovascular disease or die prematurely from any cause — particularly stroke — compared to others during a seven-year follow-up. The link was especially strong among habitual tea drinkers — those who enjoyed the beverage at least three times a week. Green tea seemed to have a stronger effect than black tea.

<p>Based on the findings, a 50-year-old frequent tea drinker might develop heart disease almost a year-and-a-half later or live about a year longer than someone who never or seldom drank tea, the study authors wrote. The results suggest habitual tea consumption may be considered "as an overall health-promoting lifestyle behaviour," wrote Vanessa Bianconi, a researcher at the University of Perugia in Italy.&nbsp;<strong>(B)</strong>&nbsp;……….</p>

<p>Tea's ability to lower blood pressure may be why it could reduce a person's risk of dying of a stroke, the editorial noted. Tea, especially green tea, is a rich source of flavonoids, bioactive compounds.&nbsp;<strong>(C)</strong>&nbsp;………. They cautioned more research was needed to see whether the results in Chinese adults would also apply to people outside east Asia. Other studies have shown teas can help protect your teeth and your heart, as well as possibly even helping to stave off cancer. At the very least, drinking tea is a flavourful way of getting enough fluid into your body each day.</p>

<p>Which type you drink can make a difference? All non-herbal teas are made from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant. The amount of time the leaves are processed determines whether you end up with a green, black or oolong tea. The green teas are the least processed and tend to have the highest amounts of polyphenols, and the only type that contain the polyphenol, catechin.&nbsp;<strong>(D)</strong>&nbsp;………. Certain herbal teas are known for their medicinal values, including soothing the digestive system. Tea contains antioxidants. Antioxidants work to prevent the body’s version of rust and thus help to keep us young and protect us from damage from pollution. Load up on antioxidants with a white tea, which is less processed than black or green tea so it retains more beneficial antioxidants.</p>

<p>Tea has less caffeine than coffee. Herbal blends have no caffeine, while traditional teas have less than 50% of what typically is found in coffee. That means you can consume it without those pesky effects on your nervous system, says Leslie Bonci, nutritionist and owner of Active Eating Advice. If you're trying to switch from coffee to tea, try a chicory root tea like Teeccino, which has a mouth feel and flavour similar to coffee.&nbsp;<strong>(E)</strong>&nbsp; ………. Bonus: this tea will give you a kick of energy without the caffeine.</p>

<p>Tea may reduce your risk of heart attack and stroke. “There’s a lot of literature out there on tea and heart health,” said Anna Ardine, clinical nutrition manager at Magee-Womens Hospital of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Centre.&nbsp;<strong>(F)</strong>&nbsp; ………. In fact, a study published in 2016 that combined data from a host of earlier reports found a nearly 20% reduction in the risk of heart attack and a 35% reduced risk of stroke among those who drank one to three cups of green tea a day. Those who drank four or more cups of green tea daily had a 32% reduction in the risk of having a heart attack and lower levels of LDL cholesterol. Four cups of green tea may keep you running to the bathroom, but you can get the same benefit from drinking one cup of matcha tea, which is made from ground green tea leaves and is said to be the nutritional equivalent of 10 cups of regular green tea.</p>

HOW DO BEES MAKE HONEYCOMB?</strong>
        <p><br>
Ever wondered where the term “busy as a bee” came from? Well, here is your answer. Honeybees work day and night in their hives making an enchanting and intricately built geometric phenomenon that we call honeycomb. How—and why—do those little fluffy guys all work together to produce the hexagonal honeycomb shape that a lot of people know and love? <strong>(A)</strong> ……….&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Honeybees are fascinating for a number of reasons. Their work ethic, the sweet syrup they secrete, and the intricate social structure of their homes used for storing honey are just a few. Honeycombs lie inside the beehives. <strong>(B)</strong> ……….&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Why Do Bees Make Honeycomb?</strong><br>
While this is a common condiment, bees do not necessarily create honey for humans to benefit. Though humans can enjoy the many health benefits offered by honey, it is primarily essential for bees to survive the winter months. <strong>(C)</strong> ……….&nbsp; This results in bees having to rely on the honey resources they have built up as the “winter cluster”. Because this is so essential for bees to survive, they have perfected the art of the honeycombs’ hexagonal architectural design.</p>
        <p>If you are wondering how a group of bees choose the perfect location to build the honeycomb, it’s primarily achieved by finding a surface they feel suitable for their hive. <strong>(D)</strong> ……….&nbsp; After they find a safe and protected place, the group of bees begin construction at the top and work their way down.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Why is Honeycomb Hexagonal?</strong><br>
Why the hexagon, of all shapes? <strong>(E)</strong> ……….&nbsp; (Scientists even claim that bees are excellent mathematicians.) <strong>(F)</strong> ……….&nbsp; This shape allows the bee to fit into the structure, as well as contains the nectar and stores it. Let’s call this their very own honey jar. Not only do the honeycomb cells hold the bees’ honey stores and nectar, they also store pollen, water, and larvae</p>

        <p><br><strong>Chocolate’s Sweet History:</strong><br>
From Elite Treat to Food for the Masses<br>
<br>
Mankind’s love affair with chocolate stretches back more than five millennia. Produced from tropical cacao trees native to the rainforests of Central and South America, chocolate was first considered “food of the gods”, and later, a delicacy for the elite. <strong>(A)</strong> ………. Archaeologists discovered early traces of cacao in pottery used by the ancient Mayo-Chinchipe culture 5,300 years ago in the upper Amazon. Chocolate played an important political, spiritual and economic role in ancient Mesoamerican civilisations, which ground roasted cacao beans into a paste to brew a frothy chocolate drink. Ancient Mesoamericans believed chocolate was an energy booster with mystical and medicinal qualities. The Mayans, who considered cacao a gift from the gods, used chocolate for sacred ceremonies and funeral offerings.</p>
        <p>As people of the Aztec empire spread, others began to prize cacao. Since they couldn’t grow it in the dry highlands of central Mexico, they traded with the Mayans for the beans. Chocolate arrived in Europe in the 1500s, brought by Spanish friars and conquistadors who had travelled to the Americas. Although the Spanish sweetened the bitter drink with cane sugar and cinnamon, one thing remained unchanged: <strong>(B)</strong> ………. It was an expensive import sipped by royal lips, and affordable only to Spanish elites. Chocolate’s popularity then spread to other European courts, where aristocrats consumed it as a magic elixir with health benefits. To quench their growing thirst for chocolate, European powers established colonial plantations in equatorial regions around the world to grow cacao and sugar. When diseases depleted the labour pool, African slaves were imported to work to maintain chocolate production.</p>
        <p><strong>(C) </strong>………. Attributed to Dutch chemist, Coenraad Johannes van Houten, the cocoa press squeezed the fatty butter from roasted cacao beans, leaving behind a dry cake that could be pulverised into a fine powder and be mixed with liquids and other ingredients, poured into moulds, and solidified into easily digestible chocolate. The cocoa press ushered in the modern era of chocolate by enabling it to be used as a confectionary with the resulting drop in production costs making chocolate much more affordable.</p>
        <p>In 1847, British company J. S. Fry &amp; Sons created the first edible chocolate bar from cocoa butter, cocoa powder and sugar. Rival chocolatier, Cadbury’s, followed suit soon after and in 1854 earned a royal warrant as purveyors of chocolate to Queen Victoria. It was in Switzerland that chocolate production took one of its greatest leaps forward. In the 1870s, Swiss chocolatier Daniel Peter utilised a powdered milk developed several years earlier by his neighbour, Henri Nestlé to produce the first milk chocolate bar. The pair eventually formed the Nestlé Company. Eventually, Swiss chocolatier, Rodolphe Lindt invented the conching machine in 1879. <strong>(D)</strong> ………. This allowed for the mass production of smooth, creamy milk chocolate.</p>
        <p>In the United States, Milton Hershey pioneered the assembly-line production of milk chocolate. Hershey bought farmland in rural Pennsylvania and built an entire factory town devoted to chocolate. <strong>(E)</strong> ………. Chocolate bars soared in popularity during the 1920’s. By the end of the decade, more than 40,000 different candy bars were being made in the U.S., according to Susan Benjamin, candy historian.</p>
        <p>From its roots more than 5,000 years ago, chocolate has become a big business. According to research by Statista, retail sales of chocolate worldwide in 2016 totalled nearly $100 billion. This included almost $25 billion in the United States alone. <strong>(F)</strong> ………. Africa is now the source of more than two-thirds of worldwide cocoa production.</p>

Taj Mahal, the magnificent monument that stands at the heart of India, has a story that has been melting the hearts of millions of listeners since the time Taj Mahal has been visible. It is a story, that although ending back in 1631, continues to live on in the concrete form of Taj Mahal and is considered a living example of eternal love. <strong>(A)</strong> .......... These two people from the course of history have set an example for the people living in the present and the future. As the poet, Edwin Arnold describes it, "Not a piece of architecture, as other buildings are, but the proud passion of an emperor's love wrought in living stones." The story that follows next will prove why that statement is true.</p>
        <p>Shah Jahan, initially named Prince Khurram, was born in the year 1592. He was the son of Jehangir, the fourth Mughal emperor of India and the grandson of Akbar the Great. In 1607, Shah Jahan strolled down the Meena Bazaar, accompanied by a string of fawning courtiers. <strong>(B)</strong> .......... It was love at first sight and the girl was Mumtaz Mahal, who was known as Arjumand Banu Begum at that time. At that time, he was 14 years old and she, a Muslim Persian princess, was 15. After meeting her, Shah Jahan went back to his father and declared that he wanted to marry her. The match was solemnised five years later i.e., in the year 1612.</p>
        <p>It was in the year 1628 that Shah Jahan became the Emperor and he entrusted Arjumand Banu with the royal seal. <strong>(C)</strong> .......... Though Shah Jahan also had other wives, Mumtaz Mahal was his favourite and accompanied him everywhere, even on military campaigns. In the year 1631, when Mumtaz Mahal was giving birth to their 14th child, she died due to some complications. While Mumtaz was on her deathbed, Shah Jahan promised her that he would never remarry and would build the richest mausoleum over her grave.</p>
        <p>It is said that Shah Jahan was so heartbroken after her death that he ordered the court into mourning for two years. Sometime after her death, Shah Jahan undertook the task of creating the world's most beautiful monument in the memory of his beloved. It took 22 years and the labour of 22,000 workers to construct the monument. <strong>(D)</strong> .......... This magnificent monument came to be known as "Taj Mahal" and now counts amongst the Seven Wonders of the World. It is the true story of the Taj Mahal of India which has mesmerised many people with its bewitching beauty.</p>
        <p>Shah Jahan was wealthy enough to support the Taj Mahal and its mighty maintenance costs. However, over the centuries, the Mughal Empire lost its riches and the Taj Mahal fell into ruins. By the 1800s, the British ousted the Mughals and took over India. The Taj Mahal was dissected for its beauty—the British cut gemstones from its walls, stole silver candlesticks and doors, and even tried to sell the white marble overseas. <strong>(E)</strong> .......... Rather than looting the Taj Mahal, Curzon worked to restore it.</p>
        <p>The Taj Mahal has once again become a magnificent place with 2.5 million visitors each year. <strong>(F)</strong> .......... Once a month, visitors also have the opportunity to make a short visit during a full moon to see how the Taj Mahal seems to glow from the inside out in the moonlight. The Taj Mahal was placed on the World Heritage List by UNESCO in 1983, but this protection has not guaranteed its safety. It is now at the mercy of pollutants from nearby factories and excessive humidity from the breath of its visitors.</p>

<p><strong>Penrith Panthers take the NRL Grand Final</strong><br><br>
Penrith Panthers have won a thrilling NRL 2021 Grand Final at Lang Park, Queensland, beating South Sydney Rabbitohs 14-12. They led 8-6 at half-time and held on after a frantic contest. The game was played at a tremendous tempo that captivated the 39,322-strong, COVID-limited Lang Park crowd. <strong>(A)</strong>&nbsp;………. He won the Clive Churchill Medal for best on ground, off the back of a tremendous kicking display. "This doesn't even feel real. I'm pinching myself," Cleary told ABC Sport after the game.</p>

<p>Despite playing an NRL grand final in Brisbane for the first time, fans of both sides packed the stands at either end. The flag-waving masses helped to create a tremendous atmosphere. It is Penrith's first premiership since 2003 and third overall, and scenes of jubilation greeted the final whistle —both in the stands and on the field. <strong>(B)</strong> ………. "The loss in the grand final last year really hurt," Ivan Cleary told ABC after the game. "It's one thing to say you want to make up for it, but it's so hard to get back here. It wasn't going to be anything other than a win that we'd be satisfied with tonight."</p>

<p>Souths, having beaten Penrith in the first week of the finals, were supposed to benefit from the extra rest their 16-10 victory in that game earned them. However, the Panthers were relentless in both defence and attack. They rushed to the line and forced the Rabbitohs back with huge hit after huge hit. <strong>(C)</strong> ………. Penrith swarmed the Rabbitohs in defence, forcing Souths into energy-sapping runs away from their own in-goal area, that would eventually tell.</p>

<p>In the opening 10 minutes, the Panthers forced two goal-line restarts off the back of some immaculate kicking by Cleary. A third resulted in the opening try of the game. Matt Burton ran onto a perfect Jarome Luai pass to burst through a massive hole in the Souths defence. South Sydney were drained by the repeat sets and bewildered by an excellent lead run by Liam Martin. Matt Burton opened the scoring in the 16th minute of the match. Cody Walker hit back almost instantly with a stunning solo try. <strong>(D)</strong> ………. Souths might have been denied territory, but Cody Walker ignored that, to capitalise with one of the Rabbitohs' only entries into the Panthers 20. He ran onto an Adam Reynolds pass before cruising past three despairing Panthers. He included a dismissive shove on Cleary before accelerating past Dylan Edwards to score a wonderful solo try. Cleary and Reynolds exchanged penalty goals either side of half-time. This left the sides locked at 8-8 for the majority of an excruciatingly tight second half.</p>

<p>The tightness and tension of the occasion demanded that any mistakes be brutally punished — and it looked like that mistake would be Walker's. His floating pass wide was intercepted by Stephen Crichton, who romped home from 40 metres out. <strong>(E)</strong> ………. Stephen Crichton intercept try in the 67th minute proved the difference. Souths then threw caution to the wind and scored a sensational try through Alex Johnston, having moved the ball nicely down their left side through quick hands by Walker and Dane Gagai. Reynolds would have backed himself to nail the conversion from the sideline, as he has done on countless occasions, but it went wide by the narrowest of margins in the tightest of grand finals.</p>

<p>Adam Reynolds looked dejected after missing a cruel field goal to level the score. "Sorry we couldn't get the job done tonight," the Brisbane-bound half player said, afterwards. <strong>(F)</strong> ………. &nbsp;He paid credit to the five injured players in the side. "This finals series, we had five blokes who wouldn't normally play ... the bravery of these boys is amazing," he said.</p>

In 1940, The Saturday Evening Post carried a short story by Paul Gallico (1897-1976). Gallico had begun his career as a sports reporter but, in 1936, had moved to England and started writing fiction. In 1941, the story was published by Alfred A. Knopf as a slim novella of some fifty pages. <strong>(A)</strong>&nbsp;………. It was also Gallico's only critical success, although he later wrote the hugely popular "Mrs. 'Arris" series, as well as The Poseidon Adventure. The Snow Goose was, in Gallico's words, "a once in a lifetime happening for a writer".&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The story of The Snow Goose is a variation on the ageless myth of a man whose physical deformity prevents most people from seeing his underlying admirable character. It begins in 1930, and is set on the east coast of England. <strong>(B)</strong> ………. Rebuffed by society, he retreats to the desolate marshland by the sea, where he lives in an abandoned lighthouse. There he paints the marsh and the wildfowl that inhabit it. He also provides a sanctuary for birds over the winter before they migrate north in the spring.</p>
        <p>One day, three years after Rhayader had come to the lighthouse, a young girl named Fritha, no more than twelve, comes to seek him out. Carrying an injured bird in her arms, she approaches the lighthouse timidly. She is frightened of its strange inhabitant, but she has heard of his reputation for taking care of the marsh's wildlife. Rhayader tends to the bird. He tells Fritha it is a Canadian snow goose, blown off course by a violent storm. Fritha visits the lighthouse often to see the bird, but after it flies north in the spring, her visits stop. <strong>(C)</strong> ……….</p>
        <p>In mid-October the snow goose returns, and Rhayader is overjoyed. <strong>(D)</strong> ………. And so the cycle repeats: when the snow goose returns, Fritha resumes her visits; when the snow goose leaves, her visits stop. Nonetheless, though the bird is the catalyst that brings Rhayader and Fritha together, their relationship develops beyond it. They sail in Rhayader's boat, and he teaches her the lore of the marsh. Over time, the snow goose's stays at the lighthouse become longer and longer. By the spring of 1940, it becomes clear that the bird will leave no more. What of Fritha, who is now a young woman?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the spring of 1940, Britain is enlisting small, private craft on the South Coast. It is a desperate attempt to evacuate hundreds of thousands of Allied soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk. Here they have been trapped by the German invasion of Belgium and France. Rhayader is determined to add his small boat to the attempt: "For once - for once I can be a man and play my part." He sails across the North Sea and successfully rescues many&nbsp;soldiers, ferrying them to boats in deeper water. <strong>(E)</strong> ………. Beautifully written in simple, lyrical prose, The Snow Goose is a moving story about love and courage, with an ending that is unforgettable.</p>
        <p>Like many, I first read The Snow Goose as a child, and no doubt its unabashed sentimentality was as appealing to me at that time as strawberry-flavoured lip gloss. On rereading I was amazed to discover that poor Philip, of the hunchback and claw-hand, was only 27. <strong>(F)</strong> ………. (I'm not quite sure how I figured the "love" bit of the "love story", except perhaps as a wartime Beauty and the Beast.) And yet I had forgotten the brutal realism of the final paragraphs, preferring to remember only Fritha's final realisation of her love for Rhayader.</p>

          <strong>The life of genius</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Antoni Gaudí was a Spanish architect who has become internationally recognised as one of the greatest experts in his discipline. <strong>(A)</strong> ………. His exceptional ground-breaking genius made him the inventor of a unique, personal and incomparable architectural language that defies classification.</p>
        <p>Antoni Gaudí was born on the 25th of June 1852 in Reus. He came from a family of boilermakers. He helped his father and grandfather in the family workshop. <strong>(B)</strong> ………. His talent for designing spaces and transforming materials grew and prospered until it eventually developed into a veritable genius for three-dimensional creation.</p>
        <p>As a child, Gaudí’s health was delicate, which meant that he was obliged to spend long periods of time resting at the summer house in Riudoms, a small town near Reus. There, he passed many an hour contemplating and storing up in his mind the secrets of nature. <strong>(C)</strong> ………. As such, Antoni Gaudí found the essence and the meaning of architecture by following the very patterns of nature and by always respecting its laws. In that context he created the most beautiful, sustainable and effective work possible through his architecture. Gaudí himself once said: “originality consists of going back to the origins.”</p>
        <p>In 1870, he moved to Barcelona to pursue his academic career in architecture, at the same time working at various jobs to enable him to pay for his studies. He was an inconsistent student. <strong>(D)</strong> ………. When he completed his studies at the School of Architecture in 1878 the Director, Elies Rogent, declared: “I do not know if we have awarded this degree to a madman or to a genius; only time will tell.” Undeniably, however, the young architect’s ideas were not a mere repetition of things that had already been done up to that time, nor could anybody receive them with indifference.</p>
        <p>During his mature period, masterpieces followed one after another: the Bellesguard Tower, Park Güell, the restoration of Mallorca Cathedral, the church on the Güell Estate, Casa Batlló, La Pedrera, and lastly, the Church of the Sagrada Familia. Surprisingly, the magnificence of Antoni Gaudí’s architecture coincided, as the result of a personal decision by the architect, with a progressive withdrawal by the man himself. <strong>(E)</strong> ………. But now went from being a young dandy with gourmet tastes to neglecting his personal appearance, eating frugally and distancing himself from social life. He simultaneously devoted himself ever more fervently to a religious and mystical sentiment.</p>
        <p>Gaudí died on the 10th of June 1926 after being knocked down by a tram while making his way, as he did every evening, to the Sagrada Família from the Church of Sant Felip Neri. After being struck, he lost consciousness. <strong>(F)</strong> ………. He was taken to the Santa Cruz Hospital, where he was later recognised by the Priest of the Sagrada Família. He was buried two days later in that very church, following a funeral attended by throngs of people: most of the citizens of Barcelona came out to bid a final farewell to the most universal architect that the city had ever known.</p>

Gunpowder Plot</strong><br><br>
The Gunpowder Plot was a failed attempt to blow up England’s King James I and the Parliament on November 5, 1605. The plot was organised by Robert Catesby in an effort to end the persecution of Roman Catholics by the English government. Catesby and others hoped to replace the country’s Protestant government with Catholic leadership. Around midnight on November 4, 1605, one of the conspirators, Guy Fawkes, was arrested. <strong>(A)</strong>&nbsp;………. Fawkes and other men involved in the plot were tried and executed for treason. Every November 5, the British celebrate Guy Fawkes Day by burning Fawkes in effigy.</p>
        <p>At about midnight on the night of November 4-5, Sir Thomas Knyvet, a justice of the peace, found Guy Fawkes lurking in a cellar under the Parliament building. <strong>(B)</strong> ………. The search resulted in thirty-six barrels of gunpowder being found, and Fawkes was taken into custody. After being tortured, Fawkes revealed he was a participant in an English Catholic conspiracy to annihilate England’s Protestant government and replace it with Catholic leadership.</p>
        <p>What became known as the Gunpowder Plot was organised by Robert Catesby, an English Catholic who was out for revenge. <strong>(C)</strong> ………. Guy Fawkes had converted to Catholicism. His religious zeal led him to fight in the army of Catholic Spain in the Protestant Netherlands.</p>
        <p>Catesby and the handful of other plotters rented a cellar that extended under the House of Lords building, and Fawkes planted the gunpowder there. However, as the November 5 opening meeting of Parliament approached, Lord Monteagle (1575-1622), the brother-in-law of one of the conspirators, received an anonymous letter. <strong>(D)</strong> ………. Monteagle alerted the government hours before the attack was to have taken place. Fawkes and the explosives were found. By torturing Fawkes, King James’ government learned the identities of his co-conspirators. During the next few weeks, English authorities killed or captured all the plotters and put the survivors on trial. Fawkes and the other surviving chief conspirators were sentenced to be hanged in London, but Fawkes jumped from a ladder while climbing to the gallows and died.</p>
        <p>In 1606, Parliament established November 5 as a day of public thanksgiving. Guy Fawkes Night is also referred to as Guy Fawkes Day and Bonfire Night. <strong>(E)</strong> ………. As dusk falls, villagers and city dwellers across Britain light bonfires, set off fireworks and burn effigies of Fawkes.<br>
Today, Guy Fawkes Day is celebrated in the United Kingdom, and in a number of countries that were formerly part of the British Empire, with parades, fireworks, bonfires, and food. Straw effigies of Fawkes are tossed on the bonfire. <strong>(F)</strong> ………. But traditionally, children carried these effigies, called “Guys”, through the streets in the days leading up to Guy Fawkes Day, and asked passers-by for “a penny for the guy,” often reciting rhymes associated with the occasion, the best known of which dates from the 18th century:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Remember, remember; The fifth of November; Gunpowder treason and plot<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;We see no reason; Why Gunpowder treason; Should ever be forgot……&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Fireworks, a major component of most Guy Fawkes Day celebrations, represent the explosives that were never used by the plotters. Guards perform an annual search of the Parliament building to check for potential arsonists, although it is more ceremonial than serious.</p>

        <p><br><strong>Half the Inhabitants of the Oz Opal Capital Live Underground</strong><br><br>
70 percent of the world's opals come from the mining town of Coober Pedy in South Australia, where half of its population lives underground. The Australian town of Coober Pedy looks like something straight out of a movie — probably because it is. In 1985, Mel Gibson, Tina Turner and a team of filmmakers descended on this barren mining town in the Outback to shoot Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome. The other-world landscape is chequered with ruddy-coloured mounds of sandstone — the result of years of opal mining. <strong>(A)</strong> ………. That landscape, and the lure of finding a pricey opal, has drawn people here for years. It’s also forced the town’s residents underground — literally.</p>
        <p>“People come here to see things differently,” Robert Coro, of the Desert Cave Hotel, says. Parts of his hotel are located below the ground, like many other buildings in town. “It’s that kind of adventure mentality that attracts people here.” Nothing about Coober Pedy is for the faint of heart. For starters, it’s hot — really hot. In the summer, temperatures can creep up to 113 degrees in the shade, assuming you can find a tree large enough to stand under. Before the city passed a tree-planting initiative, its tallest tree was a sculpture built from scraps of metal. <strong>(B)&nbsp;</strong>………. The local (dirt) golf course provides golfers with squares of carpet for their tees.</p>
        <p>Since its founding 100 years ago after a teenager discovered opal gemstones there, the town has been ground zero for opal mining. An estimated 70 percent of the world’s opal production can be linked back to the town, earning it the title of Opal Capital of the World, and the majority of its 3,500 residents work in the opal industry. One of the latest finds was a set of opalised pearls dating back more than 65 million years — but the city offers other kinds of buried treasure, too. Rather than move to a cooler locale, the town’s earliest residents learned to adapt to the hellish environment. <strong>(C)</strong> ………. Using mining tools, hardy prospectors did what they did best and dug holes into the hillsides to make underground dwellings or “dugouts.” Today about half of the population lives in dugouts where the temperature stays at a constant 75 degrees all year round.</p>
        <p>Seeking relief from the heat — and the desert’s chilly winter nights — the townsfolk continued building underground. The result is a subterranean community that includes underground museums like the Umoona Opal Mine &amp; Museum, a sprawling former opal mine located alongside the town’s main drag. It has churches like the Serbian Orthodox Church, whose sandstone walls are decorated with intricate carvings of saints. <strong>(D)</strong> ………. They let their guests experience the strange peace of life beneath the surface.</p>
        <p>“The beauty of living underground is that it’s very quiet and very still,” Coro says. “There’s no air movement or rush of air from the air conditioner, and since there are no windows or natural light, you get a very peaceful night’s sleep.” <strong>(E)</strong> ………. They have created their own customised subterranean houses that go beyond just one or two rooms into sprawling labyrinths that stretch out like spiders’ webs. “People will carve out their own bookshelves into the sandstone walls,” Michelle Provatidis, the mayor of Coober Pedy and owner of Michelle’s Opals Australia, a jewellery shop, tells Smithsonian.com. “I even know someone who has an underground swimming pool in her home.”<br>
But it’s not just what’s going on beneath the surface that makes Coober Pedy so unique. Above ground, there are hints of the city’s strong mining roots and eccentricities around every turn. <strong>(F)</strong> ………. Also, signs around town warn people to beware of unmarked holes, the remnants of previous opal digs. There’s also the annual Coober Pedy Opal Festival, which this year was held on March 26. Even the thin veil of red dust that settles on roadways, cars and buildings serves as a constant reminder of Coober Pedy’s strange charm. There really is no other place like it on — or below — Earth.</p>

        <p><br><strong>EVEL KNIEVEL – A LIFE OF DANGER</strong><br><br>
Now that Eddie Braun has completed the Snake River Canyon leap, we look back on the life of the world’s most famous stuntman, Evel Knievel. Legendary US daredevil, Evel Knievel once said that jumping a motorcycle wasn’t that difficult. It was the landing part that often proved a bit of an issue. <strong>(A)</strong> ……….&nbsp; In a career that shone like a beacon of 1970s pop culture, the iconic hospital-food aficionado had a penchant for star-spangled leather jumpsuits. He sustained somewhere in the order of 37 broken bones — including all his ribs, his pelvis three times, left femur five times, lower back twice, upper back twice. He survived a 28-day coma and helped redefine the meaning of the word ‘pain’, all as a result of landings that were anything but happy. Or soft.</p>
        <p>“I guess I thought I was Elvis Presley. But I’ll tell ya something: all Elvis did was stand on a stage and play a guitar,” Evel once helpfully explained. “He never fell off on that pavement at 80 miles per hour.” If there was a stunt Knievel never attempted — or a surgical procedure he didn’t undergo — chances are it wasn’t worth contemplating. <strong>(B)</strong> ………. Trucks, buses, lions, sharks, rattlesnakes and even geological formations were standard&nbsp; fare for the stylishly coiffured caped wonder.</p>
        <p>Demonstrating an unhinged passion for danger from childhood, Knievel exploded into prominence on New Year’s Eve 1967. That was when he attempted to jump 141 feet over the fountains at Caesar’s Palace casino in Las Vegas. He cleared the fountains easily. But the subsequent crash-landing left him with a fractured skull and broken pelvis, hips and ribs, and rendered him unconscious for a month. He awoke to find himself a national hero. “It was terrible,” he later said. “I lost control of the bike. <strong>(C)</strong> ……….&nbsp; I kept smashing over and over and ended up against a brick wall, 165 feet away.”</p>
        <p><strong>(D)</strong> ……….&nbsp; An example is his jump over 13 London buses at Wembley Stadium, which scored him a million dollars and resulted in a broken pelvis and hand after clipping the 13th bus. Then there was his leap over a shark tank in Chicago, which ended in a broken forearm and collarbone after skidding on the exit ramp. “In the old days, the promoters wanted more and more from me,” Evel once recalled of his spleen-jolting heyday. “They wanted me to jump or spill my blood and break my bones. Every time they wanted me to jump further, and further, and further. Hell, they thought my bike had wings.”</p>
        <p>Keen to flame the frenzy, in 1974 Knievel attempted to jump nearly 500 metres across Snake River Canyon in Idaho aboard a rocket-powered cycle. In front of thousands of gob-smacked spectators, Knievel launched his ballistic missile-shaped X-2 Skycycle (featuring two engines capable of producing more than 14,000lb of thrust) off a near-vertical ramp at a ball-tearing 560km/h. Apparently due to malfunction, the cycle’s parachute opened almost immediately after take-off, causing both it and the rider to drift slowly down to the canyon floor. The failed stunt worried Evel’s credibility, with detractors claiming he simply lost his nerve and pulled out of the attempt early. <strong>(E)</strong> ……….&nbsp; Alongside all the death-defying stunts were the temptations of life itself. Equally renowned for his gambling and bad temper as he was for his daredevil exploits, Knievel was a bloke who didn’t need to rely on spectacular crashes to mess with his health and future earning potential.</p>
        <p>Eventually fading from the limelight, his vast fortune lost, Knievel suffered severe ill health during the later phases of his life. In 1999, he underwent a liver transplant after nearly dying of hepatitis C, which he believed he’d contracted through a blood transfusion following one of his many massive spills. <strong>(F)</strong> ……….&nbsp; It was this incurable lung condition that ultimately achieved what countless impacts with solid objects failed to do. In May 2006, perhaps sensing the end was near, Evel appeared ready to finally meet his maker. “I can’t wait to meet God and ask why he didn’t make me go faster on some of those jumps, why he put me through all this pain. He knows I’m not evil.”</p>

Byron Bay</strong><br><br>
Byron Bay is not what it used to be. No shade intended: This small town on the north coast of the Australian state of New South Wales has always shifted with the times, and that’s no less true now. Byron Bay is known as an epicentre of Australia’s counter-culture. <strong>(A)</strong> ……...&nbsp; &nbsp;Locals, for instance, stopped McDonald’s from setting up its golden arches. But it wasn’t always this way: before the New Agers unfurled their prayer flags in the 1970s, it had a less romantic reputation as a hub of sand-mining, cedar-cutting, abattoirs and whaling.</p>
        <p>The Bundjalung nation of the Arakwal Australian Aboriginal people had been living along the coast of Byron Bay for more than 20,000 years when the cape was encountered in 1770 by Capt. James Cook, who named it for Commodore (later Admiral) John Byron, grandfather of the poet Lord Byron. Byron Bay was founded in 1860 as a timber port. It was declared a town in 1896 and a shire in 1906. Before coastal shipping declined, Byron Bay was the principal port between Newcastle (about 630km south) and Brisbane (140km north-northwest). Over the years, Byron Bay’s local economy underwent a dramatic evolution. <strong>(B)</strong> ……….&nbsp; For roughly 20 years gold was painstakingly extracted from the black sand as “poor man’s diggings”, which yielded a measure of profit for most who undertook its mining but did not bestow a fortune on anyone. In the mid-1930s it was learned that the sand that had been discarded by the prospectors, contained the valuable minerals rutile and zircon, which became the focus of a sand-mining industry that flourished until the early 1970s.</p>
        <p>Byron—or the Bay, as locals call it—is evolving again. It’s still a magnet for backpackers and surfers. However, these days it also attracts cashed-up visitors, and entrepreneurs who boast about ‘board meetings’ on the water. <strong>(C)</strong> ……….&nbsp; But its main selling points—a laid-back pace and beautiful beaches—are still just as appealing.</p>
        <p>To get there, we suggest you take the back road. There are two airports that service Byron Bay. The easiest option is to fly into Ballina Byron Gateway Airport (daily flights from Sydney, Melbourne and Newcastle) and book a transfer to Byron Bay. This will take you via the Coast Road, a scenic, 30-minute intro to the area that winds past windswept beaches, soft tea-tree forests, and cane fields before meandering into town through the lush back door of Broken Head. Alternatively, you’ll find more flight options at Gold Coast Airport, but a longer and less joy-sparking transfer via the freeway. On the upside, if you arrive this way you’ll get to see the famous “Cheer up, slow down, chill out” welcome sign, and the jaunty new silver lighthouse sculpture. Book ahead… Byron is busy year-round these days, so plan well ahead for accommodation. <strong>(D)</strong> ……….&nbsp; If you’re on a budget, the recently revamped Byron Bay YHA hostel is a good, cheap, and centrally located option. The Bower’s beach-chic suites and circular pool will rate highly on social media feeds. Also, more than 17 percent of Byron’s housing is listed on holiday rental platforms like Airbnb, so you should have plenty to choose from.</p>
        <p>And plan your trip. Byron Bay is part of the greater Byron Shire. Byron Bay is small; the Shire is large. <strong>(E)</strong> ……….&nbsp; Take The Byron at Byron Resort &amp; Spa, for instance—it sounds like it’s in the centre of Byron, but it’s actually in the suburb Suffolk Park, a 10-minute drive from town. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing—in fact, it can be a blessing to be able to retreat from the Byron bubble—just something to bear in mind when booking. Skip summer. Summer has northerly winds, week-long downpours, and throngs of tourists. The best time to visit is during autumn and winter (March to August), when the weather is great, the surf is at its best, and the crowds ease off (a little). From May to October you’ll also be able to spot humpback whales cruising past on their annual migration.</p>
        <p>Get up early and walk. It’s worth it to soak up the sunrise from Cape Byron, the most easterly point of Australia. You can save time and drive up to the historic lighthouse (there are limited parking spaces and entry is AUD$8). <strong>(F)</strong> ……….&nbsp; It winds through rare littoral rainforest, past pristine beaches and across grass-covered cliffs to reach the stately 1901 lighthouse on the headland and sweeping views of the ocean. The full loop is 3.7km and takes around two hours to complete, but don’t be tempted to take the shortcut down the road on the way back—the second half of the track along Tallow Ridge is equally special.</p>

        <p><br><strong>Marie Curie</strong><br><br>
On April 20, 1902, Marie and Pierre Curie successfully isolated radioactive radium salts from the mineral pitchblende in their laboratory in Paris. In 1898, the Curies had discovered the existence of the elements, radium and polonium in their research of pitchblende. One year after isolating radium, they would share the 1903 Nobel Prize in physics with French scientist, A. Henri Becquerel for their ground-breaking investigations of radioactivity. <strong>(A)</strong> ……….&nbsp; Both were for her ground-breaking work in radioactivity.</p>
        <p>Curie was born Maria Sklodowska in Warsaw, Poland, to school-teacher parents of modest means who encouraged their children’s educational aspirations. <strong>(B)</strong> ……….&nbsp; She agreed to fund Bronya’s medical degree in France by working as a governess. Bronya later helped Marie move to Paris and enrol at the prestigious Sorbonne, where she studied chemistry, maths and physics. Curie met her future husband, Pierre, while doing postgraduate research at the lab he supervised. The pair immediately bonded over their mutual interest in magnetism and fondness for cycling. A year later they were married in Sceaux, France. They used the money they had received as a wedding present to purchase bicycles for the many long rides they took together.</p>
        <p><strong>(C)</strong> ……….&nbsp; As a result, she began studying uranium rays; Pierre soon joined her in her research. Two years later, the Curies discovered polonium—named after Marie’s homeland—and radium. In 1903, they shared the Nobel Prize in physics with Becquerel for their ground-breaking work on radioactivity.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After Pierre’s tragic death in a 1906 accident, Marie was appointed to his seat at the Sorbonne, becoming the university’s first female professor. Just three years earlier, she had been the first woman in France to earn a doctorate. Today, France’s leading scientific and medical complex bears the name of both Curies. <strong>(D)</strong> ……….&nbsp; In 1911, she received the prestigious award again — in chemistry this time — for her isolation of radium and other accomplishments.</p>
        <p>During World War I, Curie used her radiography expertise to set up dozens of mobile and permanent X-ray stations, which helped doctors diagnose and treat battlefield injuries. They became known as “petites Curies” for their famous creator. <strong>(E)</strong> ……….&nbsp; The effects of doing this were poorly understood at the time. By the 1920s, she had developed muscle aches, anaemia, cataracts and a host of other symptoms. She died on July 4, 1934, of leukemia caused by exposure to radiation.</p>
        <p>Curie’s daughter, Irène followed in her mother’s footsteps, earning a doctorate in physics and conducting important research on synthesised radioactive elements. In 1935, she and her husband, Frédéric Joliot, shared the Noble Prize in chemistry for their discovery of artificial radioactivity. In 1995, the remains of Curie and her husband were enshrined in Paris’ Pantheon. <strong>(F)</strong> ……….&nbsp; She became the second woman to receive this honour and the first to earn it through her own achievements. Among her writing, Curie left behind this thought: "Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less."</p>

Six sentences&nbsp;have been removed from this text so that there are six gaps.</strong><br><br><strong>Understanding Elephant Empathy and their Emotions</strong><br><br><em>[Posted by World Animal Protection in the Animals in the wild blog by Dr Helen Lambert]</em><br><br>
Observing elephants in the wild is the best way to fully experience these incredible animals. Elephants are at their most awe-inspiring in the wild and some of the behaviours they exhibit show us just how emotionally complex they are. The intelligence of elephants is something which is often overlooked by humans. However, it is clear that they are very smart creatures. But exactly how smart are elephants? Elephants are considered to be one of the world’s most empathic species. <strong>(A)</strong>&nbsp;.......... This proves that they’re truly empathetic, social animals.</p>
        <p>Scientists have observed many cases of maternal and non-maternal elephants defending calves from dangerous situations such as chasing predators away, stopping aggressive play fights or pushing other individuals away. Such situations do not always elicit distress or pain signals in the calf. Therefore, we know the protector elephants are predicting their potential distress, rather than just responding to cues. Experts suggest that to do this, the elephants draw upon their past experiences and use this to consider the calf’s potential emotional state. <strong>(B)</strong> .......... This behaviour is very complex, and few species are known to be able to recognise and consider another’s feelings in this way.</p>
        <p><strong>(C)</strong> .......... African elephants have huge complicated social groups ranging from tens to hundreds, whereas Asian elephants are often thought to be the loner elephants. Recent research however has shown this is not actually the case. Their social lives are so complex it has taken years of research to understand them, and we are still continuing to learn. Female Asian elephants will have anywhere from 10-50 friends, but they may not see them for long periods of time. Instead, they will communicate with them both chemically and acoustically.</p>
        <p>Elephants also recognise themselves in a mirror. It is not surprising to hear that, as well as being incredibly emotional and social, elephants are considered to be one of the world’s most intelligent species. Asian elephants have been found to pass the mirror test. Marks are placed on the animal to see whether they use the mirror to inspect themselves. When they successfully inspect themselves, this is considered to be evidence of a high level of intelligence. <strong>(D)</strong> .......... And the ability doesn’t emerge in human children until 18-24 months of age.</p>
        <p>Elephants make the most of their environment. Both Asian and African elephants have been known to use different objects as tools for conducting various tasks. For example, they've been seen using branches to swat flies, or using dead vegetation to bury the dead.&nbsp;The way that elephants are able to practically make the most of their environment and use imagination to complete different tasks shows how complex and thoughtful these animals really are. <strong>(E)</strong> .......... Rangers once saw African elephants break off nearby branches and dump them on to a new road, rendering it closed, repeating this four times when the branches were removed. Poignantly the road was built for an elephant cull.</p>
        <p>There is still so much to learn about these fascinating animals, and scientists have only really scratched the surface when it comes to understanding how intelligent and expressive elephants are. <strong>(F)</strong> .......... Sadly, elephants used for tourist rides do not have the chance to truly express these behaviours. Their lives in these facilities are so far removed from what they should be, they are almost an entirely different animal. We want to see elephants living in the natural environments they’re entitled to and we're working with responsible travel companies to make this happen. More than 80 companies have stopped selling elephant rides and shows to tourists. But to put an end to this cruel industry, we need more companies to take action. Join our movement to help end wildlife cruelty in the tourism industry.</p>
