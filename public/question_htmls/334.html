          <strong>How Planes Fly (adapted from Malcolm, Emjayem)</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Two primary principles contribute to the creation of lift, which is what makes flight possible. Those two principles are Bernoulli's Principle and Newton's Third Law. Let's break it down and look at each principle individually.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Bernoulli's Principle</strong>
        </p>
        <p>By definition, Bernoulli's Principle states:</p>
        <p>
          <strong>For an <span class="txt-underline">inviscid</span> flow, an increase in the speed of the fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>From a practical standpoint, this basically means that as a fluid (air, water, etc) moves faster, its internal pressure decreases.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But how does this help an airplane create lift? Picture an airplane's wing - but cut in half so we can see the shape of it (referred to as an <em>airfoil</em>). The top of the wing is more curved than that of the bottom of the wing. The reasoning behind this is that the increased curvature on top of the wing will take advantage of something called <strong>magnus </strong>effect. To explain the magnus effect, close your eyes and envision a baseball game. The pitcher can curve the direction of the ball's flight left, right, down, or even up if desired. But how? Magnus effect states that a rotating ball or cylinder moving through a fluid (air, water, etc) will create faster moving fluid in the direction of rotation, thus lowering pressure and "pulling" the ball or cylinder in that direction. This force is not created when the object is stationary, which is why a baseball pitcher puts a "spin" on the ball when he or she wants a curveball.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So back to our discussion on the wing. So we know the top of the wing is more curved than the bottom. Basically, the shaping of the wing "fools" the air around it into thinking it is a long rotation cylinder, and forces the air to travel faster over the top of the wing than that of the bottom. And according to Bernoulli's Principle, faster moving air = lower pressure. If we have lower pressure on top of the wing than we do on the bottom of the wing, we now have an inequality of pressures acting on the wing. There is more pressure pushing up on the bottom of the wing than there is on the top pushing down, which means we now have a total net force pushing UP. And voila... we have LIFT.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With real airplanes and airplane models, Bernoulli's Principle (related to the curvature of the wing) and the magnus effect have very little to do with "flying". If what the author says were true - real airplanes could not fly upside down.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Almost all of the lift created on the underside of a wing is created as (A) the underside of the wing is blasted by the air rushing past the wing -- because the airplane engine is pulling the airplane very fast through the air and (B) the plane's geometrical configuration is holding the wing at an angle such that the front edge of the wing is a little higher in the direction of flight than the back edge of the wing. A &amp; B, together mean the air pressure on the bottom of the wing is higher than the pressure on the top of the wing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Large gliders, in general, can't fly upside down because they do not have engines. They get lift from surrounding air currents which force the plane upward by either (a) rising warm air -- called "thermals" or (b) air that is being directed upward by a hill. Gliders can take off at one height and land at a higher elevation if they are near thermals and air moving over hills or mountains.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Newton's 3rd Law</strong>
        </p>
        <p>This one is much less complicated than Bernoulli's Principle.</p>
        <p>Newton's 3rd Law is defined as: <strong>To every action there is always an equal and opposite reaction.</strong></p>
        <p>Airplane wings are fixed onto the airframe of the plane at a slight angle. It may not be easy to see for the untrained eye, but upon a close examination of an wing's attachment point to the body of a plane, one will see a slight angle.</p>
        <p>This angle creates a deflection of air downward. As air hits the underside of the wing, even in straightand- level cruise flight, it is forced downward. And according to Newton's 3rd Law, the forcing of the air downward causes an equal and opposite upward force on the wing, thus contributing to the creation of lift.</p>
        <p>As air is hitting the airframe and control surfaces of the plane, it is being forced downward at a great rate, creating an opposing force - LIFT - in the opposite direction.</p>

        <p>But how does this help an airplane create lift? Picture an airplane's wing - but cut in half so we can see the shape of it (referred to as an <em>airfoil</em>). The top of the wing is more curved than that of the bottom of the wing. The reasoning behind this is that the increased curvature on top of the wing will take advantage of something called <strong>magnus </strong>effect. To explain the magnus effect, close your eyes and envision a baseball game. The pitcher can curve the direction of the ball's flight left, right, down, or even up if desired. But how? Magnus effect states that a rotating ball or cylinder moving through a fluid (air, water, etc) will create faster moving fluid in the direction of rotation, thus lowering pressure and "pulling" the ball or cylinder in that direction. This force is not created when the object is stationary, which is why a baseball pitcher puts a "spin" on the ball when he or she wants a curveball.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So back to our discussion on the wing. So we know the top of the wing is more curved than the bottom. Basically, the shaping of the wing "fools" the air around it into thinking it is a long rotation cylinder, and forces the air to travel faster over the top of the wing than that of the bottom. And according to Bernoulli's Principle, faster moving air = lower pressure. If we have lower pressure on top of the wing than we do on the bottom of the wing, we now have an inequality of pressures acting on the wing. There is more pressure pushing up on the bottom of the wing than there is on the top pushing down, which means we now have a total net force pushing UP. And voila... we have LIFT.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With real airplanes and airplane models, Bernoulli's Principle (related to the curvature of the wing) and the magnus effect have very little to do with "flying". If what the author says were true - real airplanes could not fly upside down.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Almost all of the lift created on the underside of a wing is created as (A) the underside of the wing is blasted by the air rushing past the wing -- because the airplane engine is pulling the airplane very fast through the air and (B) the plane's geometrical configuration is holding the wing at an angle such that the front edge of the wing is a little higher in the direction of flight than the back edge of the wing. A &amp; B, together mean the air pressure on the bottom of the wing is higher than the pressure on the top of the wing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Large gliders, in general, can't fly upside down because they do not have engines. They get lift from surrounding air currents which force the plane upward by either (a) rising warm air -- called "thermals" or (b) air that is being directed upward by a hill. Gliders can take off at one height and land at a higher elevation if they are near thermals and air moving over hills or mountains.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Newton's 3rd Law</strong>
        </p>
        <p>This one is much less complicated than Bernoulli's Principle.</p>
        <p>Newton's 3rd Law is defined as: <strong>To every action there is always an equal and opposite reaction.</strong></p>
        <p>Airplane wings are fixed onto the airframe of the plane at a slight angle. It may not be easy to see for the untrained eye, but upon a close examination of an wing's attachment point to the body of a plane, one will see a slight angle.</p>
        <p>This angle creates a deflection of air downward. As air hits the underside of the wing, even in straightand- level cruise flight, it is forced downward. And according to Newton's 3rd Law, the forcing of the air downward causes an equal and opposite upward force on the wing, thus contributing to the creation of lift.</p>
        <p>As air is hitting the airframe and control surfaces of the plane, it is being forced downward at a great rate, creating an opposing force - LIFT - in the opposite direction.</p>

            <strong>Text Two:</strong>
          </em>
          <strong>How Planes Fly (adapted from Malcolm, Emjayem)</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Two primary principles contribute to the creation of lift, which is what makes flight possible. Those two principles are Bernoulli's Principle and Newton's Third Law. Let's break it down and look at each principle individually.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Bernoulli's Principle</strong>
        </p>
        <p>By definition, Bernoulli's Principle states:</p>
        <p>
          <strong>For an <span class="txt-underline">inviscid</span> flow, an increase in the speed of the fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>From a practical standpoint, this basically means that as a fluid (air, water, etc) moves faster, its internal pressure decreases.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But how does this help an airplane create lift? Picture an airplane's wing - but cut in half so we can see the shape of it (referred to as an <em>airfoil</em>). The top of the wing is more curved than that of the bottom of the wing. The reasoning behind this is that the increased curvature on top of the wing will take advantage of something called <strong>magnus </strong>effect. To explain the magnus effect, close your eyes and envision a baseball game. The pitcher can curve the direction of the ball's flight left, right, down, or even up if desired. But how? Magnus effect states that a rotating ball or cylinder moving through a fluid (air, water, etc) will create faster moving fluid in the direction of rotation, thus lowering pressure and "pulling" the ball or cylinder in that direction. This force is not created when the object is stationary, which is why a baseball pitcher puts a "spin" on the ball when he or she wants a curveball.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So back to our discussion on the wing. So we know the top of the wing is more curved than the bottom. Basically, the shaping of the wing "fools" the air around it into thinking it is a long rotation cylinder, and forces the air to travel faster over the top of the wing than that of the bottom. And according to Bernoulli's Principle, faster moving air = lower pressure. If we have lower pressure on top of the wing than we do on the bottom of the wing, we now have an inequality of pressures acting on the wing. There is more pressure pushing up on the bottom of the wing than there is on the top pushing down, which means we now have a total net force pushing UP. And voila... we have LIFT.</p>

A &amp; B, together mean the air pressure on the bottom of the wing is higher than the pressure on the top of the wing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Large gliders, in general, can't fly upside down because they do not have engines. They get lift from surrounding air currents which force the plane upward by either (a) rising warm air -- called "thermals" or (b) air that is being directed upward by a hill. Gliders can take off at one height and land at a higher elevation if they are near thermals and air moving over hills or mountains.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Newton's 3rd Law</strong>
        </p>
        <p>This one is much less complicated than Bernoulli's Principle.</p>

          <strong>How chocolate is made (adapted from Aphrodite Chocolate)</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <br>
          <strong>HOW CHOCOLATE IS MADE</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The first step is the harvesting of the cocoa pods containing the cocoa beans.</li>
          <li>The pods are crushed and the beans and surrounding pulp extracted and fermented naturally</li>
          <li>Light Crushing separates the kernel or 'Nib' from the shell or husk (like shelling a nut), the husk is then separated or 'winnowed' out and discarded.</li>
          <li>At this stage most manufacturers put the Cocoa Nibs through an alkalisation process to help develop flavour and colour. However, some purists producing the finest chocolate prefer to rely on the quality of the beans and natural processing to produce the best colour and flavour.</li>
          <li>The nibs, which are very high in fat or cocoa butter, are then finely milled and liquefied.</li>
          <li>If the end product is chocolate, some of the cocoa liquor is reserved, the rest is pressed to extract the cocoa butter leaving a solid residue called press cake. Press cake is usually kibbled or finely ground to produce the product known to consumers as Cocoa Powder.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>BLENDING</strong><br>
Cocoa Liquor or Cocoa Mass is blended back with cocoa butter in varying quantities to make different types of chocolate. The finest plain or dark chocolate should contain 70% Cocoa or more, whereas the best Milk Chocolate contains 30% or more Cocoa and the best White Chocolate contains 30% or more Cocoa Butter.</p>
        <p><br><strong>REFINING AND CONCHING</strong><br>
The blended Chocolate then goes through a refining process involving heavy rollers, this grinds down and blends the particles to smooth and improve the texture.</p>
        <p>Mostly, but not always, this is followed by the <strong>penultimate </strong>process called ‘conching’, a conch is a type of container in which the refined and blended chocolate mass is continually kneaded and further smoothed, the fractional heat produced by this process keeps the chocolate liquid.</p>
        <p><strong>TEMPERING</strong><br>
The chocolate must go through a very precise cycle of heating and cooling (called ‘tempering’) to encourage the stable crystal formation needed to produce the desirable properties for good tasty chocolate.</p>
        <p>
          <em>Note: One of the reasons that mass producers replace chocolate butter with vegetable oil (or other fat) is that they don't then have to worry about tempering the resulting concoction. An added bonus (as far as they are concerned) is that vegetable oil is much cheaper than chocolate butter, but it's addition results in a vastly inferior product that is most definitely not real chocolate.</em>

          <strong>How chocolate is made (adapted from Aphrodite Chocolate)</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <br>
          <strong>HOW CHOCOLATE IS MADE</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The first step is the harvesting of the cocoa pods containing the cocoa beans.</li>
          <li>The pods are crushed and the beans and surrounding pulp extracted and fermented naturally</li>
          <li>Light Crushing separates the kernel or 'Nib' from the shell or husk (like shelling a nut), the husk is then separated or 'winnowed' out and discarded.</li>
          <li>At this stage most manufacturers put the Cocoa Nibs through an alkalisation process to help develop flavour and colour. However, some purists producing the finest chocolate prefer to rely on the quality of the beans and natural processing to produce the best colour and flavour.</li>
          <li>The nibs, which are very high in fat or cocoa butter, are then finely milled and liquefied.</li>
          <li>If the end product is chocolate, some of the cocoa liquor is reserved, the rest is pressed to extract the cocoa butter leaving a solid residue called press cake. Press cake is usually kibbled or finely ground to produce the product known to consumers as Cocoa Powder.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>BLENDING</strong><br>
Cocoa Liquor or Cocoa Mass is blended back with cocoa butter in varying quantities to make different types of chocolate. The finest plain or dark chocolate should contain 70% Cocoa or more, whereas the best Milk Chocolate contains 30% or more Cocoa and the best White Chocolate contains 30% or more Cocoa Butter.</p>
        <p><br><strong>REFINING AND CONCHING</strong><br>
The blended Chocolate then goes through a refining process involving heavy rollers, this grinds down and blends the particles to smooth and improve the texture.</p>
        <p>Mostly, but not always, this is followed by the <strong>penultimate </strong>process called ‘conching’, a conch is a type of container in which the refined and blended chocolate mass is continually kneaded and further smoothed, the fractional heat produced by this process keeps the chocolate liquid.</p>
        <p><strong>TEMPERING</strong><br>
The chocolate must go through a very precise cycle of heating and cooling (called ‘tempering’) to encourage the stable crystal formation needed to produce the desirable properties for good tasty chocolate.</p>
        <p>
          <em>Note: One of the reasons that mass producers replace chocolate butter with vegetable oil (or other fat) is that they don't then have to worry about tempering the resulting concoction. An added bonus (as far as they are concerned) is that vegetable oil is much cheaper than chocolate butter, but it's addition results in a vastly inferior product that is most definitely not real chocolate.</em>

          <strong>HOW CHOCOLATE IS MADE</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The first step is the harvesting of the cocoa pods containing the cocoa beans.</li>
          <li>The pods are crushed and the beans and surrounding pulp extracted and fermented naturally</li>
          <li>Light Crushing separates the kernel or 'Nib' from the shell or husk (like shelling a nut), the husk is then separated or 'winnowed' out and discarded.</li>
          <li>At this stage most manufacturers put the Cocoa Nibs through an alkalisation process to help develop flavour and colour. However, some purists producing the finest chocolate prefer to rely on the quality of the beans and natural processing to produce the best colour and flavour.</li>
          <li>The nibs, which are very high in fat or cocoa butter, are then finely milled and liquefied.</li>
          <li>If the end product is chocolate, some of the cocoa liquor is reserved, the rest is pressed to extract the cocoa butter leaving a solid residue called press cake. Press cake is usually kibbled or finely ground to produce the product known to consumers as Cocoa Powder.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>BLENDING</strong><br>
Cocoa Liquor or Cocoa Mass is blended back with cocoa butter in varying quantities to make different types of chocolate. The finest plain or dark chocolate should contain 70% Cocoa or more, whereas the best Milk Chocolate contains 30% or more Cocoa and the best White Chocolate contains 30% or more Cocoa Butter.</p>
        <p><br><strong>REFINING AND CONCHING</strong><br>
The blended Chocolate then goes through a refining process involving heavy rollers, this grinds down and blends the particles to smooth and improve the texture.</p>
        <p>Mostly, but not always, this is followed by the <strong>penultimate </strong>process called ‘conching’, a conch is a type of container in which the refined and blended chocolate mass is continually kneaded and further smoothed, the fractional heat produced by this process keeps the chocolate liquid.</p>
        <p><strong>TEMPERING</strong><br>
The chocolate must go through a very precise cycle of heating and cooling (called ‘tempering’) to encourage the stable crystal formation needed to produce the desirable properties for good tasty chocolate.</p>
        <p>
          <em>Note: One of the reasons that mass producers replace chocolate butter with vegetable oil (or other fat) is that they don't then have to worry about tempering the resulting concoction. An added bonus (as far as they are concerned) is that vegetable oil is much cheaper than chocolate butter, but it's addition results in a vastly inferior product that is most definitely not real chocolate.</em>
