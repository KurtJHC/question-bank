Cornrows are a type of braided hairstyle in which “the hair is braided very close to the scalp, using an underhand, upward motion to make a continuous, raised row.” Also known as canerows in the Caribbean, they can be styled in straight lines as well as in intricate geometric or curved patterns. They have been traced back to around 3,000 BCE where they were found in various cultures of West Africa and the Horn of Africa. The earliest documentation has been in Stone Age paintings in the Tassili Plateau of the Sahara. However, in more recent history, cornrows were used as a powerful tool of resistance against slavery and bondage. During the Middle Passage, millions of enslaved Africans were chained and transported across the Atlantic to the Americas. They were made to shave their heads for the purpose of “sanitation” and as a way to strip them of their culture and identity. But this wasn’t adhered to by everyone. Many of those enslaved grew out their hair and braided it into cornrows as an act of resistance, rebellion and reclamation of cultural identity.<br>

<p>A good, timely haircut is something we women prefer not to save on. It’s better to save on a dress or a new shirt – nobody would notice if you are rocking a trendy cut. Although hair styling is important, it’s often secondary, because even the messiest hairstyles need a proper base – a quality cut that has its shape and texture. In this case your hairstyle will be read appealing and harmonious even if it’s the shaggiest “unkempt” ‘do. Somehow when we see bed head hair we always guess right whether it’s a true hairstyle or lack of styling, right? Click here to find out what is new there in the haircut world, select the ideas for your new cut and anticipate your style reboot! For short haircuts, the classic cropped ‘dos have got a serious style update during the last couple of seasons. Contrasting textures and lengths, undercut sections and customized colors make them unique and bring to light the femininity of the wearer. Here are ideas of classy modern crops for every hair type. For medium haircuts, the midi length hair is the golden mean that lets you enjoy free-flowing locks or sweep your hair up in a cute updo whenever the mood strikes you. If you want to rest from the maintenance of longer locks, consider a trendy shoulder-grazing cut and enjoy the benefits that come along. We are ready to suggest numerous varieties of bobs, lobs and midi shags. For long haircuts, summer is the right time to unleash your fantasy and discover the potential of lengthy locks. A subtly feathered cut will let your strands flow nicely over the shoulders and won’t give many undesired fly-aways in an updo or a braid. The fans of edgier looks may go for shags, heavier layers or undercut styles.<br>

Throughout history and across various cultures, hair and hairstyles have had significance far beyond aesthetic beauty and protection from weather.</p>

<p>Hairstyles have symbolised one’s age, tribal affiliations, ethnicity, religion, social status, marital status and more, and have allowed ethnic and cultural groups to define and even reclaim their identities. Many of these styles have stood the test of time and remain prominent today within and without the unique cultures in which they originated. In the age of social media, however, many of these traditional hairstyles have been adopted—or appropriated rather—by celebrities, social media influencers and festival-goers as mere fashion statements without any thought given to their deep cultural significance or painful history. Thus, learning about the history and significance of hair is vital to fostering a more mindful and respectful attitude towards Black, Indigenous and People of Colour.<br>

Hair is a 1979 American musical anti-war comedy-drama film based on the 1968 Broadway musical Hair: The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical. Set against the backdrop of the long-haired hippie counterculture of the Vietnam era, the film focuses on a Vietnam War draftee who meets and befriends a "tribe" of hippies while en route to the army induction center. The hippies and their leader introduce him to illegal drug use and their environment of unorthodox relationships and draft evasion. The musical’s title song begins as character Claude slowly croons his reason for his long hair, as tribe-mate Berger joins in singing they "don't know." They lead the tribe, singing "Give me a head with hair," "as long as God can grow it," listing what they want in a head of hair and their uses for it. Later the song takes the tune of "The Star-Spangled Banner" with the tribe punning "Oh say can you see/ My eyes if you can/Then my hair’s too short!"</p>
