          <strong>What is Flat Pack Furniture?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Flat packs, also known as ready-to-assemble furniture, known-down furniture, or self-assembly furniture are incredibly popular because of their affordability. This type of furniture is produced in flat parts and are assembled when purchased without the need for special tools (in most cases). <strong>(A)</strong>&nbsp;………. Depending on the piece of furniture, they can have 5 components to assemble, or over 50. One of the most known flat pack retailers is IKEA, with stores in over 25 countries.<br>
<br>
What is Flat Pack Furniture Made from?</p>
        <p>The materials used for the making of flat packs is either solid wood, medium-density fibreboard (MDF), or chipboard. MDF is the product of the residuals of softwood and hardwood mixed with wax and combined to form a panel stronger than chipboard. Chipboard is made from wood chippings, sawdust, wood shavings or particles, and are bound together into a board. <strong>(B)</strong> ………. The only disadvantage of it is that it is more susceptible to water damage. Solid wood can crack due to time or environment conditions, which is something that cannot happen to chipboard. MDF prices can vary as well, but if it is of a high quality, then it is much stronger than chipboard. <strong>(C)</strong> ………. It is often used in furniture such as desks, and cabinets.<br>
<br>
Advantages of Flat Pack Furniture</p>
        <p>&gt;&gt; One of the most famous advantages of flat pack furniture – affordable prices. <strong>(D)</strong> ………&nbsp; Also, they are said to be cheaper because they compensate for their low durability, but if properly maintained they can be very durable.</p>
        <p>&gt;&gt; They are easy to ship, disassemble and put together. Companies do not spend tons of money on shipping costs and transportation because customers can pick their furniture themselves and build them in their homes.</p>
        <p>&gt;&gt; Flat packs can be customised – there are many sites and hacks for improving, changing the design or style of flat packs. <strong>(E)</strong> ……….</p>
        <p>&gt;&gt; They are produced by machines, which cuts company costs a lot. <strong>(F)</strong> ……….</p>
        <p>&gt;&gt; This type of furniture is easily packed and moved from one place to another. If you ever move house, you can dismantle your furniture, put them in their flat boxes and easily transport and reassemble them</p>

<br>
I remember seeing her face and falling in love. Those deep blue eyes. A clean coat, all black. Except for one spot, just below her left eye. It was as though she had a black eye, but it was white. And she had the cutest meow.
<p>I remember staring into her eyes just as she stared back at me. I told the man that I wanted this kitten. No other would suffice. This kitten, named Jess, she would be mine. I will be hers.<br>
<br>
I remember taking her home. She was purring so loudly, I could hardly hear the radio in the background. She loved having her chin rubbed. Her eyes were closed as her tail swayed back and forth.<br>
<br>
I remember watching her jump out of my arms onto the floor. She began walking around. Her new home was one big puzzle. She was going to piece it all together. She started in the living room, made her way to the kitchen, through the halls, and soon she found my room. Her room.<br>
<br>
I remember the next 14 years with Jess. We did everything together. She was my best friend. I never felt alone. I always had her when no one else was available. I was sad to leave her when I went to college. They wouldn't allow pets in the dorms. But I was ready to see her during Thanksgiving break.<br>
<br>
I remember that call. I didn't move for several minutes. My mum kept asking if I was okay. Of course I wasn't. Jess wasn't okay. Our stupid neighbour let his son drive without a license. He ran over Jess. The vet wasn't sure if she'd make it.<br>
<br>
I remember driving home. That long drive home. It took everything in me not to cry the entire time. I couldn't deal with this. My best friend, gone. I didn't even get to say goodbye.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of memories. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
At the time, it felt as if I were opening my eyes for the very first time; I felt as if it were the very first moment of my life.<br>
<br>
Our existence, our lives, they are the culmination of our memories and of experiences. They teach us how to behave around others, who to trust and who to avoid. How to get ready for the day, how to deal with hurt, how to drown in bliss.<br>
<br>
They are the infinite files tucked away in our minds, instruction manuals for life; so imagine waking from that deep place and finding that the warehouse with all those files suddenly lay barren.<br>
<br>
What would you do? I would simply scratch my head and flip the switch that drowns the place in darkness, never to be of use again. But when it came to life, I didn't have that luxury.<br>
<br>
When I awoke upon the soft cushion that was my bed, I was lost. I instinctively rummaged the recesses of my mind, trying to find any sign, any remnant of something that could help me. I knew something was missing, the sudden absence leaving me unnerved, a hollow pit left where my memories once were. I almost felt as if I could stick a hand inside and rummage around an abandoned skull. Yet still I searched, hoping that at the very least, I could find a shadow of what I once had, of who I once was.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of memories. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
The first day I flew, it is such a crystalline memory. I can close my eyes and relive the moment I left the earth. The clench, fear, panic as my hands slipped from the bar, and the relief, wonder, joy as when I just kept going up.<br>
<br>
I was twelve, and it was the third day of a cub scout summer camp. My mum had been busy that morning. She just had time to bag me a sandwich, hand me a tube of sunscreen, and drop me off at the scout leader’s house. I put on the sunscreen as I sat on the front porch and waited for the leader’s son to be ready. Soon, we were off.<br>
<br>
At the camp, I bolted out of the car to find my friend, Patrick. He was already on the playground. I don't remember what we did before we got to the monkey bars. The monkey bars were my favourite. For days I had been trying to convince him to join me on the high bar. I don't know how tall it was, but it was up there. I would scramble onto the chest high sand box and leap off the edge to grab hold of the bar. I was good. My parents had sent me to some gymnastics classes and I could spin and whip circles around the bar. I felt big up there, taunting my friend to join me. I was a bit of a show-off. On that morning of the third day, I was once again telling him how safe and easy it was. "Watch me," I said as I climbed onto the sandbox. I lept, grabbed hold of the bar and swung. Instantly, I knew something was wrong. Too late I realised what was wrong. The first two days my mother had put my sunscreen on, and I had never thought of how slick the cream would be. How the greasiness of it would linger on my hands.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of memories. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Thumbing through the dusty scrapbook, I zero in on a Polaroid of my grandmother, pruning the roses in her garden. I caught her at just the right time - a gloved hand blocking the sunlight from her eyes and only her smile visible beneath the shadow, a few pink roses lay beside her on the ground, and everything warm and bright.<br>
<br>
Tears come to my eyes as I remember her wake, the smell of fresh-cut roses in bouquets around her coffin, the pink lipstick she wore to the grave. I sat beside my mother in the front row, holding her hand while she soaked through every new tissue with her tears. I consoled her and snuggled into her side as person after person stepped up to the podium to speak, to sing, to cry, to grieve, to remember, to pray. At last, the minister walked up and smiled.<br>
<br>
“Ginny was one of the best women.”<br>
<br>
And I was gone. I ripped my hand out of my mother’s, I raced to the door, and I pushed past attendants and family members. I held my breath as I darted into the bathroom and locked the door behind me.<br>

        <p><em>Read the extract below then answer the questions.</em><br><br>
The first place that I can well remember was a large, pleasant meadow with a pond of clear water in it. Some shady trees leaned over it, and rushes and waterlilies grew at the deep end. Over the hedge on one side we looked into a plowed field, and on the other we looked over a gate at our master’s house, which stood by the<br>
roadside; at the top of the meadow was a grove of fir trees, and at the bottom a running brook overhung by a steep bank.</p>
        <p>There were six young colts in the meadow besides me; they were older than I was; some were nearly as large as grownup horses. I used to run with them, and had great fun; we used to gallop all together round and round the field as hard as we could go. Sometimes we had rather rough play, for they would frequently bite and kick as well as gallop.&nbsp;<br>
One day, when there was a good deal of kicking, my mother whinnied to me to come to her, and then she said:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I wish you to pay attention to what I am going to say to you. The colts who live here are very good colts, but they are carthorse colts, and of course they have not learned manners. You have been well-bred and well-born; your father has a great name in these parts, and your grandfather won the cup two years at the Newmarket races; your grandmother had the sweetest temper of any horse I ever knew, and I think you have never seen me kick or bite. I hope you will grow up gentle and good and never learn bad ways; do your work with a good will, lift your feet up well when you trot, and never bite or kick even in play.”</p>
        <p>I have never forgotten my mother’s advice; I knew she was a wise old horse, and our master thought a great deal of her.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Her name was Duchess, but he often called her Pet.<br>
Our master was a good, kind man. He gave us good food, good lodging, and kind words; he spoke as kindly to us as he did to his little children. We were all fond of him, and my mother loved him very much. When she saw him at the gate she would neigh with joy, and trot up to him. He would pat and stroke her and say, “Well, old Pet, and how is your little Darkie?” I was a dull black, so he called me Darkie; then he would give me a piece of bread, which was very good, and sometimes he brought a carrot for my mother. All the horses would come to him, but I think we were his favourites. My mother always took him to the town on a market day in a light gig.</p>
        <p>There was a plowboy, Dick, who sometimes came into our field to pluck&nbsp; blackberries from the hedge. When he had eaten all he wanted he would have what he called fun with the colts, throwing stones and sticks at them to make them gallop. We did not much mind him, for we could gallop off; but sometimes a stone would hit and hurt us.&nbsp;<br>
One day he was at this game, and did not know that the master was in the next field; but he was there, watching what was going on; over the hedge he jumped in a snap, and catching Dick by the arm, he gave him such a box on the ear as made him roar with the pain and surprise. As soon as we saw the master we trotted up nearer to see what went on.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Bad boy!” he said, “bad boy! to chase the colts. This is not the first time, nor the second, but it shall be the last. There—take your money and go home; I shall not want you on my farm again.” So we never saw Dick anymore. Old Daniel, the man who looked after the horses, was just as gentle as our master, so we were well off.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the extract below then answer the questions.</em><br><br>
The first place that I can well remember was a large, pleasant meadow with a pond of clear water in it. Some shady trees leaned over it, and rushes and waterlilies grew at the deep end. Over the hedge on one side we looked into a plowed field, and on the other we looked over a gate at our master’s house, which stood by the<br>
roadside; at the top of the meadow was a grove of fir trees, and at the bottom a running brook overhung by a steep bank.</p>
        <p>There were six young colts in the meadow besides me; they were older than I was; some were nearly as large as grownup horses. I used to run with them, and had great fun; we used to gallop all together round and round the field as hard as we could go. Sometimes we had rather rough play, for they would frequently bite and kick as well as gallop.&nbsp;<br>
One day, when there was a good deal of kicking, my mother whinnied to me to come to her, and then she said:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I wish you to pay attention to what I am going to say to you. The colts who live here are very good colts, but they are carthorse colts, and of course they have not learned manners. You have been well-bred and well-born; your father has a great name in these parts, and your grandfather won the cup two years at the Newmarket races; your grandmother had the sweetest temper of any horse I ever knew, and I think you have never seen me kick or bite. I hope you will grow up gentle and good and never learn bad ways; do your work with a good will, lift your feet up well when you trot, and never bite or kick even in play.”</p>
        <p>I have never forgotten my mother’s advice; I knew she was a wise old horse, and our master thought a great deal of her.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Her name was Duchess, but he often called her Pet.<br>
Our master was a good, kind man. He gave us good food, good lodging, and kind words; he spoke as kindly to us as he did to his little children. We were all fond of him, and my mother loved him very much. When she saw him at the gate she would neigh with joy, and trot up to him. He would pat and stroke her and say, “Well, old Pet, and how is your little Darkie?” I was a dull black, so he called me Darkie; then he would give me a piece of bread, which was very good, and sometimes he brought a carrot for my mother. All the horses would come to him, but I think we were his favourites. My mother always took him to the town on a market day in a light gig.</p>
        <p>There was a plowboy, Dick, who sometimes came into our field to pluck&nbsp; blackberries from the hedge. When he had eaten all he wanted he would have what he called fun with the colts, throwing stones and sticks at them to make them gallop. We did not much mind him, for we could gallop off; but sometimes a stone would hit and hurt us.&nbsp;<br>
One day he was at this game, and did not know that the master was in the next field; but he was there, watching what was going on; over the hedge he jumped in a snap, and catching Dick by the arm, he gave him such a box on the ear as made him roar with the pain and surprise. As soon as we saw the master we trotted up nearer to see what went on.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Bad boy!” he said, “bad boy! to chase the colts. This is not the first time, nor the second, but it shall be the last. There—take your money and go home; I shall not want you on my farm again.” So we never saw Dick anymore. Old Daniel, the man who looked after the horses, was just as gentle as our master, so we were well off.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the extract below then answer the questions.</em><br><br>
The first place that I can well remember was a large, pleasant meadow with a pond of clear water in it. Some shady trees leaned over it, and rushes and waterlilies grew at the deep end. Over the hedge on one side we looked into a plowed field, and on the other we looked over a gate at our master’s house, which stood by the<br>
roadside; at the top of the meadow was a grove of fir trees, and at the bottom a running brook overhung by a steep bank.</p>
        <p>There were six young colts in the meadow besides me; they were older than I was; some were nearly as large as grownup horses. I used to run with them, and had great fun; we used to gallop all together round and round the field as hard as we could go. Sometimes we had rather rough play, for they would frequently bite and kick as well as gallop.&nbsp;<br>
One day, when there was a good deal of kicking, my mother whinnied to me to come to her, and then she said:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I wish you to pay attention to what I am going to say to you. The colts who live here are very good colts, but they are carthorse colts, and of course they have not learned manners. You have been well-bred and well-born; your father has a great name in these parts, and your grandfather won the cup two years at the Newmarket races; your grandmother had the sweetest temper of any horse I ever knew, and I think you have never seen me kick or bite. I hope you will grow up gentle and good and never learn bad ways; do your work with a good will, lift your feet up well when you trot, and never bite or kick even in play.”</p>
        <p>I have never forgotten my mother’s advice; I knew she was a wise old horse, and our master thought a great deal of her.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Her name was Duchess, but he often called her Pet.<br>
Our master was a good, kind man. He gave us good food, good lodging, and kind words; he spoke as kindly to us as he did to his little children. We were all fond of him, and my mother loved him very much. When she saw him at the gate she would neigh with joy, and trot up to him. He would pat and stroke her and say, “Well, old Pet, and how is your little Darkie?” I was a dull black, so he called me Darkie; then he would give me a piece of bread, which was very good, and sometimes he brought a carrot for my mother. All the horses would come to him, but I think we were his favourites. My mother always took him to the town on a market day in a light gig.</p>
        <p>There was a plowboy, Dick, who sometimes came into our field to pluck&nbsp; blackberries from the hedge. When he had eaten all he wanted he would have what he called fun with the colts, throwing stones and sticks at them to make them gallop. We did not much mind him, for we could gallop off; but sometimes a stone would hit and hurt us.&nbsp;<br>
One day he was at this game, and did not know that the master was in the next field; but he was there, watching what was going on; over the hedge he jumped in a snap, and catching Dick by the arm, he gave him such a box on the ear as made him roar with the pain and surprise. As soon as we saw the master we trotted up nearer to see what went on.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Bad boy!” he said, “bad boy! to chase the colts. This is not the first time, nor the second, but it shall be the last. There—take your money and go home; I shall not want you on my farm again.” So we never saw Dick anymore. Old Daniel, the man who looked after the horses, was just as gentle as our master, so we were well off.&nbsp;</p>

The first place that I can well remember was a large, pleasant meadow with a pond of clear water in it. Some shady trees leaned over it, and rushes and waterlilies grew at the deep end. Over the hedge on one side we looked into a plowed field, and on the other we looked over a gate at our master’s house, which stood by the<br>
roadside; at the top of the meadow was a grove of fir trees, and at the bottom a running brook overhung by a steep bank.</p>
        <p>There were six young colts in the meadow besides me; they were older than I was; some were nearly as large as grownup horses. I used to run with them, and had great fun; we used to gallop all together round and round the field as hard as we could go. Sometimes we had rather rough play, for they would frequently bite and kick as well as gallop.&nbsp;<br>
One day, when there was a good deal of kicking, my mother whinnied to me to come to her, and then she said:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I wish you to pay attention to what I am going to say to you. The colts who live here are very good colts, but they are carthorse colts, and of course they have not learned manners. You have been well-bred and well-born; your father has a great name in these parts, and your grandfather won the cup two years at the Newmarket races; your grandmother had the sweetest temper of any horse I ever knew, and I think you have never seen me kick or bite. I hope you will grow up gentle and good and never learn bad ways; do your work with a good will, lift your feet up well when you trot, and never bite or kick even in play.”</p>
        <p>I have never forgotten my mother’s advice; I knew she was a wise old horse, and our master thought a great deal of her.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Her name was Duchess, but he often called her Pet.<br>
Our master was a good, kind man. He gave us good food, good lodging, and kind words; he spoke as kindly to us as he did to his little children. We were all fond of him, and my mother loved him very much. When she saw him at the gate she would neigh with joy, and trot up to him. He would pat and stroke her and say, “Well, old Pet, and how is your little Darkie?” I was a dull black, so he called me Darkie; then he would give me a piece of bread, which was very good, and sometimes he brought a carrot for my mother. All the horses would come to him, but I think we were his favourites. My mother always took him to the town on a market day in a light gig.</p>
        <p>There was a plowboy, Dick, who sometimes came into our field to pluck&nbsp; blackberries from the hedge. When he had eaten all he wanted he would have what he called fun with the colts, throwing stones and sticks at them to make them gallop. We did not much mind him, for we could gallop off; but sometimes a stone would hit and hurt us.&nbsp;<br>
One day he was at this game, and did not know that the master was in the next field; but he was there, watching what was going on; over the hedge he jumped in a snap, and catching Dick by the arm, he gave him such a box on the ear as made him roar with the pain and surprise. As soon as we saw the master we trotted up nearer to see what went on.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Bad boy!” he said, “bad boy! to chase the colts. This is not the first time, nor the second, but it shall be the last. There—take your money and go home; I shall not want you on my farm again.” So we never saw Dick anymore. Old Daniel, the man who looked after the horses, was just as gentle as our master, so we were well off.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Ants</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Ants, social insects belonging to the family Formicidae, are related to wasps and bees and are among the most successful creatures on Earth. With over 12,500 species named and studied, scientists believe there are still many more to be discovered. Their intricate social systems and remarkable ability to work together efficiently are what make them so fascinating and widespread.</p>
        <p>An ant colony is a complex and highly organized structure. While some colonies consist of only a few dozen individuals, others can grow to immense sizes, containing millions of ants and covering vast areas. These subterranean nests feature a variety of chambers, each serving a specific purpose. There are nurseries dedicated to raising larvae, storage rooms for food, and a special chamber reserved for the queen. Because every member of the colony works together seamlessly, much like the cells of a single organism, ant colonies are often referred to as “superorganisms.”&nbsp; <strong>(A)</strong>………………………&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors between 110 and 140 million years ago, during the age of dinosaurs. They spread widely after the appearance of flowering plants and became a dominant force in many ecosystems by 60 million years ago. This evolutionary success is a testament to their adaptability and ability to thrive in nearly every environment on Earth. This specialized anatomy allows ants to perform remarkable tasks despite their small size. True ants have a unique body plan. Their bodies are divided into three distinct sections the head, the mesosoma (thorax), and the metasoma (abdomen), connected by a narrow waist called the petiole. <strong>(B)</strong>…………. The head houses antennae for touch and smell, compound eyes for detecting movement, and strong mandibles used for carrying food, building nests, and defense.</p>
        <p>The life cycle of an ant involves a process of complete metamorphosis, moving through four stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Worker ants, which are sterile females, play a crucial role in the colony’s survival. They care for the larvae and share food through a process called trophallaxis. <strong>(C)</strong>………….&nbsp; &nbsp;The colony’s reproductive cycle culminates in “nuptial flights.” During these flights, winged male and female ants leave the nest to mate. The males die shortly after, while the fertilized queens go on to start new colonies. <strong>(D)</strong>…………&nbsp; Queens can live for decades, while worker ants live for a few years, and males often survive only weeks. The differences in lifespan reflect the specialised roles within the colony.</p>
        <p>Ants communicate in highly sophisticated ways. They primarily use chemical signals called pheromones to lay trails to food sources, signal alarm, or even confuse rival colonies. <strong>(E)</strong>…………&nbsp; Recent research has shown that ant colonies can act like a single, collective brain, making group decisions when faced with environmental challenges. This collective mind helps the colony survive and adapt to changing conditions. <strong>(F)</strong>………….&nbsp;This makes their social structure even more complex and fascinating to scientists. This collective decision-making is a key to the ants’ ability to adapt and thrive.</p>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of Conflict. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Conflict can be defined as a struggle between individuals, groups, or even nations arising from differences in opinion, interests, or values. On one hand, conflict is often viewed negatively because it can lead to anger, destruction, and lasting hostility. Wars, for example, can devastate whole societies and leave deep scars that last for generations. On the other hand, conflict can also produce unexpected positives. When people disagree, they are sometimes forced to clarify their beliefs, negotiate, or even discover innovative solutions. Consider how workplace disagreements may encourage new systems that improve efficiency. Similarly, arguments between friends, though unpleasant, can ultimately strengthen bonds once differences are resolved. Thus, conflict is not simply a destructive force but rather a complex reality that contains within it both dangers and opportunities. Its consequences largely depend on how the individuals or communities involved choose to respond.<br>
<br>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of Conflict. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
In history, countless wars have erupted from the ambitions of individuals. One striking example is the story of Alexander the Great. He inherited his father’s throne at the age of twenty and quickly launched a campaign that stretched from Greece to India. For his soldiers, these conquests brought glory and riches, but for the countless communities left behind, they meant ruin, slavery, and loss. Accounts of his battles describe towns reduced to ash and people uprooted from ancestral lands. Yet, many still admire Alexander as a visionary leader who spread new ideas, established trade routes, and united diverse peoples under one empire. His life demonstrates the dual nature of conflict: while it can destroy lives, it can also reshape civilisations and inspire admiration long after the violence has ended. Conflict in this sense is remembered not only for the suffering it causes but also for the transformations it leaves behind.<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of Conflict. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Modern conflict is not always fought with swords or guns; it can emerge quietly in homes, schools, and workplaces. A teenager arguing with parents about independence, or colleagues disagreeing about how to complete a project, are both examples of this more personal form. These struggles rarely make headlines, but they can feel overwhelming to those involved. Unresolved tension in a household might create years of resentment, whereas open discussion can prevent rifts from growing. Psychologists suggest that smaller conflicts are natural in relationships because they highlight differences in personality and expectation. The real challenge lies in learning how to handle these situations constructively. Active listening, compromise, and patience are tools that can transform arguments into opportunities for greater understanding. In contrast to large-scale wars, these intimate conflicts focus less on territory and more on feelings, identity, and mutual respect.&nbsp;<br>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of Conflict. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
When I served as a volunteer in a refugee camp, I encountered conflict in its rawest human form. The people I met had fled from civil war in their homeland. One woman, Mariam, described walking for weeks with her children after soldiers set fire to her village. She lost her husband in the fighting and had to rebuild her life from nothing. Sitting with her as she recounted these memories, I realised how conflict is not just a clash of armies but also a series of personal tragedies that ripple across generations. Yet, there was also resilience. Despite the loss, Mariam had begun to organise small classes for children, teaching them to read and write under a makeshift shelter. In her determination, I saw how people endure, and even resist, the destructive weight of war. Her story reminded me that every statistic about conflict conceals individual lives of courage and grief.<br>
