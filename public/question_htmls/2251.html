"Will you come with us, Susan?" cried several little girls to a schoolmate. "We are going to the woods; do come, too."
<p>"I should like to go with you very much," replied Susan, with a sigh; "but I can not finish the task grandmother set me to do."</p>

<p>"How tiresome it must be to stay at home to work on a holiday!" said one of the girls, with a toss of her head. "Susan's grandmother is too strict."</p>

<p>Susan heard this remark, and, as she bent her head over her task, she wiped away a tear, and thought of the pleasant afternoon the girls would spend gathering wild flowers in the woods.</p>

<p>Soon she said to herself, "What harm can there be in moving the mark grandmother put in the stocking? The woods must be very beautiful today, and how I should like to be in them!"</p>

<p>"Grandmother," said she, a few minutes afterwards, "I am ready, now." "What, so soon, Susan?" Her grandmother took the work, and looked at it very closely.</p>

<p>"True, Susan," said she, laying great stress on each word; "true, I count twenty turns from the mark; and, as you have never deceived me, you may go and amuse yourself as you like the rest of the day."</p>

<p>Susan's cheeks were scarlet, and she did not say, "Thank you." As she left the cottage, she walked slowly away, not singing as usual.</p>

<p>"Why, here is Susan!" the girls cried, when she joined their company; "but what is the matter? Why have you left your dear, old grandmother?" they tauntingly added.</p>

<p>"There is nothing the matter." As Susan repeated these words, she felt that she was trying to deceive herself. She had acted a lie. At the same time she remembered her grandmother's words, "You have never deceived me."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have deceived her," said she to herself. "If she knew all, she would never trust me again."</p>

<p>When the little party had reached an open space in the woods, her companions ran about enjoying themselves; but Susan sat on the grass, wishing she were at home confessing her fault.</p>

<p>After a while Rose cried out, "Let us make a crown of violets, and put it on the head of the best girl here."</p>

<p>"It will be easy enough to make the crown, but not so easy to decide who is to wear it," said Julia.</p>

<p>"Why, Susan is to wear it, of course," said Rose: "is she not said to be the best girl in school and the most obedient at home?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; the crown shall be for Susan," cried the other girls, and they began to make the crown. It was soon finished.</p>

<p>&nbsp;"Now, Susan," said Rose, "put it on in a very dignified way, for you are to be our queen."</p>

<p>As these words were spoken, the crown was placed on her head. In a moment she snatched it off, and threw it on the ground, saying, "No crown for me; I do not deserve it."</p>

<p>The girls looked at her with surprise. "I have deceived my grandmother," said she, while tears flowed down her cheeks. "I altered the mark she put in the stocking, that I might join you in the woods."</p>

<p>"Do you call that wicked?" asked one of the girls. "I am quite sure it is; and I have been miserable all the time I have been here."</p>

"Will you come with us, Susan?" cried several little girls to a schoolmate. "We are going to the woods; do come, too."
<p>"I should like to go with you very much," replied Susan, with a sigh; "but I can not finish the task grandmother set me to do."</p>

<p>"How tiresome it must be to stay at home to work on a holiday!" said one of the girls, with a toss of her head. "Susan's grandmother is too strict."</p>

<p>Susan heard this remark, and, as she bent her head over her task, she wiped away a tear, and thought of the pleasant afternoon the girls would spend gathering wild flowers in the woods.</p>

<p>Soon she said to herself, "What harm can there be in moving the mark grandmother put in the stocking? The woods must be very beautiful today, and how I should like to be in them!"</p>

<p>"Grandmother," said she, a few minutes afterwards, "I am ready, now." "What, so soon, Susan?" Her grandmother took the work, and looked at it very closely.</p>

<p>"True, Susan," said she, laying great stress on each word; "true, I count twenty turns from the mark; and, as you have never deceived me, you may go and amuse yourself as you like the rest of the day."</p>

<p>Susan's cheeks were scarlet, and she did not say, "Thank you." As she left the cottage, she walked slowly away, not singing as usual.</p>

<p>"Why, here is Susan!" the girls cried, when she joined their company; "but what is the matter? Why have you left your dear, old grandmother?" they tauntingly added.</p>

<p>"There is nothing the matter." As Susan repeated these words, she felt that she was trying to deceive herself. She had acted a lie. At the same time she remembered her grandmother's words, "You have never deceived me."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have deceived her," said she to herself. "If she knew all, she would never trust me again."</p>

<p>When the little party had reached an open space in the woods, her companions ran about enjoying themselves; but Susan sat on the grass, wishing she were at home confessing her fault.</p>

<p>After a while Rose cried out, "Let us make a crown of violets, and put it on the head of the best girl here."</p>

<p>"It will be easy enough to make the crown, but not so easy to decide who is to wear it," said Julia.</p>

<p>"Why, Susan is to wear it, of course," said Rose: "is she not said to be the best girl in school and the most obedient at home?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; the crown shall be for Susan," cried the other girls, and they began to make the crown. It was soon finished.</p>

<p>&nbsp;"Now, Susan," said Rose, "put it on in a very dignified way, for you are to be our queen."</p>

<p>As these words were spoken, the crown was placed on her head. In a moment she snatched it off, and threw it on the ground, saying, "No crown for me; I do not deserve it."</p>

<p>The girls looked at her with surprise. "I have deceived my grandmother," said she, while tears flowed down her cheeks. "I altered the mark she put in the stocking, that I might join you in the woods."</p>

<p>"Do you call that wicked?" asked one of the girls. "I am quite sure it is; and I have been miserable all the time I have been here."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have deceived her," said she to herself. "If she knew all, she would never trust me again."</p>

<p>When the little party had reached an open space in the woods, her companions ran about enjoying themselves; but Susan sat on the grass, wishing she were at home confessing her fault.</p>

<p>After a while Rose cried out, "Let us make a crown of violets, and put it on the head of the best girl here."</p>

<p>"It will be easy enough to make the crown, but not so easy to decide who is to wear it," said Julia.</p>

<p>"Why, Susan is to wear it, of course," said Rose: "is she not said to be the best girl in school and the most obedient at home?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; the crown shall be for Susan," cried the other girls, and they began to make the crown. It was soon finished.</p>

<p>&nbsp;"Now, Susan," said Rose, "put it on in a very dignified way, for you are to be our queen."</p>

<p>As these words were spoken, the crown was placed on her head. In a moment she snatched it off, and threw it on the ground, saying, "No crown for me; I do not deserve it."</p>

<p>The girls looked at her with surprise. "I have deceived my grandmother," said she, while tears flowed down her cheeks. "I altered the mark she put in the stocking, that I might join you in the woods."</p>

<p>"Do you call that wicked?" asked one of the girls. "I am quite sure it is; and I have been miserable all the time I have been here."</p>

The phrase “trench warfare” immediately conjures images of the mud and slaughter of the Western Front during World War I. Millions died in fruitless offensives that saw men “go over the top” into withering machine gun fire. Ultimately, inventions such as tanks and airplanes allowed troops to move through or over No Man’s Land, and new technologies and doctrines would usher in the mobile warfare that characterized World War II in Europe. The German blitzkrieg flew over and drove around the Maginot Line, perhaps the most formidable static defensive barrier ever constructed, and that would seem to have spelled the end of trench warfare.</p>
For this reason, and because trench warfare is so closely associated with primitive <span class="txt-underline">black-and-white footage</span> of men struggling to cross the pockmarked battlefields of Belgium and France, it is commonly assumed that this military strategy is a relic of a bygone age, as likely to reappear as catapults or cavalry charges. In fact, trench warfare remains arguably the most effective strategy for infantry where, for whatever reason, armor and air support are lacking. During the Iran-Iraq War (1980–88), after initial gains by the Iraqi army, the fighting settled into years of trench warfare. Iran even engaged in World War I–style human wave attacks; such offensives were as unsuccessful and bloody as they had been 70 years earlier. The Syrian Civil War (2011– ) recapitulated World War I in a different fashion, with Bashar al-Assad’s army assaulting opposition-held areas with chemical weapons. The lines in that war remained relatively static, with opposition groups using trench systems that exhibited varying degrees of permanence and sophistication, until Russian airpower dramatically shifted the balance in favor of the Syrian government. In eastern Ukraine, where a mixed force of Russian troops, mercenaries, and Russian-backed militants were engaging in a proxy war against the government in Kiev (2014– ), trench systems and hardened fortifications marked a front line some 250 miles long. Airpower was largely absent from the “contact line” in Ukraine, because of the presence of sophisticated Russian antiaircraft systems on the pro-Russian side (one such system was used in the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight 17) and Russia’s desire to maintain plausible deniability of its direct involvement in the conflict. Drones may have replaced carrier pigeons in the skies above the battlefield, but the use of trenches has changed little since Verdun and the Somme.</div>

The phrase “trench warfare” immediately conjures images of the mud and slaughter of the Western Front during World War I. Millions died in fruitless offensives that saw men “go over the top” into withering machine gun fire. Ultimately, inventions such as tanks and airplanes allowed troops to move through or over No Man’s Land, and new technologies and doctrines would usher in the mobile warfare that characterized World War II in Europe. The German blitzkrieg flew over and drove around the Maginot Line, perhaps the most formidable static defensive barrier ever constructed, and that would seem to have spelled the end of trench warfare.</p>
For this reason, and because trench warfare is so closely associated with primitive <span class="txt-underline">black-and-white footage</span> of men struggling to cross the pockmarked battlefields of Belgium and France, it is commonly assumed that this military strategy is a relic of a bygone age, as likely to reappear as catapults or cavalry charges. In fact, trench warfare remains arguably the most effective strategy for infantry where, for whatever reason, armor and air support are lacking. During the Iran-Iraq War (1980–88), after initial gains by the Iraqi army, the fighting settled into years of trench warfare. Iran even engaged in World War I–style human wave attacks; such offensives were as unsuccessful and bloody as they had been 70 years earlier. The Syrian Civil War (2011– ) recapitulated World War I in a different fashion, with Bashar al-Assad’s army assaulting opposition-held areas with chemical weapons. The lines in that war remained relatively static, with opposition groups using trench systems that exhibited varying degrees of permanence and sophistication, until Russian airpower dramatically shifted the balance in favor of the Syrian government. In eastern Ukraine, where a mixed force of Russian troops, mercenaries, and Russian-backed militants were engaging in a proxy war against the government in Kiev (2014– ), trench systems and hardened fortifications marked a front line some 250 miles long. Airpower was largely absent from the “contact line” in Ukraine, because of the presence of sophisticated Russian antiaircraft systems on the pro-Russian side (one such system was used in the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight 17) and Russia’s desire to maintain plausible deniability of its direct involvement in the conflict. Drones may have replaced carrier pigeons in the skies above the battlefield, but the use of trenches has changed little since Verdun and the Somme.</div>

        <p><em>Read the following passage and answer questions 20 - 25.</em><br><br>
Ecosystems are not <span class="txt-underline"><strong>static</strong></span> things.&nbsp;Wetlands and grasslands, patches of forests, and even whole landscapes (which may contain several ecosystems) constantly evolve in response to changing temperatures, moisture levels, light availability, rates of nutrient inflow and outflow, and activities of plants, animals, and other forms of life.</p>
        <p>Ecological succession is the process by which the structure of a biological community changes over time. In most ecosystems, if succession is allowed to continue without a major disturbance (such as a flood or a wildfire), the ecosystem structure will be composed of a mix of plants and animals that maximizes the “goods” (such as moisture and nutrients) the environment can provide.&nbsp;When the biological community in a given environment becomes relatively stable, ecologists call that assemblage of living things a climax community.</p>
        <p>Primary succession is the process in which plants and animals first colonize a barren habitat. On a newly created volcanic island, for example, after the rock cools, seeds blown by the wind may lodge in crevices. There they can germinate and take root. Often these first colonizing plants are weedy species, such as fast-growing grasses, that do not grow tall but do reproduce quickly. After these plants germinate and grow, they die and decompose, and their remains create pockets of soil from which other plants as well as fungi can grow. Over time, as vegetation covers more and more of the island, seeds from other plants arrive (possibly transported by birds that begin to use the island as a stopover during migration). As the plant community develops, hardier, taller-growing species begin to shade out the first colonizers and eventually dominate. More plants and animals arrive (the latter rafting over on flotsam or flying from nearby islands or the mainland), and the ecosystem changes with each new arrival. Over several decades, as populations of different species become established, the ecosystem’s structure becomes more stable.</p>
        <p>Secondary succession differs from primary succession in that it begins after a major disturbance—such as a devastating flood, wildfire, landslide, lava flow, or human activity (farming, road or building construction, or the like)—wipes away part of a landscape. The stages of secondary succession are similar to those of primary succession: insects and weedy plants (frequently from surrounding ecosystems) are often the first to recolonize the disturbed area, and these species are replaced by hardier plants and animals as time goes on. If this landscape remains undisturbed for a long enough time, the evolving biological community can once again attain a stable ecological structure.</p>
        <p>Although wildfires and other disturbances can certainly bring ruin to a landscape, the soil often retains a bank of seeds that can sprout shortly after the effects of the disturbance pass, so ecosystems within the landscape can recover through secondary succession. Sometimes, however, catastrophic disturbances, such as massive volcanic eruptions or advancing glaciers, effectively eliminate all of the biological activity in a landscape. In these cases, any seeds that survive the disturbance are covered with large amounts of ash, rock, or ice, which isolates them from the landscape’s future development. Consequently, the landscape can return to life only though primary succession.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the following passage and answer questions 20 - 25.</em><br><br>
Ecosystems are not <span class="txt-underline"><strong>static</strong></span> things.&nbsp;Wetlands and grasslands, patches of forests, and even whole landscapes (which may contain several ecosystems) constantly evolve in response to changing temperatures, moisture levels, light availability, rates of nutrient inflow and outflow, and activities of plants, animals, and other forms of life.</p>
        <p>Ecological succession is the process by which the structure of a biological community changes over time. In most ecosystems, if succession is allowed to continue without a major disturbance (such as a flood or a wildfire), the ecosystem structure will be composed of a mix of plants and animals that maximizes the “goods” (such as moisture and nutrients) the environment can provide.&nbsp;When the biological community in a given environment becomes relatively stable, ecologists call that assemblage of living things a climax community.</p>
        <p>Primary succession is the process in which plants and animals first colonize a barren habitat. On a newly created volcanic island, for example, after the rock cools, seeds blown by the wind may lodge in crevices. There they can germinate and take root. Often these first colonizing plants are weedy species, such as fast-growing grasses, that do not grow tall but do reproduce quickly. After these plants germinate and grow, they die and decompose, and their remains create pockets of soil from which other plants as well as fungi can grow. Over time, as vegetation covers more and more of the island, seeds from other plants arrive (possibly transported by birds that begin to use the island as a stopover during migration). As the plant community develops, hardier, taller-growing species begin to shade out the first colonizers and eventually dominate. More plants and animals arrive (the latter rafting over on flotsam or flying from nearby islands or the mainland), and the ecosystem changes with each new arrival. Over several decades, as populations of different species become established, the ecosystem’s structure becomes more stable.</p>
        <p>Secondary succession differs from primary succession in that it begins after a major disturbance—such as a devastating flood, wildfire, landslide, lava flow, or human activity (farming, road or building construction, or the like)—wipes away part of a landscape. The stages of secondary succession are similar to those of primary succession: insects and weedy plants (frequently from surrounding ecosystems) are often the first to recolonize the disturbed area, and these species are replaced by hardier plants and animals as time goes on. If this landscape remains undisturbed for a long enough time, the evolving biological community can once again attain a stable ecological structure.</p>
        <p>Although wildfires and other disturbances can certainly bring ruin to a landscape, the soil often retains a bank of seeds that can sprout shortly after the effects of the disturbance pass, so ecosystems within the landscape can recover through secondary succession. Sometimes, however, catastrophic disturbances, such as massive volcanic eruptions or advancing glaciers, effectively eliminate all of the biological activity in a landscape. In these cases, any seeds that survive the disturbance are covered with large amounts of ash, rock, or ice, which isolates them from the landscape’s future development. Consequently, the landscape can return to life only though primary succession.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the following passage and answer questions 20 - 25.</em><br><br>
Ecosystems are not <span class="txt-underline"><strong>static</strong></span> things.&nbsp;Wetlands and grasslands, patches of forests, and even whole landscapes (which may contain several ecosystems) constantly evolve in response to changing temperatures, moisture levels, light availability, rates of nutrient inflow and outflow, and activities of plants, animals, and other forms of life.</p>
        <p>Ecological succession is the process by which the structure of a biological community changes over time. In most ecosystems, if succession is allowed to continue without a major disturbance (such as a flood or a wildfire), the ecosystem structure will be composed of a mix of plants and animals that maximizes the “goods” (such as moisture and nutrients) the environment can provide.&nbsp;When the biological community in a given environment becomes relatively stable, ecologists call that assemblage of living things a climax community.</p>
        <p>Primary succession is the process in which plants and animals first colonize a barren habitat. On a newly created volcanic island, for example, after the rock cools, seeds blown by the wind may lodge in crevices. There they can germinate and take root. Often these first colonizing plants are weedy species, such as fast-growing grasses, that do not grow tall but do reproduce quickly. After these plants germinate and grow, they die and decompose, and their remains create pockets of soil from which other plants as well as fungi can grow. Over time, as vegetation covers more and more of the island, seeds from other plants arrive (possibly transported by birds that begin to use the island as a stopover during migration). As the plant community develops, hardier, taller-growing species begin to shade out the first colonizers and eventually dominate. More plants and animals arrive (the latter rafting over on flotsam or flying from nearby islands or the mainland), and the ecosystem changes with each new arrival. Over several decades, as populations of different species become established, the ecosystem’s structure becomes more stable.</p>
        <p>Secondary succession differs from primary succession in that it begins after a major disturbance—such as a devastating flood, wildfire, landslide, lava flow, or human activity (farming, road or building construction, or the like)—wipes away part of a landscape. The stages of secondary succession are similar to those of primary succession: insects and weedy plants (frequently from surrounding ecosystems) are often the first to recolonize the disturbed area, and these species are replaced by hardier plants and animals as time goes on. If this landscape remains undisturbed for a long enough time, the evolving biological community can once again attain a stable ecological structure.</p>
        <p>Although wildfires and other disturbances can certainly bring ruin to a landscape, the soil often retains a bank of seeds that can sprout shortly after the effects of the disturbance pass, so ecosystems within the landscape can recover through secondary succession. Sometimes, however, catastrophic disturbances, such as massive volcanic eruptions or advancing glaciers, effectively eliminate all of the biological activity in a landscape. In these cases, any seeds that survive the disturbance are covered with large amounts of ash, rock, or ice, which isolates them from the landscape’s future development. Consequently, the landscape can return to life only though primary succession.&nbsp;</p>
