        <p>A little bit of magic is about to appear.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Earlatidge Hubert Umbray can sense it. Has the nose for it. After all these years of being the custodian of The Emporium of Imagination, he would. He’s fifty-something years old but refuses to keep track of time. Seems time does that well enough by itself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He pulls his 1954 Holden FJ (perfect paint job, complete with original red leather interiors and bucket seats) into a parking space on the dark street. It is a car that requires a physical key to drive it, a fact he is proud of as he turns off the ignition. A car where the air-conditioning system is the window he now winds down by hand.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He breathes deep. Arriving. Bathing himself in this moment.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There’s a wrinkle in the night air. A silent ripple throughout the township of Boonah. Nothing tangible; simply an unrest. A wakefulness. He knows that people are sticking to their sheets, tossing and turning. They assume that what keeps them awake is the humid mess of another January night, but they are wrong.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Earlatidge opens his car door with a satisfying creak, a noise like that of his hip joints. There’s no one around. No cars, no people. Only the steps of his polished, brown <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Oxfords</strong></span> on the footpath as he walks to the rear of the car. He arranges his suit, straightens his tie and checks his silver cufflinks, then he reaches into the back seat for his top hat and positions it on his head. Lastly, he takes a firm hold of the handle of <span class="txt-underline"><strong>his dome-top lunch box</strong></span>. It is the most important piece of the magic to come.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now things may begin.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He strides down Main Street deeper into the evening, way past the hours when all manner of humanity sat back-slapping and too-loud-laughing on bar stools. Long past the hour when the kitchen hands stopped serving pizzas. There are only the stars spread above his head for company and he feels full of the wonder of the world.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With his eyes on those stars, Earlatidge notices for the umpteenth time how small humanity is rendered against the backdrop of sky and the silence of the evening settled about. And in that quiet, he searches for the precise destination.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He stares up at the town clock as he passes. It’s over five metres tall with an oversized ushaped head taken from the firebox of an old steam boiler. Welded to the sides are wheels, metal curls and swirls, cogs and bits of this and that. The face is complete with nineteenth-century clock hands, an almost comical Dr Seuss-type creation.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Earlatidge notes the time. 3.35 am. He takes his hat off and pauses with his head hung low to acknowledge the time, what it means to him, before striding into the pre-dawn.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Because he is not merely meandering, Earlatidge soon finds the empty lot. A piece of land that locals have walked past so often they’ve stopped seeing it. For them it would take some noticing to become aware of the rectangle-shaped land squeezed in between The Golden Goose Jewellery Shop and Bart’s Real Estate, but Earlatidge has long since learnt that it is the common, the seemingly insignificant places, where The Emporium makes its home.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Earlatidge stops on the footpath in front of the vacant block holding the lunch box close to his chest. Waits.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then he hears it. The soft bell of an antique phone. And he knows.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This is indeed the place.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This is where The Emporium of Imagination will stand.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Boonah’s townspeople will not see the shop being constructed or fitted out. No trucks will arrive with inventory. Indeed, what inventory could there be? And yet there is all the lumber that is needed.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Ah, Earlatidge can almost hear the townsfolk ask, ‘Surely there were builders?’ Over the years, he’s also developed an allergy to explaining The Emporium. It makes him shorttempered and itchy-footed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He used to say, ‘Is this The Emporium of Fruit? The Emporium of Fashion? Of toys or antiques or jewellery? No, no and no! This is something special.’ He used to remind people how imagination works. He’d say, ‘Remember when that toy dinosaur you got for Christmas wore Barbie’s bonnet and saved the world? Or when you watched out your bedroom window for the Care Bear that was going to slide down the rainbow right into your arms? Well, that’s still how imagination works and exactly how the shop is built.’</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Later, in this town, when night gives way to morning, Earlatidge knows that people will stand at the shop’s door and scratch their heads. But for now, a hushed invitation floats throughout the streets.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>A little bit of magic is about to appear.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Earlatidge Hubert Umbray can sense it. Has the nose for it. After all these years of being the custodian of The Emporium of Imagination, he would. He’s fifty-something years old but refuses to keep track of time. Seems time does that well enough by itself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He pulls his 1954 Holden FJ (perfect paint job, complete with original red leather interiors and bucket seats) into a parking space on the dark street. It is a car that requires a physical key to drive it, a fact he is proud of as he turns off the ignition. A car where the air-conditioning system is the window he now winds down by hand.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He breathes deep. Arriving. Bathing himself in this moment.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There’s a wrinkle in the night air. A silent ripple throughout the township of Boonah. Nothing tangible; simply an unrest. A wakefulness. He knows that people are sticking to their sheets, tossing and turning. They assume that what keeps them awake is the humid mess of another January night, but they are wrong.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Earlatidge opens his car door with a satisfying creak, a noise like that of his hip joints. There’s no one around. No cars, no people. Only the steps of his polished, brown <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Oxfords</strong></span> on the footpath as he walks to the rear of the car. He arranges his suit, straightens his tie and checks his silver cufflinks, then he reaches into the back seat for his top hat and positions it on his head. Lastly, he takes a firm hold of the handle of <span class="txt-underline"><strong>his dome-top lunch box</strong></span>. It is the most important piece of the magic to come.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now things may begin.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He strides down Main Street deeper into the evening, way past the hours when all manner of humanity sat back-slapping and too-loud-laughing on bar stools. Long past the hour when the kitchen hands stopped serving pizzas. There are only the stars spread above his head for company and he feels full of the wonder of the world.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With his eyes on those stars, Earlatidge notices for the umpteenth time how small humanity is rendered against the backdrop of sky and the silence of the evening settled about. And in that quiet, he searches for the precise destination.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He stares up at the town clock as he passes. It’s over five metres tall with an oversized ushaped head taken from the firebox of an old steam boiler. Welded to the sides are wheels, metal curls and swirls, cogs and bits of this and that. The face is complete with nineteenth-century clock hands, an almost comical Dr Seuss-type creation.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Earlatidge notes the time. 3.35 am. He takes his hat off and pauses with his head hung low to acknowledge the time, what it means to him, before striding into the pre-dawn.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Because he is not merely meandering, Earlatidge soon finds the empty lot. A piece of land that locals have walked past so often they’ve stopped seeing it. For them it would take some noticing to become aware of the rectangle-shaped land squeezed in between The Golden Goose Jewellery Shop and Bart’s Real Estate, but Earlatidge has long since learnt that it is the common, the seemingly insignificant places, where The Emporium makes its home.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Earlatidge stops on the footpath in front of the vacant block holding the lunch box close to his chest. Waits.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then he hears it. The soft bell of an antique phone. And he knows.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This is indeed the place.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This is where The Emporium of Imagination will stand.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Boonah’s townspeople will not see the shop being constructed or fitted out. No trucks will arrive with inventory. Indeed, what inventory could there be? And yet there is all the lumber that is needed.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Ah, Earlatidge can almost hear the townsfolk ask, ‘Surely there were builders?’ Over the years, he’s also developed an allergy to explaining The Emporium. It makes him shorttempered and itchy-footed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He used to say, ‘Is this The Emporium of Fruit? The Emporium of Fashion? Of toys or antiques or jewellery? No, no and no! This is something special.’ He used to remind people how imagination works. He’d say, ‘Remember when that toy dinosaur you got for Christmas wore Barbie’s bonnet and saved the world? Or when you watched out your bedroom window for the Care Bear that was going to slide down the rainbow right into your arms? Well, that’s still how imagination works and exactly how the shop is built.’</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Later, in this town, when night gives way to morning, Earlatidge knows that people will stand at the shop’s door and scratch their heads. But for now, a hushed invitation floats throughout the streets.</p>

        <p>A little bit of magic is about to appear.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Earlatidge Hubert Umbray can sense it. Has the nose for it. After all these years of being the custodian of The Emporium of Imagination, he would. He’s fifty-something years old but refuses to keep track of time. Seems time does that well enough by itself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He pulls his 1954 Holden FJ (perfect paint job, complete with original red leather interiors and bucket seats) into a parking space on the dark street. It is a car that requires a physical key to drive it, a fact he is proud of as he turns off the ignition. A car where the air-conditioning system is the window he now winds down by hand.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He breathes deep. Arriving. Bathing himself in this moment.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There’s a wrinkle in the night air. A silent ripple throughout the township of Boonah. Nothing tangible; simply an unrest. A wakefulness. He knows that people are sticking to their sheets, tossing and turning. They assume that what keeps them awake is the humid mess of another January night, but they are wrong.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Earlatidge opens his car door with a satisfying creak, a noise like that of his hip joints. There’s no one around. No cars, no people. Only the steps of his polished, brown <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Oxfords</strong></span> on the footpath as he walks to the rear of the car. He arranges his suit, straightens his tie and checks his silver cufflinks, then he reaches into the back seat for his top hat and positions it on his head. Lastly, he takes a firm hold of the handle of <span class="txt-underline"><strong>his dome-top lunch box</strong></span>. It is the most important piece of the magic to come.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now things may begin.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He strides down Main Street deeper into the evening, way past the hours when all manner of humanity sat back-slapping and too-loud-laughing on bar stools. Long past the hour when the kitchen hands stopped serving pizzas. There are only the stars spread above his head for company and he feels full of the wonder of the world.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With his eyes on those stars, Earlatidge notices for the umpteenth time how small humanity is rendered against the backdrop of sky and the silence of the evening settled about. And in that quiet, he searches for the precise destination.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He stares up at the town clock as he passes. It’s over five metres tall with an oversized ushaped head taken from the firebox of an old steam boiler. Welded to the sides are wheels, metal curls and swirls, cogs and bits of this and that. The face is complete with nineteenth-century clock hands, an almost comical Dr Seuss-type creation.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Earlatidge notes the time. 3.35 am. He takes his hat off and pauses with his head hung low to acknowledge the time, what it means to him, before striding into the pre-dawn.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Because he is not merely meandering, Earlatidge soon finds the empty lot. A piece of land that locals have walked past so often they’ve stopped seeing it. For them it would take some noticing to become aware of the rectangle-shaped land squeezed in between The Golden Goose Jewellery Shop and Bart’s Real Estate, but Earlatidge has long since learnt that it is the common, the seemingly insignificant places, where The Emporium makes its home.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Earlatidge stops on the footpath in front of the vacant block holding the lunch box close to his chest. Waits.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then he hears it. The soft bell of an antique phone. And he knows.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>A little bit of magic is about to appear.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Earlatidge Hubert Umbray can sense it. Has the nose for it. After all these years of being the custodian of The Emporium of Imagination, he would. He’s fifty-something years old but refuses to keep track of time. Seems time does that well enough by itself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He pulls his 1954 Holden FJ (perfect paint job, complete with original red leather interiors and bucket seats) into a parking space on the dark street. It is a car that requires a physical key to drive it, a fact he is proud of as he turns off the ignition. A car where the air-conditioning system is the window he now winds down by hand.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He breathes deep. Arriving. Bathing himself in this moment.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There’s a wrinkle in the night air. A silent ripple throughout the township of Boonah. Nothing tangible; simply an unrest. A wakefulness. He knows that people are sticking to their sheets, tossing and turning. They assume that what keeps them awake is the humid mess of another January night, but they are wrong.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Earlatidge opens his car door with a satisfying creak, a noise like that of his hip joints. There’s no one around. No cars, no people. Only the steps of his polished, brown <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Oxfords</strong></span> on the footpath as he walks to the rear of the car. He arranges his suit, straightens his tie and checks his silver cufflinks, then he reaches into the back seat for his top hat and positions it on his head. Lastly, he takes a firm hold of the handle of <span class="txt-underline"><strong>his dome-top lunch box</strong></span>. It is the most important piece of the magic to come.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now things may begin.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He strides down Main Street deeper into the evening, way past the hours when all manner of humanity sat back-slapping and too-loud-laughing on bar stools. Long past the hour when the kitchen hands stopped serving pizzas. There are only the stars spread above his head for company and he feels full of the wonder of the world.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With his eyes on those stars, Earlatidge notices for the umpteenth time how small humanity is rendered against the backdrop of sky and the silence of the evening settled about. And in that quiet, he searches for the precise destination.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He stares up at the town clock as he passes. It’s over five metres tall with an oversized ushaped head taken from the firebox of an old steam boiler. Welded to the sides are wheels, metal curls and swirls, cogs and bits of this and that. The face is complete with nineteenth-century clock hands, an almost comical Dr Seuss-type creation.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Earlatidge notes the time. 3.35 am. He takes his hat off and pauses with his head hung low to acknowledge the time, what it means to him, before striding into the pre-dawn.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Because he is not merely meandering, Earlatidge soon finds the empty lot. A piece of land that locals have walked past so often they’ve stopped seeing it. For them it would take some noticing to become aware of the rectangle-shaped land squeezed in between The Golden Goose Jewellery Shop and Bart’s Real Estate, but Earlatidge has long since learnt that it is the common, the seemingly insignificant places, where The Emporium makes its home.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Earlatidge stops on the footpath in front of the vacant block holding the lunch box close to his chest. Waits.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then he hears it. The soft bell of an antique phone. And he knows.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This is indeed the place.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This is where The Emporium of Imagination will stand.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Boonah’s townspeople will not see the shop being constructed or fitted out. No trucks will arrive with inventory. Indeed, what inventory could there be? And yet there is all the lumber that is needed.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Ah, Earlatidge can almost hear the townsfolk ask, ‘Surely there were builders?’ Over the years, he’s also developed an allergy to explaining The Emporium. It makes him shorttempered and itchy-footed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He used to say, ‘Is this The Emporium of Fruit? The Emporium of Fashion? Of toys or antiques or jewellery? No, no and no! This is something special.’ He used to remind people how imagination works. He’d say, ‘Remember when that toy dinosaur you got for Christmas wore Barbie’s bonnet and saved the world? Or when you watched out your bedroom window for the Care Bear that was going to slide down the rainbow right into your arms? Well, that’s still how imagination works and exactly how the shop is built.’</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Later, in this town, when night gives way to morning, Earlatidge knows that people will stand at the shop’s door and scratch their heads. But for now, a hushed invitation floats throughout the streets.</p>

        <p>Earlatidge Hubert Umbray can sense it. Has the nose for it. After all these years of being the custodian of The Emporium of Imagination, he would. He’s fifty-something years old but refuses to keep track of time. Seems time does that well enough by itself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He pulls his 1954 Holden FJ (perfect paint job, complete with original red leather interiors and bucket seats) into a parking space on the dark street. It is a car that requires a physical key to drive it, a fact he is proud of as he turns off the ignition. A car where the air-conditioning system is the window he now winds down by hand.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He breathes deep. Arriving. Bathing himself in this moment.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There’s a wrinkle in the night air. A silent ripple throughout the township of Boonah. Nothing tangible; simply an unrest. A wakefulness. He knows that people are sticking to their sheets, tossing and turning. They assume that what keeps them awake is the humid mess of another January night, but they are wrong.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Earlatidge opens his car door with a satisfying creak, a noise like that of his hip joints. There’s no one around. No cars, no people. Only the steps of his polished, brown <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Oxfords</strong></span> on the footpath as he walks to the rear of the car. He arranges his suit, straightens his tie and checks his silver cufflinks, then he reaches into the back seat for his top hat and positions it on his head.

Long past the hour when the kitchen hands stopped serving pizzas. There are only the stars spread above his head for company and he feels full of the wonder of the world.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With his eyes on those stars, Earlatidge notices for the umpteenth time how small humanity is rendered against the backdrop of sky and the silence of the evening settled about. And in that quiet, he searches for the precise destination.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He stares up at the town clock as he passes. It’s over five metres tall with an oversized ushaped head taken from the firebox of an old steam boiler. Welded to the sides are wheels, metal curls and swirls, cogs and bits of this and that. The face is complete with nineteenth-century clock hands, an almost comical Dr Seuss-type creation.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Earlatidge notes the time. 3.35 am. He takes his hat off and pauses with his head hung low to acknowledge the time, what it means to him, before striding into the pre-dawn.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Because he is not merely meandering, Earlatidge soon finds the empty lot. A piece of land that locals have walked past so often they’ve stopped seeing it. For them it would take some noticing to become aware of the rectangle-shaped land squeezed in between The Golden Goose Jewellery Shop and Bart’s Real Estate, but Earlatidge has long since learnt that it is the common, the seemingly insignificant places, where The Emporium makes its home.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Earlatidge stops on the footpath in front of the vacant block holding the lunch box close to his chest. Waits.</p>

          <strong>The Emporium of Imagination&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-rgt">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="txt-rgt">
          <em>by Tabitha Bird</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A little bit of magic is about to appear.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Earlatidge Hubert Umbray can sense it. Has the nose for it. After all these years of being the custodian of The Emporium of Imagination, he would. He’s fifty-something years old but refuses to keep track of time. Seems time does that well enough by itself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He pulls his 1954 Holden FJ (perfect paint job, complete with original red leather interiors and bucket seats) into a parking space on the dark street. It is a car that requires a physical key to drive it, a fact he is proud of as he turns off the ignition. A car where the air-conditioning system is the window he now winds down by hand.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He breathes deep. Arriving. Bathing himself in this moment.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There’s a wrinkle in the night air. A silent ripple throughout the township of Boonah. Nothing tangible; simply an unrest. A wakefulness. He knows that people are sticking to their sheets, tossing and turning. They assume that what keeps them awake is the humid mess of another January night, but they are wrong.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Earlatidge opens his car door with a satisfying creak, a noise like that of his hip joints. There’s no one around. No cars, no people. Only the steps of his polished, brown <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Oxfords</strong></span> on the footpath as he walks to the rear of the car. He arranges his suit, straightens his tie and checks his silver cufflinks, then he reaches into the back seat for his top hat and positions it on his head. Lastly, he takes a firm hold of the handle of <span class="txt-underline"><strong>his dome-top lunch box</strong></span>. It is the most important piece of the magic to come.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now things may begin.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He strides down Main Street deeper into the evening, way past the hours when all manner of humanity sat back-slapping and too-loud-laughing on bar stools. Long past the hour when the kitchen hands stopped serving pizzas. There are only the stars spread above his head for company and he feels full of the wonder of the world.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With his eyes on those stars, Earlatidge notices for the umpteenth time how small humanity is rendered against the backdrop of sky and the silence of the evening settled about. And in that quiet, he searches for the precise destination.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He stares up at the town clock as he passes. It’s over five metres tall with an oversized ushaped head taken from the firebox of an old steam boiler. Welded to the sides are wheels, metal curls and swirls, cogs and bits of this and that. The face is complete with nineteenth-century clock hands, an almost comical Dr Seuss-type creation.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Earlatidge notes the time. 3.35 am. He takes his hat off and pauses with his head hung low to acknowledge the time, what it means to him, before striding into the pre-dawn.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Because he is not merely meandering, Earlatidge soon finds the empty lot. A piece of land that locals have walked past so often they’ve stopped seeing it. For them it would take some noticing to become aware of the rectangle-shaped land squeezed in between The Golden Goose Jewellery Shop and Bart’s Real Estate, but Earlatidge has long since learnt that it is the common, the seemingly insignificant places, where The Emporium makes its home.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Earlatidge stops on the footpath in front of the vacant block holding the lunch box close to his chest. Waits.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then he hears it. The soft bell of an antique phone. And he knows.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This is indeed the place.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This is where The Emporium of Imagination will stand.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Boonah’s townspeople will not see the shop being constructed or fitted out. No trucks will arrive with inventory. Indeed, what inventory could there be? And yet there is all the lumber that is needed.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Ah, Earlatidge can almost hear the townsfolk ask, ‘Surely there were builders?’ Over the years, he’s also developed an allergy to explaining The Emporium. It makes him shorttempered and itchy-footed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He used to say, ‘Is this The Emporium of Fruit? The Emporium of Fashion? Of toys or antiques or jewellery? No, no and no! This is something special.’ He used to remind people how imagination works. He’d say, ‘Remember when that toy dinosaur you got for Christmas wore Barbie’s bonnet and saved the world? Or when you watched out your bedroom window for the Care Bear that was going to slide down the rainbow right into your arms? Well, that’s still how imagination works and exactly how the shop is built.’</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Later, in this town, when night gives way to morning, Earlatidge knows that people will stand at the shop’s door and scratch their heads. But for now, a hushed invitation floats throughout the streets.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>Come, meet The Emporium.&nbsp;</em>

Do you think you got enough sleep this past week? <strong>15 ……….</strong> If the answer to either of these questions is “no,” you are not alone. <strong>16 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>I doubt you are surprised by this fact, but you may be surprised by the consequences. <strong>17 ……….</strong> substantially increasing your risk of certain diseases. Insufficient sleep appears to be a key lifestyle factor linked to your risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. Inadequate sleep—even moderate reductions for just one week—disrupts blood sugar levels so profoundly that you would be classified as pre-diabetic. <strong>18 ……….</strong>, setting you on a path toward cardiovascular disease, stroke, and congestive heart failure. Fitting Charlotte Brontë’s prophetic wisdom that “a ruffled mind makes a restless pillow,” sleep disruption further contributes to all major psychiatric conditions, including depression and anxiety.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Perhaps you have also noticed a desire to eat more when you’re tired? <strong>19 ……….</strong> Too little sleep swells concentrations of a hormone that makes you feel hungry while suppressing a companion hormone that otherwise signals food satisfaction. <strong>20 ……….</strong> It’s a proven recipe for weight gain in sleep-deficient adults and children alike. Worse, should you attempt to diet but don’t get enough sleep while doing so, it is futile, since most of the weight you lose will come from lean body mass, not fat.</p>

Do you think you got enough sleep this past week? <strong>15 ……….</strong> If the answer to either of these questions is “no,” you are not alone. <strong>16 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>I doubt you are surprised by this fact, but you may be surprised by the consequences. <strong>17 ……….</strong> substantially increasing your risk of certain diseases. Insufficient sleep appears to be a key lifestyle factor linked to your risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. Inadequate sleep—even moderate reductions for just one week—disrupts blood sugar levels so profoundly that you would be classified as pre-diabetic. <strong>18 ……….</strong>, setting you on a path toward cardiovascular disease, stroke, and congestive heart failure. Fitting Charlotte Brontë’s prophetic wisdom that “a ruffled mind makes a restless pillow,” sleep disruption further contributes to all major psychiatric conditions, including depression and anxiety.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Perhaps you have also noticed a desire to eat more when you’re tired? <strong>19 ……….</strong> Too little sleep swells concentrations of a hormone that makes you feel hungry while suppressing a companion hormone that otherwise signals food satisfaction. <strong>20 ……….</strong> It’s a proven recipe for weight gain in sleep-deficient adults and children alike. Worse, should you attempt to diet but don’t get enough sleep while doing so, it is futile, since most of the weight you lose will come from lean body mass, not fat.</p>

A tablet PC is a portable computing device with a touch-screen display, and is internet enabled. That means you really need internet access to get the most out of a tablet. Generally smaller than a notebook computer but larger than a smartphone, tablet PCs are designed to be thin and light, and have downloadable apps. Instead of using a keyboard, tablets are operated by touching the screen. Some tablets have a facility where you can attach a physical keyboard if that’s what you prefer. However, you will have to purchase a keyboard separately as they are not supplied with tablets. Tablets are known for their speed. They turn on really quickly and provide almost instant access to the internet and apps. Tablets are excellent for anyone who needs to work within a Microsoft-based office environment. If you need to run Windows programs, then tablets are an ideal compromise between a tablet and a laptop.<br>

Everyone’s heard of the Apple brand, and an iPad is the name for Apple’s line of handheld computers. Apple has its own Operating System called iOS and all iPads run on this system. Tablet, however, is a common name for a variety of devices which almost always&nbsp;function using a touch screen, though different manufacturers provide different specs. iPad is Apple’s version of a tablet. Most tablets use Google’s Android operating system, while the iPad runs on Apple’s iOS. An iPad cannot interact with multiple apps at the same time, whilst tablets are versatile – you can use one app whilst other apps are running in the background. Even though iPads have more features than Android tablets, it doesn’t mean they are the obvious choice as that depends on which features you really need. iPads have a large number of apps whilst the number of compatible apps is quite small for Android tablets.<br>

Most Android tablets make it pretty easy for you to add more storage if you need to. Many of these devices come with a microSD card slot so you can really add a lot of memory if need be. The iPad, on the other hand, doesn’t give you any way to expand its storage. What you get when you buy it is what you are stuck with, so bear that in mind when making your purchase. This means if you run out of space on your iPad then you are going to have to delete something in order to make space. It’s easy to buy iPads which have larger storage capacity, but it will cost you. And even those devices still won’t let you add more later should you need it. The iPad is still light years behind any Windows or Android tablet. Of course, you can move icons around, change your wallpaper, and even specify certain apps to use in certain situations, but that’s nothing when compared to Android and Windows. You can choose whatever type of app you want to use for any task with these devices and you can customise all types of fonts, screen images and much more. Basically, if it can be tweaked, then you can do it on Android and Windows. The same can’t be said for the iPad.<br>

            <p>A tablet PC is a portable computing device with a touch-screen display, and is internet enabled. That means you really need internet access to get the most out of a tablet. Generally smaller than a notebook computer but larger than a smartphone, tablet PCs are designed to be thin and light, and have downloadable apps. Instead of using a keyboard, tablets are operated by touching the screen. Some tablets have a facility where you can attach a physical keyboard if that’s what you prefer. However, you will have to purchase a keyboard separately as they are not supplied with tablets. Tablets are known for their speed. They turn on really quickly and provide almost instant access to the internet and apps. Tablets are excellent for anyone who needs to work within a Microsoft-based office environment. If you need to run Windows programs, then tablets are an ideal compromise between a tablet and a laptop.</p>

            <p>Everyone’s heard of the Apple brand, and an iPad is the name for Apple’s line of handheld computers. Apple has its own Operating System called iOS and all iPads run on this system. Tablet, however, is a common name for a variety of devices which almost always&nbsp;function using a touch screen, though different manufacturers provide different specs. iPad is Apple’s version of a tablet. Most tablets use Google’s Android operating system, while the iPad runs on Apple’s iOS. An iPad cannot interact with multiple apps at the same time, whilst tablets are versatile – you can use one app whilst other apps are running in the background. Even though iPads have more features than Android tablets, it doesn’t mean they are the obvious choice as that depends on which features you really need. iPads have a large number of apps whilst the number of compatible apps is quite small for Android tablets.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>A tablet PC is a portable computing device with a touch-screen display, and is internet enabled. That means you really need internet access to get the most out of a tablet. Generally smaller than a notebook computer but larger than a smartphone, tablet PCs are designed to be thin and light, and have downloadable apps. Instead of using a keyboard, tablets are operated by touching the screen. Some tablets have a facility where you can attach a physical keyboard if that’s what you prefer. However, you will have to purchase a keyboard separately as they are not supplied with tablets. Tablets are known for their speed. They turn on really quickly and provide almost instant access to the internet and apps. Tablets are excellent for anyone who needs to work within a Microsoft-based office environment. If you need to run Windows programs, then tablets are an ideal compromise between a tablet and a laptop.</p>

            <p>Everyone’s heard of the Apple brand, and an iPad is the name for Apple’s line of handheld computers. Apple has its own Operating System called iOS and all iPads run on this system. Tablet, however, is a common name for a variety of devices which almost always&nbsp;function using a touch screen, though different manufacturers provide different specs. iPad is Apple’s version of a tablet. Most tablets use Google’s Android operating system, while the iPad runs on Apple’s iOS. An iPad cannot interact with multiple apps at the same time, whilst tablets are versatile – you can use one app whilst other apps are running in the background. Even though iPads have more features than Android tablets, it doesn’t mean they are the obvious choice as that depends on which features you really need. iPads have a large number of apps whilst the number of compatible apps is quite small for Android tablets.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>iPads are generally easier to use and run smoother than tablets, although much of the time the difference is barely noticeable. In terms of overall user experience, Apple’s iOS is clearly ahead of Google’s Android OS system for the average user. Apple’s operating system is extremely easy to use, powerful and has an intuitive interface. iPad enables close integration between devices. You can cut and paste between your iPad and Macbook if both are running the latest Operating System. Android tablets are way behind in this area. As a company, Apple only officially supports and allows apps to be installed through its own store. It checks and approves every app before it is released for sale through the Apple store. This eliminates the chance of malware and bugs getting into their devices, so it provides an extra layer of security.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Most Android tablets make it pretty easy for you to add more storage if you need to. Many of these devices come with a microSD card slot so you can really add a lot of memory if need be. The iPad, on the other hand, doesn’t give you any way to expand its storage. What you get when you buy it is what you are stuck with, so bear that in mind when making your purchase. This means if you run out of space on your iPad then you are going to have to delete something in order to make space. It’s easy to buy iPads which have larger storage capacity, but it will cost you. And even those devices still won’t let you add more later should you need it. The iPad is still light years behind any Windows or Android tablet. Of course, you can move icons around, change your wallpaper, and even specify certain apps to use in certain situations, but that’s nothing when compared to Android and Windows. You can choose whatever type of app you want to use for any task with these devices and you can customise all types of fonts, screen images and much more. Basically, if it can be tweaked, then you can do it on Android and Windows. The same can’t be said for the iPad.</p>

            <p>Everyone’s heard of the Apple brand, and an iPad is the name for Apple’s line of handheld computers. Apple has its own Operating System called iOS and all iPads run on this system. Tablet, however, is a common name for a variety of devices which almost always&nbsp;function using a touch screen, though different manufacturers provide different specs. iPad is Apple’s version of a tablet. Most tablets use Google’s Android operating system, while the iPad runs on Apple’s iOS. An iPad cannot interact with multiple apps at the same time, whilst tablets are versatile – you can use one app whilst other apps are running in the background. Even though iPads have more features than Android tablets, it doesn’t mean they are the obvious choice as that depends on which features you really need. iPads have a large number of apps whilst the number of compatible apps is quite small for Android tablets.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>iPads are generally easier to use and run smoother than tablets, although much of the time the difference is barely noticeable.

You can cut and paste between your iPad and Macbook if both are running the latest Operating System. Android tablets are way behind in this area.

            <p>Most Android tablets make it pretty easy for you to add more storage if you need to. Many of these devices come with a microSD card slot so you can really add a lot of memory if need be. The iPad, on the other hand, doesn’t give you any way to expand its storage. What you get when you buy it is what you are stuck with, so bear that in mind when making your purchase. This means if you run out of space on your iPad then you are going to have to delete something in order to make space. It’s easy to buy iPads which have larger storage capacity, but it will cost you. And even those devices still won’t let you add more later should you need it. The iPad is still light years behind any Windows or Android tablet. Of course, you can move icons around, change your wallpaper, and even specify certain apps to use in certain situations, but that’s nothing when compared to Android and Windows. You can choose whatever type of app you want to use for any task with these devices and you can customise all types of fonts, screen images and much more. Basically, if it can be tweaked, then you can do it on Android and Windows. The same can’t be said for the iPad.</p>

            <p>A tablet PC is a portable computing device with a touch-screen display, and is internet enabled. That means you really need internet access to get the most out of a tablet. Generally smaller than a notebook computer but larger than a smartphone, tablet PCs are designed to be thin and light, and have downloadable apps. Instead of using a keyboard, tablets are operated by touching the screen. Some tablets have a facility where you can attach a physical keyboard if that’s what you prefer. However, you will have to purchase a keyboard separately as they are not supplied with tablets. Tablets are known for their speed. They turn on really quickly and provide almost instant access to the internet and apps. Tablets are excellent for anyone who needs to work within a Microsoft-based office environment. If you need to run Windows programs, then tablets are an ideal compromise between a tablet and a laptop.</p>

            <p>Most Android tablets make it pretty easy for you to add more storage if you need to. Many of these devices come with a microSD card slot so you can really add a lot of memory if need be. The iPad, on the other hand, doesn’t give you any way to expand its storage. What you get when you buy it is what you are stuck with, so bear that in mind when making your purchase. This means if you run out of space on your iPad then you are going to have to delete something in order to make space. It’s easy to buy iPads which have larger storage capacity, but it will cost you. And even those devices still won’t let you add more later should you need it. The iPad is still light years behind any Windows or Android tablet. Of course, you can move icons around, change your wallpaper, and even specify certain apps to use in certain situations, but that’s nothing when compared to Android and Windows. You can choose whatever type of app you want to use for any task with these devices and you can customise all types of fonts, screen images and much more. Basically, if it can be tweaked, then you can do it on Android and Windows. The same can’t be said for the iPad.</p>

            <p>A tablet PC is a portable computing device with a touch-screen display, and is internet enabled. That means you really need internet access to get the most out of a tablet. Generally smaller than a notebook computer but larger than a smartphone, tablet PCs are designed to be thin and light, and have downloadable apps. Instead of using a keyboard, tablets are operated by touching the screen. Some tablets have a facility where you can attach a physical keyboard if that’s what you prefer. However, you will have to purchase a keyboard separately as they are not supplied with tablets. Tablets are known for their speed. They turn on really quickly and provide almost instant access to the internet and apps. Tablets are excellent for anyone who needs to work within a Microsoft-based office environment. If you need to run Windows programs, then tablets are an ideal compromise between a tablet and a laptop.</p>

            <p>Everyone’s heard of the Apple brand, and an iPad is the name for Apple’s line of handheld computers. Apple has its own Operating System called iOS and all iPads run on this system. Tablet, however, is a common name for a variety of devices which almost always&nbsp;function using a touch screen, though different manufacturers provide different specs. iPad is Apple’s version of a tablet. Most tablets use Google’s Android operating system, while the iPad runs on Apple’s iOS. An iPad cannot interact with multiple apps at the same time, whilst tablets are versatile – you can use one app whilst other apps are running in the background. Even though iPads have more features than Android tablets, it doesn’t mean they are the obvious choice as that depends on which features you really need. iPads have a large number of apps whilst the number of compatible apps is quite small for Android tablets.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>iPads are generally easier to use and run smoother than tablets, although much of the time the difference is barely noticeable. In terms of overall user experience, Apple’s iOS is clearly ahead of Google’s Android OS system for the average user. Apple’s operating system is extremely easy to use, powerful and has an intuitive interface. iPad enables close integration between devices. You can cut and paste between your iPad and Macbook if both are running the latest Operating System. Android tablets are way behind in this area. As a company, Apple only officially supports and allows apps to be installed through its own store. It checks and approves every app before it is released for sale through the Apple store.

I was about to ask again, but I got distracted by the steel rods rooted into my bones and extending out, attached to a frame outside my leg. Ever since I woke up from surgery, I couldn’t stop staring at it. After ten years at the Kira Dobrow Ballet School, I’d seen my share of bodily horrors: weeping toe blisters, a ruptured Achilles tendon, but nothing like this. It was called an external fixator and it wasn’t messing around.</p>
        <p>Colleen was staring at it too – her fingers tapping out the melody of the Kitri variation from <em>Don Quixote</em> on the metal post of my hospital bed. I caught her eye and we had one of our silent conversations.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>

              <strong>It’s not that bad right?</strong>

          <span class="txt-underline">
            <em>
              <strong>Totally not that bad.&nbsp;</strong>
            </em>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>I let out a breath and glanced behind Colleen to my parents. Dad’s eyes were steadily on the floor so he wouldn’t accidentally look at the external fixator and need to sit with his head between his legs again. Mum gave me a smile I knew she meant to be reassuring but was 100% not.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“When can I dance?” I repeated loudly. The doctor startled, put down the charts and sat on the stool next to my bed.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Let’s take it <span class="txt-underline"><strong>one step at a time</strong></span>,” he said, looking at my leg and chuckling. “Pun not intended.” When no one reacted, he cleared his throat. “You’ll be bed to chair for a couple of weeks until we get you out of that external fixator and into a cast. A few months after that, you can start learning to walk again.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If he wasn’t going to answer my question, I’d figure it out myself. I did some mental calculations. The American Ballet Theatre summer intensive in New York was in July. Four months from now. If I was walking in a couple of months, I could dance in four. “That means I can still do the ballet intensive in July,” I said. “I can still go.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My parents shifted and the doctor sighed. “Alina,” he said carefully. “If it was a clean break, your bones could have healed naturally. You might have been able to dance on pointe in four months. But it wasn’t a clean break.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He stopped talking, like that explained everything. When I kept staring at him, he sighed again. “We needed to put in sixteen screws and two plates to keep your bones together. That hardware is meant to stay in there forever, it means your leg won’t be as strong or flexible as…”</p>
        <p>“So when? If I let it heal and do physical therapy and everything I’m supposed to do, when will it be back to normal?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Never,” the doctor said simply. “When something breaks like that, you can’t put it back together so easily. And when you do, it won’t be the same.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I felt like the doctor wasn’t being fully honest with me, but there was no point saying it, “I’ll be able to dance in four months,” I said coolly. “I’m going to New York.” I looked at my parents, so they’d know the plan hadn’t changed. Dad looked queasy and uncertain. Mum looked like she was holding back tears. <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Only Colleen was unfazed</strong></span>.</p>
