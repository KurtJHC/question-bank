        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which braces my nerves and fills me with delight. Do you understand this feeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes. Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more <strong>fervent </strong>and vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour. There—for with your leave, my sister, I will put some trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe. Its productions and features may be without example, as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? I may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. I shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his native river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries, to reach which at present so many months are requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at all possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my letter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as a steady purpose—a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye. This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. I have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have been made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean through the seas which surround the pole. You may remember that a history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole of our good Uncle Thomas’ library. My education was neglected, yet I was passionately fond of reading. These volumes were my study day and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which I had felt, as a child, on learning that my father’s dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven. I also became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation; I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated. You are well acquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment. But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.</p>

You are well acquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment. But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which braces my nerves and fills me with delight. Do you understand this feeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes. Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more <strong>fervent </strong>and vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour. There—for with your leave, my sister, I will put some trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe. Its productions and features may be without example, as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? I may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. I shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his native river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries, to reach which at present so many months are requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at all possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.</p>

These volumes were my study day and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which I had felt, as a child, on learning that my father’s dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven. I also became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation; I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated. You are well acquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment. But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Did the&nbsp;Vikings&nbsp;discover America? It’s a question that requires some unpacking.&nbsp;To begin with, there’s the problem of the Eurocentric perspective of the word&nbsp;<em>discover</em>, which looks at the encounter with the New World from the vantage point of guys on ships and ignores the fact that indigenous people had long been calling it home. In that sense, America was probably discovered by hunters from&nbsp;Asia, who historians believe made their way to&nbsp;Alaska&nbsp;either on foot from&nbsp;Siberia&nbsp;via a land bridge across the&nbsp;Bering Strait&nbsp;during the last ice age or came by boat and continued southward along the coastline. In either case, these people arrived 13,000–35,000 years ago—so long ago that their descendants are considered the continent’s indigenous peoples,&nbsp;Native Americans.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Rephrasing the question, we can ask instead whether the Vikings were the first non-Native Americans to encounter&nbsp;America. The answer to that question, however, hinges on what we mean by America. If we are referring to America broadly—meaning&nbsp;North&nbsp;and&nbsp;South America—there is a possibility that&nbsp;Polynesians&nbsp;got there first. Genetic analysis of the&nbsp;sweet potato, which is native to America, has led scientists to conclude that Polynesian explorers had an early encounter with South America and took the sweet potato with them to&nbsp;Southeast Asia&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Pacific Islands. Scholars are convinced that this exchange took place before the time of&nbsp;Christopher Columbus, but they do not know whether it preceded the visits to North America by the Vikings.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Asking whether the Vikings were the first Europeans to encounter America sets the stage for the Vikings-versus-Columbus debate, but first the legendary voyage of&nbsp;St. Brendan&nbsp;has to be reckoned with. According to the epic “Voyage of St. Brendan the Abbot” (recorded in Latin prose sometime between the mid-8th and early 10th century as&nbsp;<em>Navigatio Sancti Brendani Abbatis</em>), in the 6th century Brendan, a peripatetic Irish monk, and some of his brethren <strong>sojourned </strong>west across the Atlantic Ocean&nbsp;in a bowl-shaped boat known as a curragh (coracle). It has been argued that Brendan reached North America, and a modern experiment proved that it is possible to make a transatlantic crossing in a curragh, but there is no archaeological evidence of an early Irish visit to North America.</p>
        <p>So it still comes down to Columbus and the Vikings. History tells us that in 1492, while leading a Spanish-sponsored three-ship flotilla in search of a shorter route to Asia, Italian navigator Christopher Columbus happened upon America in the form of Guanahani (probably&nbsp;San Salvador Island, though maybe another&nbsp;Bahamian island&nbsp;or the&nbsp;Turks and Caicos Islands). Another Italian navigator,&nbsp;John Cabot, sailing for England, made his way to&nbsp;Canada about this time, but not until 1497, after Columbus. As a result, Columbus was nearly universally declared the “discoverer” of America.</p>
        <p>Standing in opposition to that claim, however, were the accounts of Viking journeys to a place called&nbsp;Vinland&nbsp;that appeared in a pair of medieval Norse&nbsp;sagas&nbsp;(heroic prose poems). According to the&nbsp;<em>Grænlendinga saga</em>&nbsp;(“Saga of the Greenlanders”), Bjarni Herjólfsson became the first European to sight mainland North America when his&nbsp;Greenland-bound ship was blown westward off course about 985. Further, about 1000,&nbsp;Leif Eriksson, son of&nbsp;Erik the Red, is reported to have led an expedition in search of the land sighted by Bjarni and to have found an icy barren land he called &nbsp;Helluland (“Land of Flat Rocks”) before eventually traveling south and finding Vinland (“Land of Wine”). Later, following a pair of expeditions undertaken by Leif’s brothers,&nbsp;Thorfinn Karlsefni, an Icelandic trader, led another expedition to Vinland, where it stayed for three years. In&nbsp;<em>Eiríks saga rauða</em>&nbsp;(“Erik the Red’s Saga”), Leif is the accidental discoverer of Vinland, and Thorfinn and his wife, Gudrid, are credited with all subsequent explorations.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>These narratives of exploration of a place that sounded like&nbsp;Maine,&nbsp;Rhode Island, or Atlantic Canada were thought to be just stories, like “Voyage of St. Brendan the Abbot,” until 1960, when Helge Ingstad, a Danish explorer, and his wife, archaeologist Anne Stine Ingstad, were led by a local man to a site on the northern tip of&nbsp;Newfoundland island. There, at&nbsp;L’Anse aux Meadows, they discovered the remains of a Viking encampment that they were able to date to the year 1000. These dramatic archaeological discoveries proved not only that the Vikings had indeed explored America some 500 years before Columbus’s arrival but also that they had travelled farther south to areas where grapes grew, to Vinland. The Vikings had indeed visited North America, and if they did not “discover” America in the strict sense of the word, they certainly got there before Columbus did.</p>

History tells us that in 1492, while leading a Spanish-sponsored three-ship flotilla in search of a shorter route to Asia, Italian navigator Christopher Columbus happened upon America in the form of Guanahani (probably&nbsp;San Salvador Island, though maybe another&nbsp;Bahamian island&nbsp;or the&nbsp;Turks and Caicos Islands). Another Italian navigator,&nbsp;John Cabot, sailing for England, made his way to&nbsp;Canada about this time, but not until 1497, after Columbus. As a result, Columbus was nearly universally declared the “discoverer” of America.</p>
        <p>Standing in opposition to that claim, however, were the accounts of Viking journeys to a place called&nbsp;Vinland&nbsp;that appeared in a pair of medieval Norse&nbsp;sagas&nbsp;(heroic prose poems). According to the&nbsp;<em>Grænlendinga saga</em>&nbsp;(“Saga of the Greenlanders”), Bjarni Herjólfsson became the first European to sight mainland North America when his&nbsp;Greenland-bound ship was blown westward off course about 985. Further, about 1000,&nbsp;Leif Eriksson, son of&nbsp;Erik the Red, is reported to have led an expedition in search of the land sighted by Bjarni and to have found an icy barren land he called &nbsp;Helluland (“Land of Flat Rocks”) before eventually traveling south and finding Vinland (“Land of Wine”). Later, following a pair of expeditions undertaken by Leif’s brothers,&nbsp;Thorfinn Karlsefni, an Icelandic trader, led another expedition to Vinland, where it stayed for three years. In&nbsp;<em>Eiríks saga rauða</em>&nbsp;(“Erik the Red’s Saga”), Leif is the accidental discoverer of Vinland, and Thorfinn and his wife, Gudrid, are credited with all subsequent explorations.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>These narratives of exploration of a place that sounded like&nbsp;Maine,&nbsp;Rhode Island, or Atlantic Canada were thought to be just stories, like “Voyage of St. Brendan the Abbot,” until 1960, when Helge Ingstad, a Danish explorer, and his wife, archaeologist Anne Stine Ingstad, were led by a local man to a site on the northern tip of&nbsp;Newfoundland island. There, at&nbsp;L’Anse aux Meadows, they discovered the remains of a Viking encampment that they were able to date to the year 1000. These dramatic archaeological discoveries proved not only that the Vikings had indeed explored America some 500 years before Columbus’s arrival but also that they had travelled farther south to areas where grapes grew, to Vinland. The Vikings had indeed visited North America, and if they did not “discover” America in the strict sense of the word, they certainly got there before Columbus did.</p>

          <strong>Read the following passage and answer question 25 -31.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Did the&nbsp;Vikings&nbsp;discover America? It’s a question that requires some unpacking.&nbsp;To begin with, there’s the problem of the Eurocentric perspective of the word&nbsp;<em>discover</em>, which looks at the encounter with the New World from the vantage point of guys on ships and ignores the fact that indigenous people had long been calling it home. In that sense, America was probably discovered by hunters from&nbsp;Asia, who historians believe made their way to&nbsp;Alaska&nbsp;either on foot from&nbsp;Siberia&nbsp;via a land bridge across the&nbsp;Bering Strait&nbsp;during the last ice age or came by boat and continued southward along the coastline. In either case, these people arrived 13,000–35,000 years ago—so long ago that their descendants are considered the continent’s indigenous peoples,&nbsp;Native Americans.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Rephrasing the question, we can ask instead whether the Vikings were the first non-Native Americans to encounter&nbsp;America. The answer to that question, however, hinges on what we mean by America. If we are referring to America broadly—meaning&nbsp;North&nbsp;and&nbsp;South America—there is a possibility that&nbsp;Polynesians&nbsp;got there first. Genetic analysis of the&nbsp;sweet potato, which is native to America, has led scientists to conclude that Polynesian explorers had an early encounter with South America and took the sweet potato with them to&nbsp;Southeast Asia&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Pacific Islands. Scholars are convinced that this exchange took place before the time of&nbsp;Christopher Columbus, but they do not know whether it preceded the visits to North America by the Vikings.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Asking whether the Vikings were the first Europeans to encounter America sets the stage for the Vikings-versus-Columbus debate, but first the legendary voyage of&nbsp;St. Brendan&nbsp;has to be reckoned with. According to the epic “Voyage of St. Brendan the Abbot” (recorded in Latin prose sometime between the mid-8th and early 10th century as&nbsp;<em>Navigatio Sancti Brendani Abbatis</em>), in the 6th century Brendan, a peripatetic Irish monk, and some of his brethren <strong>sojourned </strong>west across the Atlantic Ocean&nbsp;in a bowl-shaped boat known as a curragh (coracle). It has been argued that Brendan reached North America, and a modern experiment proved that it is possible to make a transatlantic crossing in a curragh, but there is no archaeological evidence of an early Irish visit to North America.</p>
        <p>So it still comes down to Columbus and the Vikings. History tells us that in 1492, while leading a Spanish-sponsored three-ship flotilla in search of a shorter route to Asia, Italian navigator Christopher Columbus happened upon America in the form of Guanahani (probably&nbsp;San Salvador Island, though maybe another&nbsp;Bahamian island&nbsp;or the&nbsp;Turks and Caicos Islands). Another Italian navigator,&nbsp;John Cabot, sailing for England, made his way to&nbsp;Canada about this time, but not until 1497, after Columbus. As a result, Columbus was nearly universally declared the “discoverer” of America.</p>
        <p>Standing in opposition to that claim, however, were the accounts of Viking journeys to a place called&nbsp;Vinland&nbsp;that appeared in a pair of medieval Norse&nbsp;sagas&nbsp;(heroic prose poems). According to the&nbsp;<em>Grænlendinga saga</em>&nbsp;(“Saga of the Greenlanders”), Bjarni Herjólfsson became the first European to sight mainland North America when his&nbsp;Greenland-bound ship was blown westward off course about 985. Further, about 1000,&nbsp;Leif Eriksson, son of&nbsp;Erik the Red, is reported to have led an expedition in search of the land sighted by Bjarni and to have found an icy barren land he called &nbsp;Helluland (“Land of Flat Rocks”) before eventually traveling south and finding Vinland (“Land of Wine”). Later, following a pair of expeditions undertaken by Leif’s brothers,&nbsp;Thorfinn Karlsefni, an Icelandic trader, led another expedition to Vinland, where it stayed for three years. In&nbsp;<em>Eiríks saga rauða</em>&nbsp;(“Erik the Red’s Saga”), Leif is the accidental discoverer of Vinland, and Thorfinn and his wife, Gudrid, are credited with all subsequent explorations.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>These narratives of exploration of a place that sounded like&nbsp;Maine,&nbsp;Rhode Island, or Atlantic Canada were thought to be just stories, like “Voyage of St. Brendan the Abbot,” until 1960, when Helge Ingstad, a Danish explorer, and his wife, archaeologist Anne Stine Ingstad, were led by a local man to a site on the northern tip of&nbsp;Newfoundland island. There, at&nbsp;L’Anse aux Meadows, they discovered the remains of a Viking encampment that they were able to date to the year 1000. These dramatic archaeological discoveries proved not only that the Vikings had indeed explored America some 500 years before Columbus’s arrival but also that they had travelled farther south to areas where grapes grew, to Vinland. The Vikings had indeed visited North America, and if they did not “discover” America in the strict sense of the word, they certainly got there before Columbus did.</p>

In either case, these people arrived 13,000–35,000 years ago—so long ago that their descendants are considered the continent’s indigenous peoples,&nbsp;Native Americans.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Rephrasing the question, we can ask instead whether the Vikings were the first non-Native Americans to encounter&nbsp;America. The answer to that question, however, hinges on what we mean by America. If we are referring to America broadly—meaning&nbsp;North&nbsp;and&nbsp;South America—there is a possibility that&nbsp;Polynesians&nbsp;got there first. Genetic analysis of the&nbsp;sweet potato, which is native to America, has led scientists to conclude that Polynesian explorers had an early encounter with South America and took the sweet potato with them to&nbsp;Southeast Asia&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Pacific Islands. Scholars are convinced that this exchange took place before the time of&nbsp;Christopher Columbus, but they do not know whether it preceded the visits to North America by the Vikings.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Asking whether the Vikings were the first Europeans to encounter America sets the stage for the Vikings-versus-Columbus debate, but first the legendary voyage of&nbsp;St. Brendan&nbsp;has to be reckoned with. According to the epic “Voyage of St. Brendan the Abbot” (recorded in Latin prose sometime between the mid-8th and early 10th century as&nbsp;<em>Navigatio Sancti Brendani Abbatis</em>), in the 6th century Brendan, a peripatetic Irish monk, and some of his brethren <strong>sojourned </strong>west across the Atlantic Ocean&nbsp;in a bowl-shaped boat known as a curragh (coracle). It has been argued that Brendan reached North America, and a modern experiment proved that it is possible to make a transatlantic crossing in a curragh, but there is no archaeological evidence of an early Irish visit to North America.</p>
        <p>So it still comes down to Columbus and the Vikings. History tells us that in 1492, while leading a Spanish-sponsored three-ship flotilla in search of a shorter route to Asia, Italian navigator Christopher Columbus happened upon America in the form of Guanahani (probably&nbsp;San Salvador Island, though maybe another&nbsp;Bahamian island&nbsp;or the&nbsp;Turks and Caicos Islands). Another Italian navigator,&nbsp;John Cabot, sailing for England, made his way to&nbsp;Canada about this time, but not until 1497, after Columbus. As a result, Columbus was nearly universally declared the “discoverer” of America.</p>
        <p>Standing in opposition to that claim, however, were the accounts of Viking journeys to a place called&nbsp;Vinland&nbsp;that appeared in a pair of medieval Norse&nbsp;sagas&nbsp;(heroic prose poems). According to the&nbsp;<em>Grænlendinga saga</em>&nbsp;(“Saga of the Greenlanders”), Bjarni Herjólfsson became the first European to sight mainland North America when his&nbsp;Greenland-bound ship was blown westward off course about 985. Further, about 1000,&nbsp;Leif Eriksson, son of&nbsp;Erik the Red, is reported to have led an expedition in search of the land sighted by Bjarni and to have found an icy barren land he called &nbsp;Helluland (“Land of Flat Rocks”) before eventually traveling south and finding Vinland (“Land of Wine”). Later, following a pair of expeditions undertaken by Leif’s brothers,&nbsp;Thorfinn Karlsefni, an Icelandic trader, led another expedition to Vinland, where it stayed for three years. In&nbsp;<em>Eiríks saga rauða</em>&nbsp;(“Erik the Red’s Saga”), Leif is the accidental discoverer of Vinland, and Thorfinn and his wife, Gudrid, are credited with all subsequent explorations.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>These narratives of exploration of a place that sounded like&nbsp;Maine,&nbsp;Rhode Island, or Atlantic Canada were thought to be just stories, like “Voyage of St. Brendan the Abbot,” until 1960, when Helge Ingstad, a Danish explorer, and his wife, archaeologist Anne Stine Ingstad, were led by a local man to a site on the northern tip of&nbsp;Newfoundland island. There, at&nbsp;L’Anse aux Meadows, they discovered the remains of a Viking encampment that they were able to date to the year 1000. These dramatic archaeological discoveries proved not only that the Vikings had indeed explored America some 500 years before Columbus’s arrival but also that they had travelled farther south to areas where grapes grew, to Vinland. The Vikings had indeed visited North America, and if they did not “discover” America in the strict sense of the word, they certainly got there before Columbus did.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Did the&nbsp;Vikings&nbsp;discover America? It’s a question that requires some unpacking.&nbsp;To begin with, there’s the problem of the Eurocentric perspective of the word&nbsp;<em>discover</em>, which looks at the encounter with the New World from the vantage point of guys on ships and ignores the fact that indigenous people had long been calling it home. In that sense, America was probably discovered by hunters from&nbsp;Asia, who historians believe made their way to&nbsp;Alaska&nbsp;either on foot from&nbsp;Siberia&nbsp;via a land bridge across the&nbsp;Bering Strait&nbsp;during the last ice age or came by boat and continued southward along the coastline. In either case, these people arrived 13,000–35,000 years ago—so long ago that their descendants are considered the continent’s indigenous peoples,&nbsp;Native Americans.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Rephrasing the question, we can ask instead whether the Vikings were the first non-Native Americans to encounter&nbsp;America. The answer to that question, however, hinges on what we mean by America. If we are referring to America broadly—meaning&nbsp;North&nbsp;and&nbsp;South America—there is a possibility that&nbsp;Polynesians&nbsp;got there first. Genetic analysis of the&nbsp;sweet potato, which is native to America, has led scientists to conclude that Polynesian explorers had an early encounter with South America and took the sweet potato with them to&nbsp;Southeast Asia&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Pacific Islands. Scholars are convinced that this exchange took place before the time of&nbsp;Christopher Columbus, but they do not know whether it preceded the visits to North America by the Vikings.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Asking whether the Vikings were the first Europeans to encounter America sets the stage for the Vikings-versus-Columbus debate, but first the legendary voyage of&nbsp;St. Brendan&nbsp;has to be reckoned with. According to the epic “Voyage of St. Brendan the Abbot” (recorded in Latin prose sometime between the mid-8th and early 10th century as&nbsp;<em>Navigatio Sancti Brendani Abbatis</em>), in the 6th century Brendan, a peripatetic Irish monk, and some of his brethren <strong>sojourned </strong>west across the Atlantic Ocean&nbsp;in a bowl-shaped boat known as a curragh (coracle). It has been argued that Brendan reached North America, and a modern experiment proved that it is possible to make a transatlantic crossing in a curragh, but there is no archaeological evidence of an early Irish visit to North America.</p>
        <p>So it still comes down to Columbus and the Vikings. History tells us that in 1492, while leading a Spanish-sponsored three-ship flotilla in search of a shorter route to Asia, Italian navigator Christopher Columbus happened upon America in the form of Guanahani (probably&nbsp;San Salvador Island, though maybe another&nbsp;Bahamian island&nbsp;or the&nbsp;Turks and Caicos Islands). Another Italian navigator,&nbsp;John Cabot, sailing for England, made his way to&nbsp;Canada about this time, but not until 1497, after Columbus. As a result, Columbus was nearly universally declared the “discoverer” of America.</p>
        <p>Standing in opposition to that claim, however, were the accounts of Viking journeys to a place called&nbsp;Vinland&nbsp;that appeared in a pair of medieval Norse&nbsp;sagas&nbsp;(heroic prose poems). According to the&nbsp;<em>Grænlendinga saga</em>&nbsp;(“Saga of the Greenlanders”), Bjarni Herjólfsson became the first European to sight mainland North America when his&nbsp;Greenland-bound ship was blown westward off course about 985. Further, about 1000,&nbsp;Leif Eriksson, son of&nbsp;Erik the Red, is reported to have led an expedition in search of the land sighted by Bjarni and to have found an icy barren land he called &nbsp;Helluland (“Land of Flat Rocks”) before eventually traveling south and finding Vinland (“Land of Wine”). Later, following a pair of expeditions undertaken by Leif’s brothers,&nbsp;Thorfinn Karlsefni, an Icelandic trader, led another expedition to Vinland, where it stayed for three years. In&nbsp;<em>Eiríks saga rauða</em>&nbsp;(“Erik the Red’s Saga”), Leif is the accidental discoverer of Vinland, and Thorfinn and his wife, Gudrid, are credited with all subsequent explorations.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>These narratives of exploration of a place that sounded like&nbsp;Maine,&nbsp;Rhode Island, or Atlantic Canada were thought to be just stories, like “Voyage of St. Brendan the Abbot,” until 1960, when Helge Ingstad, a Danish explorer, and his wife, archaeologist Anne Stine Ingstad, were led by a local man to a site on the northern tip of&nbsp;Newfoundland island.

          <strong>Read the following passage and answer question 25 -31.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Did the&nbsp;Vikings&nbsp;discover America? It’s a question that requires some unpacking.&nbsp;To begin with, there’s the problem of the Eurocentric perspective of the word&nbsp;<em>discover</em>, which looks at the encounter with the New World from the vantage point of guys on ships and ignores the fact that indigenous people had long been calling it home. In that sense, America was probably discovered by hunters from&nbsp;Asia, who historians believe made their way to&nbsp;Alaska&nbsp;either on foot from&nbsp;Siberia&nbsp;via a land bridge across the&nbsp;Bering Strait&nbsp;during the last ice age or came by boat and continued southward along the coastline. In either case, these people arrived 13,000–35,000 years ago—so long ago that their descendants are considered the continent’s indigenous peoples,&nbsp;Native Americans.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Rephrasing the question, we can ask instead whether the Vikings were the first non-Native Americans to encounter&nbsp;America. The answer to that question, however, hinges on what we mean by America. If we are referring to America broadly—meaning&nbsp;North&nbsp;and&nbsp;South America—there is a possibility that&nbsp;Polynesians&nbsp;got there first. Genetic analysis of the&nbsp;sweet potato, which is native to America, has led scientists to conclude that Polynesian explorers had an early encounter with South America and took the sweet potato with them to&nbsp;Southeast Asia&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Pacific Islands. Scholars are convinced that this exchange took place before the time of&nbsp;Christopher Columbus, but they do not know whether it preceded the visits to North America by the Vikings.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Asking whether the Vikings were the first Europeans to encounter America sets the stage for the Vikings-versus-Columbus debate, but first the legendary voyage of&nbsp;St. Brendan&nbsp;has to be reckoned with. According to the epic “Voyage of St. Brendan the Abbot” (recorded in Latin prose sometime between the mid-8th and early 10th century as&nbsp;<em>Navigatio Sancti Brendani Abbatis</em>), in the 6th century Brendan, a peripatetic Irish monk, and some of his brethren <strong>sojourned </strong>west across the Atlantic Ocean&nbsp;in a bowl-shaped boat known as a curragh (coracle). It has been argued that Brendan reached North America, and a modern experiment proved that it is possible to make a transatlantic crossing in a curragh, but there is no archaeological evidence of an early Irish visit to North America.</p>
        <p>So it still comes down to Columbus and the Vikings. History tells us that in 1492, while leading a Spanish-sponsored three-ship flotilla in search of a shorter route to Asia, Italian navigator Christopher Columbus happened upon America in the form of Guanahani (probably&nbsp;San Salvador Island, though maybe another&nbsp;Bahamian island&nbsp;or the&nbsp;Turks and Caicos Islands). Another Italian navigator,&nbsp;John Cabot, sailing for England, made his way to&nbsp;Canada about this time, but not until 1497, after Columbus. As a result, Columbus was nearly universally declared the “discoverer” of America.</p>
        <p>Standing in opposition to that claim, however, were the accounts of Viking journeys to a place called&nbsp;Vinland&nbsp;that appeared in a pair of medieval Norse&nbsp;sagas&nbsp;(heroic prose poems). According to the&nbsp;<em>Grænlendinga saga</em>&nbsp;(“Saga of the Greenlanders”), Bjarni Herjólfsson became the first European to sight mainland North America when his&nbsp;Greenland-bound ship was blown westward off course about 985. Further, about 1000,&nbsp;Leif Eriksson, son of&nbsp;Erik the Red, is reported to have led an expedition in search of the land sighted by Bjarni and to have found an icy barren land he called &nbsp;Helluland (“Land of Flat Rocks”) before eventually traveling south and finding Vinland (“Land of Wine”). Later, following a pair of expeditions undertaken by Leif’s brothers,&nbsp;Thorfinn Karlsefni, an Icelandic trader, led another expedition to Vinland, where it stayed for three years. In&nbsp;<em>Eiríks saga rauða</em>&nbsp;(“Erik the Red’s Saga”), Leif is the accidental discoverer of Vinland, and Thorfinn and his wife, Gudrid, are credited with all subsequent explorations.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>These narratives of exploration of a place that sounded like&nbsp;Maine,&nbsp;Rhode Island, or Atlantic Canada were thought to be just stories, like “Voyage of St. Brendan the Abbot,” until 1960, when Helge Ingstad, a Danish explorer, and his wife, archaeologist Anne Stine Ingstad, were led by a local man to a site on the northern tip of&nbsp;Newfoundland island. There, at&nbsp;L’Anse aux Meadows, they discovered the remains of a Viking encampment that they were able to date to the year 1000. These dramatic archaeological discoveries proved not only that the Vikings had indeed explored America some 500 years before Columbus’s arrival but also that they had travelled farther south to areas where grapes grew, to Vinland. The Vikings had indeed visited North America, and if they did not “discover” America in the strict sense of the word, they certainly got there before Columbus did.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Did the&nbsp;Vikings&nbsp;discover America? It’s a question that requires some unpacking.&nbsp;To begin with, there’s the problem of the Eurocentric perspective of the word&nbsp;<em>discover</em>, which looks at the encounter with the New World from the vantage point of guys on ships and ignores the fact that indigenous people had long been calling it home. In that sense, America was probably discovered by hunters from&nbsp;Asia, who historians believe made their way to&nbsp;Alaska&nbsp;either on foot from&nbsp;Siberia&nbsp;via a land bridge across the&nbsp;Bering Strait&nbsp;during the last ice age or came by boat and continued southward along the coastline. In either case, these people arrived 13,000–35,000 years ago—so long ago that their descendants are considered the continent’s indigenous peoples,&nbsp;Native Americans.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Rephrasing the question, we can ask instead whether the Vikings were the first non-Native Americans to encounter&nbsp;America. The answer to that question, however, hinges on what we mean by America. If we are referring to America broadly—meaning&nbsp;North&nbsp;and&nbsp;South America—there is a possibility that&nbsp;Polynesians&nbsp;got there first. Genetic analysis of the&nbsp;sweet potato, which is native to America, has led scientists to conclude that Polynesian explorers had an early encounter with South America and took the sweet potato with them to&nbsp;Southeast Asia&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Pacific Islands. Scholars are convinced that this exchange took place before the time of&nbsp;Christopher Columbus, but they do not know whether it preceded the visits to North America by the Vikings.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Asking whether the Vikings were the first Europeans to encounter America sets the stage for the Vikings-versus-Columbus debate, but first the legendary voyage of&nbsp;St. Brendan&nbsp;has to be reckoned with. According to the epic “Voyage of St. Brendan the Abbot” (recorded in Latin prose sometime between the mid-8th and early 10th century as&nbsp;<em>Navigatio Sancti Brendani Abbatis</em>), in the 6th century Brendan, a peripatetic Irish monk, and some of his brethren <strong>sojourned </strong>west across the Atlantic Ocean&nbsp;in a bowl-shaped boat known as a curragh (coracle).

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Not just any radio show could be placed in the Time Capsule. What picture of contemporary 1960 mankind would the men of the future derive from a soap opera? A news analysis? Or top comedy show? Certainly not a flattering one, and so, reasoned the brass in charge of the project, not a true one.</p>
        <p>No, the only answer was to produce a special documentary program, painting on a broad canvas the glories that were the common man's birthright in an enlightened democracy. As July 4th was only a month away, the idea was a natural. The program would be carried simultaneously on four networks, then placed in the Time Capsule so that historians of the future would have something solid on which to base their conclusions.</p>
        <p>A famous poet-radio writer was hired to write the script. Hollywood's greatest young male star donated his services (with much attendant publicity) as narrator. A self-acknowledged genius who directed radio shows for a living condescended to lend his talents to the production. Numerous other actors, musicians, technicians and assistants were hired ... none well-known, but all quite competent.</p>
        <p>July 4th, the big day, arrived. The cast went into rehearsal early in the morning. By the second complete run-through, just before the break for lunch, the show was hanging together nicely. After four hours of polishing in the afternoon, it was ready to go on the air. Everyone's nerves were raw, but the show sounded great.</p>
        <p>Naturally, when a room full of creative people have been rubbing against one another for a full day, a lot of emotions are generated. The listening audience never knew about it, but it took the actors, directors, musicians and technicians several days to get the session out of their systems. During rehearsals, the young Hollywood star developed a consuming lust for one of the minor actresses. One of the minor actors developed a consuming lust for the young Hollywood star. Everyone immediately hated the director, and he, lofty and all-wise, <strong>contemptuously </strong>hated them in return. By eight o'clock that night, show time, the splendid documentary on the splendid American people was not the only thing that was at peak pitch.</p>
        <p>It was the only thing, however, that the radio audience heard. It was magnificent. Future students hearing the tape could not but conclude that here was the Golden Age. Man, at least American man, circa 1960, noble, humble and sincere, was carrying in his bosom the seeds of greatness. Difficulties still existed, of course, but they were not <strong>insurmountable</strong>. A few deluded people seemed to be working against the common good, but the program left no doubt that this would be cleaned up in short order. The millenium was at hand!</p>

          <strong>Reading the following passage and answer questions 32 – 37.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Not just any radio show could be placed in the Time Capsule. What picture of contemporary 1960 mankind would the men of the future derive from a soap opera? A news analysis? Or top comedy show? Certainly not a flattering one, and so, reasoned the brass in charge of the project, not a true one.</p>
        <p>No, the only answer was to produce a special documentary program, painting on a broad canvas the glories that were the common man's birthright in an enlightened democracy. As July 4th was only a month away, the idea was a natural. The program would be carried simultaneously on four networks, then placed in the Time Capsule so that historians of the future would have something solid on which to base their conclusions.</p>
        <p>A famous poet-radio writer was hired to write the script. Hollywood's greatest young male star donated his services (with much attendant publicity) as narrator. A self-acknowledged genius who directed radio shows for a living condescended to lend his talents to the production. Numerous other actors, musicians, technicians and assistants were hired ... none well-known, but all quite competent.</p>
        <p>July 4th, the big day, arrived. The cast went into rehearsal early in the morning. By the second complete run-through, just before the break for lunch, the show was hanging together nicely. After four hours of polishing in the afternoon, it was ready to go on the air. Everyone's nerves were raw, but the show sounded great.</p>
        <p>Naturally, when a room full of creative people have been rubbing against one another for a full day, a lot of emotions are generated. The listening audience never knew about it, but it took the actors, directors, musicians and technicians several days to get the session out of their systems. During rehearsals, the young Hollywood star developed a consuming lust for one of the minor actresses. One of the minor actors developed a consuming lust for the young Hollywood star. Everyone immediately hated the director, and he, lofty and all-wise, <strong>contemptuously </strong>hated them in return. By eight o'clock that night, show time, the splendid documentary on the splendid American people was not the only thing that was at peak pitch.</p>
        <p>It was the only thing, however, that the radio audience heard. It was magnificent. Future students hearing the tape could not but conclude that here was the Golden Age. Man, at least American man, circa 1960, noble, humble and sincere, was carrying in his bosom the seeds of greatness. Difficulties still existed, of course, but they were not <strong>insurmountable</strong>. A few deluded people seemed to be working against the common good, but the program left no doubt that this would be cleaned up in short order. The millenium was at hand!</p>

          <strong>Read the following passage and answer questions 38 – 42.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The box score of a baseball game is filled with all kinds of shorthand, which is necessitated by the desire for a concise encapsulation of the contest and by the constraints of print space, since box scores were found only in newspapers for the first century of their existence. As a result, baseball fans are familiar with the common abbreviations of the box score, such as E (error), HR (home run), DP (double play), and SB (stolen base). All of those have fairly obvious origins, but what about K, which stands for strikeout?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The use of K has arguably transcended the box score to a greater degree than any other shorthand notation. The letter is often chanted by fans in a stadium when an opponent has two strikes, and placards with K on them are frequently displayed around a stadium to count how many strikeouts the home team’s pitcher has tallied. However, most of these fans are likely not aware that the catchy abbreviation they’re using owes its origin to a 19th-century Englishman who simply ran out of letters.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That man, Henry Chadwick, was a writer who had transferred his love of cricket to baseball when he saw the new game played in 1856. While working as a baseball reporter, Chadwick created many of the now-common features of baseball scoring and statistics keeping, including the numbers used to denote defensive positions (1 for pitcher, 2 for catcher, etc.). He had already chosen S to stand for sacrifice in a box score, so he used K for a strikeout, since that is the last letter in “struck,” which was at the time the most popular way to refer to a batter’s being out after three strikes. (A backwards K has come to indicate that a batter struck out without swinging at the third strike.) Chadwick’s box score of an 1859 game has been recognized as the first box score ever (although there are a number of sources that dispute this claim), and his choices made in it have reverberated throughout baseball history. His impact on how we describe the game was so great that Chadwick became the only journalist officially enshrined in the Baseball Hall of Fame.</p>

          <strong>Read the following passage and answer questions 38 – 42.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The box score of a baseball game is filled with all kinds of shorthand, which is necessitated by the desire for a concise encapsulation of the contest and by the constraints of print space, since box scores were found only in newspapers for the first century of their existence. As a result, baseball fans are familiar with the common abbreviations of the box score, such as E (error), HR (home run), DP (double play), and SB (stolen base). All of those have fairly obvious origins, but what about K, which stands for strikeout?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The use of K has arguably transcended the box score to a greater degree than any other shorthand notation. The letter is often chanted by fans in a stadium when an opponent has two strikes, and placards with K on them are frequently displayed around a stadium to count how many strikeouts the home team’s pitcher has tallied. However, most of these fans are likely not aware that the catchy abbreviation they’re using owes its origin to a 19th-century Englishman who simply ran out of letters.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That man, Henry Chadwick, was a writer who had transferred his love of cricket to baseball when he saw the new game played in 1856. While working as a baseball reporter, Chadwick created many of the now-common features of baseball scoring and statistics keeping, including the numbers used to denote defensive positions (1 for pitcher, 2 for catcher, etc.). He had already chosen S to stand for sacrifice in a box score, so he used K for a strikeout, since that is the last letter in “struck,” which was at the time the most popular way to refer to a batter’s being out after three strikes. (A backwards K has come to indicate that a batter struck out without swinging at the third strike.) Chadwick’s box score of an 1859 game has been recognized as the first box score ever (although there are a number of sources that dispute this claim), and his choices made in it have reverberated throughout baseball history. His impact on how we describe the game was so great that Chadwick became the only journalist officially enshrined in the Baseball Hall of Fame.</p>

          <strong>Read the following passage and answer questions 38 – 42.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The box score of a baseball game is filled with all kinds of shorthand, which is necessitated by the desire for a concise encapsulation of the contest and by the constraints of print space, since box scores were found only in newspapers for the first century of their existence. As a result, baseball fans are familiar with the common abbreviations of the box score, such as E (error), HR (home run), DP (double play), and SB (stolen base). All of those have fairly obvious origins, but what about K, which stands for strikeout?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The use of K has arguably transcended the box score to a greater degree than any other shorthand notation. The letter is often chanted by fans in a stadium when an opponent has two strikes, and placards with K on them are frequently displayed around a stadium to count how many strikeouts the home team’s pitcher has tallied. However, most of these fans are likely not aware that the catchy abbreviation they’re using owes its origin to a 19th-century Englishman who simply ran out of letters.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That man, Henry Chadwick, was a writer who had transferred his love of cricket to baseball when he saw the new game played in 1856. While working as a baseball reporter, Chadwick created many of the now-common features of baseball scoring and statistics keeping, including the numbers used to denote defensive positions (1 for pitcher, 2 for catcher, etc.). He had already chosen S to stand for sacrifice in a box score, so he used K for a strikeout, since that is the last letter in “struck,” which was at the time the most popular way to refer to a batter’s being out after three strikes. (A backwards K has come to indicate that a batter struck out without swinging at the third strike.) Chadwick’s box score of an 1859 game has been recognized as the first box score ever (although there are a number of sources that dispute this claim), and his choices made in it have reverberated throughout baseball history. His impact on how we describe the game was so great that Chadwick became the only journalist officially enshrined in the Baseball Hall of Fame.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mr. Alfred Thipps was a small, nervous man, whose flaxen hair was beginning to abandon the unequal struggle with destiny. One might say that his only really marked feature was a large bruise over the left eyebrow, which gave him a faintly dissipated air <strong>incongruous </strong>with the rest of his appearance. Almost in the same breath with his first greeting, he made a self-conscious apology for it, murmuring something about having run against the dining-room door in the dark. He was touched almost to tears by Lord Peter’s thoughtfulness and condescension in calling.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I’m sure it’s most kind of your lordship,” he repeated for the dozenth time, rapidly blinking his weak little eyelids. “I appreciate it very deeply, very deeply, indeed, and so would Mother, only she’s so deaf, I don’t like to trouble you with making her understand. It’s been very hard all day,” he added, “with the policemen in the house and all this commotion. It’s what Mother and me have never been used to, always living very retired, and it’s most distressing to a man of regular habits, my lord, and reely, I’m almost thankful Mother doesn’t understand, for I’m sure it would worry her terribly if she was to know about it. She was upset at first, but she’s made up some idea of her own about it now, and I’m sure it’s all for the best.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The old lady who sat knitting by the fire nodded grimly in response to a look from her son.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I always said as you ought to complain about that bath, Alfred,” she said suddenly, in the high, piping voice peculiar to the deaf, “and it’s to be ’oped the landlord’ll see about it now; not but what I think you might have managed without having the police in, but there! You always were one to make a fuss about a little thing, from chicken-pox up.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“There now,” said Mr. Thipps apologetically, “you see how it is. Not but what it’s just as well she’s settled on that, because she understands we’ve locked up the bathroom and don’t try to go in there. But it’s been a terrible shock to me, sir—my lord, I should say, but there! My nerves are all to pieces. Such a thing has never ’appened—happened to me in all my born days. Such a state I was in this morning—I didn’t know if I was on my head or my heels—I reely didn’t, and my heart not being too strong, I hardly knew how to get out of that horrid room and telephone for the police. It’s affected me, sir, it’s affected me, it reely has—I couldn’t touch a bit of breakfast, nor lunch neither, and what with telephoning and putting off clients and interviewing people all morning, I’ve hardly known what to do with myself.”</p>
