        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How dogs were domesticated&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Have you ever asked yourself ‘How did dogs become domesticated from wild wolves?’ Maybe you look at your pet dog and wonder why it looks and behaves the way it does. One theory is that early humans kept wolves as pets by somehow taking them from their wolf pack when they were pups. <strong>12 ……….</strong> This domestication may have occurred around the same period of time as the growth of agriculture, which was about 10 000 years ago. Contrary to this, there have been some extremely old fossils discovered which suggest that domesticated or partly domesticated dogs may have existed even earlier, approximately 14 000 years ago.</p>
        <p>More current genetic studies have taken place and suggest that the date of the domestication of dogs happened even earlier than 14 000 years ago. Many scientists now support the fascinating theory of “survival of the friendliest.”<strong> 13 ………. </strong>Wolves discovered that they could have access to food and shelter if they behaved certain ways. They were truly very clever creatures.</p>
        <p>Director of the Duke University Canine Cognition Centre, Brian Hare stated that it was highly doubtful that humans managed to control wild wolves because they were big meat eating animals, who were rivals for food. Interestingly, this theory about “survival of the friendliest” does not just apply to a dog’s demeanour, it is also shaped by physical changes over time. <strong>14 ……….</strong> The physical changes in dogs can be seen in only a few generations and it is the quality of friendliness that determines how they look. Humans tend to feel more comfortable around animals who look more approachable, so these physical changes were definitely advantageous for dogs. As we know, there are hundreds of dog breeds today, many of which are considered to be friendly and cute looking. Just think about the huge cute factor of a Labrador puppy or even a Japanese Spitz, with its white fluffy coat and feather duster looking tail. Most humans would not be scared of them and would like to give them food and shelter.</p>
        <p>Hare also stated that although some wolves would have been friendlier than others, most wolves would have been scared and vicious towards humans. The wolves which were friendly would have gained more food than the others. <strong>15 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>There has been another source of strong evidence about self-domestication and this involved foxes in Russia. <strong>16 ……….</strong> Laurie Santos, director of the Canine Cognition Centre at Yale University said that these foxes were able to pick up on human social cues. <strong>17 ……….</strong> It can be said that dogs domesticated themselves, it was self-domestication, not the work of humans. So, the next time you look at your pet dog or even dogs you see when you’re outside, maybe appreciate where they have come from and all the joy that they bring to your life.&nbsp;</p>

          <em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How dogs were domesticated&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Have you ever asked yourself ‘How did dogs become domesticated from wild wolves?’ Maybe you look at your pet dog and wonder why it looks and behaves the way it does. One theory is that early humans kept wolves as pets by somehow taking them from their wolf pack when they were pups. <strong>12 ……….</strong> This domestication may have occurred around the same period of time as the growth of agriculture, which was about 10 000 years ago. Contrary to this, there have been some extremely old fossils discovered which suggest that domesticated or partly domesticated dogs may have existed even earlier, approximately 14 000 years ago.</p>
        <p>More current genetic studies have taken place and suggest that the date of the domestication of dogs happened even earlier than 14 000 years ago. Many scientists now support the fascinating theory of “survival of the friendliest.”<strong> 13 ………. </strong>Wolves discovered that they could have access to food and shelter if they behaved certain ways. They were truly very clever creatures.</p>
        <p>Director of the Duke University Canine Cognition Centre, Brian Hare stated that it was highly doubtful that humans managed to control wild wolves because they were big meat eating animals, who were rivals for food. Interestingly, this theory about “survival of the friendliest” does not just apply to a dog’s demeanour, it is also shaped by physical changes over time. <strong>14 ……….</strong> The physical changes in dogs can be seen in only a few generations and it is the quality of friendliness that determines how they look. Humans tend to feel more comfortable around animals who look more approachable, so these physical changes were definitely advantageous for dogs. As we know, there are hundreds of dog breeds today, many of which are considered to be friendly and cute looking. Just think about the huge cute factor of a Labrador puppy or even a Japanese Spitz, with its white fluffy coat and feather duster looking tail. Most humans would not be scared of them and would like to give them food and shelter.</p>
        <p>Hare also stated that although some wolves would have been friendlier than others, most wolves would have been scared and vicious towards humans. The wolves which were friendly would have gained more food than the others. <strong>15 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>There has been another source of strong evidence about self-domestication and this involved foxes in Russia. <strong>16 ……….</strong> Laurie Santos, director of the Canine Cognition Centre at Yale University said that these foxes were able to pick up on human social cues. <strong>17 ……….</strong> It can be said that dogs domesticated themselves, it was self-domestication, not the work of humans. So, the next time you look at your pet dog or even dogs you see when you’re outside, maybe appreciate where they have come from and all the joy that they bring to your life.&nbsp;</p>

I’m sure most of you would have heard of Minecraft. It is the highest selling video game ever! It was released a decade ago and is still amongst the most popular games out there, especially for children. Minecraft was created in 2011 by the Swedish company, Mojang. It has millions of players around the world with spin off games, merchandise and an annual convention takes place, for especially dedicated Minecraft fans. Minecraft is unlike most other video games as it does not have an aim or storyline, the player is free to build what they like. The only limitation is that the player’s character has a health bar which needs to be monitored in order for survival. The Minecraft world is made up of various 3D blocks such as grass, tree and water blocks. Players can break and pick up the blocks then position them to build their various structures which can be likened to ‘mining’.&nbsp;<br>

Minecraft is appealing because it is a cross-platform game, which means that players are able to play the game on their computer, console, phone, tablet and also Amazon Fire TV. There are price differences when it comes to purchasing Minecraft and that depends on which platform you wish to play the game on. The base game is practically the same in most versions with some elements not matching exactly, depending on the system. In the past couple of years, Minecraft has invented a multiplayer mode which is also crossplatform. This is great for being able to play with friends and family as it provides more options on how and where to play the game.&nbsp;<br>

In 2017, the first official Minecraft novel was released,&nbsp;Minecraft: The Island.&nbsp;The novel is written by bestselling author, Max Brooks. Brooks has written other successful novels such as&nbsp;The Zombie Survival Guide&nbsp;(2003) and&nbsp;World War Z&nbsp;(2006).&nbsp;Minecraft:&nbsp;The Island&nbsp;is an exciting story about a hero who is stranded on the Minecraft Island. The solo castaway character must find food and build structures as well as keep away from some scary zombies that come out at night! There are also many interesting places to explore on the island like forests and hidden underground tunnels. There are now eight other Minecraft novels. Each novel is written by a different, accomplished author, so the reader will have a unique reading experience with every novel.<br>

If you’re a massive Minecraft fan, then you’ve probably heard about the Minecraft movie that has been delayed several times over a number of years. It was supposed to be released in 2018, then it was said to be March 2022. Now, the studio producing the film, Warner Bros, has delayed it again. There is no new release date as yet. Other Warner Bros films have also been delayed including The Matrix 4, The Flash and Shazam! These films all have a new release date but Minecraft and another film, Black Adam, do not. The Minecraft movie sounds like it has an entertaining plot based around a teenage girl and her friends trying to save their Overworld from the Ender Dragon. Let’s hope for all the Minecraft fans out there that it comes into fruition after all this time patiently waiting.<br>

I’m sure most of you would have heard of Minecraft. It is the highest selling video game ever! It was released a decade ago and is still amongst the most popular games out there, especially for children. Minecraft was created in 2011 by the Swedish company, Mojang. It has millions of players around the world with spin off games, merchandise and an annual convention takes place, for especially dedicated Minecraft fans. Minecraft is unlike most other video games as it does not have an aim or storyline, the player is free to build what they like. The only limitation is that the player’s character has a health bar which needs to be monitored in order for survival. The Minecraft world is made up of various 3D blocks such as grass, tree and water blocks. Players can break and pick up the blocks then position them to build their various structures which can be likened to ‘mining’.&nbsp;<br>

Minecraft is appealing because it is a cross-platform game, which means that players are able to play the game on their computer, console, phone, tablet and also Amazon Fire TV. There are price differences when it comes to purchasing Minecraft and that depends on which platform you wish to play the game on. The base game is practically the same in most versions with some elements not matching exactly, depending on the system. In the past couple of years, Minecraft has invented a multiplayer mode which is also crossplatform. This is great for being able to play with friends and family as it provides more options on how and where to play the game.&nbsp;<br>

In 2017, the first official Minecraft novel was released,&nbsp;Minecraft: The Island.&nbsp;The novel is written by bestselling author, Max Brooks. Brooks has written other successful novels such as&nbsp;The Zombie Survival Guide&nbsp;(2003) and&nbsp;World War Z&nbsp;(2006).&nbsp;Minecraft:&nbsp;The Island&nbsp;is an exciting story about a hero who is stranded on the Minecraft Island. The solo castaway character must find food and build structures as well as keep away from some scary zombies that come out at night! There are also many interesting places to explore on the island like forests and hidden underground tunnels. There are now eight other Minecraft novels. Each novel is written by a different, accomplished author, so the reader will have a unique reading experience with every novel.<br>

If you’re a massive Minecraft fan, then you’ve probably heard about the Minecraft movie that has been delayed several times over a number of years. It was supposed to be released in 2018, then it was said to be March 2022. Now, the studio producing the film, Warner Bros, has delayed it again. There is no new release date as yet. Other Warner Bros films have also been delayed including The Matrix 4, The Flash and Shazam! These films all have a new release date but Minecraft and another film, Black Adam, do not. The Minecraft movie sounds like it has an entertaining plot based around a teenage girl and her friends trying to save their Overworld from the Ender Dragon. Let’s hope for all the Minecraft fans out there that it comes into fruition after all this time patiently waiting.<br>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Book Review – Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</strong><br><br>
The Philosopher’s Stone is the first in J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series of seven novels that have made her the most successful literary author of all time, selling in excess of 400 million copies world-wide. <strong>31</strong> ……….<br>
<br>
Do the Harry Potter books live up to the hype? When I first began reading the Philosopher’s Stone, I was immediately struck by how good - and laugh-out-loud funny - the humour was. <strong>32</strong> ………. &nbsp;but Rowling has managed to infuse this book with a lovely wit and charm that will both amuse and delight adults and children.<br>
<br>
Here is an example, with the ending being particularly good:<br>
<br>
<em>"Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large, pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes and thick, blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. </em><strong>33</strong> ………. – <em>Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig."</em><br>
<br>
There are characters in this book that will remind us of all the people we have met. <strong>34</strong> ………. &nbsp;or a bossy and interfering (yet kind-hearted) girl like Hermione. A large number of the younger readers will also be able to easily identify with Harry, especially with his initial feelings of isolation and not belonging, and then through to his excitement at finally leaving that life behind in favour of one where he belongs and will be happy.<br>
<br>
When Harry begins his first term at Hogwarts (a wizarding school) he is not alone in being overawed:<br>
<br>
<em>“‘Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight of Hogwarts in a sec,’ Hagrid called over his shoulder, ‘jus’ round this bend here.’ There was a loud ‘Oooooh!’<br>
The narrow path had opened suddenly on to the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.”</em><br>
<br>
Hogwarts is a truly magical place, not only in the most obvious way but also in all the detail that the author has gone to describe it so vibrantly. It is the place that everybody wishes they could have gone to when they were eleven. <strong>35</strong> ………. &nbsp;The story builds towards an exciting conclusion that has the ultimate feel-good factor.<br>
<br>
J.K. Rowling should be commended for getting so many people reading and excited by books. The biggest surprise must be the effect that this novel had on the adult population, both male and female - at the time the books were published many a commuting train was spotted with Harry Potter books providing world-weary workers with a wonderful sense of escapism. <strong>36</strong> ……….<br>
<br>
Is all the hype about the Harry Potter books justified? In a word, yes, the books are a joy to read and possibly the most rewarding young adult’s book since The Hobbit.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Book Review – Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</strong><br><br>
The Philosopher’s Stone is the first in J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series of seven novels that have made her the most successful literary author of all time, selling in excess of 400 million copies world-wide. <strong>31</strong> ……….<br>
<br>
Do the Harry Potter books live up to the hype? When I first began reading the Philosopher’s Stone, I was immediately struck by how good - and laugh-out-loud funny - the humour was. <strong>32</strong> ………. &nbsp;but Rowling has managed to infuse this book with a lovely wit and charm that will both amuse and delight adults and children.<br>
<br>
Here is an example, with the ending being particularly good:<br>
<br>
<em>"Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large, pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes and thick, blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. </em><strong>33</strong> ………. – <em>Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig."</em><br>
<br>
There are characters in this book that will remind us of all the people we have met. <strong>34</strong> ………. &nbsp;or a bossy and interfering (yet kind-hearted) girl like Hermione. A large number of the younger readers will also be able to easily identify with Harry, especially with his initial feelings of isolation and not belonging, and then through to his excitement at finally leaving that life behind in favour of one where he belongs and will be happy.<br>
<br>
When Harry begins his first term at Hogwarts (a wizarding school) he is not alone in being overawed:<br>
<br>
<em>“‘Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight of Hogwarts in a sec,’ Hagrid called over his shoulder, ‘jus’ round this bend here.’ There was a loud ‘Oooooh!’<br>
The narrow path had opened suddenly on to the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.”</em><br>
<br>
Hogwarts is a truly magical place, not only in the most obvious way but also in all the detail that the author has gone to describe it so vibrantly. It is the place that everybody wishes they could have gone to when they were eleven. <strong>35</strong> ………. &nbsp;The story builds towards an exciting conclusion that has the ultimate feel-good factor.<br>
<br>
J.K. Rowling should be commended for getting so many people reading and excited by books. The biggest surprise must be the effect that this novel had on the adult population, both male and female - at the time the books were published many a commuting train was spotted with Harry Potter books providing world-weary workers with a wonderful sense of escapism. <strong>36</strong> ……….<br>
<br>
Is all the hype about the Harry Potter books justified? In a word, yes, the books are a joy to read and possibly the most rewarding young adult’s book since The Hobbit.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Book Review – Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</strong><br><br>
The Philosopher’s Stone is the first in J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series of seven novels that have made her the most successful literary author of all time, selling in excess of 400 million copies world-wide. <strong>31</strong> ……….<br>
<br>
Do the Harry Potter books live up to the hype? When I first began reading the Philosopher’s Stone, I was immediately struck by how good - and laugh-out-loud funny - the humour was. <strong>32</strong> ………. &nbsp;but Rowling has managed to infuse this book with a lovely wit and charm that will both amuse and delight adults and children.<br>
<br>
Here is an example, with the ending being particularly good:<br>
<br>
<em>"Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large, pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes and thick, blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. </em><strong>33</strong> ………. – <em>Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig."</em><br>
<br>
There are characters in this book that will remind us of all the people we have met. <strong>34</strong> ………. &nbsp;or a bossy and interfering (yet kind-hearted) girl like Hermione. A large number of the younger readers will also be able to easily identify with Harry, especially with his initial feelings of isolation and not belonging, and then through to his excitement at finally leaving that life behind in favour of one where he belongs and will be happy.<br>
<br>
When Harry begins his first term at Hogwarts (a wizarding school) he is not alone in being overawed:<br>
<br>
<em>“‘Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight of Hogwarts in a sec,’ Hagrid called over his shoulder, ‘jus’ round this bend here.’ There was a loud ‘Oooooh!’<br>
The narrow path had opened suddenly on to the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.”</em><br>
<br>
Hogwarts is a truly magical place, not only in the most obvious way but also in all the detail that the author has gone to describe it so vibrantly. It is the place that everybody wishes they could have gone to when they were eleven. <strong>35</strong> ………. &nbsp;The story builds towards an exciting conclusion that has the ultimate feel-good factor.<br>
<br>
J.K. Rowling should be commended for getting so many people reading and excited by books. The biggest surprise must be the effect that this novel had on the adult population, both male and female - at the time the books were published many a commuting train was spotted with Harry Potter books providing world-weary workers with a wonderful sense of escapism. <strong>36</strong> ……….<br>
<br>
Is all the hype about the Harry Potter books justified? In a word, yes, the books are a joy to read and possibly the most rewarding young adult’s book since The Hobbit.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Book Review – Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</strong><br><br>
The Philosopher’s Stone is the first in J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series of seven novels that have made her the most successful literary author of all time, selling in excess of 400 million copies world-wide. <strong>31</strong> ……….<br>
<br>
Do the Harry Potter books live up to the hype? When I first began reading the Philosopher’s Stone, I was immediately struck by how good - and laugh-out-loud funny - the humour was. <strong>32</strong> ………. &nbsp;but Rowling has managed to infuse this book with a lovely wit and charm that will both amuse and delight adults and children.<br>
<br>
Here is an example, with the ending being particularly good:<br>
<br>
<em>"Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large, pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes and thick, blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. </em><strong>33</strong> ………. – <em>Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig."</em><br>
<br>
There are characters in this book that will remind us of all the people we have met. <strong>34</strong> ………. &nbsp;or a bossy and interfering (yet kind-hearted) girl like Hermione. A large number of the younger readers will also be able to easily identify with Harry, especially with his initial feelings of isolation and not belonging, and then through to his excitement at finally leaving that life behind in favour of one where he belongs and will be happy.<br>
<br>
When Harry begins his first term at Hogwarts (a wizarding school) he is not alone in being overawed:<br>
<br>
<em>“‘Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight of Hogwarts in a sec,’ Hagrid called over his shoulder, ‘jus’ round this bend here.’ There was a loud ‘Oooooh!’<br>
The narrow path had opened suddenly on to the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.”</em><br>
<br>
Hogwarts is a truly magical place, not only in the most obvious way but also in all the detail that the author has gone to describe it so vibrantly. It is the place that everybody wishes they could have gone to when they were eleven. <strong>35</strong> ………. &nbsp;The story builds towards an exciting conclusion that has the ultimate feel-good factor.<br>
<br>
J.K. Rowling should be commended for getting so many people reading and excited by books. The biggest surprise must be the effect that this novel had on the adult population, both male and female - at the time the books were published many a commuting train was spotted with Harry Potter books providing world-weary workers with a wonderful sense of escapism. <strong>36</strong> ……….<br>
<br>
Is all the hype about the Harry Potter books justified? In a word, yes, the books are a joy to read and possibly the most rewarding young adult’s book since The Hobbit.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Book Review – Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</strong><br><br>
The Philosopher’s Stone is the first in J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series of seven novels that have made her the most successful literary author of all time, selling in excess of 400 million copies world-wide. <strong>31</strong> ……….<br>
<br>
Do the Harry Potter books live up to the hype? When I first began reading the Philosopher’s Stone, I was immediately struck by how good - and laugh-out-loud funny - the humour was. <strong>32</strong> ………. &nbsp;but Rowling has managed to infuse this book with a lovely wit and charm that will both amuse and delight adults and children.<br>
<br>
Here is an example, with the ending being particularly good:<br>
<br>
<em>"Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large, pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes and thick, blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. </em><strong>33</strong> ………. – <em>Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig."</em><br>
<br>
There are characters in this book that will remind us of all the people we have met. <strong>34</strong> ………. &nbsp;or a bossy and interfering (yet kind-hearted) girl like Hermione. A large number of the younger readers will also be able to easily identify with Harry, especially with his initial feelings of isolation and not belonging, and then through to his excitement at finally leaving that life behind in favour of one where he belongs and will be happy.<br>
<br>
When Harry begins his first term at Hogwarts (a wizarding school) he is not alone in being overawed:<br>
<br>
<em>“‘Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight of Hogwarts in a sec,’ Hagrid called over his shoulder, ‘jus’ round this bend here.’ There was a loud ‘Oooooh!’<br>
The narrow path had opened suddenly on to the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.”</em><br>
<br>
Hogwarts is a truly magical place, not only in the most obvious way but also in all the detail that the author has gone to describe it so vibrantly. It is the place that everybody wishes they could have gone to when they were eleven. <strong>35</strong> ………. &nbsp;The story builds towards an exciting conclusion that has the ultimate feel-good factor.<br>
<br>
J.K. Rowling should be commended for getting so many people reading and excited by books. The biggest surprise must be the effect that this novel had on the adult population, both male and female - at the time the books were published many a commuting train was spotted with Harry Potter books providing world-weary workers with a wonderful sense of escapism. <strong>36</strong> ……….<br>
<br>
Is all the hype about the Harry Potter books justified? In a word, yes, the books are a joy to read and possibly the most rewarding young adult’s book since The Hobbit.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Book Review – Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</strong><br><br>
The Philosopher’s Stone is the first in J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series of seven novels that have made her the most successful literary author of all time, selling in excess of 400 million copies world-wide. <strong>31</strong> ……….<br>
<br>
Do the Harry Potter books live up to the hype? When I first began reading the Philosopher’s Stone, I was immediately struck by how good - and laugh-out-loud funny - the humour was. <strong>32</strong> ………. &nbsp;but Rowling has managed to infuse this book with a lovely wit and charm that will both amuse and delight adults and children.<br>
<br>
Here is an example, with the ending being particularly good:<br>
<br>
<em>"Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large, pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes and thick, blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. </em><strong>33</strong> ………. – <em>Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig."</em><br>
<br>
There are characters in this book that will remind us of all the people we have met. <strong>34</strong> ………. &nbsp;or a bossy and interfering (yet kind-hearted) girl like Hermione. A large number of the younger readers will also be able to easily identify with Harry, especially with his initial feelings of isolation and not belonging, and then through to his excitement at finally leaving that life behind in favour of one where he belongs and will be happy.<br>
<br>
When Harry begins his first term at Hogwarts (a wizarding school) he is not alone in being overawed:<br>
<br>
<em>“‘Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight of Hogwarts in a sec,’ Hagrid called over his shoulder, ‘jus’ round this bend here.’ There was a loud ‘Oooooh!’<br>
The narrow path had opened suddenly on to the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.”</em><br>
<br>
Hogwarts is a truly magical place, not only in the most obvious way but also in all the detail that the author has gone to describe it so vibrantly. It is the place that everybody wishes they could have gone to when they were eleven. <strong>35</strong> ………. &nbsp;The story builds towards an exciting conclusion that has the ultimate feel-good factor.<br>
<br>
J.K. Rowling should be commended for getting so many people reading and excited by books. The biggest surprise must be the effect that this novel had on the adult population, both male and female - at the time the books were published many a commuting train was spotted with Harry Potter books providing world-weary workers with a wonderful sense of escapism. <strong>36</strong> ……….<br>
<br>
Is all the hype about the Harry Potter books justified? In a word, yes, the books are a joy to read and possibly the most rewarding young adult’s book since The Hobbit.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Book Review – Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</strong><br><br>
The Philosopher’s Stone is the first in J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series of seven novels that have made her the most successful literary author of all time, selling in excess of 400 million copies world-wide. <strong>31</strong> ……….<br>
<br>
Do the Harry Potter books live up to the hype? When I first began reading the Philosopher’s Stone, I was immediately struck by how good - and laugh-out-loud funny - the humour was. <strong>32</strong> ………. &nbsp;but Rowling has managed to infuse this book with a lovely wit and charm that will both amuse and delight adults and children.<br>
<br>
Here is an example, with the ending being particularly good:<br>
<br>
<em>"Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large, pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes and thick, blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. </em><strong>33</strong> ………. – <em>Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig."</em><br>
<br>
There are characters in this book that will remind us of all the people we have met. <strong>34</strong> ………. &nbsp;or a bossy and interfering (yet kind-hearted) girl like Hermione. A large number of the younger readers will also be able to easily identify with Harry, especially with his initial feelings of isolation and not belonging, and then through to his excitement at finally leaving that life behind in favour of one where he belongs and will be happy.<br>
<br>
When Harry begins his first term at Hogwarts (a wizarding school) he is not alone in being overawed:<br>
<br>
<em>“‘Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight of Hogwarts in a sec,’ Hagrid called over his shoulder, ‘jus’ round this bend here.’ There was a loud ‘Oooooh!’<br>
The narrow path had opened suddenly on to the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.”</em><br>
<br>
Hogwarts is a truly magical place, not only in the most obvious way but also in all the detail that the author has gone to describe it so vibrantly. It is the place that everybody wishes they could have gone to when they were eleven. <strong>35</strong> ………. &nbsp;The story builds towards an exciting conclusion that has the ultimate feel-good factor.<br>
<br>
J.K. Rowling should be commended for getting so many people reading and excited by books. The biggest surprise must be the effect that this novel had on the adult population, both male and female - at the time the books were published many a commuting train was spotted with Harry Potter books providing world-weary workers with a wonderful sense of escapism. <strong>36</strong> ……….<br>
<br>
Is all the hype about the Harry Potter books justified? In a word, yes, the books are a joy to read and possibly the most rewarding young adult’s book since The Hobbit.</p>

  The Spanish architect, Antoni Gaudí's work was influenced by his passions in life: architecture, nature, and religion. He considered every detail of his creations and integrated into his architecture such crafts as ceramics, stained glass, wrought ironwork forging and carpentry. His masterpiece, the still-incomplete Sagrada Família Cathedral, is the most-visited monument in Spain. Between 1984 and 2005, seven of his works were declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO.<br>
