        <p>The lions woke me up around two in the morning. The sound wasn’t loud so much as <em>big—</em> like the moaning hydraulics of a garbage truck interrupted by the coughs and grunts of an idling Harley-Davidson. My first hazy, sleepy reaction was a kind of grateful joy. Ah, the sounds of wild Africa! I stared up through the gossamer mesh roof of my tent at the stars overhead, felt the night breeze pushing through the dry grass and thorny acacia trees and up against the tent’s thin nylon walls, carrying the lions’ chorus. I felt fortunate to be there, camped in my little tent in the middle of the vast East African savanna, a place so remote and untrammeled that there were lions just a few hundred yards off. How lucky was I?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then a pang of adrenaline and fear. This wasn’t a zoo or some tourist safari. Those lions weren’t pretty pictures in a <em>National Geographic</em> magazine or a PBS nature show. This was real life. A gang of heavily muscled 300-pound feline killing machines was a short stroll away, and they sounded . . . anxious. Maybe even . . . <em>hungry</em>? Of course they could smell me. <span class="txt-underline"><em><strong>After days of camping I could smell myself.</strong></em></span>&nbsp;What was my plan when they came for my soft American carcass, the warm triple crème brie of human flesh? I wondered how close they’d get before I heard them in the tall grass, or if the end would come unannounced, an explosion of claws and hot angry teeth crashing through the walls of the tent.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I kept thinking it through, trying to be rational. Judging by where the sound was coming from, the lions would have to walk past Dave’s and Brian’s tents first. I was Door Number 3 in this particular game of chance. That meant 1 in 3 odds of being eaten by lions tonight, or, if one was a glass-two-thirds-full kind of person, a 67 percent chance of not being eaten. That was a comforting thought. Plus, we were with the Hadza, on the outskirts of their camp, and nobody messes with the Hadza. Sure, hyenas and leopards would occasionally slink past their grass huts at night looking for scraps or unattended babies, but the lions seemed to keep their distance.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fear began to dissipate. Drowsiness seeped back in. I’d probably be fine. Besides, if one had to be eaten by lions, it seemed preferable to be asleep at the time, at least until the last possible moment. I fluffed up the pile of dirty clothes I was using for a pillow, adjusted my sleeping pad, and went back to sleep.</p>

        <p><strong>Burn</strong>&nbsp;<em>by Herman Pontzer</em></p>

        </p>
        <p>The lions woke me up around two in the morning. The sound wasn’t loud so much as <em>big—</em> like the moaning hydraulics of a garbage truck interrupted by the coughs and grunts of an idling Harley-Davidson. My first hazy, sleepy reaction was a kind of grateful joy. Ah, the sounds of wild Africa! I stared up through the gossamer mesh roof of my tent at the stars overhead, felt the night breeze pushing through the dry grass and thorny acacia trees and up against the tent’s thin nylon walls, carrying the lions’ chorus. I felt fortunate to be there, camped in my little tent in the middle of the vast East African savanna, a place so remote and untrammeled that there were lions just a few hundred yards off. How lucky was I?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then a pang of adrenaline and fear. This wasn’t a zoo or some tourist safari. Those lions weren’t pretty pictures in a <em>National Geographic</em> magazine or a PBS nature show. This was real life. A gang of heavily muscled 300-pound feline killing machines was a short stroll away, and they sounded . . . anxious. Maybe even . . . <em>hungry</em>? Of course they could smell me. <span class="txt-underline"><em><strong>After days of camping I could smell myself.</strong></em></span>&nbsp;What was my plan when they came for my soft American carcass, the warm triple crème brie of human flesh? I wondered how close they’d get before I heard them in the tall grass, or if the end would come unannounced, an explosion of claws and hot angry teeth crashing through the walls of the tent.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I kept thinking it through, trying to be rational. Judging by where the sound was coming from, the lions would have to walk past Dave’s and Brian’s tents first. I was Door Number 3 in this particular game of chance. That meant 1 in 3 odds of being eaten by lions tonight, or, if one was a glass-two-thirds-full kind of person, a 67 percent chance of not being eaten. That was a comforting thought. Plus, we were with the Hadza, on the outskirts of their camp, and nobody messes with the Hadza. Sure, hyenas and leopards would occasionally slink past their grass huts at night looking for scraps or unattended babies, but the lions seemed to keep their distance.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fear began to dissipate. Drowsiness seeped back in. I’d probably be fine. Besides, if one had to be eaten by lions, it seemed preferable to be asleep at the time, at least until the last possible moment. I fluffed up the pile of dirty clothes I was using for a pillow, adjusted my sleeping pad, and went back to sleep.</p>

            <p>While it would be ideal to share a meal together each day, make it your goal to enjoy a family meal 3-4 times per week. The good news is that dinner isn’t the only opportunity -- breakfast during the week or lunch on the weekend also counts. And while a home-cooked meal is always healthiest (less fat, sodium and added sugar), it’s fine to enjoy a frozen pizza together too. What matters is that you aren’t distracted and that everyone can relax, which leads to kids being more willing to share what’s really going on in their lives.</p>

            <p>Ideally, you’d eat together seven days a week, but I know that isn’t realistic. Your daughter has gymnastics on Mondays and your son has soccer practice on Tuesdays; then there’s swimming on Thursday, and don’t forget your book group meeting on Friday evening. With everyone’s busy schedules, sitting down together for dinner isn’t always a possibility, but this is an important one to make time for</p>
            <p>Try to schedule a family dinner at least a few times a week, and if that doesn’t work, what about breakfast, or even snack time? Find a time for everyone to sit down together and enjoy one another’s company. Making family meals a daily habit that children look forward to helps them develop healthier attitudes about food and resist destructive weight behaviours.</p>

            </p>
            <p>For psychologist, Amanda Gordon, one of the main benefits of eating together is connection. “[We can] live very isolated lives, sitting in front of a desk, talking to people online or on the phone. We get very little opportunity to engage with people at a deeper level,” she says. “Connecting around food can be a very safe way of doing this, because you can eat and stop and think for a while.”</p>
            <p>Gordon says that food takes on more importance than just nutritional value when we’re eating with others. Oxford University research even goes so far as to suggest that people who eat socially feel happier and are “more satisfied with life, are more trusting of others, are more engaged with their local communities and have more friends they can depend on for support.” The same research suggests that social eating could improve self-esteem.</p>

            <p>Studies show the effect of eating with your children is both immediate and long lasting. Gordon suggests it can also help children understand social cues. “We teach the skills that go with being part of a society when we’re sitting around a table,” she explains. “It’s a chance for parents to teach children to wait until the next person has spoken, to teach them restaurant behaviours and how to ignore distractions and focus on the conversation at hand.”&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Gordon says it’s also the perfect time for each family member to talk about their day, reflect on what’s happened and offer each other support. For young children, family meals have been linked to better vocabulary, according to Harvard University research. For teenagers, a lack of family meals has been linked to increased disruptive behaviour, academic problems and an increase in alcohol and drug use, according to recent research.</p>

            </p>
            <p>While it would be ideal to share a meal together each day, make it your goal to enjoy a family meal 3-4 times per week. The good news is that dinner isn’t the only opportunity -- breakfast during the week or lunch on the weekend also counts. And while a home-cooked meal is always healthiest (less fat, sodium and added sugar), it’s fine to enjoy a frozen pizza together too. What matters is that you aren’t distracted and that everyone can relax, which leads to kids being more willing to share what’s really going on in their lives.</p>

            <p>Ideally, you’d eat together seven days a week, but I know that isn’t realistic. Your daughter has gymnastics on Mondays and your son has soccer practice on Tuesdays; then there’s swimming on Thursday, and don’t forget your book group meeting on Friday evening. With everyone’s busy schedules, sitting down together for dinner isn’t always a possibility, but this is an important one to make time for</p>
            <p>Try to schedule a family dinner at least a few times a week, and if that doesn’t work, what about breakfast, or even snack time? Find a time for everyone to sit down together and enjoy one another’s company. Making family meals a daily habit that children look forward to helps them develop healthier attitudes about food and resist destructive weight behaviours.</p>

              <strong>Extract C </strong>
            </p>
            <p>For psychologist, Amanda Gordon, one of the main benefits of eating together is connection. “[We can] live very isolated lives, sitting in front of a desk, talking to people online or on the phone. We get very little opportunity to engage with people at a deeper level,” she says. “Connecting around food can be a very safe way of doing this, because you can eat and stop and think for a while.”</p>
            <p>Gordon says that food takes on more importance than just nutritional value when we’re eating with others. Oxford University research even goes so far as to suggest that people who eat socially feel happier and are “more satisfied with life, are more trusting of others, are more engaged with their local communities and have more friends they can depend on for support.” The same research suggests that social eating could improve self-esteem.</p>

            <p>Studies show the effect of eating with your children is both immediate and long lasting. Gordon suggests it can also help children understand social cues. “We teach the skills that go with being part of a society when we’re sitting around a table,” she explains. “It’s a chance for parents to teach children to wait until the next person has spoken, to teach them restaurant behaviours and how to ignore distractions and focus on the conversation at hand.”&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Gordon says it’s also the perfect time for each family member to talk about their day, reflect on what’s happened and offer each other support. For young children, family meals have been linked to better vocabulary, according to Harvard University research. For teenagers, a lack of family meals has been linked to increased disruptive behaviour, academic problems and an increase in alcohol and drug use, according to recent research.</p>

            <p>For psychologist, Amanda Gordon, one of the main benefits of eating together is connection. “[We can] live very isolated lives, sitting in front of a desk, talking to people online or on the phone. We get very little opportunity to engage with people at a deeper level,” she says. “Connecting around food can be a very safe way of doing this, because you can eat and stop and think for a while.”</p>
            <p>Gordon says that food takes on more importance than just nutritional value when we’re eating with others. Oxford University research even goes so far as to suggest that people who eat socially feel happier and are “more satisfied with life, are more trusting of others, are more engaged with their local communities and have more friends they can depend on for support.” The same research suggests that social eating could improve self-esteem.</p>

            <p>While it would be ideal to share a meal together each day, make it your goal to enjoy a family meal 3-4 times per week. The good news is that dinner isn’t the only opportunity -- breakfast during the week or lunch on the weekend also counts. And while a home-cooked meal is always healthiest (less fat, sodium and added sugar), it’s fine to enjoy a frozen pizza together too. What matters is that you aren’t distracted and that everyone can relax, which leads to kids being more willing to share what’s really going on in their lives.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Ideally, you’d eat together seven days a week, but I know that isn’t realistic. Your daughter has gymnastics on Mondays and your son has soccer practice on Tuesdays; then there’s swimming on Thursday, and don’t forget your book group meeting on Friday evening. With everyone’s busy schedules, sitting down together for dinner isn’t always a possibility, but this is an important one to make time for</p>
            <p>Try to schedule a family dinner at least a few times a week, and if that doesn’t work, what about breakfast, or even snack time? Find a time for everyone to sit down together and enjoy one another’s company. Making family meals a daily habit that children look forward to helps them develop healthier attitudes about food and resist destructive weight behaviours.</p>

            <p>While it would be ideal to share a meal together each day, make it your goal to enjoy a family meal 3-4 times per week. The good news is that dinner isn’t the only opportunity -- breakfast during the week or lunch on the weekend also counts. And while a home-cooked meal is always healthiest (less fat, sodium and added sugar), it’s fine to enjoy a frozen pizza together too. What matters is that you aren’t distracted and that everyone can relax, which leads to kids being more willing to share what’s really going on in their lives.</p>

            <p>Ideally, you’d eat together seven days a week, but I know that isn’t realistic. Your daughter has gymnastics on Mondays and your son has soccer practice on Tuesdays; then there’s swimming on Thursday, and don’t forget your book group meeting on Friday evening. With everyone’s busy schedules, sitting down together for dinner isn’t always a possibility, but this is an important one to make time for</p>
            <p>Try to schedule a family dinner at least a few times a week, and if that doesn’t work, what about breakfast, or even snack time? Find a time for everyone to sit down together and enjoy one another’s company. Making family meals a daily habit that children look forward to helps them develop healthier attitudes about food and resist destructive weight behaviours.</p>

            </p>
            <p>For psychologist, Amanda Gordon, one of the main benefits of eating together is connection. “[We can] live very isolated lives, sitting in front of a desk, talking to people online or on the phone. We get very little opportunity to engage with people at a deeper level,” she says. “Connecting around food can be a very safe way of doing this, because you can eat and stop and think for a while.”</p>
            <p>Gordon says that food takes on more importance than just nutritional value when we’re eating with others. Oxford University research even goes so far as to suggest that people who eat socially feel happier and are “more satisfied with life, are more trusting of others, are more engaged with their local communities and have more friends they can depend on for support.” The same research suggests that social eating could improve self-esteem.</p>

            <p>Studies show the effect of eating with your children is both immediate and long lasting. Gordon suggests it can also help children understand social cues. “We teach the skills that go with being part of a society when we’re sitting around a table,” she explains. “It’s a chance for parents to teach children to wait until the next person has spoken, to teach them restaurant behaviours and how to ignore distractions and focus on the conversation at hand.”&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Gordon says it’s also the perfect time for each family member to talk about their day, reflect on what’s happened and offer each other support. For young children, family meals have been linked to better vocabulary, according to Harvard University research. For teenagers, a lack of family meals has been linked to increased disruptive behaviour, academic problems and an increase in alcohol and drug use, according to recent research.</p>

With everyone’s busy schedules, sitting down together for dinner isn’t always a possibility, but this is an important one to make time for</p>
            <p>Try to schedule a family dinner at least a few times a week, and if that doesn’t work, what about breakfast, or even snack time? Find a time for everyone to sit down together and enjoy one another’s company. Making family meals a daily habit that children look forward to helps them develop healthier attitudes about food and resist destructive weight behaviours.</p>

              <strong>Extract C </strong>
            </p>
            <p>For psychologist, Amanda Gordon, one of the main benefits of eating together is connection. “[We can] live very isolated lives, sitting in front of a desk, talking to people online or on the phone. We get very little opportunity to engage with people at a deeper level,” she says. “Connecting around food can be a very safe way of doing this, because you can eat and stop and think for a while.”</p>
            <p>Gordon says that food takes on more importance than just nutritional value when we’re eating with others. Oxford University research even goes so far as to suggest that people who eat socially feel happier and are “more satisfied with life, are more trusting of others, are more engaged with their local communities and have more friends they can depend on for support.” The same research suggests that social eating could improve self-esteem.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Studies show the effect of eating with your children is both immediate and long lasting. Gordon suggests it can also help children understand social cues. “We teach the skills that go with being part of a society when we’re sitting around a table,” she explains. “It’s a chance for parents to teach children to wait until the next person has spoken, to teach them restaurant behaviours and how to ignore distractions and focus on the conversation at hand.”&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Gordon says it’s also the perfect time for each family member to talk about their day, reflect on what’s happened and offer each other support. For young children, family meals have been linked to better vocabulary, according to Harvard University research. For teenagers, a lack of family meals has been linked to increased disruptive behaviour, academic problems and an increase in alcohol and drug use, according to recent research.</p>

          <strong>How To Simplify a Kid’s Birthday Party&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Birthday celebrations are supposed to be fun, but they can turn into expensive nightmares full of wasted food and needless gifts. <strong>1 ……….. .</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My daughter turned four last week. It was also the first time ever that we had a “real party”— before then, it had just been family gatherings. <strong>2 ……….. </strong>and second, the unnecessary onslaught of gifts and clutter that would land in our home as a result.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Here are my takeaways.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Plan early. Set expectations early.&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>By plan, I don’t mean decide the menu or party favours, I mean sit down with the birthday child and ask what he or she wants for a party. <strong>3 ……….. </strong>Planning early will give you time to work with your kid to manage or change expectations.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Talk about priorities—yours and theirs.&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Once you’ve re-adjusted high expectations, it’s time to get into details. But where to begin?&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Start with yourself. <strong>4 ……….. </strong>Think of this as negotiation; list your two highest priorities. If you and your kid have hugely different priorities, this might take diplomacy</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Define “celebration.”&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Birthday parties can be simple if we change our perspective from it being a “party” to it being a “celebration.” As you plan, talk about the years that have gone by, the milestones and memories of people and experiences from previous celebrations. Children cherish what we cherish, and as their parents, they learn to love the things we value.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Involve the family.&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Having a simple, frugal birthday party could be hard because you’re going against normal expectations. <strong>5 ………..</strong>—this will make the process a little easier.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Communicate with friends.&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Explain your approach to a few close friends, especially if it involves them in some way (such as with our no-gift policy). Since it was my daughter’s first party—and it was going to be quite different from a normal party—I wanted to have individual conversations with a few friends. <strong>6 ……….. .</strong> It also gave them time to explain the no-gift concept to their own kids.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Simplify the actual party. Less is more.&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If you’ve done everything you can by this point to set simplified expectations, the actual party planning should be simpler. Make choices that are easiest on you, the busy parent with minimalist expectations. Remember, most kids just want to have fun, run around, and eat cake.</p>

          <strong>How To Simplify a Kid’s Birthday Party&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Birthday celebrations are supposed to be fun, but they can turn into expensive nightmares full of wasted food and needless gifts. <strong>1 ……….. .</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My daughter turned four last week. It was also the first time ever that we had a “real party”— before then, it had just been family gatherings. <strong>2 ……….. </strong>and second, the unnecessary onslaught of gifts and clutter that would land in our home as a result.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Here are my takeaways.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Plan early. Set expectations early.&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>By plan, I don’t mean decide the menu or party favours, I mean sit down with the birthday child and ask what he or she wants for a party. <strong>3 ……….. </strong>Planning early will give you time to work with your kid to manage or change expectations.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Talk about priorities—yours and theirs.&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Once you’ve re-adjusted high expectations, it’s time to get into details. But where to begin?&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Start with yourself. <strong>4 ……….. </strong>Think of this as negotiation; list your two highest priorities. If you and your kid have hugely different priorities, this might take diplomacy</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Define “celebration.”&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Birthday parties can be simple if we change our perspective from it being a “party” to it being a “celebration.” As you plan, talk about the years that have gone by, the milestones and memories of people and experiences from previous celebrations. Children cherish what we cherish, and as their parents, they learn to love the things we value.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Involve the family.&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Having a simple, frugal birthday party could be hard because you’re going against normal expectations. <strong>5 ………..</strong>—this will make the process a little easier.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Communicate with friends.&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Explain your approach to a few close friends, especially if it involves them in some way (such as with our no-gift policy). Since it was my daughter’s first party—and it was going to be quite different from a normal party—I wanted to have individual conversations with a few friends. <strong>6 ……….. .</strong> It also gave them time to explain the no-gift concept to their own kids.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Simplify the actual party. Less is more.&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If you’ve done everything you can by this point to set simplified expectations, the actual party planning should be simpler. Make choices that are easiest on you, the busy parent with minimalist expectations. Remember, most kids just want to have fun, run around, and eat cake.</p>

          <strong>How To Simplify a Kid’s Birthday Party&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Birthday celebrations are supposed to be fun, but they can turn into expensive nightmares full of wasted food and needless gifts. <strong>1 ……….. .</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My daughter turned four last week. It was also the first time ever that we had a “real party”— before then, it had just been family gatherings. <strong>2 ……….. </strong>and second, the unnecessary onslaught of gifts and clutter that would land in our home as a result.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Here are my takeaways.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Plan early. Set expectations early.&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>By plan, I don’t mean decide the menu or party favours, I mean sit down with the birthday child and ask what he or she wants for a party. <strong>3 ……….. </strong>Planning early will give you time to work with your kid to manage or change expectations.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Talk about priorities—yours and theirs.&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Once you’ve re-adjusted high expectations, it’s time to get into details. But where to begin?&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Start with yourself. <strong>4 ……….. </strong>Think of this as negotiation; list your two highest priorities. If you and your kid have hugely different priorities, this might take diplomacy</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Define “celebration.”&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Birthday parties can be simple if we change our perspective from it being a “party” to it being a “celebration.” As you plan, talk about the years that have gone by, the milestones and memories of people and experiences from previous celebrations. Children cherish what we cherish, and as their parents, they learn to love the things we value.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Involve the family.&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Having a simple, frugal birthday party could be hard because you’re going against normal expectations. <strong>5 ………..</strong>—this will make the process a little easier.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Communicate with friends.&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Explain your approach to a few close friends, especially if it involves them in some way (such as with our no-gift policy). Since it was my daughter’s first party—and it was going to be quite different from a normal party—I wanted to have individual conversations with a few friends. <strong>6 ……….. .</strong> It also gave them time to explain the no-gift concept to their own kids.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Simplify the actual party. Less is more.&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If you’ve done everything you can by this point to set simplified expectations, the actual party planning should be simpler. Make choices that are easiest on you, the busy parent with minimalist expectations. Remember, most kids just want to have fun, run around, and eat cake.</p>

          <strong>How To Simplify a Kid’s Birthday Party&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Birthday celebrations are supposed to be fun, but they can turn into expensive nightmares full of wasted food and needless gifts. <strong>1 ……….. .</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My daughter turned four last week. It was also the first time ever that we had a “real party”— before then, it had just been family gatherings. <strong>2 ……….. </strong>and second, the unnecessary onslaught of gifts and clutter that would land in our home as a result.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Here are my takeaways.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Plan early. Set expectations early.&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>By plan, I don’t mean decide the menu or party favours, I mean sit down with the birthday child and ask what he or she wants for a party. <strong>3 ……….. </strong>Planning early will give you time to work with your kid to manage or change expectations.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Talk about priorities—yours and theirs.&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Once you’ve re-adjusted high expectations, it’s time to get into details. But where to begin?&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Start with yourself. <strong>4 ……….. </strong>Think of this as negotiation; list your two highest priorities. If you and your kid have hugely different priorities, this might take diplomacy</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Define “celebration.”&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Birthday parties can be simple if we change our perspective from it being a “party” to it being a “celebration.” As you plan, talk about the years that have gone by, the milestones and memories of people and experiences from previous celebrations. Children cherish what we cherish, and as their parents, they learn to love the things we value.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Involve the family.&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Having a simple, frugal birthday party could be hard because you’re going against normal expectations. <strong>5 ………..</strong>—this will make the process a little easier.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Communicate with friends.&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Explain your approach to a few close friends, especially if it involves them in some way (such as with our no-gift policy). Since it was my daughter’s first party—and it was going to be quite different from a normal party—I wanted to have individual conversations with a few friends. <strong>6 ……….. .</strong> It also gave them time to explain the no-gift concept to their own kids.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Simplify the actual party. Less is more.&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If you’ve done everything you can by this point to set simplified expectations, the actual party planning should be simpler. Make choices that are easiest on you, the busy parent with minimalist expectations. Remember, most kids just want to have fun, run around, and eat cake.</p>

          <strong>How To Simplify a Kid’s Birthday Party&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Birthday celebrations are supposed to be fun, but they can turn into expensive nightmares full of wasted food and needless gifts. <strong>1 ……….. .</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My daughter turned four last week. It was also the first time ever that we had a “real party”— before then, it had just been family gatherings. <strong>2 ……….. </strong>and second, the unnecessary onslaught of gifts and clutter that would land in our home as a result.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Here are my takeaways.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Plan early. Set expectations early.&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>By plan, I don’t mean decide the menu or party favours, I mean sit down with the birthday child and ask what he or she wants for a party. <strong>3 ……….. </strong>Planning early will give you time to work with your kid to manage or change expectations.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Talk about priorities—yours and theirs.&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Once you’ve re-adjusted high expectations, it’s time to get into details. But where to begin?&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Start with yourself. <strong>4 ……….. </strong>Think of this as negotiation; list your two highest priorities. If you and your kid have hugely different priorities, this might take diplomacy</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Define “celebration.”&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Birthday parties can be simple if we change our perspective from it being a “party” to it being a “celebration.” As you plan, talk about the years that have gone by, the milestones and memories of people and experiences from previous celebrations. Children cherish what we cherish, and as their parents, they learn to love the things we value.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Involve the family.&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Having a simple, frugal birthday party could be hard because you’re going against normal expectations. <strong>5 ………..</strong>—this will make the process a little easier.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Communicate with friends.&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Explain your approach to a few close friends, especially if it involves them in some way (such as with our no-gift policy). Since it was my daughter’s first party—and it was going to be quite different from a normal party—I wanted to have individual conversations with a few friends. <strong>6 ……….. .</strong> It also gave them time to explain the no-gift concept to their own kids.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Simplify the actual party. Less is more.&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If you’ve done everything you can by this point to set simplified expectations, the actual party planning should be simpler. Make choices that are easiest on you, the busy parent with minimalist expectations. Remember, most kids just want to have fun, run around, and eat cake.</p>
