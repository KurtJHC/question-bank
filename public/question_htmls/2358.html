“What?”</p>
        <p>“Well, like she’s just doing it because she’s sorry for us. We’ve been kind to her, and she wouldn’t want to hurt our feelings, so she just puts up with us. Like she’s too polite to run unless we tell her to go . . .”</p>
        <p>“Ah, now, no dog can be full of things like that—like human things . . .”</p>
        <p>“Nay, my Herself is, Dan. Ye don’t know that dog. Dan!”</p>
        <p>“Well?”</p>
        <p>The old woman’s voice dropped.</p>
        <p>“Ye see, I know aboot this dog. I know something.”</p>
        <p>“What?”</p>
        <p>“Dan, she’s going somewhere. She’s on her way.”</p>
        <p>“Ah, now, woman, and what fancies are ye building in your mind!”</p>
        <p>“I don’t care, Dan. I know—me and Herself, we both know. She was on her way, Dan, and she got tired on the way, and she’s just stopped here like it was a hospital—or a wayside inn in a story. And now she’s better, she wants to be on her way. But she’s so polite and understanding, she doesn’t want to hurt us. But in her heart, she’s for being away.</p>
        <p>She’s not happy here.”</p>
        <p>The old man did not answer. He tapped out his clay pipe in the palm of his hand and looked steadily at the dog. Finally, he spoke.</p>
        <p>“Aye,” he said. “All right, Dally. All right.”</p>
        <p>There are people whose hearts are so full of ugly fear that when they see a thirsty animal pass with a fleck of saliva on its parched jowl, they must run in terror shouting, “Mad dog!” There are others to whom every passing creature is an enemy, to be harried on its way with a flung stone. But, and for this the canine world must be thankful, there are others with affection and deep understanding in their lives who bring dignity and honour to the relationship between man and dog.</p>
        <p>Such was the old couple, who on the next afternoon sat watching the dog. When the time neared four o’clock, and Lassie rose, their eyes followed her.</p>
        <p>And when Lassie whined at the door and then paced to the window, they both sighed.</p>
        <p>“Well,” the old man said.</p>
        <p>That was all. They both got up. The woman opened the door. Side by side, the old man and his wife followed Lassie out to the road.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There for a moment, the dog stood, as if unable to realize that at last her great urge could be fulfilled.</p>
        <p>She looked back at the woman whose hands had patted and fondled her and fed her.</p>
        <p>For a second, the old woman wished to call—to call the dog back to her and try again to wean its mind from old memories. But she was too honest. She lifted her head, and her aged voice came clearly.</p>
        <p>“It’s all richt, then, dog. If ye must go—awa’ wi’ ye.”</p>
        <p>In that sentence, Lassie caught the word “go.” It was what she wanted.</p>
        <p>She turned, looked back once as in a glance of farewell, and then started—not up the road to the east, nor down it to the west, but straight across the field. She was going south again.</p>

“What?”</p>
        <p>“Well, like she’s just doing it because she’s sorry for us. We’ve been kind to her, and she wouldn’t want to hurt our feelings, so she just puts up with us. Like she’s too polite to run unless we tell her to go . . .”</p>
        <p>“Ah, now, no dog can be full of things like that—like human things . . .”</p>
        <p>“Nay, my Herself is, Dan. Ye don’t know that dog. Dan!”</p>
        <p>“Well?”</p>
        <p>The old woman’s voice dropped.</p>
        <p>“Ye see, I know aboot this dog. I know something.”</p>
        <p>“What?”</p>
        <p>“Dan, she’s going somewhere. She’s on her way.”</p>
        <p>“Ah, now, woman, and what fancies are ye building in your mind!”</p>
        <p>“I don’t care, Dan. I know—me and Herself, we both know. She was on her way, Dan, and she got tired on the way, and she’s just stopped here like it was a hospital—or a wayside inn in a story. And now she’s better, she wants to be on her way. But she’s so polite and understanding, she doesn’t want to hurt us. But in her heart, she’s for being away.</p>
        <p>She’s not happy here.”</p>
        <p>The old man did not answer. He tapped out his clay pipe in the palm of his hand and looked steadily at the dog. Finally, he spoke.</p>
        <p>“Aye,” he said. “All right, Dally. All right.”</p>
        <p>There are people whose hearts are so full of ugly fear that when they see a thirsty animal pass with a fleck of saliva on its parched jowl, they must run in terror shouting, “Mad dog!” There are others to whom every passing creature is an enemy, to be harried on its way with a flung stone. But, and for this the canine world must be thankful, there are others with affection and deep understanding in their lives who bring dignity and honour to the relationship between man and dog.</p>
        <p>Such was the old couple, who on the next afternoon sat watching the dog. When the time neared four o’clock, and Lassie rose, their eyes followed her.</p>
        <p>And when Lassie whined at the door and then paced to the window, they both sighed.</p>
        <p>“Well,” the old man said.</p>
        <p>That was all. They both got up. The woman opened the door. Side by side, the old man and his wife followed Lassie out to the road.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There for a moment, the dog stood, as if unable to realize that at last her great urge could be fulfilled.</p>
        <p>She looked back at the woman whose hands had patted and fondled her and fed her.</p>
        <p>For a second, the old woman wished to call—to call the dog back to her and try again to wean its mind from old memories. But she was too honest. She lifted her head, and her aged voice came clearly.</p>
        <p>“It’s all richt, then, dog. If ye must go—awa’ wi’ ye.”</p>
        <p>In that sentence, Lassie caught the word “go.” It was what she wanted.</p>
        <p>She turned, looked back once as in a glance of farewell, and then started—not up the road to the east, nor down it to the west, but straight across the field. She was going south again.</p>

        <p><em>Read the extract below then answer the questions.</em><br><br>
“What?”</p>
        <p>“Well, like she’s just doing it because she’s sorry for us. We’ve been kind to her, and she wouldn’t want to hurt our feelings, so she just puts up with us. Like she’s too polite to run unless we tell her to go . . .”</p>
        <p>“Ah, now, no dog can be full of things like that—like human things . . .”</p>
        <p>“Nay, my Herself is, Dan. Ye don’t know that dog. Dan!”</p>
        <p>“Well?”</p>
        <p>The old woman’s voice dropped.</p>
        <p>“Ye see, I know aboot this dog. I know something.”</p>
        <p>“What?”</p>
        <p>“Dan, she’s going somewhere. She’s on her way.”</p>
        <p>“Ah, now, woman, and what fancies are ye building in your mind!”</p>
        <p>“I don’t care, Dan. I know—me and Herself, we both know. She was on her way, Dan, and she got tired on the way, and she’s just stopped here like it was a hospital—or a wayside inn in a story. And now she’s better, she wants to be on her way. But she’s so polite and understanding, she doesn’t want to hurt us. But in her heart, she’s for being away.</p>
        <p>She’s not happy here.”</p>
        <p>The old man did not answer. He tapped out his clay pipe in the palm of his hand and looked steadily at the dog. Finally, he spoke.</p>
        <p>“Aye,” he said. “All right, Dally. All right.”</p>
        <p>There are people whose hearts are so full of ugly fear that when they see a thirsty animal pass with a fleck of saliva on its parched jowl, they must run in terror shouting, “Mad dog!” There are others to whom every passing creature is an enemy, to be harried on its way with a flung stone. But, and for this the canine world must be thankful, there are others with affection and deep understanding in their lives who bring dignity and honour to the relationship between man and dog.</p>
        <p>Such was the old couple, who on the next afternoon sat watching the dog. When the time neared four o’clock, and Lassie rose, their eyes followed her.</p>
        <p>And when Lassie whined at the door and then paced to the window, they both sighed.</p>
        <p>“Well,” the old man said.</p>
        <p>That was all. They both got up. The woman opened the door. Side by side, the old man and his wife followed Lassie out to the road.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There for a moment, the dog stood, as if unable to realize that at last her great urge could be fulfilled.</p>
        <p>She looked back at the woman whose hands had patted and fondled her and fed her.</p>
        <p>For a second, the old woman wished to call—to call the dog back to her and try again to wean its mind from old memories. But she was too honest. She lifted her head, and her aged voice came clearly.</p>
        <p>“It’s all richt, then, dog. If ye must go—awa’ wi’ ye.”</p>
        <p>In that sentence, Lassie caught the word “go.” It was what she wanted.</p>
        <p>She turned, looked back once as in a glance of farewell, and then started—not up the road to the east, nor down it to the west, but straight across the field. She was going south again.</p>

<br>
Simpson and His Donkey</strong>
        </p>
        <p>John Simpson Kirkpatrick, known simply as Simpson, became an Australian war hero during World War I for his extraordinary bravery as a stretcher-bearer in the Gallipoli campaign. He famously used a donkey to rescue hundreds of wounded soldiers under enemy fire, embodying courage, sacrifice, and kindness. <strong>(A)&nbsp;</strong>................. Hoping to see his mother in England, he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) in 1914 and landed at Anzac Cove in April 1915. Recognising the inefficiency of traditional stretchers, he ingeniously used a donkey to transport the injured more quickly and made numerous perilous trips daily.</p>
        <p>Simpson’s remarkable bravery was widely acknowledged by his fellow soldiers. He calmly navigated enemy fire, often whistling to soothe his donkey, while rescuing an estimated 300 soldiers. &nbsp;<strong>(B)</strong>&nbsp;................. Tragically, on 19 May 1915, at the young age of 22, Simpson was killed by enemy fire while continuing his selfless rescue missions. His donkey survived and continued its service.</p>
        <p>Despite never receiving the Victoria Cross, Simpson’s story became legendary after his death, and he is remembered as one of Australia’s greatest war heroes. His bravery is commemorated in schools, books, and war memorials across the nation, his tale forming a significant part of Anzac history, symbolising selflessness and heroism.<strong>&nbsp;(C)&nbsp;</strong>................. Additionally, the donkey itself has become a potent symbol of endurance, loyalty, and compassion, deeply intertwined with Simpson’s legacy.</p>
        <p>Simpson’s actions at Gallipoli significantly shaped Australian national identity, embodying valued traits like courage, selflessness, and resilience, particularly during Australia’s early nationhood. His story is a central part of the Anzac legend, recounted on Anzac Day and taught in schools, reinforcing values of mateship and determination. <strong>(D)&nbsp;</strong>................. This omission has sparked considerable debate, with many arguing his actions warranted the highest military honour.</p>
        <p>Simpson’s dedication to saving wounded soldiers underscored the vital role of medical personnel in war, highlighting their bravery in perilous conditions. His legacy has also inspired humanitarian efforts globally, reminding people of the impact of compassion in conflict zones. <strong>(E)&nbsp;</strong>................. His story has been retold in various artistic and literary forms, solidifying his place in Australian cultural memory and exploring themes of heroism and sacrifice.</p>
        <p>More than a century after his death, Simpson’s legacy remains profoundly relevant, frequently referenced in discussions about heroism and the human cost of war. <strong>(F)</strong>&nbsp;................. His unwavering commitment to helping others, even at the ultimate cost, serves as a powerful reminder of true heroism and continues to inspire generations worldwide.</p>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of climate change. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, primarily caused by human activities. The burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas releases greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat, leading to global warming. According to NASA, Earth’s average surface temperature has risen by about 1.1°C since the late 19th century. The consequences of this warming are already evident: melting glaciers, rising sea levels, more frequent heatwaves, and extreme weather events such as hurricanes and droughts. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns that if global temperatures rise more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, the damage could become irreversible. Governments and organizations worldwide are promoting renewable energy sources, sustainable agriculture, and conservation efforts to reduce emissions and mitigate climate change. However, the window for effective action is narrowing, making it vital that we address this crisis urgently.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of climate change. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
I’ve been farming this land for over thirty years. My father farmed it before me, and his father before him. We used to know the seasons like the back of our hand — when to plant, when to harvest, when the rains would come. But that certainty is gone now. In the last decade, the weather’s become unpredictable. Some years, the rain doesn’t come at all until it’s too late. Other times, it floods and wipes out weeks of work in a single afternoon. Last summer, we lost nearly half our crop to a heatwave that scorched the fields. I watched my corn wilt in soil that cracked like broken clay. It’s not just the crops. The bees are fewer. The soil takes longer to recover. We’ve had to switch to drought-resistant seeds, dig deeper wells, and even cut back on livestock because we can’t count on enough water. Climate change isn’t a theory to me. It’s not a debate. It’s what I face every morning when I look at the sky and wonder if the clouds will bless us or betray us. But I haven’t given up. I’m working with other farmers to try new methods — crop rotation, water conservation, solar-powered irrigation. We’re adapting, because we have to. This land feeds people. And I’ll keep fighting for it, one season at a time.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of climate change. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
The year is 2074. What was once the Arctic is now navigable ocean for most of the year. Entire nations have shifted borders inland, retreating from coastlines swallowed by rising seas. Cities like Amsterdam, Bangkok, and Miami are remembered in history lessons, alongside maps of their sunken remains. Artificial intelligence now runs much of the planet’s resource management, including global carbon regulation systems, powered by fusion energy. The atmosphere is slowly stabilizing thanks to decades of drastic action — carbon drawdown satellites, global reforestation drones, and a ban on fossil fuels. But the scars are deep. Climate refugees now form the largest migratory population in history. Generations have grown up in climate-adapted arcologies — enclosed, self-sufficient cities that withstand extreme weather. Children learn about coral reefs and polar bears as extinct wonders, like dinosaurs. The world didn’t end, but it transformed. Climate change became the great equaliser, and ultimately, the great teacher.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of climate change. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Greta Thunberg was just 15 years old when she began her solo climate strike outside the Swedish Parliament in 2018, holding a handmade sign that read “Skolstrejk för klimatet” (“School strike for climate”). What started as one girl skipping school to demand action quickly became a global movement. Greta’s message was simple but powerful: world leaders were failing to act on the climate crisis, and the younger generation would bear the consequences. Her quiet protest sparked a worldwide youth movement, “Fridays for Future,” inspiring millions of students across the globe to strike for climate justice. Greta’s speeches at the United Nations, the European Parliament, and climate summits have been sharp, emotional, and unflinching. She famously told world leaders: “You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words... How dare you?”<br>
<br>
Despite criticism and resistance, Greta remains undeterred. She refuses to be silenced or softened, reminding the world that the science is clear — and that inaction is a betrayal of future generations. She has become a symbol of youth resistance, a reminder that one voice, when honest and persistent, can echo around the world.<br>

Or, if he came in from the raw Yorkshire air boasting of how hungry he was, no longer did his mother’s face take on that frightened, secret look, but instead she would laugh in her merry, plump way and say:</p>
        <p>“My goodness, I don’t know how to keep you full! Where do you put it all?”</p>
        <p>But all the time she was saying it her voice would sound as if she were proud of a son who had such a great appetite, and that was just as it used to be in old times, too.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>No longer did the grownups stop talking when he came in suddenly, nor did the voices go on, lifting and falling in weary argument after he was abed. No longer did his father come home each day, weary and dour and unspeaking, to sit by the fire and gaze into it.</p>
        <p>Instead, the moment his footstep would sound out on the gravel, Mrs. Carraclough would jump up in a great bustle and cry:</p>
        <p>“Look out! Here comes thy father now! Heads up— hot stuff coming!”</p>
        <p>Then she would race from fire to table, whisking steaming tureens and bowls from the oven as if the most important thing in all the world was that they should all be set out in that brief space of time between the sound of his coming and the opening of the door.</p>
        <p>Then she would stand, her arms akimbo, and say:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Hurry up and wash, Sam! Sheep’s head and dumplings tonight—and they don’t wait for no man!”</p>
        <p>That was the way it was—like old times again. And his father, too, sitting at the table, bowing his head to the food and then looking up and saying:</p>
        <p>“Well, and how’s our Joe been today? Did ye do your lessons good at school?”</p>
        <p>Once it had been like that before. Then it had all stopped. Now it was like that again. What was the reason?</p>
        <p>Joe pondered over this all through the meal that evening. After the meal was over, and Lassie came stalking in, he sank on the rug beside her and stroked her, and he thought he had found the answer.</p>
        <p>It was Lassie! Of course—that was it! When she had been home, things had been right. When she was sold and gone, nothing had gone right anymore.</p>
        <p>And now that she was back, everything was fine again, and they were all very happy.</p>
        <p>“She came home and brought us luck,” he thought.</p>
        <p>“She did it. She came home and brought us luck.”</p>
        <p>He made a crooning sound and pillowed his face in the dog’s ruff. Lassie sighed contentedly.</p>
        <p>Then his mother spoke:</p>
        <p>“Now Joe, don’t lie with that dog all over my rug. Getting hair all over. And what’s making you so silent tonight?”</p>
        <p>Joe smiled to himself. He still crooned to the dog.</p>
        <p>“Ye’re a come-home dog, aren’t ye, Lassie?” he crooned.</p>
        <p>“Aye, that ye are. And ye brought us luck. ’Cause ye’re a come-homer. Ye’re my Come-home. Lassie Come-home. That’s thy name! Lassie Comehome!”</p>

Or, if he came in from the raw Yorkshire air boasting of how hungry he was, no longer did his mother’s face take on that frightened, secret look, but instead she would laugh in her merry, plump way and say:</p>

        <p>But all the time she was saying it her voice would sound as if she were proud of a son who had such a great appetite, and that was just as it used to be in old times, too.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Instead, the moment his footstep would sound out on the gravel, Mrs. Carraclough would jump up in a great bustle and cry:</p>
        <p>“Look out! Here comes thy father now! Heads up— hot stuff coming!”</p>
        <p>Then she would race from fire to table, whisking steaming tureens and bowls from the oven as if the most important thing in all the world was that they should all be set out in that brief space of time between the sound of his coming and the opening of the door.</p>

        <p>“Hurry up and wash, Sam! Sheep’s head and dumplings tonight—and they don’t wait for no man!”</p>
        <p>That was the way it was—like old times again. And his father, too, sitting at the table, bowing his head to the food and then looking up and saying:</p>
        <p>“Well, and how’s our Joe been today? Did ye do your lessons good at school?”</p>
        <p>Once it had been like that before. Then it had all stopped. Now it was like that again. What was the reason?</p>
        <p>Joe pondered over this all through the meal that evening. After the meal was over, and Lassie came stalking in, he sank on the rug beside her and stroked her, and he thought he had found the answer.</p>
        <p>It was Lassie! Of course—that was it! When she had been home, things had been right. When she was sold and gone, nothing had gone right anymore.</p>
        <p>And now that she was back, everything was fine again, and they were all very happy.</p>
        <p>“She came home and brought us luck,” he thought.</p>
        <p>“She did it. She came home and brought us luck.”</p>
        <p>He made a crooning sound and pillowed his face in the dog’s ruff. Lassie sighed contentedly.</p>
        <p>Then his mother spoke:</p>
        <p>“Now Joe, don’t lie with that dog all over my rug. Getting hair all over. And what’s making you so silent tonight?”</p>
        <p>Joe smiled to himself. He still crooned to the dog.</p>
        <p>“Ye’re a come-home dog, aren’t ye, Lassie?” he crooned.</p>
        <p>“Aye, that ye are. And ye brought us luck. ’Cause ye’re a come-homer. Ye’re my Come-home. Lassie Come-home. That’s thy name! Lassie Comehome!”</p>

        <p>Once it had been like that before. Then it had all stopped. Now it was like that again. What was the reason?</p>
        <p>Joe pondered over this all through the meal that evening. After the meal was over, and Lassie came stalking in, he sank on the rug beside her and stroked her, and he thought he had found the answer.</p>
        <p>It was Lassie! Of course—that was it! When she had been home, things had been right. When she was sold and gone, nothing had gone right anymore.</p>
        <p>And now that she was back, everything was fine again, and they were all very happy.</p>

        <p>He made a crooning sound and pillowed his face in the dog’s ruff. Lassie sighed contentedly.</p>
        <p>Then his mother spoke:</p>

        <p>Joe smiled to himself. He still crooned to the dog.</p>
        <p>“Ye’re a come-home dog, aren’t ye, Lassie?” he crooned.</p>
        <p>“Aye, that ye are. And ye brought us luck. ’Cause ye’re a come-homer. Ye’re my Come-home. Lassie Come-home. That’s thy name! Lassie Comehome!”</p>

Or, if he came in from the raw Yorkshire air boasting of how hungry he was, no longer did his mother’s face take on that frightened, secret look, but instead she would laugh in her merry, plump way and say:</p>
        <p>“My goodness, I don’t know how to keep you full! Where do you put it all?”</p>
        <p>But all the time she was saying it her voice would sound as if she were proud of a son who had such a great appetite, and that was just as it used to be in old times, too.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>No longer did the grownups stop talking when he came in suddenly, nor did the voices go on, lifting and falling in weary argument after he was abed. No longer did his father come home each day, weary and dour and unspeaking, to sit by the fire and gaze into it.</p>
        <p>Instead, the moment his footstep would sound out on the gravel, Mrs. Carraclough would jump up in a great bustle and cry:</p>
        <p>“Look out! Here comes thy father now! Heads up— hot stuff coming!”</p>
        <p>Then she would race from fire to table, whisking steaming tureens and bowls from the oven as if the most important thing in all the world was that they should all be set out in that brief space of time between the sound of his coming and the opening of the door.</p>
        <p>Then she would stand, her arms akimbo, and say:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Hurry up and wash, Sam! Sheep’s head and dumplings tonight—and they don’t wait for no man!”</p>
        <p>That was the way it was—like old times again. And his father, too, sitting at the table, bowing his head to the food and then looking up and saying:</p>

        <p><em>Read the extract below then answer the questions.</em><br><br>
Or, if he came in from the raw Yorkshire air boasting of how hungry he was, no longer did his mother’s face take on that frightened, secret look, but instead she would laugh in her merry, plump way and say:</p>
        <p>“My goodness, I don’t know how to keep you full! Where do you put it all?”</p>
        <p>But all the time she was saying it her voice would sound as if she were proud of a son who had such a great appetite, and that was just as it used to be in old times, too.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>No longer did the grownups stop talking when he came in suddenly, nor did the voices go on, lifting and falling in weary argument after he was abed. No longer did his father come home each day, weary and dour and unspeaking, to sit by the fire and gaze into it.</p>
        <p>Instead, the moment his footstep would sound out on the gravel, Mrs. Carraclough would jump up in a great bustle and cry:</p>
        <p>“Look out! Here comes thy father now! Heads up— hot stuff coming!”</p>
        <p>Then she would race from fire to table, whisking steaming tureens and bowls from the oven as if the most important thing in all the world was that they should all be set out in that brief space of time between the sound of his coming and the opening of the door.</p>
        <p>Then she would stand, her arms akimbo, and say:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Hurry up and wash, Sam! Sheep’s head and dumplings tonight—and they don’t wait for no man!”</p>
        <p>That was the way it was—like old times again. And his father, too, sitting at the table, bowing his head to the food and then looking up and saying:</p>
        <p>“Well, and how’s our Joe been today? Did ye do your lessons good at school?”</p>
        <p>Once it had been like that before. Then it had all stopped. Now it was like that again. What was the reason?</p>
        <p>Joe pondered over this all through the meal that evening. After the meal was over, and Lassie came stalking in, he sank on the rug beside her and stroked her, and he thought he had found the answer.</p>
        <p>It was Lassie! Of course—that was it! When she had been home, things had been right. When she was sold and gone, nothing had gone right anymore.</p>
        <p>And now that she was back, everything was fine again, and they were all very happy.</p>
        <p>“She came home and brought us luck,” he thought.</p>
        <p>“She did it. She came home and brought us luck.”</p>
        <p>He made a crooning sound and pillowed his face in the dog’s ruff. Lassie sighed contentedly.</p>
        <p>Then his mother spoke:</p>
        <p>“Now Joe, don’t lie with that dog all over my rug. Getting hair all over. And what’s making you so silent tonight?”</p>
        <p>Joe smiled to himself. He still crooned to the dog.</p>
        <p>“Ye’re a come-home dog, aren’t ye, Lassie?” he crooned.</p>
        <p>“Aye, that ye are. And ye brought us luck. ’Cause ye’re a come-homer. Ye’re my Come-home. Lassie Come-home. That’s thy name! Lassie Comehome!”</p>

          <strong>TROPICAL MORNING</strong>
        </p>
        <p>I roll over and wake. The light<br>
is like a divorce photograph. And a sharp<br>
bird-note<br>
pierces beneath the verandah’s deep</p>
        <p>frontal lobe. Sit up to face<br>
the sky, an infinite<br>
cruel calm. Trees in this place<br>
feathered bones. And the cliff, a brute</p>
        <p>relic, re-emerging over<br>
tin roofs. This light, with its copious dust<br>
swirling, burrows for cover<br>
indolents. There, underside of a crust,</p>
        <p>one’s sheet. Another alarmed call. That alert<br>
sentry, a weapon in its face, was here:<br>
it came in the verandah’s slit,<br>
and has leapt again on the swollen air.<br>

Fight against animal cruelty</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Animal cruelty, encompassing neglect, abuse, and exploitation across various industries, affects millions globally. Numerous organisations and individuals are dedicated to preventing this mistreatment and advocating for animal rights, emphasising the importance of compassion and respect towards all living beings for a more humane society. <strong>(A)&nbsp;</strong>................. These laws are enforced by organisations like the RSPCA, which investigates abuse cases and rescues animals, with penalties for offenders including fines and imprisonment.</p>
        <p>Various organisations champion animal welfare, including the RSPCA, PETA (focusing on ending animal testing, factory farming, and animal use in entertainment), WWF (protecting endangered species), and the Animal Welfare League (providing shelter and rehoming). <strong>(B)&nbsp;</strong>................. Individuals can contribute by adopting pets, reporting abuse, choosing cruelty-free products and ethically farmed goods, and raising awareness about the issue. Education plays a crucial role in fostering empathy and respect for animals, while stronger legislation and enforcement are necessary to ensure their protection.</p>
        <p>Businesses also have a significant role in ending animal cruelty by adopting cruelty-free policies and ensuring ethical supply chains. Consumers can support these efforts by purchasing certified cruelty-free products and ethically sourced food. <strong>(C)</strong> ................. Public protests and social media campaigns can pressure governments and corporations to improve animal welfare policies. Veterinarians and animal care professionals are vital in preventing and addressing cruelty by providing care and identifying signs of abuse.</p>
        <p>Community involvement through volunteering at shelters and raising awareness locally is also crucial. Addressing the link between animal abuse and other forms of violence, as well as challenging harmful cultural attitudes towards animals, are important aspects of prevention. <strong>(D)&nbsp;</strong>................. International cooperation is essential for tackling global issues like wildlife trafficking, with treaties and organisations working towards worldwide animal welfare. The media and educational institutions also play significant roles in shaping public perception and instilling compassion.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, combating animal cruelty requires a collective effort from individuals, governments, businesses, and organisations. <strong>(E)&nbsp;</strong>................. Strengthening laws, supporting ethical practices, educating future generations, and raising awareness are all vital components of this movement.<br>
Creating a world free from animal cruelty necessitates ongoing commitment and collaboration. <strong>(F)&nbsp;</strong>................. By working together, society can make substantial progress in protecting animals from these types of harm and realising a more compassionate world for all living creatures.</p>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of wood. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
In Māori culture, wood is deeply sacred and spiritually powerful, serving as both a practical material and a vessel of ancestral connection. Known as rākau, wood is central to carving traditions (whakairo), which are not merely decorative but rich in symbolism and genealogy. Māori carvers (tohunga whakairo) use native trees like tōtara, kauri, and rimu to create intricate patterns that tell stories of gods (atua), ancestors (tīpuna), and tribal history. Meeting houses (wharenui) are among the most significant wooden structures in Māori culture. Every part of the wharenui represents a part of an ancestor’s body — the ridgepole as the spine, the rafters as ribs — transforming the building into a living embodiment of tribal lineage. Entering a wharenui is like stepping into a sacred body, where wood, carvings, and memory become one. Wood is also used to craft weapons (taiaha), canoes (waka), and ceremonial objects, each shaped with reverence and accompanied by spiritual rituals. Trees are seen as ancestors themselves, and their felling is often marked by karakia (prayers) to acknowledge their spirit and request safe passage for their transformation. For Māori, wood is not inert — it is living, breathing history. It links past and present, earth and sky, people and gods, carving Māori identity into the heart of the natural world.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of wood. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Even in today’s high-tech world, our modern lifestyle still relies heavily on trees and the materials they provide. Wood, one of the oldest resources used by humans, remains essential in construction, furniture, and everyday products. From the framing of homes and schools to the desks we work at and the flooring beneath our feet, wood offers durability, flexibility, and a lower carbon footprint compared to many synthetic materials — especially when responsibly sourced through sustainable forestry practices. Beyond timber, trees provide countless materials that support daily life. Paper, derived from wood pulp, is used not only for books, notebooks, newspapers, and packaging, but also in tissues, toilet paper, food cartons, and even in specialty uses like filter paper for tea bags and laboratory settings. Despite the digital shift, paper remains vital in education, healthcare, and industry. Tree resins such as rosin and turpentine, extracted from pines, are essential in products like varnishes, soaps, chewing gum, and even violin bows. Trees also contribute to packaging innovations. Cardboard, made from layers of paperboard, is now used in everything from Amazon deliveries to fast-food containers, replacing plastic foam and single-use plastic wraps. New technologies are transforming cellulose — the main component of plant cell walls — into biodegradable plastics, wearable fabrics like lyocell, and even transparent wood for use in windows and solar panels.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of wood. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Trees are logged all over the world to produce paper and other essential materials. The process begins with the careful selection and felling of trees, often from managed forests. While this process supplies many of the materials we rely on daily, it does come with environmental costs. Large-scale logging can lead to deforestation, habitat loss, and reduced biodiversity if not managed sustainably. The production of paper also uses significant amounts of water and energy.<br>
<br>
To reduce these impacts, many paper companies now use recycled paper, plant new trees to replace those cut, and apply cleaner, more efficient manufacturing methods. Still, balancing human needs with environmental protection remains a crucial challenge.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of wood. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Logging, when carried out irresponsibly and on a massive scale, is one of the most destructive forces facing our planet. Entire forests — rich, ancient ecosystems that took centuries to grow — are being reduced to stumps in a matter of days. With each tree felled, we edge closer to ecological collapse. Wildlife is driven out or killed, their habitats destroyed beyond repair. Iconic species such as orangutans, jaguars, and countless insects face extinction, their homes vanishing before they have a chance to adapt or escape. But the damage doesn’t stop there. Trees are vital to absorbing carbon dioxide and regulating Earth’s climate. When they are logged, the carbon they’ve stored for decades is released into the atmosphere, supercharging global warming. The result? More extreme weather, rising seas, and a rapidly changing planet. Ravaged forests leave behind scarred land — dry, eroded, and unable to support life. Rivers choke with mud and chemicals, drinking water is poisoned, and entire communities suffer. If unsustainable logging continues, the Earth’s lungs will be lost — and with them, our future.<br>
