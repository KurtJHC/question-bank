            <strong>History of Moondyne Joe</strong>
          </span>

        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <strong>Joseph Bolitho Johns, better known as Moondyne Joe, was an English convict and Western Australia's best-known bushranger.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <strong>FEBRUARY 1853</strong>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Joseph Bolitho Johns</strong> arrived in Australia aboard the convict ship Pyrenees, facing ten years imprisonment at the Convict Establishment. He had been arrested in Wales and proven guilty of stealing several cheeses, 3 loaves of bread 2 pieces of bacon, part of a shoulder of mutton and a piece of suet. Johns’ good behaviour on the ship meant he was offered his ticket-of-leave upon arrival in Fremantle.</p>
        <p>What is a ticket-of-leave? A convict would receive a ticket of leave if they passed a period of probation with good behaviour. The ticket allowed the prisoner the freedom to seek employment, acquire land, marry, and bring family from overseas to join them. They were not allowed to leave a district without permission, carry firearms or board a ship. Once a ticket of leave prisoner completed half their sentence under these conditions they were entitled to a conditional pardon. This removed all restrictions except the right to leave the colony.</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <strong>1861</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Johns was arrested in Newcastle for illegally branding a brumby and jailed in the&nbsp;<strong>Newcastle Convict Hiring Depot</strong>. The building was old and dilapidated and he easily escaped by taking the horse and the Resident Magistrate’s saddle and bridle.</p>
        <p>He was re-captured days later, and sentenced to “three years penal servitude”, to be served at the forbidding Convict Establishment (now known as&nbsp;<strong>Fremantle Prison</strong>).</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <strong>1865</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Johns is arrested again for “killing an ox with felonious intent” and sentenced to ten years imprisonment back at&nbsp;<strong>Fremantle Prison</strong>. He escaped three times in four months, on the last attempt breaking into Everett’s Store in Newcastle to obtain supplies for a trip to South Australia. He was recaptured only 300kms from Perth.</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <strong>1866</strong>
        </p>
        <p>On his return to&nbsp;<strong>Fremantle Prison</strong>, Johns was subjected to one of Governor Hampton’s “escape proof” cells. This was a 4ft x 7ft cell lined with jarrah planks nailed to the walls with hundreds of metal studs. Three layers of bars were put on the windows and he was handcuffed, wore leg irons and was chained to the floor. Governor Hampton is reputed to have said to Johns on inspection, “If you get out again, I’ll forgive you.” In this tiny cell Johns began to suffer physically and was assigned to “exercise”; breaking stones in the main parade ground of the prison.</p>
        <p>The name “Moondyne Joe” appeared in the press for the first time on 8 August in relation to this escape, cementing Johns into Western Australian history and folklore. Governor Hampton described Joe as an “immense scoundrel.”</p>
        <p>The name “Moondyne” is thought to have originated from Joe’s hiding spot in the Moondyne Hills near Toodyay. Many of the settlers who knew him from this area regarded him as something of a hero for his ability to continuously evade the authorities. It is thought that people like this helped hide and feed him whilst he was on the run.</p>

          <strong>History of Koalas</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Koalas or Koala-like animals probably first evolved on the Australian continent during the period when Australia began to drift slowly northward, gradually separating from the Antarctic land mass some 45 million years ago. Fossil remains of Koala-like animals have been found dating back to 25 million years ago.</p>
        <p>As the climate changed and Australia became drier, vegetation evolved to what we know as eucalyptus, becoming the Koalas food source.</p>
        <p>Australia's Indigenous people are thought to have arrived in Australia 60,000 years ago or more. Koalas, like all Australian animals, were an important part of Aboriginal culture and feature in many of their myths and legends.</p>
        <p>Koalas were a readily available source of food, and they remained abundant after the arrival of Europeans with the First Fleet in 1788.</p>
        <p>John Price was the first European to record Koalas. He described them in his account of a journey into the Blue Mountains near Sydney in 1798. The Koala was given its scientific name, phascolarctos cinereus, meaning 'ash grey pouched bear' in 1816. Subsequently, it was discovered that the Koala was not a bear at all, but a member of a specialised group of mammals called 'marsupials', that give birth to immature young and carry them in a pouch. Today, most marsupials are found in Australia and Papua New Guinea.</p>
        <p>'Koala' is thought to mean 'no drink' in the Aboriginal language, although there are many different languages spoken by Aboriginal people throughout the country. The name for Koala appears in diverse forms in the written accounts of early settlers as&nbsp;cullewine, koolewong, colo, colah, koolah, kaola, Koala, karbor, boorabee,&nbsp;and&nbsp;goribun.</p>
        <p>As the new colony progressed, the clearing of forests for farmland began, and with it the beginning of the loss of habitat to the native animals. European settlers identified the Koala as a source of fur to trade, and in the ensuing years up until the 1930's, millions of Koalas were shot for their pelts.</p>
        <p>By 1924 Koalas were extinct in South Australia, severely depleted in New South Wales, and estimates for Victoria were as low as 500 animals. At this time, the focus of the fur trade moved north to Queensland. In 1919 the Qld Government announced a six month open season on Koalas, and in that period alone, one million Koalas were killed. Although the season officially remained closed until 1927, when the season re-opened, over 800,000 were slaughtered in just over 1 month. Public outrage at the slaughter forced governments in all states to declare the Koala a 'protected species' by the late 1930's. However, no such laws were brought in to protect the gum trees upon which Koalas rely for their food and shelter. This remains a challenge for koalas.</p>

          <strong>History of Koalas</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Koalas or Koala-like animals probably first evolved on the Australian continent during the period when Australia began to drift slowly northward, gradually separating from the Antarctic land mass some 45 million years ago. Fossil remains of Koala-like animals have been found dating back to 25 million years ago.</p>
        <p>As the climate changed and Australia became drier, vegetation evolved to what we know as eucalyptus, becoming the Koalas food source.</p>
        <p>Australia's Indigenous people are thought to have arrived in Australia 60,000 years ago or more. Koalas, like all Australian animals, were an important part of Aboriginal culture and feature in many of their myths and legends.</p>
        <p>Koalas were a readily available source of food, and they remained abundant after the arrival of Europeans with the First Fleet in 1788.</p>
        <p>John Price was the first European to record Koalas. He described them in his account of a journey into the Blue Mountains near Sydney in 1798. The Koala was given its scientific name, phascolarctos cinereus, meaning 'ash grey pouched bear' in 1816. Subsequently, it was discovered that the Koala was not a bear at all, but a member of a specialised group of mammals called 'marsupials', that give birth to immature young and carry them in a pouch. Today, most marsupials are found in Australia and Papua New Guinea.</p>
        <p>'Koala' is thought to mean 'no drink' in the Aboriginal language, although there are many different languages spoken by Aboriginal people throughout the country. The name for Koala appears in diverse forms in the written accounts of early settlers as&nbsp;cullewine, koolewong, colo, colah, koolah, kaola, Koala, karbor, boorabee,&nbsp;and&nbsp;goribun.</p>
        <p>As the new colony progressed, the clearing of forests for farmland began, and with it the beginning of the loss of habitat to the native animals. European settlers identified the Koala as a source of fur to trade, and in the ensuing years up until the 1930's, millions of Koalas were shot for their pelts.</p>
        <p>By 1924 Koalas were extinct in South Australia, severely depleted in New South Wales, and estimates for Victoria were as low as 500 animals. At this time, the focus of the fur trade moved north to Queensland. In 1919 the Qld Government announced a six month open season on Koalas, and in that period alone, one million Koalas were killed. Although the season officially remained closed until 1927, when the season re-opened, over 800,000 were slaughtered in just over 1 month. Public outrage at the slaughter forced governments in all states to declare the Koala a 'protected species' by the late 1930's. However, no such laws were brought in to protect the gum trees upon which Koalas rely for their food and shelter. This remains a challenge for koalas.</p>

          <strong>History of Koalas</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Koalas or Koala-like animals probably first evolved on the Australian continent during the period when Australia began to drift slowly northward, gradually separating from the Antarctic land mass some 45 million years ago. Fossil remains of Koala-like animals have been found dating back to 25 million years ago.</p>
        <p>As the climate changed and Australia became drier, vegetation evolved to what we know as eucalyptus, becoming the Koalas food source.</p>
        <p>Australia's Indigenous people are thought to have arrived in Australia 60,000 years ago or more. Koalas, like all Australian animals, were an important part of Aboriginal culture and feature in many of their myths and legends.</p>
        <p>Koalas were a readily available source of food, and they remained abundant after the arrival of Europeans with the First Fleet in 1788.</p>
        <p>John Price was the first European to record Koalas. He described them in his account of a journey into the Blue Mountains near Sydney in 1798. The Koala was given its scientific name, phascolarctos cinereus, meaning 'ash grey pouched bear' in 1816. Subsequently, it was discovered that the Koala was not a bear at all, but a member of a specialised group of mammals called 'marsupials', that give birth to immature young and carry them in a pouch. Today, most marsupials are found in Australia and Papua New Guinea.</p>
        <p>'Koala' is thought to mean 'no drink' in the Aboriginal language, although there are many different languages spoken by Aboriginal people throughout the country. The name for Koala appears in diverse forms in the written accounts of early settlers as&nbsp;cullewine, koolewong, colo, colah, koolah, kaola, Koala, karbor, boorabee,&nbsp;and&nbsp;goribun.</p>
        <p>As the new colony progressed, the clearing of forests for farmland began, and with it the beginning of the loss of habitat to the native animals. European settlers identified the Koala as a source of fur to trade, and in the ensuing years up until the 1930's, millions of Koalas were shot for their pelts.</p>
        <p>By 1924 Koalas were extinct in South Australia, severely depleted in New South Wales, and estimates for Victoria were as low as 500 animals. At this time, the focus of the fur trade moved north to Queensland. In 1919 the Qld Government announced a six month open season on Koalas, and in that period alone, one million Koalas were killed. Although the season officially remained closed until 1927, when the season re-opened, over 800,000 were slaughtered in just over 1 month. Public outrage at the slaughter forced governments in all states to declare the Koala a 'protected species' by the late 1930's. However, no such laws were brought in to protect the gum trees upon which Koalas rely for their food and shelter. This remains a challenge for koalas.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr"><span class="txt-underline"><strong>NUMBERS</strong></span><br>
By Mary Cornish</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I like the generosity of numbers.<br>
The way, for example,<br>
they are willing to count<br>
anything or anyone:<br>
two pickles, one door to the room,<br>
eight dancers dressed as swans.</p>
        <p>I like the domesticity of addition--<br>
add two cups of milk and stir--<br>
the sense of plenty: six plums<br>
on the ground, three more<br>
falling from the tree.</p>
        <p>And multiplication's school<br>
of fish times fish,<br>
whose silver bodies breed<br>
beneath the shadow<br>
of a boat.</p>
        <p>Even subtraction is never loss,<br>
just addition somewhere else:<br>
five sparrows take away two,<br>
the two in someone else's<br>
garden now.</p>
        <p>There's an amplitude to long division,<br>
as it opens Chinese take-out<br>
box by paper box,<br>
inside every folded cookie<br>
a new fortune.</p>
        <p>And I never fail to be surprised<br>
by the gift of an odd remainder,<br>
footloose at the end:<br>
forty-seven divided by eleven equals four,<br>
with three remaining.</p>
        <p>Three boys beyond their mothers’ call,<br>
Two Italians off to the sea,<br>
One sock that isn’t anywhere you look.</p>

By Mary Cornish</p>

        <p>I like the generosity of numbers.<br>
The way, for example,<br>
they are willing to count<br>
anything or anyone:<br>
two pickles, one door to the room,<br>
eight dancers dressed as swans.</p>
        <p>I like the domesticity of addition--<br>
add two cups of milk and stir--<br>
the sense of plenty: six plums<br>
on the ground, three more<br>
falling from the tree.</p>
        <p>And multiplication's school<br>
of fish times fish,<br>
whose silver bodies breed<br>
beneath the shadow<br>
of a boat.</p>
        <p>Even subtraction is never loss,<br>
just addition somewhere else:<br>
five sparrows take away two,<br>
the two in someone else's<br>
garden now.</p>
        <p>There's an amplitude to long division,<br>
as it opens Chinese take-out<br>
box by paper box,<br>
inside every folded cookie<br>
a new fortune.</p>
        <p>And I never fail to be surprised<br>
by the gift of an odd remainder,<br>
footloose at the end:<br>
forty-seven divided by eleven equals four,<br>
with three remaining.</p>
        <p>Three boys beyond their mothers’ call,<br>
Two Italians off to the sea,<br>
One sock that isn’t anywhere you look.</p>

          <strong>The Merchant of Venice</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <strong>Extract by William Shakespeare<br>
(modern translation)</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The quality of mercy is not strained:</p>
        <p>It drops on to the&nbsp;world as the gentle rain does – from heaven.<br>
It’s doubly blessed. It&nbsp;blesses both the giver and the receiver.<br>
It’s most powerful when granted&nbsp;by those who hold power over others.<br>
It’s more important to a monarch&nbsp;than his crown.<br>
His sceptre shows the level of his temporal power –<br>
the&nbsp;symbol of awe and majesty in which lies the source of the dread and fear&nbsp;that kings command.<br>
But mercy is above that sceptered power. It’s&nbsp;enthroned in the hearts of kings.<br>
It is an attribute of God himself.<br>
And&nbsp;earthly power most closely resembles God’s power when justice is&nbsp;guided by mercy.<br>
Therefore Jew, although justice is your aim, think about&nbsp;this:<br>
none of us would be saved if we depended on justice alone.<br>
We&nbsp;pray for mercy and, in seeking it ourselves, we learn to be merciful.<br>
I’ve&nbsp;spoken about this to soften the justice of your plea.<br>
If you insist on pure&nbsp;justice, however, then this serious Venetian court has no alternative other&nbsp;than to pronounce sentence against the merchant there.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The quality of mercy is not strained:</p>
        <p>It drops on to the&nbsp;world as the gentle rain does – from heaven.<br>
It’s doubly blessed. It&nbsp;blesses both the giver and the receiver.<br>
It’s most powerful when granted&nbsp;by those who hold power over others.<br>
It’s more important to a monarch&nbsp;than his crown.<br>
His sceptre shows the level of his temporal power –<br>
the&nbsp;symbol of awe and majesty in which lies the source of the dread and fear&nbsp;that kings command.<br>
But mercy is above that sceptered power. It’s&nbsp;enthroned in the hearts of kings.<br>
It is an attribute of God himself.<br>
And&nbsp;earthly power most closely resembles God’s power when justice is&nbsp;guided by mercy.<br>
Therefore Jew, although justice is your aim, think about&nbsp;this:<br>
none of us would be saved if we depended on justice alone.<br>
We&nbsp;pray for mercy and, in seeking it ourselves, we learn to be merciful.<br>
I’ve&nbsp;spoken about this to soften the justice of your plea.<br>
If you insist on pure&nbsp;justice, however, then this serious Venetian court has no alternative other&nbsp;than to pronounce sentence against the merchant there.</p>

          <strong>The Merchant of Venice</strong>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The quality of mercy is not strained:</p>
        <p>It drops on to the&nbsp;world as the gentle rain does – from heaven.<br>
It’s doubly blessed. It&nbsp;blesses both the giver and the receiver.<br>
It’s most powerful when granted&nbsp;by those who hold power over others.<br>
It’s more important to a monarch&nbsp;than his crown.<br>
His sceptre shows the level of his temporal power –<br>
the&nbsp;symbol of awe and majesty in which lies the source of the dread and fear&nbsp;that kings command.<br>
But mercy is above that sceptered power. It’s&nbsp;enthroned in the hearts of kings.<br>
It is an attribute of God himself.<br>
And&nbsp;earthly power most closely resembles God’s power when justice is&nbsp;guided by mercy.<br>
Therefore Jew, although justice is your aim, think about&nbsp;this:<br>
none of us would be saved if we depended on justice alone.<br>
We&nbsp;pray for mercy and, in seeking it ourselves, we learn to be merciful.<br>
I’ve&nbsp;spoken about this to soften the justice of your plea.<br>
If you insist on pure&nbsp;justice, however, then this serious Venetian court has no alternative other&nbsp;than to pronounce sentence against the merchant there.</p>

          <strong>With Kit, Age 7, At the Beach</strong>

        <p class="txt-ctr">By William Stafford<br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">We would climb the highest dune,<br>
from there to gaze and come down:<br>
the ocean was performing;<br>
we contributed our climb.<br>
<br>
Waves leapfrogged and came<br>
straight out of the storm.<br>
What should our gaze mean?<br>
Kit waited for me to decide.<br>
<br>
Standing on such a hill,<br>
what would you tell your child?<br>
That was an absolute vista.<br>
Those waves raced far, and cold.<br>
<br>
'How far could you swim, Daddy,<br>
in such a storm?'<br>
'As far as was needed,' I said,<br>
and as I talked, I swam.</p>

He earned the title of world champion an unprecedented 11 times, including a record five times consecutively (1994–98), and he was also the all-time leader in event wins.</p><p>The son of a bait-store proprietor, Slater grew up near the water, and he began&nbsp;surfing&nbsp;at age five. By age 10 he was winning age-division events up and down the Atlantic coast, and in 1984 he won his first age-division&nbsp;United States&nbsp;championship title. Two years later he finished third in the junior division at the world amateur championships in England, and he won the Pacific Cup junior championship in&nbsp;Australia&nbsp;the following year.</p><p>After turning professional in 1990, Slater struggled during his first two years on the professional tour, finishing 90th and 43rd in the world rankings those years. In 1992 he secured podium (top-three) finishes in three of his first five events before winning his first professional tour event, the Rip Curl Pro, in France. His win in that year’s prestigious Pipeline Masters in&nbsp;Hawaii&nbsp;secured his first world title, and at age 20 he became the youngest surfing world champion ever. Slater finished sixth in the 1993 rankings but came back in 1994 to begin a five-year run of complete domination of the world tour, earning the champion’s crown every year between 1994 and 1998. He then took a break from competitive surfing at the end of 1998.</p>
During his years off the world tour, Slater appeared in assorted surf films, television shows, and video games. He returned to the world pro tour in 2002, finished a close second in the world rankings in 2003, and won his first post hiatus championship in 2005. He won his 11th world title in 2011, thereby becoming both the youngest and the oldest surfer to have won the championship.</div>

He earned the title of world champion an unprecedented 11 times, including a record five times consecutively (1994–98), and he was also the all-time leader in event wins.</p><p>The son of a bait-store proprietor, Slater grew up near the water, and he began&nbsp;surfing&nbsp;at age five. By age 10 he was winning age-division events up and down the Atlantic coast, and in 1984 he won his first age-division&nbsp;United States&nbsp;championship title. Two years later he finished third in the junior division at the world amateur championships in England, and he won the Pacific Cup junior championship in&nbsp;Australia&nbsp;the following year.</p><p>After turning professional in 1990, Slater struggled during his first two years on the professional tour, finishing 90th and 43rd in the world rankings those years. In 1992 he secured podium (top-three) finishes in three of his first five events before winning his first professional tour event, the Rip Curl Pro, in France. His win in that year’s prestigious Pipeline Masters in&nbsp;Hawaii&nbsp;secured his first world title, and at age 20 he became the youngest surfing world champion ever. Slater finished sixth in the 1993 rankings but came back in 1994 to begin a five-year run of complete domination of the world tour, earning the champion’s crown every year between 1994 and 1998. He then took a break from competitive surfing at the end of 1998.</p>
During his years off the world tour, Slater appeared in assorted surf films, television shows, and video games. He returned to the world pro tour in 2002, finished a close second in the world rankings in 2003, and won his first post hiatus championship in 2005. He won his 11th world title in 2011, thereby becoming both the youngest and the oldest surfer to have won the championship.</div>
