Native Americans were great inventors. For example, corn was cultivated by ancient farmers 10,000 years ago. Native Americans then taught European colonists to grow the crop. Everybody knows corn, but they don’t know it’s a food that wouldn’t exist without human intervention. Farmers in southern Mexico selectively bred a wild grass, for many generations to enlarge the ear and develop kernels that were soft enough for humans to eat. Later, their invention spread throughout the Western Hemisphere.<br>
<br>
Native American inventions were appropriated by Europeans with their trading networks and manufacturing infrastructure, who sometimes added improvements. For example, rubber was developed by Native Americans, and then Columbus took a rubber ball back to Europe. After Charles Goodyear developed the vulcanisation process in the 1830s to allow rubber to withstand heat and cold, colonisers developed vast rubber tree plantations in Asia to produce the raw material for factories. Now, rubber is used all over the world.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The Inuit in the Arctic developed the concept of a small, narrow boat, with a sealed cockpit to protect the paddler from sinking in the event that the craft capsized. The classic vessels were fashioned entirely from natural materials, with wood or whalebone frames covered by stitched sealskin or other animal hides. Today, the kayaks in use across the world are sometimes built from modern materials such as plastic and carbon fibre, but the design is still essentially the same.<br>

Forty million years ago, horses first emerged in North America, but after migrating to Asia, horses disappeared from this continent at least 10,000 years ago. So, for millennia, Native Americans travelled and hunted on foot, relying on dogs as miniature pack animals.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
When Christopher Columbus brought two dozen horses on his second voyage to the New World in 1493, he couldn’t have imagined how reintroducing the horse to North America would transform Native American life, especially for the buffalo-hunting Plains Indians, for whom the swift and loyal horse was a marriage made in heaven.<br>
<br>
When Columbus and other Spanish explorers arrived in Hispaniola on horseback, the native Taíno of the Caribbean were terrified by what they saw as a half-man, half-beast. They had never seen a creature that had human beings riding on it. As more Native tribes encountered the horse, that initial fear gave way to awe for the animal’s speed and power. With the dog as their closest reference, Indians gave this mythical new creature names like “elk dog”, “sky dog” and “holy dog”. The Spanish quickly realised that the last thing they wanted was for Indians to have horses, because that would put them on equal footing, but that’s exactly what happened.<br>

In the early 1800s, the sovereign Cherokee nation covered a vast region that included northwest Georgia and adjacent land in Tennessee, North Carolina and Alabama. Under the terms of an 1819 treaty, the United States guaranteed that Cherokee land would be off-limits to white settlers forever. Forever lasted less than 20 years. Although the treaty mandated the removal of “all white people who have intruded, or may hereafter intrude, on the lands of the Cherokees,” the United States instead forcibly removed more than 15,000 Cherokees in 1838 and 1839.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
As many as 4,000 died of disease, starvation and exposure during their detention and forced migration through nine states that became known as the “Trail of Tears”. The last of the Cherokee completed the Trail of Tears in March 1839. Decades later, a Confederate soldier who participated in the forced migration recalled, “I fought through the Civil War and saw men shot to pieces and slaughtered by the thousands, but the Cherokee removal was the cruelest work I ever knew.”&nbsp;<br>

Before European contact, the temperate, hospitable California area had more people (+/- 300,000 in 1600’s) than any other. It was also more diverse. Its estimated 100 different tribes and groups spoke more spoke over 200 dialects. In fact, California’s language landscape was more complex than that of Europe.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Despite this great diversity, most native Californians lived very similar lives. They did not practise much agriculture. Instead, they organised themselves into small, family-based bands of hunter-gatherers known as tribelets. Inter-tribelet relationships, based on wellestablished systems of trade and common rights, were generally peaceful.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But although gold spelled prosperity and power for the white settlers who arrived in California in 1849 and after, it meant disaster for the state’s peaceful indigenous population. An estimated 100,000 Native Americans died during the first two years of the Gold Rush alone. Today, despite all odds, California has the United States’ largest Native American population and is home to 109 federally recognised tribes.&nbsp;<br>

          <strong>Doctor Dolittle&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Hugh Lofting&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The parrot, Polynesia, was sitting in the window looking out at the rain and singing a sailor-song to herself. She stopped singing and started to listen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You see, Doctor,” the Cat’s-Meat-Man went on, “you know all about animals - much more than what these vets do. That book you wrote - about cats, why, it’s wonderful! I can’t read or write myself—or maybe I’d write some books. But my wife, Theodosia, she’s a scholar, she is. And she read your book to me. Well, it’s wonderful - that’s all can be said - wonderful. You might have been a cat yourself. You know the way they think. And listen: you can make a lot of money doctoring animals. Do you know that? You see, I’d send all the old women who had sick cats or dogs to you. And if they didn’t get sick fast enough, I could put something in the meat I sell ’em to make ’em sick, see?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Oh, no,” said the Doctor quickly. “You mustn’t do that. That wouldn’t be right.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Oh, I didn’t mean real sick,” answered the Cat’s-meat-Man. “Just a little something to make them droopy-like. But maybe it ain’t quite fair on the animals. But they’ll get sick anyway, because the old women always give ’em too much to eat. And all the farmers round about who had lame horses and weak lambs - they’d come. Be an animal-doctor.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the Cat’s-Meat-Man had gone the parrot flew off the window on to the Doctor’s table and said,</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“That man’s got sense. That’s what you ought to do. Be an animal-doctor. Give the silly people up - if they haven’t brains enough to see you’re the best doctor in the world. Take care of animals instead—they’ll soon find it out. Be an animal-doctor.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Oh, there are plenty of animal-doctors,” said John Dolittle, putting the flower-pots outside on the window-sill to get the rain.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Yes, there are plenty,” said Polynesia. “But none of them are any good at all. Now listen, Doctor, and I’ll tell you something. Did you know that animals can talk?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I know that parrots can talk,” said the Doctor.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Oh, we parrots can talk in two languages - people’s language and bird-language,” said Polynesia proudly. “If I say, ‘Polly wants a cracker,’ you understand me. But hear this: Ka-ka oi-ee, fee-fee?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Good Gracious!” cried the Doctor. “What does that mean?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“That means, ‘Is the porridge hot yet?’ - in bird-language.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“My! You don’t say so!” said the Doctor. “You never talked that way to me before.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“What would have been the good?” said Polynesia, dusting some cracker-crumbs off her left wing. “You wouldn’t have understood me if I had.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Tell me some more,” said the Doctor, all excited; and he rushed over to the dresser-drawer and came back with the butcher’s book and a pencil. “Now don’t go too fast—and I’ll write it down. This is interesting - very interesting - something quite new. Give me the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Birds’ A.B.C</strong></span>. first—slowly now.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So that was the way the Doctor came to know that animals had a language of their own and could talk to one another. And all that afternoon, while it was raining, Polynesia sat on the kitchen table giving him bird words to put down in the book.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After a while, with the parrot’s help, the Doctor got to learn the language of the&nbsp;animals so well that he could talk to them himself and understand everything they said. Then he gave up being a people’s doctor altogether.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As soon as the Cat’s-meat-Man had told everyone that John Dolittle was going to become an animal-doctor, <span class="txt-underline"><strong>old ladies began to bring him their pet pugs and poodles</strong></span> who had eaten too much cake; and farmers came many miles to show him sick cows and sheep.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One day a plough-horse was brought to him; and <span class="txt-underline"><strong>the poor thing was terribly glad to find a man who could talk in horse-language</strong></span>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You know, Doctor,” said the horse, “that vet over the hill knows nothing at all. He has been treating me six weeks now - for spavins. What I need is sun spectacles. I am going blind in one eye. There’s no reason why horses shouldn’t wear glasses, the same as people. But that stupid man over the hill never even looked at my eyes. He kept on giving me big pills. I tried to tell him; but he couldn’t understand a word of horse-language. What I need is sun spectacles.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Of course; of course,” said the Doctor. “I’ll get you some at once.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I would like a pair like yours,” said the horse - “only green. They’ll keep the sun out of my eyes while I’m ploughing the Fifty-Acre Field.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Certainly,” said the Doctor. “Green ones you shall have.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You know, the trouble is, Sir,” said the plough-horse as the Doctor opened the front door to let him out - “the trouble is that anybody thinks he can doctor animals - just because the animals don’t complain. As a matter of fact, it takes a much cleverer man to be a really good animal-doctor than it does to be a good people’s doctor. My farmer’s boy thinks he knows all about horses. I wish you could see him - his face is so fat he looks as though he had no eyes - and he has got as much brain as a potato-bug. When will my sunglasses be ready?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I’ll have them for you next week,” said the Doctor. “Come in again Tuesday—Good morning!”&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Doctor Dolittle&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Hugh Lofting&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The parrot, Polynesia, was sitting in the window looking out at the rain and singing a sailor-song to herself. She stopped singing and started to listen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You see, Doctor,” the Cat’s-Meat-Man went on, “you know all about animals - much more than what these vets do. That book you wrote - about cats, why, it’s wonderful! I can’t read or write myself—or maybe I’d write some books. But my wife, Theodosia, she’s a scholar, she is. And she read your book to me. Well, it’s wonderful - that’s all can be said - wonderful. You might have been a cat yourself. You know the way they think. And listen: you can make a lot of money doctoring animals. Do you know that? You see, I’d send all the old women who had sick cats or dogs to you. And if they didn’t get sick fast enough, I could put something in the meat I sell ’em to make ’em sick, see?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Oh, no,” said the Doctor quickly. “You mustn’t do that. That wouldn’t be right.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Oh, I didn’t mean real sick,” answered the Cat’s-meat-Man. “Just a little something to make them droopy-like. But maybe it ain’t quite fair on the animals. But they’ll get sick anyway, because the old women always give ’em too much to eat. And all the farmers round about who had lame horses and weak lambs - they’d come. Be an animal-doctor.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the Cat’s-Meat-Man had gone the parrot flew off the window on to the Doctor’s table and said,</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“That man’s got sense. That’s what you ought to do. Be an animal-doctor. Give the silly people up - if they haven’t brains enough to see you’re the best doctor in the world. Take care of animals instead—they’ll soon find it out. Be an animal-doctor.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Oh, there are plenty of animal-doctors,” said John Dolittle, putting the flower-pots outside on the window-sill to get the rain.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Yes, there are plenty,” said Polynesia. “But none of them are any good at all. Now listen, Doctor, and I’ll tell you something. Did you know that animals can talk?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I know that parrots can talk,” said the Doctor.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Oh, we parrots can talk in two languages - people’s language and bird-language,” said Polynesia proudly. “If I say, ‘Polly wants a cracker,’ you understand me. But hear this: Ka-ka oi-ee, fee-fee?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Good Gracious!” cried the Doctor. “What does that mean?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“That means, ‘Is the porridge hot yet?’ - in bird-language.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“My! You don’t say so!” said the Doctor. “You never talked that way to me before.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“What would have been the good?” said Polynesia, dusting some cracker-crumbs off her left wing. “You wouldn’t have understood me if I had.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Tell me some more,” said the Doctor, all excited; and he rushed over to the dresser-drawer and came back with the butcher’s book and a pencil. “Now don’t go too fast—and I’ll write it down. This is interesting - very interesting - something quite new. Give me the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Birds’ A.B.C</strong></span>. first—slowly now.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So that was the way the Doctor came to know that animals had a language of their own and could talk to one another. And all that afternoon, while it was raining, Polynesia sat on the kitchen table giving him bird words to put down in the book.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After a while, with the parrot’s help, the Doctor got to learn the language of the&nbsp;animals so well that he could talk to them himself and understand everything they said. Then he gave up being a people’s doctor altogether.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As soon as the Cat’s-meat-Man had told everyone that John Dolittle was going to become an animal-doctor, <span class="txt-underline"><strong>old ladies began to bring him their pet pugs and poodles</strong></span> who had eaten too much cake; and farmers came many miles to show him sick cows and sheep.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One day a plough-horse was brought to him; and <span class="txt-underline"><strong>the poor thing was terribly glad to find a man who could talk in horse-language</strong></span>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You know, Doctor,” said the horse, “that vet over the hill knows nothing at all. He has been treating me six weeks now - for spavins. What I need is sun spectacles. I am going blind in one eye. There’s no reason why horses shouldn’t wear glasses, the same as people. But that stupid man over the hill never even looked at my eyes. He kept on giving me big pills. I tried to tell him; but he couldn’t understand a word of horse-language. What I need is sun spectacles.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Of course; of course,” said the Doctor. “I’ll get you some at once.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I would like a pair like yours,” said the horse - “only green. They’ll keep the sun out of my eyes while I’m ploughing the Fifty-Acre Field.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Certainly,” said the Doctor. “Green ones you shall have.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You know, the trouble is, Sir,” said the plough-horse as the Doctor opened the front door to let him out - “the trouble is that anybody thinks he can doctor animals - just because the animals don’t complain. As a matter of fact, it takes a much cleverer man to be a really good animal-doctor than it does to be a good people’s doctor. My farmer’s boy thinks he knows all about horses. I wish you could see him - his face is so fat he looks as though he had no eyes - and he has got as much brain as a potato-bug. When will my sunglasses be ready?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I’ll have them for you next week,” said the Doctor. “Come in again Tuesday—Good morning!”&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Doctor Dolittle&nbsp;</strong>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The parrot, Polynesia, was sitting in the window looking out at the rain and singing a sailor-song to herself. She stopped singing and started to listen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You see, Doctor,” the Cat’s-Meat-Man went on, “you know all about animals - much more than what these vets do. That book you wrote - about cats, why, it’s wonderful! I can’t read or write myself—or maybe I’d write some books. But my wife, Theodosia, she’s a scholar, she is. And she read your book to me. Well, it’s wonderful - that’s all can be said - wonderful. You might have been a cat yourself. You know the way they think. And listen: you can make a lot of money doctoring animals. Do you know that? You see, I’d send all the old women who had sick cats or dogs to you. And if they didn’t get sick fast enough, I could put something in the meat I sell ’em to make ’em sick, see?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Oh, no,” said the Doctor quickly. “You mustn’t do that. That wouldn’t be right.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Oh, I didn’t mean real sick,” answered the Cat’s-meat-Man. “Just a little something to make them droopy-like. But maybe it ain’t quite fair on the animals. But they’ll get sick anyway, because the old women always give ’em too much to eat. And all the farmers round about who had lame horses and weak lambs - they’d come. Be an animal-doctor.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the Cat’s-Meat-Man had gone the parrot flew off the window on to the Doctor’s table and said,</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“That man’s got sense. That’s what you ought to do. Be an animal-doctor. Give the silly people up - if they haven’t brains enough to see you’re the best doctor in the world. Take care of animals instead—they’ll soon find it out. Be an animal-doctor.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Oh, there are plenty of animal-doctors,” said John Dolittle, putting the flower-pots outside on the window-sill to get the rain.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Yes, there are plenty,” said Polynesia. “But none of them are any good at all. Now listen, Doctor, and I’ll tell you something. Did you know that animals can talk?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I know that parrots can talk,” said the Doctor.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Oh, we parrots can talk in two languages - people’s language and bird-language,” said Polynesia proudly. “If I say, ‘Polly wants a cracker,’ you understand me. But hear this: Ka-ka oi-ee, fee-fee?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Good Gracious!” cried the Doctor. “What does that mean?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“That means, ‘Is the porridge hot yet?’ - in bird-language.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“My! You don’t say so!” said the Doctor. “You never talked that way to me before.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“What would have been the good?” said Polynesia, dusting some cracker-crumbs off her left wing. “You wouldn’t have understood me if I had.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Tell me some more,” said the Doctor, all excited; and he rushed over to the dresser-drawer and came back with the butcher’s book and a pencil. “Now don’t go too fast—and I’ll write it down. This is interesting - very interesting - something quite new. Give me the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Birds’ A.B.C</strong></span>. first—slowly now.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So that was the way the Doctor came to know that animals had a language of their own and could talk to one another. And all that afternoon, while it was raining, Polynesia sat on the kitchen table giving him bird words to put down in the book.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After a while, with the parrot’s help, the Doctor got to learn the language of the&nbsp;animals so well that he could talk to them himself and understand everything they said. Then he gave up being a people’s doctor altogether.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One day a plough-horse was brought to him; and <span class="txt-underline"><strong>the poor thing was terribly glad to find a man who could talk in horse-language</strong></span>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You know, Doctor,” said the horse, “that vet over the hill knows nothing at all. He has been treating me six weeks now - for spavins.

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I would like a pair like yours,” said the horse - “only green. They’ll keep the sun out of my eyes while I’m ploughing the Fifty-Acre Field.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Certainly,” said the Doctor. “Green ones you shall have.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You know, the trouble is, Sir,” said the plough-horse as the Doctor opened the front door to let him out - “the trouble is that anybody thinks he can doctor animals - just because the animals don’t complain.

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I’ll have them for you next week,” said the Doctor. “Come in again Tuesday—Good morning!”&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Doctor Dolittle&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Hugh Lofting&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The parrot, Polynesia, was sitting in the window looking out at the rain and singing a sailor-song to herself. She stopped singing and started to listen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You see, Doctor,” the Cat’s-Meat-Man went on, “you know all about animals - much more than what these vets do. That book you wrote - about cats, why, it’s wonderful! I can’t read or write myself—or maybe I’d write some books. But my wife, Theodosia, she’s a scholar, she is. And she read your book to me. Well, it’s wonderful - that’s all can be said - wonderful. You might have been a cat yourself. You know the way they think. And listen: you can make a lot of money doctoring animals. Do you know that? You see, I’d send all the old women who had sick cats or dogs to you. And if they didn’t get sick fast enough, I could put something in the meat I sell ’em to make ’em sick, see?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Oh, no,” said the Doctor quickly. “You mustn’t do that. That wouldn’t be right.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Oh, I didn’t mean real sick,” answered the Cat’s-meat-Man. “Just a little something to make them droopy-like. But maybe it ain’t quite fair on the animals. But they’ll get sick anyway, because the old women always give ’em too much to eat. And all the farmers round about who had lame horses and weak lambs - they’d come. Be an animal-doctor.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the Cat’s-Meat-Man had gone the parrot flew off the window on to the Doctor’s table and said,</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“That man’s got sense. That’s what you ought to do. Be an animal-doctor. Give the silly people up - if they haven’t brains enough to see you’re the best doctor in the world. Take care of animals instead—they’ll soon find it out. Be an animal-doctor.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Oh, there are plenty of animal-doctors,” said John Dolittle, putting the flower-pots outside on the window-sill to get the rain.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Yes, there are plenty,” said Polynesia. “But none of them are any good at all. Now listen, Doctor, and I’ll tell you something. Did you know that animals can talk?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I know that parrots can talk,” said the Doctor.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Oh, we parrots can talk in two languages - people’s language and bird-language,” said Polynesia proudly. “If I say, ‘Polly wants a cracker,’ you understand me. But hear this: Ka-ka oi-ee, fee-fee?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Good Gracious!” cried the Doctor. “What does that mean?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“That means, ‘Is the porridge hot yet?’ - in bird-language.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“My! You don’t say so!” said the Doctor. “You never talked that way to me before.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“What would have been the good?” said Polynesia, dusting some cracker-crumbs off her left wing. “You wouldn’t have understood me if I had.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Tell me some more,” said the Doctor, all excited; and he rushed over to the dresser-drawer and came back with the butcher’s book and a pencil. “Now don’t go too fast—and I’ll write it down. This is interesting - very interesting - something quite new. Give me the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Birds’ A.B.C</strong></span>. first—slowly now.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So that was the way the Doctor came to know that animals had a language of their own and could talk to one another. And all that afternoon, while it was raining, Polynesia sat on the kitchen table giving him bird words to put down in the book.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After a while, with the parrot’s help, the Doctor got to learn the language of the&nbsp;animals so well that he could talk to them himself and understand everything they said. Then he gave up being a people’s doctor altogether.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As soon as the Cat’s-meat-Man had told everyone that John Dolittle was going to become an animal-doctor, <span class="txt-underline"><strong>old ladies began to bring him their pet pugs and poodles</strong></span> who had eaten too much cake; and farmers came many miles to show him sick cows and sheep.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One day a plough-horse was brought to him; and <span class="txt-underline"><strong>the poor thing was terribly glad to find a man who could talk in horse-language</strong></span>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You know, Doctor,” said the horse, “that vet over the hill knows nothing at all. He has been treating me six weeks now - for spavins. What I need is sun spectacles. I am going blind in one eye. There’s no reason why horses shouldn’t wear glasses, the same as people. But that stupid man over the hill never even looked at my eyes. He kept on giving me big pills. I tried to tell him; but he couldn’t understand a word of horse-language. What I need is sun spectacles.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Of course; of course,” said the Doctor. “I’ll get you some at once.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I would like a pair like yours,” said the horse - “only green. They’ll keep the sun out of my eyes while I’m ploughing the Fifty-Acre Field.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Certainly,” said the Doctor. “Green ones you shall have.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You know, the trouble is, Sir,” said the plough-horse as the Doctor opened the front door to let him out - “the trouble is that anybody thinks he can doctor animals - just because the animals don’t complain. As a matter of fact, it takes a much cleverer man to be a really good animal-doctor than it does to be a good people’s doctor. My farmer’s boy thinks he knows all about horses. I wish you could see him - his face is so fat he looks as though he had no eyes - and he has got as much brain as a potato-bug. When will my sunglasses be ready?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I’ll have them for you next week,” said the Doctor. “Come in again Tuesday—Good morning!”&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After a while, with the parrot’s help, the Doctor got to learn the language of the&nbsp;animals so well that he could talk to them himself and understand everything they said. Then he gave up being a people’s doctor altogether.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As soon as the Cat’s-meat-Man had told everyone that John Dolittle was going to become an animal-doctor, <span class="txt-underline"><strong>old ladies began to bring him their pet pugs and poodles</strong></span> who had eaten too much cake; and farmers came many miles to show him sick cows and sheep.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One day a plough-horse was brought to him; and <span class="txt-underline"><strong>the poor thing was terribly glad to find a man who could talk in horse-language</strong></span>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You know, Doctor,” said the horse, “that vet over the hill knows nothing at all. He has been treating me six weeks now - for spavins. What I need is sun spectacles. I am going blind in one eye. There’s no reason why horses shouldn’t wear glasses, the same as people. But that stupid man over the hill never even looked at my eyes. He kept on giving me big pills. I tried to tell him; but he couldn’t understand a word of horse-language. What I need is sun spectacles.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Of course; of course,” said the Doctor. “I’ll get you some at once.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I would like a pair like yours,” said the horse - “only green. They’ll keep the sun out of my eyes while I’m ploughing the Fifty-Acre Field.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Certainly,” said the Doctor. “Green ones you shall have.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You know, the trouble is, Sir,” said the plough-horse as the Doctor opened the front door to let him out - “the trouble is that anybody thinks he can doctor animals - just because the animals don’t complain. As a matter of fact, it takes a much cleverer man to be a really good animal-doctor than it does to be a good people’s doctor. My farmer’s boy thinks he knows all about horses. I wish you could see him - his face is so fat he looks as though he had no eyes - and he has got as much brain as a potato-bug. When will my sunglasses be ready?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I’ll have them for you next week,” said the Doctor. “Come in again Tuesday—Good morning!”&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Doctor Dolittle&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Hugh Lofting&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The parrot, Polynesia, was sitting in the window looking out at the rain and singing a sailor-song to herself. She stopped singing and started to listen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You see, Doctor,” the Cat’s-Meat-Man went on, “you know all about animals - much more than what these vets do. That book you wrote - about cats, why, it’s wonderful! I can’t read or write myself—or maybe I’d write some books. But my wife, Theodosia, she’s a scholar, she is. And she read your book to me. Well, it’s wonderful - that’s all can be said - wonderful. You might have been a cat yourself. You know the way they think. And listen: you can make a lot of money doctoring animals. Do you know that? You see, I’d send all the old women who had sick cats or dogs to you. And if they didn’t get sick fast enough, I could put something in the meat I sell ’em to make ’em sick, see?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Oh, no,” said the Doctor quickly. “You mustn’t do that. That wouldn’t be right.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Oh, I didn’t mean real sick,” answered the Cat’s-meat-Man. “Just a little something to make them droopy-like. But maybe it ain’t quite fair on the animals. But they’ll get sick anyway, because the old women always give ’em too much to eat. And all the farmers round about who had lame horses and weak lambs - they’d come. Be an animal-doctor.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the Cat’s-Meat-Man had gone the parrot flew off the window on to the Doctor’s table and said,</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“That man’s got sense. That’s what you ought to do. Be an animal-doctor. Give the silly people up - if they haven’t brains enough to see you’re the best doctor in the world. Take care of animals instead—they’ll soon find it out. Be an animal-doctor.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Oh, there are plenty of animal-doctors,” said John Dolittle, putting the flower-pots outside on the window-sill to get the rain.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Yes, there are plenty,” said Polynesia. “But none of them are any good at all. Now listen, Doctor, and I’ll tell you something. Did you know that animals can talk?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I know that parrots can talk,” said the Doctor.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Oh, we parrots can talk in two languages - people’s language and bird-language,” said Polynesia proudly. “If I say, ‘Polly wants a cracker,’ you understand me. But hear this: Ka-ka oi-ee, fee-fee?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Good Gracious!” cried the Doctor. “What does that mean?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“That means, ‘Is the porridge hot yet?’ - in bird-language.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“My! You don’t say so!” said the Doctor. “You never talked that way to me before.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“What would have been the good?” said Polynesia, dusting some cracker-crumbs off her left wing. “You wouldn’t have understood me if I had.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Tell me some more,” said the Doctor, all excited; and he rushed over to the dresser-drawer and came back with the butcher’s book and a pencil. “Now don’t go too fast—and I’ll write it down. This is interesting - very interesting - something quite new. Give me the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Birds’ A.B.C</strong></span>. first—slowly now.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So that was the way the Doctor came to know that animals had a language of their own and could talk to one another. And all that afternoon, while it was raining, Polynesia sat on the kitchen table giving him bird words to put down in the book.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After a while, with the parrot’s help, the Doctor got to learn the language of the&nbsp;animals so well that he could talk to them himself and understand everything they said. Then he gave up being a people’s doctor altogether.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As soon as the Cat’s-meat-Man had told everyone that John Dolittle was going to become an animal-doctor, <span class="txt-underline"><strong>old ladies began to bring him their pet pugs and poodles</strong></span> who had eaten too much cake; and farmers came many miles to show him sick cows and sheep.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One day a plough-horse was brought to him; and <span class="txt-underline"><strong>the poor thing was terribly glad to find a man who could talk in horse-language</strong></span>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You know, Doctor,” said the horse, “that vet over the hill knows nothing at all. He has been treating me six weeks now - for spavins. What I need is sun spectacles. I am going blind in one eye. There’s no reason why horses shouldn’t wear glasses, the same as people. But that stupid man over the hill never even looked at my eyes. He kept on giving me big pills. I tried to tell him; but he couldn’t understand a word of horse-language. What I need is sun spectacles.”</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Certainly,” said the Doctor. “Green ones you shall have.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You know, the trouble is, Sir,” said the plough-horse as the Doctor opened the front door to let him out - “the trouble is that anybody thinks he can doctor animals - just because the animals don’t complain.

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The parrot, Polynesia, was sitting in the window looking out at the rain and singing a sailor-song to herself. She stopped singing and started to listen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You see, Doctor,” the Cat’s-Meat-Man went on, “you know all about animals - much more than what these vets do. That book you wrote - about cats, why, it’s wonderful! I can’t read or write myself—or maybe I’d write some books. But my wife, Theodosia, she’s a scholar, she is. And she read your book to me. Well, it’s wonderful - that’s all can be said - wonderful. You might have been a cat yourself. You know the way they think. And listen: you can make a lot of money doctoring animals. Do you know that? You see, I’d send all the old women who had sick cats or dogs to you. And if they didn’t get sick fast enough, I could put something in the meat I sell ’em to make ’em sick, see?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Oh, no,” said the Doctor quickly. “You mustn’t do that. That wouldn’t be right.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Oh, I didn’t mean real sick,” answered the Cat’s-meat-Man. “Just a little something to make them droopy-like. But maybe it ain’t quite fair on the animals. But they’ll get sick anyway, because the old women always give ’em too much to eat. And all the farmers round about who had lame horses and weak lambs - they’d come. Be an animal-doctor.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the Cat’s-Meat-Man had gone the parrot flew off the window on to the Doctor’s table and said,</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“That man’s got sense. That’s what you ought to do. Be an animal-doctor. Give the silly people up - if they haven’t brains enough to see you’re the best doctor in the world. Take care of animals instead—they’ll soon find it out. Be an animal-doctor.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Oh, there are plenty of animal-doctors,” said John Dolittle, putting the flower-pots outside on the window-sill to get the rain.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Yes, there are plenty,” said Polynesia. “But none of them are any good at all. Now listen, Doctor, and I’ll tell you something. Did you know that animals can talk?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I know that parrots can talk,” said the Doctor.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Oh, we parrots can talk in two languages - people’s language and bird-language,” said Polynesia proudly. “If I say, ‘Polly wants a cracker,’ you understand me. But hear this: Ka-ka oi-ee, fee-fee?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Good Gracious!” cried the Doctor. “What does that mean?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“That means, ‘Is the porridge hot yet?’ - in bird-language.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“My! You don’t say so!” said the Doctor. “You never talked that way to me before.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“What would have been the good?” said Polynesia, dusting some cracker-crumbs off her left wing. “You wouldn’t have understood me if I had.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Tell me some more,” said the Doctor, all excited; and he rushed over to the dresser-drawer and came back with the butcher’s book and a pencil. “Now don’t go too fast—and I’ll write it down. This is interesting - very interesting - something quite new. Give me the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Birds’ A.B.C</strong></span>. first—slowly now.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So that was the way the Doctor came to know that animals had a language of their own and could talk to one another. And all that afternoon, while it was raining, Polynesia sat on the kitchen table giving him bird words to put down in the book.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After a while, with the parrot’s help, the Doctor got to learn the language of the&nbsp;animals so well that he could talk to them himself and understand everything they said. Then he gave up being a people’s doctor altogether.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As soon as the Cat’s-meat-Man had told everyone that John Dolittle was going to become an animal-doctor, <span class="txt-underline"><strong>old ladies began to bring him their pet pugs and poodles</strong></span> who had eaten too much cake; and farmers came many miles to show him sick cows and sheep.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One day a plough-horse was brought to him; and <span class="txt-underline"><strong>the poor thing was terribly glad to find a man who could talk in horse-language</strong></span>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You know, Doctor,” said the horse, “that vet over the hill knows nothing at all. He has been treating me six weeks now - for spavins. What I need is sun spectacles. I am going blind in one eye. There’s no reason why horses shouldn’t wear glasses, the same as people. But that stupid man over the hill never even looked at my eyes. He kept on giving me big pills. I tried to tell him; but he couldn’t understand a word of horse-language. What I need is sun spectacles.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Of course; of course,” said the Doctor. “I’ll get you some at once.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I would like a pair like yours,” said the horse - “only green. They’ll keep the sun out of my eyes while I’m ploughing the Fifty-Acre Field.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Certainly,” said the Doctor. “Green ones you shall have.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You know, the trouble is, Sir,” said the plough-horse as the Doctor opened the front door to let him out - “the trouble is that anybody thinks he can doctor animals - just because the animals don’t complain. As a matter of fact, it takes a much cleverer man to be a really good animal-doctor than it does to be a good people’s doctor. My farmer’s boy thinks he knows all about horses. I wish you could see him - his face is so fat he looks as though he had no eyes - and he has got as much brain as a potato-bug. When will my sunglasses be ready?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I’ll have them for you next week,” said the Doctor. “Come in again Tuesday—Good morning!”&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Oh, there are plenty of animal-doctors,” said John Dolittle, putting the flower-pots outside on the window-sill to get the rain.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Duck Creek&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A name that played&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the mind like water –&nbsp;</p>
        <p>through years of living in suburbs&nbsp;</p>
        <p>and a city whose rivers&nbsp;</p>
        <p>grew dark with each ebb:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>remembering paperbarks and she-oaks&nbsp;</p>
        <p>that lined its banks&nbsp;</p>
        <p>and the scent of eucalypts descending&nbsp;</p>
        <p>over bulrushes and Jensen Park.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Tortoises were found there.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Blue-tongue lizards&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And rabbits, magpies&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And noisy mudlarks –&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A host of insects whose names&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Escaped or died&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When the land was cleared,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Pipes laid and factories rose.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Today only the Willy-wagtails remain.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Childhood was in a backyard&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Overlooking its winding path,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>dreams at play in a vegetable garden&nbsp;</p>
        <p>and fruit trees of apples&nbsp;</p>
        <p>and blood-plums,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>a long-winged crane&nbsp;</p>
        <p>that slowly rose over Duck Creek’s&nbsp;</p>
        <p>cloud of leaves&nbsp;</p>
        <p>like an ancient god –&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>to settle at dusk on shores of a sea&nbsp;</p>
        <p>where human beings had never trod.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Penrith Panthers take the NRL Grand Final&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Penrith Panthers have won a thrilling NRL 2021 Grand Final at Lang Park, Queensland, beating South Sydney Rabbitohs 14-12. They led 8-6 at half-time and held on after a frantic contest. The game was played at a tremendous tempo that captivated the 39,322- strong, COVID-limited Lang Park crowd. <strong>15 ………. </strong>He won the Clive Churchill Medal for best on ground, off the back of a tremendous kicking display. "This doesn't even feel real. I'm pinching myself," Cleary told ABC Sport after the game.</p>
        <p>Despite playing an NRL grand final in Brisbane for the first time, fans of both sides packed the stands at either end. The flag-waving masses helped to create a tremendous atmosphere. It is Penrith's first premiership since 2003 and third overall, and scenes of jubilation greeted the final whistle —both in the stands and on the field. <strong>16 ………. </strong>"The loss in the grand final last year really hurt," Ivan Cleary told ABC after the game. "It's one thing to say you want to make up for it, but it's so hard to get back here. It wasn't going to be anything other than a win that we'd be satisfied with tonight."</p>
        <p>Souths, having beaten Penrith in the first week of the finals, were supposed to benefit from the extra rest their 16-10 victory in that game earned them. However, the Panthers were relentless in both defence and attack. They rushed to the line and forced the Rabbitohs back with huge hit after huge hit. <strong>17 ……….</strong> Penrith swarmed the Rabbitohs in defence, forcing Souths into energy-sapping runs away from their own in-goal area, that would eventually tell.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the opening 10 minutes, the Panthers forced two goal-line restarts off the back of some immaculate kicking by Cleary. A third resulted in the opening try of the game. Matt Burton ran onto a perfect Jarome Luai pass to burst through a massive hole in the Souths defence. South Sydney were drained by the repeat sets and bewildered by an excellent lead run by Liam Martin. Matt Burton opened the scoring in the 16th minute of the match. Cody Walker hit back almost instantly with a stunning solo try. <strong>18 ……….</strong> Souths might have been denied territory, but Cody Walker ignored that, to capitalise with one of the Rabbitohs' only entries into the Panthers 20. He ran onto an Adam Reynolds pass before cruising past three despairing Panthers. He included a dismissive shove on Cleary before accelerating past Dylan Edwards to score a wonderful solo try. Cleary and Reynolds exchanged penalty goals either side of half-time. This left the sides locked at 8-8 for the majority of an excruciatingly tight second half.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The tightness and tension of the occasion demanded that any mistakes be brutally punished — and it looked like that mistake would be Walker's. His floating pass wide was intercepted by Stephen Crichton, who romped home from 40 metres out. <strong>19 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>Stephen Crichton intercept try in the 67th minute proved the difference. Souths then threw caution to the wind and scored a sensational try through Alex Johnston, having moved the ball nicely down their left side through quick hands by Walker and Dane Gagai. Reynolds would have backed himself to nail the conversion from the sideline, as he has done on countless occasions, but it went wide by the narrowest of margins in the tightest of grand finals.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Adam Reynolds looked dejected after missing a cruel field goal to level the score. "Sorry we couldn't get the job done tonight," the Brisbane-bound half player said, afterwards. <strong>20 ………. </strong>He paid credit to the five injured players in the side. "This finals series, we had five blokes who wouldn't normally play ... the bravery of these boys is amazing," he said.&nbsp;</p>

Penrith Panthers have won a thrilling NRL 2021 Grand Final at Lang Park, Queensland, beating South Sydney Rabbitohs 14-12. They led 8-6 at half-time and held on after a frantic contest. The game was played at a tremendous tempo that captivated the 39,322- strong, COVID-limited Lang Park crowd. <strong>15 ………. </strong>He won the Clive Churchill Medal for best on ground, off the back of a tremendous kicking display. "This doesn't even feel real. I'm pinching myself," Cleary told ABC Sport after the game.</p>
        <p>Despite playing an NRL grand final in Brisbane for the first time, fans of both sides packed the stands at either end. The flag-waving masses helped to create a tremendous atmosphere. It is Penrith's first premiership since 2003 and third overall, and scenes of jubilation greeted the final whistle —both in the stands and on the field. <strong>16 ………. </strong>"The loss in the grand final last year really hurt," Ivan Cleary told ABC after the game. "It's one thing to say you want to make up for it, but it's so hard to get back here. It wasn't going to be anything other than a win that we'd be satisfied with tonight."</p>
        <p>Souths, having beaten Penrith in the first week of the finals, were supposed to benefit from the extra rest their 16-10 victory in that game earned them. However, the Panthers were relentless in both defence and attack. They rushed to the line and forced the Rabbitohs back with huge hit after huge hit. <strong>17 ……….</strong> Penrith swarmed the Rabbitohs in defence, forcing Souths into energy-sapping runs away from their own in-goal area, that would eventually tell.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the opening 10 minutes, the Panthers forced two goal-line restarts off the back of some immaculate kicking by Cleary. A third resulted in the opening try of the game. Matt Burton ran onto a perfect Jarome Luai pass to burst through a massive hole in the Souths defence. South Sydney were drained by the repeat sets and bewildered by an excellent lead run by Liam Martin. Matt Burton opened the scoring in the 16th minute of the match. Cody Walker hit back almost instantly with a stunning solo try. <strong>18 ……….</strong> Souths might have been denied territory, but Cody Walker ignored that, to capitalise with one of the Rabbitohs' only entries into the Panthers 20. He ran onto an Adam Reynolds pass before cruising past three despairing Panthers. He included a dismissive shove on Cleary before accelerating past Dylan Edwards to score a wonderful solo try. Cleary and Reynolds exchanged penalty goals either side of half-time. This left the sides locked at 8-8 for the majority of an excruciatingly tight second half.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The tightness and tension of the occasion demanded that any mistakes be brutally punished — and it looked like that mistake would be Walker's. His floating pass wide was intercepted by Stephen Crichton, who romped home from 40 metres out. <strong>19 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>Stephen Crichton intercept try in the 67th minute proved the difference. Souths then threw caution to the wind and scored a sensational try through Alex Johnston, having moved the ball nicely down their left side through quick hands by Walker and Dane Gagai. Reynolds would have backed himself to nail the conversion from the sideline, as he has done on countless occasions, but it went wide by the narrowest of margins in the tightest of grand finals.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Adam Reynolds looked dejected after missing a cruel field goal to level the score. "Sorry we couldn't get the job done tonight," the Brisbane-bound half player said, afterwards. <strong>20 ………. </strong>He paid credit to the five injured players in the side. "This finals series, we had five blokes who wouldn't normally play ... the bravery of these boys is amazing," he said.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Penrith Panthers take the NRL Grand Final&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Penrith Panthers have won a thrilling NRL 2021 Grand Final at Lang Park, Queensland, beating South Sydney Rabbitohs 14-12. They led 8-6 at half-time and held on after a frantic contest. The game was played at a tremendous tempo that captivated the 39,322- strong, COVID-limited Lang Park crowd. <strong>15 ………. </strong>He won the Clive Churchill Medal for best on ground, off the back of a tremendous kicking display. "This doesn't even feel real. I'm pinching myself," Cleary told ABC Sport after the game.</p>
        <p>Despite playing an NRL grand final in Brisbane for the first time, fans of both sides packed the stands at either end. The flag-waving masses helped to create a tremendous atmosphere. It is Penrith's first premiership since 2003 and third overall, and scenes of jubilation greeted the final whistle —both in the stands and on the field. <strong>16 ………. </strong>"The loss in the grand final last year really hurt," Ivan Cleary told ABC after the game. "It's one thing to say you want to make up for it, but it's so hard to get back here. It wasn't going to be anything other than a win that we'd be satisfied with tonight."</p>
        <p>Souths, having beaten Penrith in the first week of the finals, were supposed to benefit from the extra rest their 16-10 victory in that game earned them. However, the Panthers were relentless in both defence and attack. They rushed to the line and forced the Rabbitohs back with huge hit after huge hit. <strong>17 ……….</strong> Penrith swarmed the Rabbitohs in defence, forcing Souths into energy-sapping runs away from their own in-goal area, that would eventually tell.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the opening 10 minutes, the Panthers forced two goal-line restarts off the back of some immaculate kicking by Cleary. A third resulted in the opening try of the game. Matt Burton ran onto a perfect Jarome Luai pass to burst through a massive hole in the Souths defence. South Sydney were drained by the repeat sets and bewildered by an excellent lead run by Liam Martin. Matt Burton opened the scoring in the 16th minute of the match. Cody Walker hit back almost instantly with a stunning solo try. <strong>18 ……….</strong> Souths might have been denied territory, but Cody Walker ignored that, to capitalise with one of the Rabbitohs' only entries into the Panthers 20. He ran onto an Adam Reynolds pass before cruising past three despairing Panthers. He included a dismissive shove on Cleary before accelerating past Dylan Edwards to score a wonderful solo try. Cleary and Reynolds exchanged penalty goals either side of half-time. This left the sides locked at 8-8 for the majority of an excruciatingly tight second half.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The tightness and tension of the occasion demanded that any mistakes be brutally punished — and it looked like that mistake would be Walker's. His floating pass wide was intercepted by Stephen Crichton, who romped home from 40 metres out. <strong>19 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>Stephen Crichton intercept try in the 67th minute proved the difference. Souths then threw caution to the wind and scored a sensational try through Alex Johnston, having moved the ball nicely down their left side through quick hands by Walker and Dane Gagai. Reynolds would have backed himself to nail the conversion from the sideline, as he has done on countless occasions, but it went wide by the narrowest of margins in the tightest of grand finals.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Adam Reynolds looked dejected after missing a cruel field goal to level the score. "Sorry we couldn't get the job done tonight," the Brisbane-bound half player said, afterwards. <strong>20 ………. </strong>He paid credit to the five injured players in the side. "This finals series, we had five blokes who wouldn't normally play ... the bravery of these boys is amazing," he said.&nbsp;</p>

South Sydney were drained by the repeat sets and bewildered by an excellent lead run by Liam Martin. Matt Burton opened the scoring in the 16th minute of the match. Cody Walker hit back almost instantly with a stunning solo try. <strong>18 ……….</strong> Souths might have been denied territory, but Cody Walker ignored that, to capitalise with one of the Rabbitohs' only entries into the Panthers 20. He ran onto an Adam Reynolds pass before cruising past three despairing Panthers. He included a dismissive shove on Cleary before accelerating past Dylan Edwards to score a wonderful solo try. Cleary and Reynolds exchanged penalty goals either side of half-time. This left the sides locked at 8-8 for the majority of an excruciatingly tight second half.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The tightness and tension of the occasion demanded that any mistakes be brutally punished — and it looked like that mistake would be Walker's. His floating pass wide was intercepted by Stephen Crichton, who romped home from 40 metres out. <strong>19 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>Stephen Crichton intercept try in the 67th minute proved the difference. Souths then threw caution to the wind and scored a sensational try through Alex Johnston, having moved the ball nicely down their left side through quick hands by Walker and Dane Gagai. Reynolds would have backed himself to nail the conversion from the sideline, as he has done on countless occasions, but it went wide by the narrowest of margins in the tightest of grand finals.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Adam Reynolds looked dejected after missing a cruel field goal to level the score. "Sorry we couldn't get the job done tonight," the Brisbane-bound half player said, afterwards. <strong>20 ………. </strong>He paid credit to the five injured players in the side. "This finals series, we had five blokes who wouldn't normally play ... the bravery of these boys is amazing," he said.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Penrith Panthers take the NRL Grand Final&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Penrith Panthers have won a thrilling NRL 2021 Grand Final at Lang Park, Queensland, beating South Sydney Rabbitohs 14-12. They led 8-6 at half-time and held on after a frantic contest. The game was played at a tremendous tempo that captivated the 39,322- strong, COVID-limited Lang Park crowd. <strong>15 ………. </strong>He won the Clive Churchill Medal for best on ground, off the back of a tremendous kicking display. "This doesn't even feel real. I'm pinching myself," Cleary told ABC Sport after the game.</p>
        <p>Despite playing an NRL grand final in Brisbane for the first time, fans of both sides packed the stands at either end. The flag-waving masses helped to create a tremendous atmosphere. It is Penrith's first premiership since 2003 and third overall, and scenes of jubilation greeted the final whistle —both in the stands and on the field. <strong>16 ………. </strong>"The loss in the grand final last year really hurt," Ivan Cleary told ABC after the game. "It's one thing to say you want to make up for it, but it's so hard to get back here. It wasn't going to be anything other than a win that we'd be satisfied with tonight."</p>
        <p>Souths, having beaten Penrith in the first week of the finals, were supposed to benefit from the extra rest their 16-10 victory in that game earned them. However, the Panthers were relentless in both defence and attack. They rushed to the line and forced the Rabbitohs back with huge hit after huge hit. <strong>17 ……….</strong> Penrith swarmed the Rabbitohs in defence, forcing Souths into energy-sapping runs away from their own in-goal area, that would eventually tell.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the opening 10 minutes, the Panthers forced two goal-line restarts off the back of some immaculate kicking by Cleary. A third resulted in the opening try of the game. Matt Burton ran onto a perfect Jarome Luai pass to burst through a massive hole in the Souths defence. South Sydney were drained by the repeat sets and bewildered by an excellent lead run by Liam Martin. Matt Burton opened the scoring in the 16th minute of the match. Cody Walker hit back almost instantly with a stunning solo try. <strong>18 ……….</strong> Souths might have been denied territory, but Cody Walker ignored that, to capitalise with one of the Rabbitohs' only entries into the Panthers 20. He ran onto an Adam Reynolds pass before cruising past three despairing Panthers. He included a dismissive shove on Cleary before accelerating past Dylan Edwards to score a wonderful solo try. Cleary and Reynolds exchanged penalty goals either side of half-time. This left the sides locked at 8-8 for the majority of an excruciatingly tight second half.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The tightness and tension of the occasion demanded that any mistakes be brutally punished — and it looked like that mistake would be Walker's. His floating pass wide was intercepted by Stephen Crichton, who romped home from 40 metres out. <strong>19 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Native Americans were great inventors. For example, corn was cultivated by ancient farmers 10,000 years ago. Native Americans then taught European colonists to grow the crop. Everybody knows corn, but they don’t know it’s a food that wouldn’t exist without human intervention. Farmers in southern Mexico selectively bred a wild grass, for many generations to enlarge the ear and develop kernels that were soft enough for humans to eat. Later, their invention spread throughout the Western Hemisphere.<br>
<br>
Native American inventions were appropriated by Europeans with their trading networks and manufacturing infrastructure, who sometimes added improvements. For example, rubber was developed by Native Americans, and then Columbus took a rubber ball back to Europe. After Charles Goodyear developed the vulcanisation process in the 1830s to allow rubber to withstand heat and cold, colonisers developed vast rubber tree plantations in Asia to produce the raw material for factories. Now, rubber is used all over the world.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The Inuit in the Arctic developed the concept of a small, narrow boat, with a sealed cockpit to protect the paddler from sinking in the event that the craft capsized. The classic vessels were fashioned entirely from natural materials, with wood or whalebone frames covered by stitched sealskin or other animal hides. Today, the kayaks in use across the world are sometimes built from modern materials such as plastic and carbon fibre, but the design is still essentially the same.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Forty million years ago, horses first emerged in North America, but after migrating to Asia, horses disappeared from this continent at least 10,000 years ago. So, for millennia, Native Americans travelled and hunted on foot, relying on dogs as miniature pack animals.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
When Christopher Columbus brought two dozen horses on his second voyage to the New World in 1493, he couldn’t have imagined how reintroducing the horse to North America would transform Native American life, especially for the buffalo-hunting Plains Indians, for whom the swift and loyal horse was a marriage made in heaven.<br>
<br>
When Columbus and other Spanish explorers arrived in Hispaniola on horseback, the native Taíno of the Caribbean were terrified by what they saw as a half-man, half-beast. They had never seen a creature that had human beings riding on it. As more Native tribes encountered the horse, that initial fear gave way to awe for the animal’s speed and power. With the dog as their closest reference, Indians gave this mythical new creature names like “elk dog”, “sky dog” and “holy dog”. The Spanish quickly realised that the last thing they wanted was for Indians to have horses, because that would put them on equal footing, but that’s exactly what happened.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
In the early 1800s, the sovereign Cherokee nation covered a vast region that included northwest Georgia and adjacent land in Tennessee, North Carolina and Alabama. Under the terms of an 1819 treaty, the United States guaranteed that Cherokee land would be off-limits to white settlers forever. Forever lasted less than 20 years. Although the treaty mandated the removal of “all white people who have intruded, or may hereafter intrude, on the lands of the Cherokees,” the United States instead forcibly removed more than 15,000 Cherokees in 1838 and 1839.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
As many as 4,000 died of disease, starvation and exposure during their detention and forced migration through nine states that became known as the “Trail of Tears”. The last of the Cherokee completed the Trail of Tears in March 1839. Decades later, a Confederate soldier who participated in the forced migration recalled, “I fought through the Civil War and saw men shot to pieces and slaughtered by the thousands, but the Cherokee removal was the cruelest work I ever knew.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Before European contact, the temperate, hospitable California area had more people (+/- 300,000 in 1600’s) than any other. It was also more diverse. Its estimated 100 different tribes and groups spoke more spoke over 200 dialects. In fact, California’s language landscape was more complex than that of Europe.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Despite this great diversity, most native Californians lived very similar lives. They did not practise much agriculture. Instead, they organised themselves into small, family-based bands of hunter-gatherers known as tribelets. Inter-tribelet relationships, based on wellestablished systems of trade and common rights, were generally peaceful.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But although gold spelled prosperity and power for the white settlers who arrived in California in 1849 and after, it meant disaster for the state’s peaceful indigenous population. An estimated 100,000 Native Americans died during the first two years of the Gold Rush alone. Today, despite all odds, California has the United States’ largest Native American population and is home to 109 federally recognised tribes.&nbsp;<br>

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Native Americans were great inventors. For example, corn was cultivated by ancient farmers 10,000 years ago. Native Americans then taught European colonists to grow the crop. Everybody knows corn, but they don’t know it’s a food that wouldn’t exist without human intervention. Farmers in southern Mexico selectively bred a wild grass, for many generations to enlarge the ear and develop kernels that were soft enough for humans to eat. Later, their invention spread throughout the Western Hemisphere.<br>
<br>
Native American inventions were appropriated by Europeans with their trading networks and manufacturing infrastructure, who sometimes added improvements. For example, rubber was developed by Native Americans, and then Columbus took a rubber ball back to Europe. After Charles Goodyear developed the vulcanisation process in the 1830s to allow rubber to withstand heat and cold, colonisers developed vast rubber tree plantations in Asia to produce the raw material for factories. Now, rubber is used all over the world.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The Inuit in the Arctic developed the concept of a small, narrow boat, with a sealed cockpit to protect the paddler from sinking in the event that the craft capsized. The classic vessels were fashioned entirely from natural materials, with wood or whalebone frames covered by stitched sealskin or other animal hides. Today, the kayaks in use across the world are sometimes built from modern materials such as plastic and carbon fibre, but the design is still essentially the same.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Forty million years ago, horses first emerged in North America, but after migrating to Asia, horses disappeared from this continent at least 10,000 years ago. So, for millennia, Native Americans travelled and hunted on foot, relying on dogs as miniature pack animals.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
When Christopher Columbus brought two dozen horses on his second voyage to the New World in 1493, he couldn’t have imagined how reintroducing the horse to North America would transform Native American life, especially for the buffalo-hunting Plains Indians, for whom the swift and loyal horse was a marriage made in heaven.<br>
<br>
When Columbus and other Spanish explorers arrived in Hispaniola on horseback, the native Taíno of the Caribbean were terrified by what they saw as a half-man, half-beast. They had never seen a creature that had human beings riding on it. As more Native tribes encountered the horse, that initial fear gave way to awe for the animal’s speed and power. With the dog as their closest reference, Indians gave this mythical new creature names like “elk dog”, “sky dog” and “holy dog”. The Spanish quickly realised that the last thing they wanted was for Indians to have horses, because that would put them on equal footing, but that’s exactly what happened.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
In the early 1800s, the sovereign Cherokee nation covered a vast region that included northwest Georgia and adjacent land in Tennessee, North Carolina and Alabama. Under the terms of an 1819 treaty, the United States guaranteed that Cherokee land would be off-limits to white settlers forever. Forever lasted less than 20 years. Although the treaty mandated the removal of “all white people who have intruded, or may hereafter intrude, on the lands of the Cherokees,” the United States instead forcibly removed more than 15,000 Cherokees in 1838 and 1839.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
As many as 4,000 died of disease, starvation and exposure during their detention and forced migration through nine states that became known as the “Trail of Tears”. The last of the Cherokee completed the Trail of Tears in March 1839. Decades later, a Confederate soldier who participated in the forced migration recalled, “I fought through the Civil War and saw men shot to pieces and slaughtered by the thousands, but the Cherokee removal was the cruelest work I ever knew.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Before European contact, the temperate, hospitable California area had more people (+/- 300,000 in 1600’s) than any other. It was also more diverse. Its estimated 100 different tribes and groups spoke more spoke over 200 dialects. In fact, California’s language landscape was more complex than that of Europe.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Despite this great diversity, most native Californians lived very similar lives. They did not practise much agriculture. Instead, they organised themselves into small, family-based bands of hunter-gatherers known as tribelets. Inter-tribelet relationships, based on wellestablished systems of trade and common rights, were generally peaceful.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But although gold spelled prosperity and power for the white settlers who arrived in California in 1849 and after, it meant disaster for the state’s peaceful indigenous population. An estimated 100,000 Native Americans died during the first two years of the Gold Rush alone. Today, despite all odds, California has the United States’ largest Native American population and is home to 109 federally recognised tribes.&nbsp;<br>
