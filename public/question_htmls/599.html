          <strong>THE GIRL WITH X-RAY EYES</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>‘New Light Sees Through Flesh to Bones’ was the headline in one newspaper when, in 1896, Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen (1845-1923) unveiled his new x-ray machine. His discovery was to change the course of modern medicine. But in 1997, some 100 years later, a young Russian girl claimed to see inside human bodies without the benefit of technology, using her eyes alone.</em>
        </p>
        <p>As a young girl growing up in Saransk, the capital of Mordovia some 480km east of Moscow, there was little to mark Natasha Demkina out from her playmates. But all that changed when, aged ten, she confessed to her mother that she could ‘see’ beneath her skin, inside her body. Under Natasha’s penetrating gaze, her mum’s bones, sinews and blood-pumping veins were all startlingly apparent.</p>
        <p>“At first, I was disgusted,” Natasha later admitted. “Then I became used to it. It seems normal now and, if I don’t see anyone for a while, I miss the experience.”</p>
        <p>Natasha began to use her unexpected talents to diagnose ailments among friends and family. Her startling success rate soon led people to call her ‘the girl with x-ray eyes.’ As her reputation spread, Natasha was confronted with more ‘patients’ than ever. She returned from school each day to discover a line of people outside her house, hoping that she would identify health problems undetected by doctors. She began to charge people a small fee. Natasha dreamed of going to medical school, and when her family realised how expensive this would be, the cost went up again. Some Natasha enthusiasts claimed she had offered her diagnostic opinion to 10,000 people.</p>
        <p>Her bizarre visual surgery finally attracted the interest of an international television company, who asked her to appear on air and expose her skills to camera scrutiny. Ringing in the ears of the television producer were the words of her proud mother Tatyana, “She has never been wrong in six years.”</p>
