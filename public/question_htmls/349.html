          <strong>BUSY BUILDERS</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by George Laycock</em>
        </p>
        <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>1</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; A farmer in Minnesota had a big surprise one morning when he looked out his kitchen window. His beautiful cornfield had turned into a muddy lake.</p>
        <p><strong>2</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; The farmer rushed out to his truck and hurried to the creek. He discovered that, during the night, a family of beavers had moved in and built a fine new dam across the creek. It was working perfectly, too. Hardly a drop of water was getting through!</p>
        <p><strong>3</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;The farmer spent many hours tearing down the dam. Finally, the water ran out of his cornfield and back to the flowing creek.</p>
        <p><strong>4</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; That night, the beavers built a new dam. Every night, after the farmer had torn down the dam, the beavers rebuilt it. They used up the trees and the brush. Then, they snipped off all of the farmer’s corn to build one last dam of cornstalks.</p>
        <p><strong>5</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; When they finally moved on, they left behind a farmer who never wanted to see such hardworking beavers again!</p>
        <p><strong>6</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; How does the beaver do it? It sits up on its short hind legs, using its wide, flat tail for balance. It gnaws away at the wood with its long, sharp front teeth until the tree begins to crack. As the tree falls, the beaver dives into the water to keep from being hit!</p>
        <p><strong>7</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;Next, the beaver cuts the tree into smaller pieces that it can push or pull through the water. The lakes and ponds created by beaver dams also provide homes for many other animals.</p>
        <p><strong>8</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; The beaver feels very safe in the water, where it can escape from wolves, bobcats, bears, and other predators. It can stay underwater for 15 minutes without coming up for air. The beaver’s feet have webs between the toes, which make each foot a strong paddle for swimming. Thick, waterproof fur protects the beaver from the cold.</p>
        <p><strong>9</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;In the water, the beaver uses its flat tail to help it steer, like a rudder on a boat. When an enemy comes around, the beaver lifts its heavy tail and slaps it on top of the water. This makes a loud cracking sound that warns other beavers to dive into safe water.</p>
        <p><strong>10</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Beavers always seem to be busy cutting trees and building dams or beaver homes. Often they work at night so they can stay out of the way of people. Sometimes, they can be very helpful to people. Wildlife rangers in New Jersey once wanted to flood an area. They wanted to create a new nesting area for water birds. Human experts said it would cost $25,000.</p>
        <p><strong>11</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, a family of beaver “experts” moved in and built a dam for free! Everyone, including the beavers and birds, were happy.</p>

          <strong>BUSY BUILDERS</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by George Laycock</em>
        </p>
        <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>1</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; A farmer in Minnesota had a big surprise one morning when he looked out his kitchen window. His beautiful cornfield had turned into a muddy lake.</p>
        <p><strong>2</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; The farmer rushed out to his truck and hurried to the creek. He discovered that, during the night, a family of beavers had moved in and built a fine new dam across the creek. It was working perfectly, too. Hardly a drop of water was getting through!</p>
        <p><strong>3</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;The farmer spent many hours tearing down the dam. Finally, the water ran out of his cornfield and back to the flowing creek.</p>
        <p><strong>4</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; That night, the beavers built a new dam. Every night, after the farmer had torn down the dam, the beavers rebuilt it. They used up the trees and the brush. Then, they snipped off all of the farmer’s corn to build one last dam of cornstalks.</p>
        <p><strong>5</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; When they finally moved on, they left behind a farmer who never wanted to see such hardworking beavers again!</p>
        <p><strong>6</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; How does the beaver do it? It sits up on its short hind legs, using its wide, flat tail for balance. It gnaws away at the wood with its long, sharp front teeth until the tree begins to crack. As the tree falls, the beaver dives into the water to keep from being hit!</p>
        <p><strong>7</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;Next, the beaver cuts the tree into smaller pieces that it can push or pull through the water. The lakes and ponds created by beaver dams also provide homes for many other animals.</p>
        <p><strong>8</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; The beaver feels very safe in the water, where it can escape from wolves, bobcats, bears, and other predators. It can stay underwater for 15 minutes without coming up for air. The beaver’s feet have webs between the toes, which make each foot a strong paddle for swimming. Thick, waterproof fur protects the beaver from the cold.</p>
        <p><strong>9</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;In the water, the beaver uses its flat tail to help it steer, like a rudder on a boat. When an enemy comes around, the beaver lifts its heavy tail and slaps it on top of the water. This makes a loud cracking sound that warns other beavers to dive into safe water.</p>
        <p><strong>10</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Beavers always seem to be busy cutting trees and building dams or beaver homes. Often they work at night so they can stay out of the way of people. Sometimes, they can be very helpful to people. Wildlife rangers in New Jersey once wanted to flood an area. They wanted to create a new nesting area for water birds. Human experts said it would cost $25,000.</p>
        <p><strong>11</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, a family of beaver “experts” moved in and built a dam for free! Everyone, including the beavers and birds, were happy.</p>

          <strong>Treasure in the Field A Vietnamese </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Retold by Marilyn Bolchunos</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Once there was an old man who lived with his two young sons on a farm in Vietnam. The mother of the boys had died. Since the old man had to tend the field, the boys took care of the house. That is, they were supposed to take care of the house, but they were lazy.</p>
        <p>Often the father returned home to find that nothing had been done—he even had to cook dinner.</p>
        <p>“What have you been doing all day, Ta?” he would ask his older son.</p>
        <p>“Studying, Father, and thinking,” Ta would reply.</p>
        <p>“And what have you been doing, Hai, my young son?” the father would ask.</p>
        <p>“Watching the house for you,” Hai would answer.</p>
        <p>A neighbour asked the old man, “Are your sons helping you?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;“Oh, they would,” the father answered, “but they are young, and they miss their mother.”</p>
        <p>Some years later, the neighbour asked, “Aren’t your sons helping you in the field?”</p>
        <p>“Oh, they would,” the father replied again, “but they are still young. I will let them enjoy life now. They will help me later on.”</p>
        <p>As the years went by, it became clear even to their father that the boys were lazy. Though they sometimes tended the field with him, they always made excuses to go home early.</p>
        <p>Finally the father grew too old to work, and he took to his bed. The sons were sad, for they not only depended on their father, but they also loved him.</p>
        <p>One day the old man called Ta and Hai to his side and said weakly, “I have a secret to tell you, my sons. Bend close.”</p>
        <p>Hai and Ta leaned over to hear the secret.</p>
        <p>“Before your mother died,” the old man said, “we learned that there is treasure buried in the field. It’s still there, but you must dig for it.”</p>
        <p>The sons’ eyes widened.</p>
        <p>“Treasure in the field?” Ta said.</p>
        <p>“Where?” asked Hai.</p>
        <p>“Dig for it, and you will find it,” said their father. “But promise me that you will share it equally.”</p>
        <p>The sons promised and hurried out to begin. Day after day they dug. Their neighbour was astonished to see how long and hard the young men worked. As for Ta and Hai, they felt stronger and better than ever before.</p>
        <p>At last, the entire field had been dug, but no treasure had been found. The brothers moped around with their heads down.</p>
        <p>Finally an idea came to Ta. “The land is ready for planting,” he said to his brother. “And our rice is almost gone. You take one half of the field, and I’ll take the other. We’ll tend it just as Father did.”</p>
        <p>The days passed and the seedlings grew. In due time, the field gave an abundant harvest. There was rice to eat and rice to sell.</p>
        <p>When the sons took the rice to the marketplace, it brought a good price.</p>
        <p>Excited, Ta and Hai ran back to the house and approached their father’s bedside. They dropped coins into the old man’s hands.</p>
        <p>“Look, Father,” said Hai. “We have sold rice and brought you gold!”</p>
        <p>“Yes,” said Ta. “Just as you said, the treasure was in the field.”</p>
        <p>The old man smiled. They had learned his secret.</p>

          <strong>Treasure in the Field A Vietnamese </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Retold by Marilyn Bolchunos</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Once there was an old man who lived with his two young sons on a farm in Vietnam. The mother of the boys had died. Since the old man had to tend the field, the boys took care of the house. That is, they were supposed to take care of the house, but they were lazy.</p>
        <p>Often the father returned home to find that nothing had been done—he even had to cook dinner.</p>
        <p>“What have you been doing all day, Ta?” he would ask his older son.</p>
        <p>“Studying, Father, and thinking,” Ta would reply.</p>
        <p>“And what have you been doing, Hai, my young son?” the father would ask.</p>
        <p>“Watching the house for you,” Hai would answer.</p>
        <p>A neighbour asked the old man, “Are your sons helping you?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;“Oh, they would,” the father answered, “but they are young, and they miss their mother.”</p>
        <p>Some years later, the neighbour asked, “Aren’t your sons helping you in the field?”</p>
        <p>“Oh, they would,” the father replied again, “but they are still young. I will let them enjoy life now. They will help me later on.”</p>
        <p>As the years went by, it became clear even to their father that the boys were lazy. Though they sometimes tended the field with him, they always made excuses to go home early.</p>
        <p>Finally the father grew too old to work, and he took to his bed. The sons were sad, for they not only depended on their father, but they also loved him.</p>
        <p>One day the old man called Ta and Hai to his side and said weakly, “I have a secret to tell you, my sons. Bend close.”</p>
        <p>Hai and Ta leaned over to hear the secret.</p>
        <p>“Before your mother died,” the old man said, “we learned that there is treasure buried in the field. It’s still there, but you must dig for it.”</p>
        <p>The sons’ eyes widened.</p>
        <p>“Treasure in the field?” Ta said.</p>
        <p>“Where?” asked Hai.</p>
        <p>“Dig for it, and you will find it,” said their father. “But promise me that you will share it equally.”</p>
        <p>The sons promised and hurried out to begin. Day after day they dug. Their neighbour was astonished to see how long and hard the young men worked. As for Ta and Hai, they felt stronger and better than ever before.</p>
        <p>At last, the entire field had been dug, but no treasure had been found. The brothers moped around with their heads down.</p>
        <p>Finally an idea came to Ta. “The land is ready for planting,” he said to his brother. “And our rice is almost gone. You take one half of the field, and I’ll take the other. We’ll tend it just as Father did.”</p>
        <p>The days passed and the seedlings grew. In due time, the field gave an abundant harvest. There was rice to eat and rice to sell.</p>
        <p>When the sons took the rice to the marketplace, it brought a good price.</p>
        <p>Excited, Ta and Hai ran back to the house and approached their father’s bedside. They dropped coins into the old man’s hands.</p>
        <p>“Look, Father,” said Hai. “We have sold rice and brought you gold!”</p>
        <p>“Yes,” said Ta. “Just as you said, the treasure was in the field.”</p>
        <p>The old man smiled. They had learned his secret.</p>

          <em>Retold by Marilyn Bolchunos</em>

        <p>“Watching the house for you,” Hai would answer.</p>
        <p>A neighbour asked the old man, “Are your sons helping you?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;“Oh, they would,” the father answered, “but they are young, and they miss their mother.”</p>
        <p>Some years later, the neighbour asked, “Aren’t your sons helping you in the field?”</p>
        <p>“Oh, they would,” the father replied again, “but they are still young. I will let them enjoy life now. They will help me later on.”</p>
        <p>As the years went by, it became clear even to their father that the boys were lazy. Though they sometimes tended the field with him, they always made excuses to go home early.</p>
        <p>Finally the father grew too old to work, and he took to his bed. The sons were sad, for they not only depended on their father, but they also loved him.</p>
        <p>One day the old man called Ta and Hai to his side and said weakly, “I have a secret to tell you, my sons. Bend close.”</p>
        <p>Hai and Ta leaned over to hear the secret.</p>
        <p>“Before your mother died,” the old man said, “we learned that there is treasure buried in the field. It’s still there, but you must dig for it.”</p>
        <p>The sons’ eyes widened.</p>
        <p>“Treasure in the field?” Ta said.</p>
        <p>“Where?” asked Hai.</p>
        <p>“Dig for it, and you will find it,” said their father. “But promise me that you will share it equally.”</p>
        <p>The sons promised and hurried out to begin. Day after day they dug. Their neighbour was astonished to see how long and hard the young men worked. As for Ta and Hai, they felt stronger and better than ever before.</p>
        <p>At last, the entire field had been dug, but no treasure had been found. The brothers moped around with their heads down.</p>
        <p>Finally an idea came to Ta. “The land is ready for planting,” he said to his brother. “And our rice is almost gone. You take one half of the field, and I’ll take the other. We’ll tend it just as Father did.”</p>
        <p>The days passed and the seedlings grew. In due time, the field gave an abundant harvest. There was rice to eat and rice to sell.</p>
        <p>When the sons took the rice to the marketplace, it brought a good price.</p>
        <p>Excited, Ta and Hai ran back to the house and approached their father’s bedside. They dropped coins into the old man’s hands.</p>
        <p>“Look, Father,” said Hai. “We have sold rice and brought you gold!”</p>
        <p>“Yes,” said Ta. “Just as you said, the treasure was in the field.”</p>
        <p>The old man smiled. They had learned his secret.</p>

          <strong>Treasure in the Field A Vietnamese </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Retold by Marilyn Bolchunos</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Once there was an old man who lived with his two young sons on a farm in Vietnam. The mother of the boys had died. Since the old man had to tend the field, the boys took care of the house. That is, they were supposed to take care of the house, but they were lazy.</p>
        <p>Often the father returned home to find that nothing had been done—he even had to cook dinner.</p>
        <p>“What have you been doing all day, Ta?” he would ask his older son.</p>
        <p>“Studying, Father, and thinking,” Ta would reply.</p>
        <p>“And what have you been doing, Hai, my young son?” the father would ask.</p>
        <p>“Watching the house for you,” Hai would answer.</p>
        <p>A neighbour asked the old man, “Are your sons helping you?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;“Oh, they would,” the father answered, “but they are young, and they miss their mother.”</p>
        <p>Some years later, the neighbour asked, “Aren’t your sons helping you in the field?”</p>
        <p>“Oh, they would,” the father replied again, “but they are still young. I will let them enjoy life now. They will help me later on.”</p>
        <p>As the years went by, it became clear even to their father that the boys were lazy. Though they sometimes tended the field with him, they always made excuses to go home early.</p>
        <p>Finally the father grew too old to work, and he took to his bed. The sons were sad, for they not only depended on their father, but they also loved him.</p>
        <p>One day the old man called Ta and Hai to his side and said weakly, “I have a secret to tell you, my sons. Bend close.”</p>
        <p>Hai and Ta leaned over to hear the secret.</p>
        <p>“Before your mother died,” the old man said, “we learned that there is treasure buried in the field. It’s still there, but you must dig for it.”</p>
        <p>The sons’ eyes widened.</p>
        <p>“Treasure in the field?” Ta said.</p>
        <p>“Where?” asked Hai.</p>
