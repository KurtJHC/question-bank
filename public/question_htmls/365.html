        <p>Questions 10 - 12 relate to the synopsis of “<strong>The Lion King</strong>” that follows:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>The Lion King</em> is a 1994 board book adaptation of the movie of the same name produced by Disney Animation. Written by Don Ferguson, it is a narrated and illustrated retelling of the coming of age of Simba, a young lion, as he overcomes the death of his father and ousting from his pride which rules the Pride Land, a kingdom of animals in Africa. Simba ultimately regains his rightful place as king of the pride, and in doing so, restores the kingdom's natural order, referred to in the animals' shared vocabulary as the “circle of life.”</p>
        <p>The novel begins in the Pride Lands, an area in Kenya, Africa ruled by a pride of lions. Its leader, King Mufasa, who rules benevolently from his home, Pride Rock, attends the presentation of his newborn son, Simba, to the assembly of animals that make up the kingdom. His advisor and shaman, a baboon named Rafiki, hoists young Simba into the air atop a rocky pinnacle, and the animals cheer. Mufasa waves his hand across the land, explaining that Simba will be responsible for it once he becomes king. He also explains the “circle of life,” the sacred relationship between birth and death that connects all living creatures.</p>
        <p>As Simba comes of age, Mufasa's younger brother, Scar, seeks to usurp the throne. Scar plans to kill Mufasa and Simba. He lures Simba and his best friend and future wife and queen of the pride, the young lioness Nala, to explore a dangerous elephant graveyard. There, a trio of spotted hyenas loyal to Scar ambushes them. Mufasa, learning about the ambush from his messenger hornbill Zazu, rushes to rescue the cubs. Though Mufasa is angry with Simba, he forgives him, taking him to a field and explaining that the kings of the past watch from the stars, just as he will one day watch over the prides of Africa.</p>
        <p>After his failed attempt to kill Simba, Scar lures him and Mufasa into a ravine where his hyenas cause a stampede of wildebeest, hoping to have them trampled. Scar lures Simba first and then, notifies Mufasa of Simba's danger. Mufasa rushes to save Simba again but is left hanging on the edge of the ravine. Scar approaches and, instead of saving him, throws him into the ravine, where he dies. Scar convinces Simba that Mufasa's death was his own fault, telling him to leave the kingdom. After Simba flees with the hyenas in pursuit, Scar tells the rest of the pride that the wildebeest killed both Mufasa and his son, Simba. He becomes the new king, allowing his previously excommunicated hyenas and their pack to come live in the Pride Lands.</p>
        <p>Simba, exhausted in the desert, is rescued by a meerkat and a warthog, Timon and Pumbaa. He grows up with them in the jungle, learning to create a carefree life and adopting a new motto, “Hakuna Matata,” meaning “no worries.” One day, a hungry lioness comes to hunt Timon and Pumbaa. Simba intercepts her, discovering that she is Nala. They fall back in love and Nala tells him to come home, conveying that the Pride Lands have fallen into drought and despair. Simba refuses and runs away, unwilling to cope with returning to the site of his father‟s death. He finds Rafiki, who says that Mufasa is still alive in Simba. Mufasa's spirit appears in the stars, telling Simba that he must live on as king. Simba is convinced to return home.</p>
        <p>Simba covertly returns to Pride Rock, confronting Scar. Scar tries to exploit Simba's insecurity about his role in Mufasa's death, backing him to the edge of Pride Rock. There, he reveals that he killed Mufasa. Overcome with anger, Simba throws himself onto Scar, pinning him down. He forces Scar to announce the truth to the pride. His friends Timon and Pumbaa, along with Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses, fight off the hyenas while Scar tries to escape. Simba corners him, and Scar begs for mercy, offering to betray his hyenas. Simba agrees on the condition that Scar is banished from the Pride Lands. Scar tries to attack again, and Simba throws him from the rock. He survives the fall but is killed by the hyenas who overheard his betrayal. Rain begins to fall as Simba regains the kingship, and life comes back to the Pride Lands. The book concludes as Rafiki holds up Simba and Nala's new cub to the assembly of animals, repeating the circle of life.</p>
        <p>A classic coming of age story, <em>The Lion King</em> incorporates the symbolism of the animal kingdom and its natural hierarchical structure to present the struggle of its protagonist as a return to his inherited home, family, and throne.</p>

There, he reveals that he killed Mufasa. Overcome with anger, Simba throws himself onto Scar, pinning him down. He forces Scar to announce the truth to the pride. His friends Timon and Pumbaa, along with Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses, fight off the hyenas while Scar tries to escape. Simba corners him, and Scar begs for mercy, offering to betray his hyenas. Simba agrees on the condition that Scar is banished from the Pride Lands. Scar tries to attack again, and Simba throws him from the rock. He survives the fall but is killed by the hyenas who overheard his betrayal. Rain begins to fall as Simba regains the kingship, and life comes back to the Pride Lands. The book concludes as Rafiki holds up Simba and Nala's new cub to the assembly of animals, repeating the circle of life.</p>
        <p>A classic coming of age story, <em>The Lion King</em> incorporates the symbolism of the animal kingdom and its natural hierarchical structure to present the struggle of its protagonist as a return to his inherited home, family, and throne.</p>

        </p>
        <p>1 &nbsp;&nbsp;The early-morning August sun was rising over the mountains across the lake. Alan sat next to his father in the small metal boat. He and his father had been to this fishing spot many times over the summer. Alan usually loved being here, but today his heart was heavy.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp;&nbsp; Alan’s father leaned back and sighed comfortably. “I’m really glad we were able to have one last fishing weekend before you have to go back to school. It’s a perfect day to relax,” he said. His fishing line started to jerk. “And a perfect day to catch a big fish,” he added. Alan’s father reeled in a large catfish and scooped it up with the net. He held up the fish like a trophy.</p>
        <p>3 &nbsp;“Dad expects everything to be the best,” thought Alan. “I wonder what he’ll say when I tell him I don’t want to try out for the football team this year.” Alan tried to push the thought out of his mind and concentrate on putting the worm on the hook.</p>
        <p>4 &nbsp;“Here, Alan, let me show you a better way to get that bait on your hook,” Dad said, reaching for Alan’s fishing pole.</p>
        <p>5 “I’ve got it, Dad,” Alan answered, pulling away as he roughly put the worm onto the hook, nearly tearing it to pieces.</p>
        <p>6 &nbsp;“O.K., but try to be a little more careful. You don’t want it to fall apart,” his father said, looking at the mangled bait. “Now, let me show you how to cast just right so you can catch the biggest fish.”</p>
        <p>7 &nbsp;“No, thanks,” Alan mumbled.</p>
        <p>8 “C’mon, you can do it! Just try,” Dad said. “Watch how I do it.” He demonstrated a perfect cast. Then he leaned back in the boat and pushed his hat down low over his forehead. “Now, you try.”</p>
        <p>9 &nbsp;<em>You can do it! Just try. Watch how I do it.</em> The words rang over and over in Alan’s mind. It seemed to Alan that they were the only words his father had said all summer. Alan had told his father at the beginning of summer that he was thinking about trying out for his school’s football team. Although Alan hadn’t played much football before, he knew Dad would be pleased if he made the team. Dad always talked about how he had played football in high school and college. He was more than willing to help Alan learn the game.</p>
        <p>10 &nbsp;The first day they practiced, Dad had thrown the ball to Alan. “You can catch it! Just try!” his father had called. Alan had run as fast as he could to catch the ball, but it hit his chest hard and bounced out of his hands. He stumbled and fell to the ground.</p>
        <p>11 &nbsp;“Don’t worry, Alan. You’ll get it next time. Here, watch how I hold my hands to catch the ball,” Dad had told him. All summer he and Dad had practiced football in the yard. Over and over again Alan would miss, and Dad would try to show him how to improve his skills. By the beginning of August, Alan had made some improvement, but he had also begun to loathe the game. He couldn’t even stand the sight of a football.</p>
        <p>12 &nbsp;Alan tried to bring his thoughts back to fishing. He raised his pole and threw the line out into the water, where it immediately became <span class="txt-underline">intertwined</span> with his father’s line. Alan tried to pull his line free from his father’s, but the tangle only got worse.</p>
        <p>13 &nbsp;“See, I can’t! I don’t want to! And I don’t want to play football, either!” Alan blurted out. The words escaped before he knew it. Instantly he wished he could take them back.</p>
        <p>14 &nbsp;“But I thought you liked football! You were getting really good at it,” his father said.</p>
        <p>15 &nbsp;“No, Dad, I just wanted to try it because you liked it. You were the one who was good at it, not me.” Alan looked down at the water. “You always told me that I had to be the best. Well, I’m not the best.”</p>
        <p>16 His father shook his head sadly. “Son, I never said, ‘Be the best.’ Don’t you remember? I always say, ‘Do your best.’ ”</p>
        <p>17 &nbsp;Alan sank farther down into his seat. The small boat rocked and then calmed. All around, everything was still and silent. Neither Alan nor Dad said a word in the uncomfortable silence.</p>
        <p>18 &nbsp;It was probably only a few minutes, but it seemed like hours before either of them spoke. Finally Alan’s father took out his pocketknife. “I guess we’ll just have to cut these lines and start over,” Dad said. With a quick tug of his knife, he cut the tangled lines and began pulling them in.</p>
        <p>19 &nbsp;Alan reached into the tackle box and then fixed his line. He attached new bait to the hook, being more careful this time, and cast the line out as far as he could. Before long the bobber went under, and his line tightened.</p>
        <p>20 “You’ve got a bite!” his father said, pointing. Alan jerked the pole to set the hook and began reeling in the line. But the line slackened, and the hook came up empty.</p>
        <p>21 “It got away,” Alan said, sighing.</p>
        <p>22 “That’s O.K.,” Dad said as he cast his own line. “You can’t expect to catch them all.”</p>
        <p>23 Alan glanced over at his father with a smile.</p>

        <p>Well, son, I'll tell you:<br>
Life for me ain't been no crystal stair.<br>
It's had tacks in it,<br>
And splinters,<br>
And boards torn up,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5<br>
And places with no carpet on the floor—<br>
Bare.<br>
But all the time<br>
I'se been a-climbin' on,<br>
And reachin' landin's,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;10<br>
And turnin' corners,<br>
And sometimes goin' in the dark<br>
Where there ain't been no light.<br>
So, boy, don't you turn back.<br>
Don't you set down on the steps.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;15<br>
'Cause you finds it's kinder hard.<br>
Don't you fall now—<br>
For I'se still goin', honey,<br>
I'se still climbin',<br>
And life for me ain't been no crystal stair.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;20</p>

          <strong>Thorns and Roses</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <em>by Margaret S. Frezon</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Sarah sat up in bed and rubbed her eyes. Where were all of her old familiar things? The &nbsp;framed picture of the cocker spaniel puppy was not hanging on the wall opposite her bed. The navy blue blanket that had always covered the foot of her bed seemed to have gone missing in the night. The curtains had magically changed from sky-blue to sea-green. Everything had changed. “All part of my new life,” she thought, frowning.</p>
        <p>When Sarah’s family had moved just a few weeks ago, everyone seemed happy. Their new house was located in a town next to a national forest, twenty miles closer to her mother’s job. There would be an extra bedroom in the new house for her great aunt, who had been living alone.</p>
        <p>Despite her family’s enthusiasm, Sarah was having a hard time getting used to the changes. She missed her old school and she missed the friends who had lived on her block. She missed all the things that had been left behind, from the curtains to the colors of the walls. Since it was summer, there was no opportunity to make friends at school. What was she supposed to do all day?</p>
        <p>Seeing Sarah moping around, her great aunt Felicia said, “You could always come out and help me get the garden whipped into shape.” Sarah was not exactly in the mood for gardening, but this offer was the only one she had. Besides, she loved her great aunt and wanted to be helpful. She shrugged and followed her into the yard.</p>
        <p>Sarah had to agree that the garden needed a lot of work. The plot itself was fairly large but few flowers could be seen, and the overgrown greenery was choked with weeds. The little fence around the perimeter of the garden was old and wobbly. Sarah began to wonder if it was worth weeding the plot at all. With a little sigh, she knelt down and began yanking clumps of weeds.</p>
        <p>At first it was difficult telling the weeds from the emerging flower plants. But after she had asked a few questions and watched her great aunt at work, Sarah felt more confident. She grabbed a handful of grass at the base of a shrubby bush and got ready to toss it into a waiting wheelbarrow.</p>
        <p>“Ouch!”</p>
        <p>Sarah yanked her hand back and stared at a crimson drop on the tip of her finger. “Why do rosebushes have to have thorns?” she complained aloud.</p>
        <p>“Sorry, baby,” her great aunt called. “I should have brought us some gardening gloves.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Working around roses can be prickly work.”</p>
        <p>“That’s okay, Aunt Felicia,” Sarah replied. “I’ll survive.” They worked through the afternoon and then decided to quit for the day. As Sarah went through the back door, she looked back and smiled. The garden did look much better.</p>
        <p>She got a cold drink from the refrigerator, retreated to her room, flopped down on the bed and looked at the walls. She had to admit that the walls of her new room were an attractive shade of yellow. Maybe she could find a picture of sunflowers that would look nice hanging over her dresser. She decided that she had begun to outgrow the puppy picture anyway.</p>
        <p>The next day, Sarah woke up before anyone else and slipped outside to the garden. She was especially careful to avoid the thorns of the rosebush. As she pulled weeds and grass, she noticed a bud just beginning to blossom. It looked delicate. Just a trace of pink peeked out from under the green covering. Sarah knew that it would soon open into a full and fragrant blossom. And then she noticed another bud and another—the bush was filled with them. She could not help but let out a happy shout.</p>
        <p>“I see you found the roses,” Aunt Felicia said from the back porch.</p>
        <p>Sarah smiled. “You know,” she said, “yesterday I was angry that there were thorns on the rosebush. But do you know how I feel today?”</p>
        <p>Aunt Felicia raised her eyebrows.</p>
        <p>“Today I’m glad that this thorn bush has such beautiful roses.”</p>
        <p>Aunt Felicia came down the back porch steps and put her arms around Sarah. “Suppose we take a walk around our new neighborhood,” she said. “I’ll bet we can find more roses or other things just as nice.”</p>

          <em>MONTANA</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; THE BUFFALO no longer wandered the prairie, and the grass was wilted and brown. The streams no longer ran full and deep. In the glare of the sun, the parched earth lay burning, for drought had come into the country of the Blackfoot, and with the drought came famine. Many miles wandered the hunters in search of game, only to return empty handed and with <span class="txt-underline">waning</span> strength. Bad days had come to the Blackfoot nation and powerful ceremonies were to be held in the hope of securing relief.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Along the shore of a well-loved lake, two medicine lodges had been built, and here the ceremonies were carried on. Chants were sung and accompanied with elaborate ritual. At last these earnest prayers were heard by Old Man. Through His spirit helpers, He sent word to the suffering nation that they must send seven of their oldest and wisest men to the top of the mountain where the Wind Spirit lived. (Chief Mountain.) It was the Wind Spirit who was causing the drought, and it was he who must be appeased.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;And so the seven were selected and sent forth to climb the steep mountain to its summit. But when they reached the top, the Wind Spirit was such an awe-inspiring person that their hearts failed them and they turned and fled in fear. Therefore the drought continued, the suffering increased, and the Blackfoot were in desperate straits.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Now Old Man sent word again—this time that fourteen of the young warriors must journey to the home of the Wind Spirit. The fourteen bravest were selected—those who had earned many of the hard-won eagle plumes and whose deeds were most often recounted about the evening camp fires. They made their way up the trail until they, too, stood upon the mountain crest.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Wind Spirit waited in the door of his lodge, dreadful to behold. But these were warriors, tried and true, and though they were fearful they were brave as well. They gave no sign of weakness but drew nearer until they could reach out and touch the robe of this Mighty One.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Their courage pleased the Wind Spirit greatly. He sent them home with these words to carry to their people. “Now am I sure that the Blackfoot are a nation of men and deserving of my favor.” He brought forth the life-giving rains and poured them down upon the parched land, drenching the earth with the cool, sweet water.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When the young men reached the lake shore, they found the grass growing thick and green, the streams replenished, and the buffalo returned. From that day forth there was happiness and prosperity where dwelt the bands of the Blackfoot nation.</p>

        <p>give solemn, adult advice -</p>

        <p>When I take him on my knee</p>
        <p>with his Ladybird book</p>
        <p>he gazes into the air,</p>
        <p>sighing and shaking his head</p>
        <p>like an old man&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10</p>
        <p>who knows the mountains</p>
        <p>are impassable.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He toys with words,</p>
        <p>letting them go cold</p>
        <p>as <strong>gristly meat</strong>,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;15</p>

        <p>from the bit – who sees</p>
        <p>that if he takes it</p>
