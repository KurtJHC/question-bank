          <strong>RANGER’S APPRENTICE&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Try to eat something, Will. Tomorrow’s a big day, after all.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jenny, blond, pretty and cheerful, gestured toward Will’s barely touched plate and smiled encouragingly at him. Will made an attempt to return the smile, but it was a dismal failure. He picked at the plate before him, piled high with his favourite foods. Tonight, his stomach knotted tight with tension and anticipation, he could hardly bring himself to swallow a bite. Tomorrow would be a big day, he knew. He knew it all too well, in fact. Tomorrow would be the biggest day in his life, because tomorrow was the Choosing Day and it would determine how he spent the rest of his life.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Nerves, I imagine,” said George, setting down his loaded fork and seizing the lapels of his jacket in a judicious manner. He was a thin, gangly and studious boy, fascinated by rules and regulations and with a penchant for examining and debating both sides of any question—sometimes at great length. “Dreadful thing, nervousness. It can just freeze you up so you can’t think, can’t eat, can’t speak.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I’m not nervous,” Will said quickly, noticing that Horace had looked up, ready to form a sarcastic comment.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;George nodded several times, considering Will’s statement. “On the other hand,” he added, “a little nervousness can actually improve performance. It can heighten your perceptions and sharpen your reactions. So, the fact that you are worried, if, in fact, you are, is not necessarily something to be worried about, of itself—so to speak.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In spite of himself, a wry smile touched Will’s mouth. George would be a natural in the legal profession, he thought. He would almost certainly be the Scribemaster’s choice on the following morning. Perhaps, Will thought, that was at the heart of his own problem. He was the only one of the wardmates who had any fears about the Choosing that would take place within twelve hours.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“He ought to be nervous!” Horace scoffed. “After all, which Craftmaster is going to want him as an apprentice?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I’m sure we’re all nervous,” Alyss said. She directed one of her rare smiles at Will. “We’d be stupid not to be.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Well, I’m not!” Horace said, then reddened as Alyss raised one eyebrow and Jenny giggled.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was typical of Alyss, Will thought. He knew that the tall, graceful girl had already been promised a place as an apprentice by Lady Pauline, head of Castle Redmont’s Diplomatic Service. Her pretense that she was nervous about the following day, and her discretion in refraining from pointing out Horace’s gaffe, showed that she was already a diplomat of some skill.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jenny, of course, would gravitate immediately to the castle kitchens, domain of Master Chubb, Redmont’s head chef. He was a man renowned throughout the kingdom for the banquets served in the castle’s massive dining hall. Jenny loved food and cooking, and her easy-going nature and unfailing good humour would make her an invaluable staff member in the turmoil of the castle kitchens.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Battleschool would be Horace’s choice. Will glanced at his wardmate now, hungrily tucking into the roast turkey, ham and potatoes that he had heaped onto his plate. Horace was big for his age and a natural athlete. The chances that he would be refused were virtually non-existent. Horace was exactly the type of recruit that Sir Rodney looked for in his warrior apprentices. Strong, athletic, fit. And, thought Will a trifle sourly, not too bright.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Battleschool was the path to knighthood for boys like Horace—born commoners but with the physical abilities to serve as knights of the kingdom. Which left Will. What would his choice be? More importantly, as Horace had pointed out, what Craftmaster would accept him as an apprentice?</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For Choosing Day was the pivotal point in the life of the castle wards. They were orphan children raised by the generosity of Baron Arald, the Lord of Redmont Fief. For the most part, their parents had died in the service of the fief, and the Baron saw it as his responsibility to care for and raise the children of his former subjects— and to give them an opportunity to improve their station in life wherever possible.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Choosing Day provided that opportunity. Each year, castle wards turning fifteen could apply to be apprenticed to the masters of the various crafts that served the castle and its people. Ordinarily, craft apprentices were selected by dint of their parents’ occupations or influence with the Craftmasters. The castle wards usually had no such influence, and this was their chance to win a future for themselves. Those wards who weren’t chosen, or for whom no openings could be found, would be assigned to farming families in the nearby village, providing farm labour to raise the crops and animals that fed the castle inhabitants. It was rare for this to happen, Will knew. The Baron and his Craftmasters usually went out of their way to fit the wards into one craft or another. But it could happen, and it was a fate he feared more than anything.</p>

          <strong>RANGER’S APPRENTICE&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Try to eat something, Will. Tomorrow’s a big day, after all.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jenny, blond, pretty and cheerful, gestured toward Will’s barely touched plate and smiled encouragingly at him. Will made an attempt to return the smile, but it was a dismal failure. He picked at the plate before him, piled high with his favourite foods. Tonight, his stomach knotted tight with tension and anticipation, he could hardly bring himself to swallow a bite. Tomorrow would be a big day, he knew. He knew it all too well, in fact. Tomorrow would be the biggest day in his life, because tomorrow was the Choosing Day and it would determine how he spent the rest of his life.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Nerves, I imagine,” said George, setting down his loaded fork and seizing the lapels of his jacket in a judicious manner. He was a thin, gangly and studious boy, fascinated by rules and regulations and with a penchant for examining and debating both sides of any question—sometimes at great length. “Dreadful thing, nervousness. It can just freeze you up so you can’t think, can’t eat, can’t speak.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I’m not nervous,” Will said quickly, noticing that Horace had looked up, ready to form a sarcastic comment.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;George nodded several times, considering Will’s statement. “On the other hand,” he added, “a little nervousness can actually improve performance. It can heighten your perceptions and sharpen your reactions. So, the fact that you are worried, if, in fact, you are, is not necessarily something to be worried about, of itself—so to speak.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In spite of himself, a wry smile touched Will’s mouth. George would be a natural in the legal profession, he thought. He would almost certainly be the Scribemaster’s choice on the following morning. Perhaps, Will thought, that was at the heart of his own problem. He was the only one of the wardmates who had any fears about the Choosing that would take place within twelve hours.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“He ought to be nervous!” Horace scoffed. “After all, which Craftmaster is going to want him as an apprentice?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I’m sure we’re all nervous,” Alyss said. She directed one of her rare smiles at Will. “We’d be stupid not to be.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Well, I’m not!” Horace said, then reddened as Alyss raised one eyebrow and Jenny giggled.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was typical of Alyss, Will thought. He knew that the tall, graceful girl had already been promised a place as an apprentice by Lady Pauline, head of Castle Redmont’s Diplomatic Service. Her pretense that she was nervous about the following day, and her discretion in refraining from pointing out Horace’s gaffe, showed that she was already a diplomat of some skill.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jenny, of course, would gravitate immediately to the castle kitchens, domain of Master Chubb, Redmont’s head chef. He was a man renowned throughout the kingdom for the banquets served in the castle’s massive dining hall. Jenny loved food and cooking, and her easy-going nature and unfailing good humour would make her an invaluable staff member in the turmoil of the castle kitchens.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Battleschool would be Horace’s choice. Will glanced at his wardmate now, hungrily tucking into the roast turkey, ham and potatoes that he had heaped onto his plate. Horace was big for his age and a natural athlete. The chances that he would be refused were virtually non-existent. Horace was exactly the type of recruit that Sir Rodney looked for in his warrior apprentices. Strong, athletic, fit. And, thought Will a trifle sourly, not too bright.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Battleschool was the path to knighthood for boys like Horace—born commoners but with the physical abilities to serve as knights of the kingdom. Which left Will. What would his choice be? More importantly, as Horace had pointed out, what Craftmaster would accept him as an apprentice?</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For Choosing Day was the pivotal point in the life of the castle wards. They were orphan children raised by the generosity of Baron Arald, the Lord of Redmont Fief. For the most part, their parents had died in the service of the fief, and the Baron saw it as his responsibility to care for and raise the children of his former subjects— and to give them an opportunity to improve their station in life wherever possible.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Choosing Day provided that opportunity. Each year, castle wards turning fifteen could apply to be apprenticed to the masters of the various crafts that served the castle and its people. Ordinarily, craft apprentices were selected by dint of their parents’ occupations or influence with the Craftmasters. The castle wards usually had no such influence, and this was their chance to win a future for themselves. Those wards who weren’t chosen, or for whom no openings could be found, would be assigned to farming families in the nearby village, providing farm labour to raise the crops and animals that fed the castle inhabitants. It was rare for this to happen, Will knew. The Baron and his Craftmasters usually went out of their way to fit the wards into one craft or another. But it could happen, and it was a fate he feared more than anything.</p>

        <p>The most amazing discoveries of diamonds were mostly found by accident. The northern Cape in 1867 was a hot and desolate place where Erasmus Jacobs, 15, amused himself by playing with the 'klippies' (small stones) which abounded on their farm, De Kalk, not that far from Kimberley in South Africa. Erasmus was somewhat amused when a neighbour, Schalk van Niekerk, asked if he could borrow one of the play stones which he had found a year earlier - a particularly shiny one. It became known as the Eureka Diamond.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Although Erasmus Jacobs never found another diamond, Schalk van Niekerk was luckier three years later. Having learned something of precious stones, Schalk traded a shepherd boy for a stone, giving him five hundred sheep, ten oxen and a horse. It was practically all of van Niekerk's possessions, but a few days later he sold the rough crystal in Hopetown for £11,200. In 1974, it was sold for 1.6 million Swiss Francs.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In July 1871, a labourer, working for diggers from Colesberg, came to work one Monday morning. His boss told him to ‘run to that hill over there, and don’t come back until you have found diamonds. It wasn’t long before he was back with stones in his hat, among which were three diamonds. This small hillock came to be known, locally, as the Colesberg Kopje. A new rush of diggers descended on what later became known as the De Beers mine, which soon dug out the whole hill, and then continued mining underground the flat terrain.</p>

        <p>The greatest and most important adventure of our lives is discovering who we really are. Yet, so many of us walk around without asking the most important question we’ll ever ask: Who am I really? As Mary Oliver put it, “what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?” Finding yourself may sound like an inherently selfcentred goal, but it is actually an unselfish process that is at the root of everything we do in life and that will benefit others. This personal journey is one every individual will benefit from taking. It is a process that involves breaking down – shedding layers that do not serve us in our lives and don’t reflect who we really are. Yet, it also involves a tremendous act of building up – recognising who we want to be and passionately going about fulfilling our unique destiny – whatever that may be. It’s a matter of recognising our personal power yet being open and vulnerable to our experiences. It isn’t something to fear or avoid, berating ourselves along the way, but rather something to seek out with the curiosity and compassion we would have toward a fascinating new friend.</p>

        <p>Science is all about facts and discoveries, with some of the remarkable breakthroughs coming from seemingly everyday occurrences and experiences. One of the oldest and well-known tales revolves around Archimedes' legendary “Eureka moment” while taking a bath in a tub. This was when he made a remarkable discovery, which is now known as the Archimedes Principle. Supposedly, Archimedes was so thrilled and excited with this discovery that he immediately hopped out of the bath and ran onto the streets to tell the ancient Greek king, shouting loudly 'Eureka! Eureka!' (I have found it! I have found it!), in delight. Archimedes went on to make a number of important contributions in science and mathematics. He was the first to realise that the number Pi features in the formula for the circumference of the circle, the area of the circle, and the volume and area of the sphere (notably, he determined an accurate estimation of the value of Pi).</p>

        <p>It’s time to dive into the film, ‘<em>Finding Nemo</em>’ - a hilarious adventure of discovery that takes you into the breathtaking underwater world of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. When Nemo, a young clownfish, is unexpectedly carried far from home, his overprotective father, Marlin, and Dory, a friendly but forgetful regal blue tang fish embark on an epic journey that leads to encounters with vegetarian sharks, surfer dude turtles, hypnotic jellyfish and hungry seagulls!&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘<em>Finding Nemo</em>’ teaches the classic, cartoon Pixar/Disney lessons about the importance of family and discovering acceptance, kindness, and love, but it also an exciting tale of adventure, overcoming adversity, and teamwork. The film is beautiful from start to finish and a truly exceptional technical feat. Finding Nemo sets itself apart from other Disney films by having the whole package: tight storytelling, great characters, winning performances, technical brilliance, laughter, tears, and a very quotable script.</p>

        <p>The most amazing discoveries of diamonds were mostly found by accident. The northern Cape in 1867 was a hot and desolate place where Erasmus Jacobs, 15, amused himself by playing with the 'klippies' (small stones) which abounded on their farm, De Kalk, not that far from Kimberley in South Africa. Erasmus was somewhat amused when a neighbour, Schalk van Niekerk, asked if he could borrow one of the play stones which he had found a year earlier - a particularly shiny one. It became known as the Eureka Diamond.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Although Erasmus Jacobs never found another diamond, Schalk van Niekerk was luckier three years later. Having learned something of precious stones, Schalk traded a shepherd boy for a stone, giving him five hundred sheep, ten oxen and a horse. It was practically all of van Niekerk's possessions, but a few days later he sold the rough crystal in Hopetown for £11,200. In 1974, it was sold for 1.6 million Swiss Francs.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In July 1871, a labourer, working for diggers from Colesberg, came to work one Monday morning. His boss told him to ‘run to that hill over there, and don’t come back until you have found diamonds. It wasn’t long before he was back with stones in his hat, among which were three diamonds. This small hillock came to be known, locally, as the Colesberg Kopje. A new rush of diggers descended on what later became known as the De Beers mine, which soon dug out the whole hill, and then continued mining underground the flat terrain.</p>

        <p>The greatest and most important adventure of our lives is discovering who we really are. Yet, so many of us walk around without asking the most important question we’ll ever ask: Who am I really? As Mary Oliver put it, “what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?” Finding yourself may sound like an inherently selfcentred goal, but it is actually an unselfish process that is at the root of everything we do in life and that will benefit others. This personal journey is one every individual will benefit from taking. It is a process that involves breaking down – shedding layers that do not serve us in our lives and don’t reflect who we really are. Yet, it also involves a tremendous act of building up – recognising who we want to be and passionately going about fulfilling our unique destiny – whatever that may be. It’s a matter of recognising our personal power yet being open and vulnerable to our experiences. It isn’t something to fear or avoid, berating ourselves along the way, but rather something to seek out with the curiosity and compassion we would have toward a fascinating new friend.</p>

        <p>Science is all about facts and discoveries, with some of the remarkable breakthroughs coming from seemingly everyday occurrences and experiences. One of the oldest and well-known tales revolves around Archimedes' legendary “Eureka moment” while taking a bath in a tub. This was when he made a remarkable discovery, which is now known as the Archimedes Principle. Supposedly, Archimedes was so thrilled and excited with this discovery that he immediately hopped out of the bath and ran onto the streets to tell the ancient Greek king, shouting loudly 'Eureka! Eureka!' (I have found it! I have found it!), in delight. Archimedes went on to make a number of important contributions in science and mathematics. He was the first to realise that the number Pi features in the formula for the circumference of the circle, the area of the circle, and the volume and area of the sphere (notably, he determined an accurate estimation of the value of Pi).</p>

        <p>The most amazing discoveries of diamonds were mostly found by accident. The northern Cape in 1867 was a hot and desolate place where Erasmus Jacobs, 15, amused himself by playing with the 'klippies' (small stones) which abounded on their farm, De Kalk, not that far from Kimberley in South Africa. Erasmus was somewhat amused when a neighbour, Schalk van Niekerk, asked if he could borrow one of the play stones which he had found a year earlier - a particularly shiny one. It became known as the Eureka Diamond.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Although Erasmus Jacobs never found another diamond, Schalk van Niekerk was luckier three years later. Having learned something of precious stones, Schalk traded a shepherd boy for a stone, giving him five hundred sheep, ten oxen and a horse. It was practically all of van Niekerk's possessions, but a few days later he sold the rough crystal in Hopetown for £11,200. In 1974, it was sold for 1.6 million Swiss Francs.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In July 1871, a labourer, working for diggers from Colesberg, came to work one Monday morning. His boss told him to ‘run to that hill over there, and don’t come back until you have found diamonds. It wasn’t long before he was back with stones in his hat, among which were three diamonds. This small hillock came to be known, locally, as the Colesberg Kopje. A new rush of diggers descended on what later became known as the De Beers mine, which soon dug out the whole hill, and then continued mining underground the flat terrain.</p>

        <p>The greatest and most important adventure of our lives is discovering who we really are. Yet, so many of us walk around without asking the most important question we’ll ever ask: Who am I really? As Mary Oliver put it, “what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?” Finding yourself may sound like an inherently selfcentred goal, but it is actually an unselfish process that is at the root of everything we do in life and that will benefit others. This personal journey is one every individual will benefit from taking. It is a process that involves breaking down – shedding layers that do not serve us in our lives and don’t reflect who we really are. Yet, it also involves a tremendous act of building up – recognising who we want to be and passionately going about fulfilling our unique destiny – whatever that may be. It’s a matter of recognising our personal power yet being open and vulnerable to our experiences. It isn’t something to fear or avoid, berating ourselves along the way, but rather something to seek out with the curiosity and compassion we would have toward a fascinating new friend.</p>

        <p>The greatest and most important adventure of our lives is discovering who we really are. Yet, so many of us walk around without asking the most important question we’ll ever ask: Who am I really? As Mary Oliver put it, “what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?” Finding yourself may sound like an inherently selfcentred goal, but it is actually an unselfish process that is at the root of everything we do in life and that will benefit others. This personal journey is one every individual will benefit from taking. It is a process that involves breaking down – shedding layers that do not serve us in our lives and don’t reflect who we really are. Yet, it also involves a tremendous act of building up – recognising who we want to be and passionately going about fulfilling our unique destiny – whatever that may be. It’s a matter of recognising our personal power yet being open and vulnerable to our experiences. It isn’t something to fear or avoid, berating ourselves along the way, but rather something to seek out with the curiosity and compassion we would have toward a fascinating new friend.</p>

        <p>Science is all about facts and discoveries, with some of the remarkable breakthroughs coming from seemingly everyday occurrences and experiences. One of the oldest and well-known tales revolves around Archimedes' legendary “Eureka moment” while taking a bath in a tub. This was when he made a remarkable discovery, which is now known as the Archimedes Principle. Supposedly, Archimedes was so thrilled and excited with this discovery that he immediately hopped out of the bath and ran onto the streets to tell the ancient Greek king, shouting loudly 'Eureka! Eureka!' (I have found it! I have found it!), in delight. Archimedes went on to make a number of important contributions in science and mathematics. He was the first to realise that the number Pi features in the formula for the circumference of the circle, the area of the circle, and the volume and area of the sphere (notably, he determined an accurate estimation of the value of Pi).</p>

        <p>It’s time to dive into the film, ‘<em>Finding Nemo</em>’ - a hilarious adventure of discovery that takes you into the breathtaking underwater world of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. When Nemo, a young clownfish, is unexpectedly carried far from home, his overprotective father, Marlin, and Dory, a friendly but forgetful regal blue tang fish embark on an epic journey that leads to encounters with vegetarian sharks, surfer dude turtles, hypnotic jellyfish and hungry seagulls!&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘<em>Finding Nemo</em>’ teaches the classic, cartoon Pixar/Disney lessons about the importance of family and discovering acceptance, kindness, and love, but it also an exciting tale of adventure, overcoming adversity, and teamwork. The film is beautiful from start to finish and a truly exceptional technical feat. Finding Nemo sets itself apart from other Disney films by having the whole package: tight storytelling, great characters, winning performances, technical brilliance, laughter, tears, and a very quotable script.</p>
