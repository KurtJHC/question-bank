        </p>
        <p>After a particularly fierce blow, he crawled to his feet, too dazed to rush. He staggered Alimply about, the blood flowing from nose and mouth and ears, his beautiful coat sprayed and flecked with bloody slaver. Then the man advanced and deliberately dealt him a frightful blow on the nose. All the pain he had endured was as nothing compared with the exquisite agony of this. With a roar that was almost lionlike in its ferocity, he again hurled himself at the man. But the man, shifting the club from right to left, coolly caught him by the under jaw, at the same time wrenching downward and backward. Buck described a complete circle in the air, and half of another, then crashed to the ground on his head and chest.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For the last time he rushed. The man struck the shrewd blow he had purposely withheld for so long, and Buck crumpled up and went down, knocked utterly senseless.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“He’s no slouch at dog-breakin’, that’s wot I say,” one of the men on the wall cried enthusiastically.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Druther break cayuses any day, and twice on Sundays,” was the reply of the driver, as he climbed on the wagon and started the horses.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Buck’s senses came back to him, but not his strength. He lay where he had fallen, and from there he watched the man in the red sweater.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“‘Answers to the name of Buck,’” the man soliloquized, quoting from the saloon-keeper’s letter which had announced the consignment of the crate and contents. “Well, Buck, my boy,” he went on in a genial voice, “we’ve had our little ruction, and the best thing we can do is to let it go at that. You’ve learned your place, and I know mine. Be a good dog and all ’ll go well and the goose hang high. Be a bad dog, and I’ll whale the stuffin’ outa you. Understand?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As he spoke he fearlessly patted the head he had so mercilessly pounded, and though Buck’s hair involuntarily bristled at touch of the hand, he endured it without protest. When the man brought him water he drank eagerly, and later bolted a generous meal of raw meat, chunk by chunk, from the man’s hand.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He was beaten (he knew that); but he was not broken. He saw, once for all, that he stood no chance against a man with a club. He had learned the lesson, and in all his after life he never forgot it. That club was a revelation. It was his introduction to the&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline"><strong>reign of primitive law</strong></span>, and he met the introduction halfway. The facts of life took on a fiercer aspect; and while he faced that aspect uncowed, he faced it with all the latent cunning of his nature aroused. As the days went by, other dogs came, in crates and at the ends of ropes, some docilely, and some raging and roaring as he had come; and, one and all, he watched them pass under the dominion of the man in the red sweater. Again and again, as he looked at each brutal performance, the lesson was driven home to Buck: a man with a club was a lawgiver, a master to be obeyed, though not necessarily conciliated. Of this last Buck was never guilty, though he did see beaten dogs that fawned upon the man, and wagged their tails, and licked his hand. Also he saw one dog, that would neither conciliate nor obey, finally killed in the struggle for mastery.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now and again men came, strangers, who talked excitedly, wheedlingly, and in all kinds of fashions to the man in the red sweater. And at such times that money passed between them the strangers took one or more of the dogs away with them. Buck wondered where they went, for they never came back; but the fear of the future was strong upon him, and he was glad each time when he was not selected.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Yet his time came, in the end, in the form of a little weazened man who spat broken English and many strange and uncouth exclamations which Buck could not understand.</p>

          <br>
          <strong>Birches</strong>
        </p>
        <p>When I see birches bend to left and right<br>
Across the lines of straighter darker trees,<br>
I like to think some boy’s been swinging them.<br>
But swinging doesn’t bend them down to stay<br>
As ice-storms do. Often you must have seen them<br>
Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning<br>
After a rain. They click upon themselves<br>
As the breeze rises, and turn many-coloured<br>
As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.<br>
Soon the sun’s warmth makes them shed crystal shells<br>
Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust—<br>
Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away<br>
You’d think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.<br>
They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load,<br>
And they seem not to break; though once they are bowed<br>
So low for long, they never right themselves:<br>
You may see their trunks arching in the woods<br>
Years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground<br>
Like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair<br>
Before them over their heads to dry in the sun.</p>

          <strong>Birches</strong>
        </p>
        <p>When I see birches bend to left and right<br>
Across the lines of straighter darker trees,<br>
I like to think some boy’s been swinging them.<br>
But swinging doesn’t bend them down to stay<br>
As ice-storms do. Often you must have seen them<br>
Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning<br>
After a rain. They click upon themselves<br>
As the breeze rises, and turn many-coloured<br>
As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.<br>
Soon the sun’s warmth makes them shed crystal shells<br>
Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust—<br>
Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away<br>
You’d think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.<br>
They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load,<br>
And they seem not to break; though once they are bowed<br>
So low for long, they never right themselves:<br>
You may see their trunks arching in the woods<br>
Years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground<br>
Like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair<br>
Before them over their heads to dry in the sun.</p>

        <p>When I see birches bend to left and right<br>
Across the lines of straighter darker trees,<br>
I like to think some boy’s been swinging them.<br>
But swinging doesn’t bend them down to stay<br>
As ice-storms do. Often you must have seen them<br>
Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning<br>
After a rain. They click upon themselves<br>
As the breeze rises, and turn many-coloured<br>
As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.<br>
Soon the sun’s warmth makes them shed crystal shells<br>
Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust—<br>
Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away<br>
You’d think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.<br>
They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load,<br>
And they seem not to break; though once they are bowed<br>
So low for long, they never right themselves:<br>
You may see their trunks arching in the woods<br>
Years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground<br>
Like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair<br>
Before them over their heads to dry in the sun.</p>

        <p><strong>Jack in the Pulpit</strong><br>
(Arisaema triphyllum)&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Lynne Bittner, a botanical illustrator, frequently encounters many people at art and craft shows in New England who share a fascination with early spring woodland wildflowers. <strong>(A)</strong>&nbsp;……………&nbsp; This preference may stem from its unique appearance and the nostalgic memories it evokes of a simpler time. Bittner herself was first introduced to Jack-in-the-Pulpit as a child, during a memorable adventure in the woods. The plant’s distinctive look, with its striped spathe and protruding spadix, left a lasting impression on her and her friends.</p>
        <p>The Jack-in-the-Pulpit is easily recognized by its peculiar structure, which includes a spathe that surrounds a spadix. The plant’s common names, such as cuckoo pint and dog’s dilly, hint at its whimsical nature in folklore. This wildflower’s unique design not only makes it visually striking but also functional for its survival. <strong>(B)</strong>&nbsp;……………&nbsp; However, this allure can sometimes be a trap for the insects, ensuring that pollination occurs, even if it means some insects may not escape.</p>
        <p>Despite its beauty, Jack-in-the-Pulpit is not meant for consumption. The plant contains crystalline calcium oxalate, a substance that can cause intense burning sensations and severe gastric distress if ingested. Native Americans utilized the plant for various medicinal purposes and even reportedly used it to create traps for their enemies. <strong>(C)</strong> …………….&nbsp; The entire plant, including its berries, contains this toxic substance, with the highest concentration found in its root or corm.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, Jack-in-the-Pulpit can change its sex from year to year based on nutritional availability. Male plants, which require less nutrition, produce pollen, while female plants, needing more resources, produce seeds and fruit. <strong>(D)</strong> …………….&nbsp; When conditions are favourable, female plants will also produce additional leaves to maximize nutrient intake through photosynthesis. This dynamic ability to switch between male and female forms highlights the plant’s resilience and evolutionary strategy.</p>
        <p>The plant’s pollination strategy is equally fascinating. Jack-in-the-Pulpit relies primarily on fungus gnats, which are attracted by the spadix’s mushroom-like scent. The structure of the spathe confuses the gnats, leading them to the base where they can become trapped. Male spathes have an exit hole allowing pollen-laden gnats to escape, while female spathes do not, ensuring that the gnats final act is to pollinate the female flowers. <strong>(E)</strong> …………….&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Bittner concludes that Jack-in-the-Pulpit, with its unique characteristics and adaptive strategies, has successfully carved out a niche for itself in the woodland ecosystem. <strong>(F)</strong> ……………&nbsp; Protecting these wildflowers is crucial to preserving the beauty and biodiversity of our woodlands. By appreciating and conserving such plants, we can ensure that future generations will also be able to marvel at the wonders of the Jack-in-the-Pulpit and other woodland wildflowers.</p>

<br>
A family is a group of people related to each other by blood or inheritance. These people are not only connected by blood but also by compassion, love and support. A person’s personality and character are formed by their family. There are different types of families in today’s culture: immediate and extended families, including nuclear families, single-parent families, spouses, grandparents, cousins, and others. The word ‘family’ is synonymous with trust, comfort, love, care, happiness and belonging. The members in a family are connected from the moment they are born into the world. The people who care for you and support you as you grow up are the people you call family and will be your lifeline. Family plays an important role in determining a person’s success, as it is a vital support system and a source of encouragement.<br>

<br>
‘Bonds of Friendship’ is a 1.5-metre by 1-metre polished bronze statue, built in 1979 and located in Circular Quay, New South Wales, Australia. Looking at this sculpture, I began to think about the relationships that exist between friends. Perhaps, because I was the youngest by five years in a family of three boys, I was raised as an ‘only child’ and always found it difficult to mix with children of my own age. When I was fifteen, my mother took me to the island of Madeira for the summer holidays, where I was forced to join the games of the children of a Belgian family staying at the same hotel. Anne Francoise, the eldest sister in this close-knit family of two boys and two girls, took me under her wing, and we became close friends. It was a new and marvellous experience for me to talk to a girl of my own age with whom I was totally at ease. A few months later, I left England for Australia. Anne and I sadly lost touch with each other, but the joy of having a close friend, which she had introduced into my life, awoke me to the understanding of what a great gift it is to share ‘trust’ between friends. These are the feelings I wanted to express with a symbol. I found it by creating the strongest chain possible. The ‘Bonds of Friendship’ is a chain with only two links, locked so tightly together that it is inseparable, thus able to withstand all the pressures of life.<br>

<br>
People are social creatures, and living in a community means that we have to live and cooperate with other people. This means that we need to adapt to what is socially desirable and accepted. A certain level of conformity to rules and social conventions is necessary to prevent things from ending in chaos. I am glad most people conform to road rules for instance, or that we conform to the social habit of putting on clothes before we go out. Imagine what would happen if we didn’t conform in these cases. So, in many cases, conformity can be helpful. It makes society run more or less smoothly and it helps us fit in and function properly. On the other hand, living in a free society offers us all the space to develop our individuality – to become who we want to be, pursue our own dreams, make plans, and take initiatives; to have our own beliefs and opinions, and to speak out openly. We not only appreciate that, but it is also widely promoted to be ‘your own unique and authentic self’. In the end, it all comes down to this: is our individualism greater than our need to belong?<br>

Jenny was thirteen when a large dust storm rolled into her central California town in December 1977. Bedridden after contracting a life-threatening illness in the storm and suffering a shocking loss, Jenny realises that she will never be cared for by the mother who both neglects and terrifies her, or by the father who allows it. She relies on her cousin, Heather, who has the loving home Jenny longs for; her beloved great-uncle, Gino, the last link between generations; her best friend, Henry, a free spirit with whom she shares an inexplicable bond; and earnest baseball star, Billy, who becomes her first love. Spanning three decades, ‘Belonging’ is about first love and heartbreak, friendship and secrets, family and forgiveness, hometowns and coming of age, and memory and music. The heart of the story is Jenny’s struggle to undo the binds of a childhood that have deeply affected her life, the painful path to love endured by children raised in alcoholic families, and the grim reality of believing you must hide a part of yourself in order to belong.&nbsp;<br>

          <br>
          <strong>Birches</strong>
        </p>
        <p>When I see birches bend to left and right<br>
Across the lines of straighter darker trees,<br>
I like to think some boy’s been swinging them.<br>
But swinging doesn’t bend them down to stay<br>
As ice-storms do. Often you must have seen them<br>
Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning<br>
After a rain. They click upon themselves<br>
As the breeze rises, and turn many-coloured<br>
As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.<br>
Soon the sun’s warmth makes them shed crystal shells<br>
Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust—<br>
Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away<br>
You’d think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.<br>
They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load,<br>
And they seem not to break; though once they are bowed<br>
So low for long, they never right themselves:<br>
You may see their trunks arching in the woods<br>
Years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground<br>
Like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair<br>
Before them over their heads to dry in the sun.</p>

Walking the Yukon Trail</strong><br><br><strong>(A)</strong>&nbsp; ………..&nbsp; The name "Yukon Trail" conjures images of a rugged, pristine vastness, lying deep in the wilderness along the border between Alaska and the mountains of western Canada. It should because they were carved into the Yukon to give gold prospectors access to the previously inaccessible reaches of that beautiful but forbidding country. Some of these trails still exist, giving hikers the opportunity to explore the landscape of the Yukon.</p>
        <p><strong>(B)</strong>&nbsp; ………..&nbsp; Strictly speaking, there are multiple "Yukon Trails," or routes used by prospectors and settlers seeking access to the depths of the Yukon during the Klondike Gold Rush. These include the Overland Trail in Canada and the international Chilkoot Trail. No modern trail in the Yukon actually bears the name "The Yukon Trail."</p>
        <p><span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span><strong>(C)​<span style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</strong> ………..&nbsp; Chilkoot Trail is possibly the most accessible because it connects the US Klondike Gold Rush National Historic Park with Canada's Chilkoot Trail National Historic Site – both ends of the trail are in a national park facility. Although the trail is only 33 miles long, its difficult terrain and strenuous nature make hiking it a backpacking and camping expedition. According to the Parks Canada, just hiking the almost 8 miles from Sheep Camp to Happy Camp takes 12 hours.</p>
        <p><strong>(D)&nbsp;</strong> ………..&nbsp; Another Yukon trail is the Dawson Overland Trail, perhaps best known for its part of the famed Yukon Quest dog-sledding race. The modern trail runs 70 miles from Whitehorse and Braeburn Lodge, entirely within the Canadian Yukon. However, the classic Overland Trail ran all the way to Dawson City, near the US-Canadian border, and from there into Alaska. This route started as a dog-sledding freight path and is now used by hikers, horseback riders, dog-sledders and snowmobilers.</p>
        <p><strong>(E)&nbsp;</strong> ………..&nbsp; The Yukon is a habitat for both grizzly and black bears, so safety precautions must be followed. The National Park Service requests that all hikers on Chilkoot Trail use their bear-safe food containers and camp only in designated areas. If this is not possible, hang your food in its container some distance from the camp using a rope and a bear pole, so it is both out of reach and a safe distance away. Make plenty of noise while hiking to give bears warning of your approach.</p>
        <p><strong>(F)&nbsp;</strong> ………..&nbsp; Due to frigid temperatures, heavy snowfall and the risk of avalanche, hiking on the Chilkoot Trail in winter is not recommended by either US or Canadian park authorities. Snows persist in the upper reaches of the trail well into June, so the Chilkoot hiking season is between mid-June and late September. The Dawson route, on the other hand, is open all year to hikers using snowshoes.</p>

          <em>Read the extract below then answer the questions.</em>
        </p>
        <p>After a particularly fierce blow, he crawled to his feet, too dazed to rush. He staggered Alimply about, the blood flowing from nose and mouth and ears, his beautiful coat sprayed and flecked with bloody slaver. Then the man advanced and deliberately dealt him a frightful blow on the nose. All the pain he had endured was as nothing compared with the exquisite agony of this. With a roar that was almost lionlike in its ferocity, he again hurled himself at the man. But the man, shifting the club from right to left, coolly caught him by the under jaw, at the same time wrenching downward and backward. Buck described a complete circle in the air, and half of another, then crashed to the ground on his head and chest.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For the last time he rushed. The man struck the shrewd blow he had purposely withheld for so long, and Buck crumpled up and went down, knocked utterly senseless.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“He’s no slouch at dog-breakin’, that’s wot I say,” one of the men on the wall cried enthusiastically.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Druther break cayuses any day, and twice on Sundays,” was the reply of the driver, as he climbed on the wagon and started the horses.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Buck’s senses came back to him, but not his strength. He lay where he had fallen, and from there he watched the man in the red sweater.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“‘Answers to the name of Buck,’” the man soliloquized, quoting from the saloon-keeper’s letter which had announced the consignment of the crate and contents. “Well, Buck, my boy,” he went on in a genial voice, “we’ve had our little ruction, and the best thing we can do is to let it go at that. You’ve learned your place, and I know mine. Be a good dog and all ’ll go well and the goose hang high. Be a bad dog, and I’ll whale the stuffin’ outa you. Understand?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As he spoke he fearlessly patted the head he had so mercilessly pounded, and though Buck’s hair involuntarily bristled at touch of the hand, he endured it without protest. When the man brought him water he drank eagerly, and later bolted a generous meal of raw meat, chunk by chunk, from the man’s hand.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He was beaten (he knew that); but he was not broken. He saw, once for all, that he stood no chance against a man with a club. He had learned the lesson, and in all his after life he never forgot it. That club was a revelation. It was his introduction to the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>reign of primitive law</strong></span>, and he met the introduction halfway. The facts of life took on a fiercer aspect; and while he faced that aspect uncowed, he faced it with all the latent cunning of his nature aroused. As the days went by, other dogs came, in crates and at the ends of ropes, some docilely, and some raging and roaring as he had come; and, one and all, he watched them pass under the dominion of the man in the red sweater. Again and again, as he looked at each brutal performance, the lesson was driven home to Buck: a man with a club was a lawgiver, a master to be obeyed, though not necessarily conciliated. Of this last Buck was never guilty, though he did see beaten dogs that fawned upon the man, and wagged their tails, and licked his hand. Also he saw one dog, that would neither conciliate nor obey, finally killed in the struggle for mastery.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now and again men came, strangers, who talked excitedly, wheedlingly, and in all kinds of fashions to the man in the red sweater. And at such times that money passed between them the strangers took one or more of the dogs away with them. Buck wondered where they went, for they never came back; but the fear of the future was strong upon him, and he was glad each time when he was not selected.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Yet his time came, in the end, in the form of a little weazened man who spat broken English and many strange and uncouth exclamations which Buck could not understand.</p>

          <em>Read the extract below then answer the questions.</em>
        </p>
        <p>After a particularly fierce blow, he crawled to his feet, too dazed to rush. He staggered Alimply about, the blood flowing from nose and mouth and ears, his beautiful coat sprayed and flecked with bloody slaver. Then the man advanced and deliberately dealt him a frightful blow on the nose. All the pain he had endured was as nothing compared with the exquisite agony of this. With a roar that was almost lionlike in its ferocity, he again hurled himself at the man. But the man, shifting the club from right to left, coolly caught him by the under jaw, at the same time wrenching downward and backward. Buck described a complete circle in the air, and half of another, then crashed to the ground on his head and chest.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For the last time he rushed. The man struck the shrewd blow he had purposely withheld for so long, and Buck crumpled up and went down, knocked utterly senseless.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“He’s no slouch at dog-breakin’, that’s wot I say,” one of the men on the wall cried enthusiastically.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Druther break cayuses any day, and twice on Sundays,” was the reply of the driver, as he climbed on the wagon and started the horses.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Buck’s senses came back to him, but not his strength. He lay where he had fallen, and from there he watched the man in the red sweater.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“‘Answers to the name of Buck,’” the man soliloquized, quoting from the saloon-keeper’s letter which had announced the consignment of the crate and contents. “Well, Buck, my boy,” he went on in a genial voice, “we’ve had our little ruction, and the best thing we can do is to let it go at that. You’ve learned your place, and I know mine. Be a good dog and all ’ll go well and the goose hang high. Be a bad dog, and I’ll whale the stuffin’ outa you. Understand?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As he spoke he fearlessly patted the head he had so mercilessly pounded, and though Buck’s hair involuntarily bristled at touch of the hand, he endured it without protest. When the man brought him water he drank eagerly, and later bolted a generous meal of raw meat, chunk by chunk, from the man’s hand.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He was beaten (he knew that); but he was not broken. He saw, once for all, that he stood no chance against a man with a club. He had learned the lesson, and in all his after life he never forgot it. That club was a revelation. It was his introduction to the&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline"><strong>reign of primitive law</strong></span>, and he met the introduction halfway. The facts of life took on a fiercer aspect; and while he faced that aspect uncowed, he faced it with all the latent cunning of his nature aroused. As the days went by, other dogs came, in crates and at the ends of ropes, some docilely, and some raging and roaring as he had come; and, one and all, he watched them pass under the dominion of the man in the red sweater. Again and again, as he looked at each brutal performance, the lesson was driven home to Buck: a man with a club was a lawgiver, a master to be obeyed, though not necessarily conciliated. Of this last Buck was never guilty, though he did see beaten dogs that fawned upon the man, and wagged their tails, and licked his hand. Also he saw one dog, that would neither conciliate nor obey, finally killed in the struggle for mastery.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now and again men came, strangers, who talked excitedly, wheedlingly, and in all kinds of fashions to the man in the red sweater. And at such times that money passed between them the strangers took one or more of the dogs away with them. Buck wondered where they went, for they never came back; but the fear of the future was strong upon him, and he was glad each time when he was not selected.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Yet his time came, in the end, in the form of a little weazened man who spat broken English and many strange and uncouth exclamations which Buck could not understand.</p>

        <p>For the last time he rushed. The man struck the shrewd blow he had purposely withheld for so long, and Buck crumpled up and went down, knocked utterly senseless.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“He’s no slouch at dog-breakin’, that’s wot I say,” one of the men on the wall cried enthusiastically.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Druther break cayuses any day, and twice on Sundays,” was the reply of the driver, as he climbed on the wagon and started the horses.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Buck’s senses came back to him, but not his strength. He lay where he had fallen, and from there he watched the man in the red sweater.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“‘Answers to the name of Buck,’” the man soliloquized, quoting from the saloon-keeper’s letter which had announced the consignment of the crate and contents. “Well, Buck, my boy,” he went on in a genial voice, “we’ve had our little ruction, and the best thing we can do is to let it go at that. You’ve learned your place, and I know mine. Be a good dog and all ’ll go well and the goose hang high. Be a bad dog, and I’ll whale the stuffin’ outa you. Understand?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As he spoke he fearlessly patted the head he had so mercilessly pounded, and though Buck’s hair involuntarily bristled at touch of the hand, he endured it without protest. When the man brought him water he drank eagerly, and later bolted a generous meal of raw meat, chunk by chunk, from the man’s hand.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He was beaten (he knew that); but he was not broken. He saw, once for all, that he stood no chance against a man with a club. He had learned the lesson, and in all his after life he never forgot it. That club was a revelation. It was his introduction to the&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline"><strong>reign of primitive law</strong></span>, and he met the introduction halfway. The facts of life took on a fiercer aspect; and while he faced that aspect uncowed, he faced it with all the latent cunning of his nature aroused. As the days went by, other dogs came, in crates and at the ends of ropes, some docilely, and some raging and roaring as he had come; and, one and all, he watched them pass under the dominion of the man in the red sweater. Again and again, as he looked at each brutal performance, the lesson was driven home to Buck: a man with a club was a lawgiver, a master to be obeyed, though not necessarily conciliated. Of this last Buck was never guilty, though he did see beaten dogs that fawned upon the man, and wagged their tails, and licked his hand. Also he saw one dog, that would neither conciliate nor obey, finally killed in the struggle for mastery.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now and again men came, strangers, who talked excitedly, wheedlingly, and in all kinds of fashions to the man in the red sweater. And at such times that money passed between them the strangers took one or more of the dogs away with them. Buck wondered where they went, for they never came back; but the fear of the future was strong upon him, and he was glad each time when he was not selected.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Yet his time came, in the end, in the form of a little weazened man who spat broken English and many strange and uncouth exclamations which Buck could not understand.</p>

        <p>After a particularly fierce blow, he crawled to his feet, too dazed to rush. He staggered Alimply about, the blood flowing from nose and mouth and ears, his beautiful coat sprayed and flecked with bloody slaver. Then the man advanced and deliberately dealt him a frightful blow on the nose. All the pain he had endured was as nothing compared with the exquisite agony of this. With a roar that was almost lionlike in its ferocity, he again hurled himself at the man.

          <em>Read the extract below then answer the questions.</em>
        </p>
        <p>After a particularly fierce blow, he crawled to his feet, too dazed to rush. He staggered Alimply about, the blood flowing from nose and mouth and ears, his beautiful coat sprayed and flecked with bloody slaver. Then the man advanced and deliberately dealt him a frightful blow on the nose. All the pain he had endured was as nothing compared with the exquisite agony of this. With a roar that was almost lionlike in its ferocity, he again hurled himself at the man. But the man, shifting the club from right to left, coolly caught him by the under jaw, at the same time wrenching downward and backward. Buck described a complete circle in the air, and half of another, then crashed to the ground on his head and chest.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For the last time he rushed. The man struck the shrewd blow he had purposely withheld for so long, and Buck crumpled up and went down, knocked utterly senseless.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“He’s no slouch at dog-breakin’, that’s wot I say,” one of the men on the wall cried enthusiastically.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Druther break cayuses any day, and twice on Sundays,” was the reply of the driver, as he climbed on the wagon and started the horses.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Buck’s senses came back to him, but not his strength. He lay where he had fallen, and from there he watched the man in the red sweater.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“‘Answers to the name of Buck,’” the man soliloquized, quoting from the saloon-keeper’s letter which had announced the consignment of the crate and contents. “Well, Buck, my boy,” he went on in a genial voice, “we’ve had our little ruction, and the best thing we can do is to let it go at that. You’ve learned your place, and I know mine. Be a good dog and all ’ll go well and the goose hang high. Be a bad dog, and I’ll whale the stuffin’ outa you. Understand?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As he spoke he fearlessly patted the head he had so mercilessly pounded, and though Buck’s hair involuntarily bristled at touch of the hand, he endured it without protest. When the man brought him water he drank eagerly, and later bolted a generous meal of raw meat, chunk by chunk, from the man’s hand.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He was beaten (he knew that); but he was not broken. He saw, once for all, that he stood no chance against a man with a club. He had learned the lesson, and in all his after life he never forgot it. That club was a revelation. It was his introduction to the&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline"><strong>reign of primitive law</strong></span>, and he met the introduction halfway. The facts of life took on a fiercer aspect; and while he faced that aspect uncowed, he faced it with all the latent cunning of his nature aroused. As the days went by, other dogs came, in crates and at the ends of ropes, some docilely, and some raging and roaring as he had come; and, one and all, he watched them pass under the dominion of the man in the red sweater. Again and again, as he looked at each brutal performance, the lesson was driven home to Buck: a man with a club was a lawgiver, a master to be obeyed, though not necessarily conciliated. Of this last Buck was never guilty, though he did see beaten dogs that fawned upon the man, and wagged their tails, and licked his hand. Also he saw one dog, that would neither conciliate nor obey, finally killed in the struggle for mastery.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now and again men came, strangers, who talked excitedly, wheedlingly, and in all kinds of fashions to the man in the red sweater. And at such times that money passed between them the strangers took one or more of the dogs away with them. Buck wondered where they went, for they never came back; but the fear of the future was strong upon him, and he was glad each time when he was not selected.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Yet his time came, in the end, in the form of a little weazened man who spat broken English and many strange and uncouth exclamations which Buck could not understand.</p>

          <strong>Birches</strong>
        </p>
        <p>When I see birches bend to left and right<br>
Across the lines of straighter darker trees,<br>
I like to think some boy’s been swinging them.<br>
But swinging doesn’t bend them down to stay<br>
As ice-storms do. Often you must have seen them<br>
Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning<br>
After a rain. They click upon themselves<br>
As the breeze rises, and turn many-coloured<br>
As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.<br>
Soon the sun’s warmth makes them shed crystal shells<br>
Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust—<br>
Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away<br>
You’d think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.<br>
They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load,<br>
And they seem not to break; though once they are bowed<br>
So low for long, they never right themselves:<br>
You may see their trunks arching in the woods<br>
Years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground<br>
Like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair<br>
Before them over their heads to dry in the sun.</p>

          <strong>Birches</strong>
        </p>
        <p>When I see birches bend to left and right<br>
Across the lines of straighter darker trees,<br>
I like to think some boy’s been swinging them.<br>
But swinging doesn’t bend them down to stay<br>
As ice-storms do. Often you must have seen them<br>
Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning<br>
After a rain. They click upon themselves<br>
As the breeze rises, and turn many-coloured<br>
As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.<br>
Soon the sun’s warmth makes them shed crystal shells<br>
Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust—<br>
Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away<br>
You’d think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.<br>
They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load,<br>
And they seem not to break; though once they are bowed<br>
So low for long, they never right themselves:<br>
You may see their trunks arching in the woods<br>
Years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground<br>
Like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair<br>
Before them over their heads to dry in the sun.</p>

        <p><strong>Jack in the Pulpit</strong><br>
(Arisaema triphyllum)&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Lynne Bittner, a botanical illustrator, frequently encounters many people at art and craft shows in New England who share a fascination with early spring woodland wildflowers. <strong>(A)</strong>&nbsp;……………&nbsp; This preference may stem from its unique appearance and the nostalgic memories it evokes of a simpler time. Bittner herself was first introduced to Jack-in-the-Pulpit as a child, during a memorable adventure in the woods. The plant’s distinctive look, with its striped spathe and protruding spadix, left a lasting impression on her and her friends.</p>
        <p>The Jack-in-the-Pulpit is easily recognized by its peculiar structure, which includes a spathe that surrounds a spadix. The plant’s common names, such as cuckoo pint and dog’s dilly, hint at its whimsical nature in folklore. This wildflower’s unique design not only makes it visually striking but also functional for its survival. <strong>(B)</strong>&nbsp;……………&nbsp; However, this allure can sometimes be a trap for the insects, ensuring that pollination occurs, even if it means some insects may not escape.</p>
        <p>Despite its beauty, Jack-in-the-Pulpit is not meant for consumption. The plant contains crystalline calcium oxalate, a substance that can cause intense burning sensations and severe gastric distress if ingested. Native Americans utilized the plant for various medicinal purposes and even reportedly used it to create traps for their enemies. <strong>(C)</strong> …………….&nbsp; The entire plant, including its berries, contains this toxic substance, with the highest concentration found in its root or corm.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, Jack-in-the-Pulpit can change its sex from year to year based on nutritional availability. Male plants, which require less nutrition, produce pollen, while female plants, needing more resources, produce seeds and fruit. <strong>(D)</strong> …………….&nbsp; When conditions are favourable, female plants will also produce additional leaves to maximize nutrient intake through photosynthesis. This dynamic ability to switch between male and female forms highlights the plant’s resilience and evolutionary strategy.</p>
        <p>The plant’s pollination strategy is equally fascinating. Jack-in-the-Pulpit relies primarily on fungus gnats, which are attracted by the spadix’s mushroom-like scent. The structure of the spathe confuses the gnats, leading them to the base where they can become trapped. Male spathes have an exit hole allowing pollen-laden gnats to escape, while female spathes do not, ensuring that the gnats final act is to pollinate the female flowers. <strong>(E)</strong> …………….&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Bittner concludes that Jack-in-the-Pulpit, with its unique characteristics and adaptive strategies, has successfully carved out a niche for itself in the woodland ecosystem. <strong>(F)</strong> ……………&nbsp; Protecting these wildflowers is crucial to preserving the beauty and biodiversity of our woodlands. By appreciating and conserving such plants, we can ensure that future generations will also be able to marvel at the wonders of the Jack-in-the-Pulpit and other woodland wildflowers.</p>

<br>
A family is a group of people related to each other by blood or inheritance. These people are not only connected by blood but also by compassion, love and support. A person’s personality and character are formed by their family. There are different types of families in today’s culture: immediate and extended families, including nuclear families, single-parent families, spouses, grandparents, cousins, and others. The word ‘family’ is synonymous with trust, comfort, love, care, happiness and belonging. The members in a family are connected from the moment they are born into the world. The people who care for you and support you as you grow up are the people you call family and will be your lifeline. Family plays an important role in determining a person’s success, as it is a vital support system and a source of encouragement.<br>

<br>
‘Bonds of Friendship’ is a 1.5-metre by 1-metre polished bronze statue, built in 1979 and located in Circular Quay, New South Wales, Australia. Looking at this sculpture, I began to think about the relationships that exist between friends. Perhaps, because I was the youngest by five years in a family of three boys, I was raised as an ‘only child’ and always found it difficult to mix with children of my own age. When I was fifteen, my mother took me to the island of Madeira for the summer holidays, where I was forced to join the games of the children of a Belgian family staying at the same hotel. Anne Francoise, the eldest sister in this close-knit family of two boys and two girls, took me under her wing, and we became close friends. It was a new and marvellous experience for me to talk to a girl of my own age with whom I was totally at ease. A few months later, I left England for Australia. Anne and I sadly lost touch with each other, but the joy of having a close friend, which she had introduced into my life, awoke me to the understanding of what a great gift it is to share ‘trust’ between friends. These are the feelings I wanted to express with a symbol. I found it by creating the strongest chain possible. The ‘Bonds of Friendship’ is a chain with only two links, locked so tightly together that it is inseparable, thus able to withstand all the pressures of life.<br>
<br>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of bonds of connection. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
People are social creatures, and living in a community means that we have to live and cooperate with other people. This means that we need to adapt to what is socially desirable and accepted. A certain level of conformity to rules and social conventions is necessary to prevent things from ending in chaos. I am glad most people conform to road rules for instance, or that we conform to the social habit of putting on clothes before we go out. Imagine what would happen if we didn’t conform in these cases. So, in many cases, conformity can be helpful. It makes society run more or less smoothly and it helps us fit in and function properly. On the other hand, living in a free society offers us all the space to develop our individuality – to become who we want to be, pursue our own dreams, make plans, and take initiatives; to have our own beliefs and opinions, and to speak out openly. We not only appreciate that, but it is also widely promoted to be ‘your own unique and authentic self’. In the end, it all comes down to this: is our individualism greater than our need to belong?<br>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of bonds of connection. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Jenny was thirteen when a large dust storm rolled into her central California town in December 1977. Bedridden after contracting a life-threatening illness in the storm and suffering a shocking loss, Jenny realises that she will never be cared for by the mother who both neglects and terrifies her, or by the father who allows it. She relies on her cousin, Heather, who has the loving home Jenny longs for; her beloved great-uncle, Gino, the last link between generations; her best friend, Henry, a free spirit with whom she shares an inexplicable bond; and earnest baseball star, Billy, who becomes her first love. Spanning three decades, ‘Belonging’ is about first love and heartbreak, friendship and secrets, family and forgiveness, hometowns and coming of age, and memory and music. The heart of the story is Jenny’s struggle to undo the binds of a childhood that have deeply affected her life, the painful path to love endured by children raised in alcoholic families, and the grim reality of believing you must hide a part of yourself in order to belong.&nbsp;<br>

        <p>By evening Perrault secured another dog, an old husky, long and lean and gaunt, with a battle-scarred face and a single eye which flashed a warning of prowess that commanded respect. He was called Sol-leks, which means the Angry One. Like Dave, he asked nothing, gave nothing, expected nothing; and when he marched slowly and deliberately into their midst, even Spitz left him alone. He had one peculiarity which Buck was unlucky enough to discover. He did not like to be approached on his blind side. Of this offence Buck was unwittingly guilty, and the first knowledge he had of his indiscretion was when Sol-leks whirled upon him and slashed his shoulder to the bone for three inches up and down. Forever after Buck avoided his blind side, and to the last of their comradeship had no more trouble. His only apparent ambition, like Dave’s, was to be left alone; though, as Buck was afterward to learn, each of them possessed one other and even more vital ambition.</p>
        <p>That night Buck faced the great problem of sleeping. The tent, illumined by a candle, glowed warmly in the midst of the white plain; and when he, as a matter of course, entered it, both Perrault and François bombarded him with curses and cooking utensils, till he recovered from his consternation and fled ignominiously into the outer cold. A chill wind was blowing that nipped him sharply and bit with especial venom into his wounded shoulder. He lay down on the snow and attempted to sleep, but the frost soon drove him shivering to his feet. Miserable and disconsolate, he wandered about among the many tents, only to find that one place was as cold as another. Here and there savage dogs rushed upon him, but he bristled his neck-hair and snarled (for he was learning fast), and they let him go his way unmolested.</p>
        <p>Finally an idea came to him. He would return and see how his own team-mates were making out. To his astonishment, they had disappeared. Again he wandered about through the great camp, looking for them, and again he returned. Were they in the tent? No, that could not be, else he would not have been driven out. Then where could they possibly be? With drooping tail and shivering body, very forlorn indeed, he aimlessly circled the tent. Suddenly the snow gave way beneath his fore legs and he sank down. Something wriggled under his feet. He sprang back, bristling and snarling, fearful of the unseen and unknown. But a friendly little yelp reassured him, and he went back to investigate. A whiff of warm air ascended to his nostrils, and there, curled up under the snow in a snug ball, lay Billee. He whined placatingly, squirmed and wriggled to show his good will and intentions, and even ventured, as a bribe for peace, to lick Buck’s face with his warm wet tongue.</p>
        <p>Another lesson. So that was the way they did it, eh? Buck confidently selected a spot, and with much fuss and waste effort proceeded to dig a hole for himself. In a trice the heat from his body filled the confined space and he was asleep. The day had been long and arduous, and he slept soundly and comfortably, though he growled and barked and wrestled with bad dreams.</p>
        <p>Nor did he open his eyes till roused by the noises of the waking camp. At first he did not know where he was. It had snowed during the night and he was completely buried. The snow walls pressed him on every side, and a great surge of fear swept through him—the fear of the wild thing for the trap. It was a token that he was harking back through his own life to the lives of his forebears; for he was a civilized dog, an unduly civilized dog, and of his own experience knew no trap and so could not of himself fear it. The muscles of his whole body contracted spasmodically and instinctively, the hair on his neck and shoulders stood on end, and with a ferocious snarl he bounded straight up <span class="txt-underline"><strong>into the blinding day</strong></span>, the snow flying about him in a flashing cloud. Ere he landed on his feet, he saw the white camp spread out before him and knew where he was and remembered all that had passed from the time he went for a stroll with Manuel to the hole he had dug for himself the night before.</p>
