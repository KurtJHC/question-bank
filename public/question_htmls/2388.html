          <strong>The Osage Firebird</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>By Sudipta Bardhan</em><br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a child, Betty Marie Tallchief listened for hours to her grandmother’s stories of fire spirits and animals that could talk. Much of what Betty Marie knew about her Osage heritage came from Grandmother Tall Chief. She never forgot the tales, or the pride, that she learned at her grandmother’s feet.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Born in 1925, Betty Marie spent part of her childhood on an Osage reservation in Oklahoma. She saw herself as “a typical Indian girl-shy, docile, introverted.” Ballet brought her out of her shell. She took her first ballet lesson when she was four years old. From that moment, Betty Marie had her heart set on becoming a ballerina.<br>
<br>
<strong>Talent Isn’t Enough</strong></p>
        <p>Betty Marie soon became a local star, performing at rodeos and county fairs. Her natural talent made it easy for her to learn everything taught by her hometown dance instructor. But Betty Marie soon learned that having talent wasn't enough to make her a success. There was always more work to do.</p>
        <p>One instructor said that despite her talent, she hadn't properly learned the basics. “He insisted we go back to the beginning,” she explained. At first, Betty Marie was frustrated by this criticism. But she soon realized that no matter how well she danced, she could always do better.<br>
<br>
<strong>Facing Prejudice</strong></p>
        <p>Betty Marie's skills grew and grew. People in the world of dancing considered her special. But outside that World, Sometimes she encountered prejudice. When the Tallchief family moved from the reservation to California, Betty Marie was teased because she was a Native American.</p>
        <p>“At Beverly Vista School I was made to feel different,” she remembers. “Some of the students made fun of my last name. A few made war whoops whenever they saw me, and asked why I didn't wear feathers.” Though being singled out because of her race bothered Betty Marie, the teasing did not lessen her pride in being an Osage Indian. She would still announce her name to new classmates with pleasure-Tallchief.<br>
<br>
<strong>What's in a Name?</strong></p>
        <p>Later in her career as a ballerina, Tallchief did change her first name. She began using the name Maria instead of Betty Marie. She thought it sounded more sophisticated. Since most professional ballerinas at the time were white and European, she might have chosen to change her last name as well. A European last name would have seemed more traditional and might have helped her career. But Tallchief refused to deny her heritage. Nothing would ever make her change her last name.<br>
<br>
<strong>Woman of Two Worlds</strong></p>
        <p>Maria Tallchief went on to do great things as a dancer. She became prima ballerina of the New York City Ballet. She was the first American in a century to dance for the Paris Opera Ballet. In 1953, President Eisenhower honored Tallchief, naming her “Woman of the Year.”</p>
        <p>That same year, the state of Oklahoma declared June 29 “Maria Tallchief Day.” She was given a special title by the Osage tribe. Grandmother Tall Chief chose the title, naming Betty Marie Wa-Xth-Thonba, which means “woman of two worlds.”</p>
        <p>Tallchief was touched by this recognition. She knew what her grandmother was saying when she chose that title. “While I was a ballerina with an important career on the stage, I was also her grandchild, an Osage woman and a daughter of the tribe.”</p>
        <p>In her long career, Tallchief's most famous performance was in The Firebird. Based on a Russian folktale, this ballet tells the story of a strange creature that is half woman and half bird. Those who watched her perform said that Tallchief had achieved the unbelievable-she had truly become a bird of fire. As she danced, Tallchief must have remembered her grandmother's voice recounting the Osage legends of fire spirits walking the earth. Performing The Firebird, Tallchief combined her heritage with the ballet, and truly became a woman of two worlds.</p>

<br>
<strong>Woman of Two Worlds</strong></p>
        <p>Maria Tallchief went on to do great things as a dancer. She became prima ballerina of the New York City Ballet. She was the first American in a century to dance for the Paris Opera Ballet. In 1953, President Eisenhower honored Tallchief, naming her “Woman of the Year.”</p>
        <p>That same year, the state of Oklahoma declared June 29 “Maria Tallchief Day.” She was given a special title by the Osage tribe. Grandmother Tall Chief chose the title, naming Betty Marie Wa-Xth-Thonba, which means “woman of two worlds.”</p>
        <p>Tallchief was touched by this recognition. She knew what her grandmother was saying when she chose that title. “While I was a ballerina with an important career on the stage, I was also her grandchild, an Osage woman and a daughter of the tribe.”</p>
        <p>In her long career, Tallchief's most famous performance was in The Firebird. Based on a Russian folktale, this ballet tells the story of a strange creature that is half woman and half bird. Those who watched her perform said that Tallchief had achieved the unbelievable-she had truly become a bird of fire. As she danced, Tallchief must have remembered her grandmother's voice recounting the Osage legends of fire spirits walking the earth. Performing The Firebird, Tallchief combined her heritage with the ballet, and truly became a woman of two worlds.</p>

          <strong>The Osage Firebird</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>By Sudipta Bardhan</em><br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a child, Betty Marie Tallchief listened for hours to her grandmother’s stories of fire spirits and animals that could talk. Much of what Betty Marie knew about her Osage heritage came from Grandmother Tall Chief. She never forgot the tales, or the pride, that she learned at her grandmother’s feet.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Born in 1925, Betty Marie spent part of her childhood on an Osage reservation in Oklahoma. She saw herself as “a typical Indian girl-shy, docile, introverted.” Ballet brought her out of her shell. She took her first ballet lesson when she was four years old. From that moment, Betty Marie had her heart set on becoming a ballerina.<br>
<br>
<strong>Talent Isn’t Enough</strong></p>
        <p>Betty Marie soon became a local star, performing at rodeos and county fairs. Her natural talent made it easy for her to learn everything taught by her hometown dance instructor. But Betty Marie soon learned that having talent wasn't enough to make her a success. There was always more work to do.</p>
        <p>One instructor said that despite her talent, she hadn't properly learned the basics. “He insisted we go back to the beginning,” she explained. At first, Betty Marie was frustrated by this criticism. But she soon realized that no matter how well she danced, she could always do better.<br>
<br>
<strong>Facing Prejudice</strong></p>
        <p>Betty Marie's skills grew and grew. People in the world of dancing considered her special. But outside that World, Sometimes she encountered prejudice. When the Tallchief family moved from the reservation to California, Betty Marie was teased because she was a Native American.</p>
        <p>“At Beverly Vista School I was made to feel different,” she remembers. “Some of the students made fun of my last name. A few made war whoops whenever they saw me, and asked why I didn't wear feathers.” Though being singled out because of her race bothered Betty Marie, the teasing did not lessen her pride in being an Osage Indian. She would still announce her name to new classmates with pleasure-Tallchief.<br>
<br>
<strong>What's in a Name?</strong></p>
        <p>Later in her career as a ballerina, Tallchief did change her first name. She began using the name Maria instead of Betty Marie. She thought it sounded more sophisticated. Since most professional ballerinas at the time were white and European, she might have chosen to change her last name as well. A European last name would have seemed more traditional and might have helped her career. But Tallchief refused to deny her heritage. Nothing would ever make her change her last name.<br>

          <strong>The Osage Firebird</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>By Sudipta Bardhan</em><br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a child, Betty Marie Tallchief listened for hours to her grandmother’s stories of fire spirits and animals that could talk. Much of what Betty Marie knew about her Osage heritage came from Grandmother Tall Chief. She never forgot the tales, or the pride, that she learned at her grandmother’s feet.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Born in 1925, Betty Marie spent part of her childhood on an Osage reservation in Oklahoma. She saw herself as “a typical Indian girl-shy, docile, introverted.” Ballet brought her out of her shell. She took her first ballet lesson when she was four years old. From that moment, Betty Marie had her heart set on becoming a ballerina.<br>
<br>
<strong>Talent Isn’t Enough</strong></p>
        <p>Betty Marie soon became a local star, performing at rodeos and county fairs. Her natural talent made it easy for her to learn everything taught by her hometown dance instructor. But Betty Marie soon learned that having talent wasn't enough to make her a success. There was always more work to do.</p>
        <p>One instructor said that despite her talent, she hadn't properly learned the basics. “He insisted we go back to the beginning,” she explained. At first, Betty Marie was frustrated by this criticism. But she soon realized that no matter how well she danced, she could always do better.<br>
<br>
<strong>Facing Prejudice</strong></p>
        <p>Betty Marie's skills grew and grew. People in the world of dancing considered her special. But outside that World, Sometimes she encountered prejudice. When the Tallchief family moved from the reservation to California, Betty Marie was teased because she was a Native American.</p>
        <p>“At Beverly Vista School I was made to feel different,” she remembers. “Some of the students made fun of my last name. A few made war whoops whenever they saw me, and asked why I didn't wear feathers.” Though being singled out because of her race bothered Betty Marie, the teasing did not lessen her pride in being an Osage Indian. She would still announce her name to new classmates with pleasure-Tallchief.<br>
<br>
<strong>What's in a Name?</strong></p>
        <p>Later in her career as a ballerina, Tallchief did change her first name. She began using the name Maria instead of Betty Marie. She thought it sounded more sophisticated. Since most professional ballerinas at the time were white and European, she might have chosen to change her last name as well. A European last name would have seemed more traditional and might have helped her career. But Tallchief refused to deny her heritage. Nothing would ever make her change her last name.<br>
<br>
<strong>Woman of Two Worlds</strong></p>
        <p>Maria Tallchief went on to do great things as a dancer. She became prima ballerina of the New York City Ballet. She was the first American in a century to dance for the Paris Opera Ballet. In 1953, President Eisenhower honored Tallchief, naming her “Woman of the Year.”</p>
        <p>That same year, the state of Oklahoma declared June 29 “Maria Tallchief Day.” She was given a special title by the Osage tribe. Grandmother Tall Chief chose the title, naming Betty Marie Wa-Xth-Thonba, which means “woman of two worlds.”</p>
        <p>Tallchief was touched by this recognition. She knew what her grandmother was saying when she chose that title. “While I was a ballerina with an important career on the stage, I was also her grandchild, an Osage woman and a daughter of the tribe.”</p>
        <p>In her long career, Tallchief's most famous performance was in The Firebird. Based on a Russian folktale, this ballet tells the story of a strange creature that is half woman and half bird. Those who watched her perform said that Tallchief had achieved the unbelievable-she had truly become a bird of fire. As she danced, Tallchief must have remembered her grandmother's voice recounting the Osage legends of fire spirits walking the earth. Performing The Firebird, Tallchief combined her heritage with the ballet, and truly became a woman of two worlds.</p>

          <strong>Nina the Gorilla</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by John V. Eickhoff</em><br><br>
Nina the gorilla was seven years old when I met her and her companions, Kiki and one other male. When I began working with them, I was doing a research project. My main job was to write down what each gorilla did at a particular time.</p>
        <p>Nina seemed to like me. When I stood outside the cage window, she ambled over to sit beside me. She looked over my shoulder as I wrote. She followed me around.</p>
        <p>The research I did helped me understand the kinds of behavior that are acceptable in a gorilla troop. Gorillas behave differently toward one another, depending on whether the other animal is higher or lower in rank. The troop is led by the highest-ranking male, who is respected by the other gorillas. In the wild, he is responsible for the safety and well-being of the troop.<br>
<br>
<strong>Leader</strong></p>
        <p>Kiki was leader of the gorilla troop that lived at the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle, Washington. Almost from the beginning, he resented my presence.</p>
        <p>When he noticed me, he stiffened his arms and legs to make himself taller. He lifted his head and pressed his lips tightly together. He then strutted back and forth, his hair standing up. All of these behaviors are signals of aggression in gorillas.</p>
        <p>If this didn’t drive me away, he charged and hit the heavy glass that separated us. That is about as aggressive as a gorilla ever gets. This behavior is the same as that of a wild gorilla who is challenged by the actions of another male. Kiki seemed to think I was challenging his position, probably because I am a big man and because of the way Nina reacted to me.</p>
        <p>I tried to ease the tension between us by saying, in gorilla body language, “I recognize your dominance over me.” I did this by avoiding eye contact, turning my face away when he looked at me, and trying to make myself smaller when he approached.<br>
<br>
<strong>Gorilla Language</strong></p>
        <p>Gorillas communicate using body posture, facial expressions, and gestures. They can't speak as we do, partly because their lips, tongues, and vocal cords cannot make many of the sounds of human speech.</p>
        <p>They can make some sounds, about twenty, each of which has a different meaning. For example, a short grunt means, “I am content.” But most of their communication is not by sounds.</p>
        <p>By watching the gorillas closely and spending a lot of time “talking” to them, I found we could communicate on a simple level. I could give them the idea of what I wanted them to do, such as take their vitamin pills or move from one cage to another.</p>
        <p>I learned to tell when they were feeling irritable, content, happy, sad or playful. The gorillas learned that by gesturing they could ask to go outside or tell me that they wanted a certain food.</p>
        <p>It was a crude way to communicate, but it was all we needed.<br>
<br>
<strong>Big News</strong></p>
        <p>After working at the zoo for about six years, I moved to another city but continued to visit. One day, I read in the newspaper that Nina had given birth to her fourth baby. This was exciting news because gorilla births in zoos are fairly rare.</p>
        <p>I was anxious to see Nina and her baby, but it was several months before I got the chance. It had been nearly a year since I had visited the gorillas. I wondered if they would remember me after such a long time.</p>
        <p>As I entered the viewing area, I saw the gorillas foraging for food in their large, brushy yard. Nina was eating about a hundred feet away. As I approached the glass that separated us, she glanced in my direction and immediately froze in mid­chew.</p>
        <p>She tilted her head as if she wanted to confirm that I was really there. She then made the gesture that we had used as our greeting signal-a Jerk of her head while pursing her lips, as though throwing a kiss.</p>
        <p>She was showing me she recognized me. I was surprised she still remembered me, but a bigger surprise was yet to come.<br>
<br>
<strong>Nina's Baby</strong></p>
        <p>I returned her greeting, and she immediately began searching through the tall grass nearby. She soon found what she was looking for.</p>
        <p>Reaching behind a log, she picked up a small bundle of black fur. Placing it on her back, where it clung tightly, she began walking toward me. She glanced up occasionally to make sure I was still there. She smacked her lips in excitement.</p>
        <p>She stopped next to me and sat down. Reaching behind her, she removed her baby from her back and held it toward me. Then she cradled it in her arms, patting it gently on the head.</p>
        <p>She looked at me questioningly and I clapped my hands in approval. The questioning look disappeared, and she seemed content. Through the glass I could hear a grunt of satisfaction.</p>
        <p>She then began to play with the baby, holding up its hands and feet and pointing to its fingers and toes. It was as if she were proudly showing me that it had the right parts.</p>
        <p>Now, each time I see any kind of ape portrayed as a monster, I remember Nina gently showing me her baby’s fingers and toes.</p>

          <strong>Nina the Gorilla</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by John V. Eickhoff</em><br><br>
Nina the gorilla was seven years old when I met her and her companions, Kiki and one other male. When I began working with them, I was doing a research project. My main job was to write down what each gorilla did at a particular time.</p>
        <p>Nina seemed to like me. When I stood outside the cage window, she ambled over to sit beside me. She looked over my shoulder as I wrote. She followed me around.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The research I did helped me understand the kinds of behavior that are acceptable in a gorilla troop. Gorillas behave differently toward one another, depending on whether the other animal is higher or lower in rank. The troop is led by the highest-ranking male, who is respected by the other gorillas. In the wild, he is responsible for the safety and well-being of the troop.<br>
<br>
<strong>Leader</strong></p>
        <p>Kiki was leader of the gorilla troop that lived at the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle, Washington. Almost from the beginning, he resented my presence.</p>
        <p>When he noticed me, he stiffened his arms and legs to make himself taller. He lifted his head and pressed his lips tightly together. He then strutted back and forth, his hair standing up. All of these behaviors are signals of aggression in gorillas.</p>
        <p>If this didn’t drive me away, he charged and hit the heavy glass that separated us. That is about as aggressive as a gorilla ever gets. This behavior is the same as that of a wild gorilla who is challenged by the actions of another male. Kiki seemed to think I was challenging his position, probably because I am a big man and because of the way Nina reacted to me.</p>
        <p>I tried to ease the tension between us by saying, in gorilla body language, “I recognize your dominance over me.” I did this by avoiding eye contact, turning my face away when he looked at me, and trying to make myself smaller when he approached.<br>
<br>
<strong>Gorilla Language</strong></p>
        <p>Gorillas communicate using body posture, facial expressions, and gestures. They can't speak as we do, partly because their lips, tongues, and vocal cords cannot make many of the sounds of human speech.</p>
        <p>They can make some sounds, about twenty, each of which has a different meaning. For example, a short grunt means, “I am content.” But most of their communication is not by sounds.</p>
        <p>By watching the gorillas closely and spending a lot of time “talking” to them, I found we could communicate on a simple level. I could give them the idea of what I wanted them to do, such as take their vitamin pills or move from one cage to another.</p>
        <p>I learned to tell when they were feeling irritable, content, happy, sad or playful. The gorillas learned that by gesturing they could ask to go outside or tell me that they wanted a certain food.</p>
        <p>It was a crude way to communicate, but it was all we needed.<br>
<br>
<strong>Big News</strong></p>
        <p>After working at the zoo for about six years, I moved to another city but continued to visit. One day, I read in the newspaper that Nina had given birth to her fourth baby. This was exciting news because gorilla births in zoos are fairly rare.</p>
        <p>I was anxious to see Nina and her baby, but it was several months before I got the chance. It had been nearly a year since I had visited the gorillas. I wondered if they would remember me after such a long time.</p>
        <p>As I entered the viewing area, I saw the gorillas foraging for food in their large, brushy yard. Nina was eating about a hundred feet away. As I approached the glass that separated us, she glanced in my direction and immediately froze in mid­chew.</p>
        <p>She tilted her head as if she wanted to confirm that I was really there. She then made the gesture that we had used as our greeting signal-a Jerk of her head while pursing her lips, as though throwing a kiss.</p>
        <p>She was showing me she recognized me. I was surprised she still remembered me, but a bigger surprise was yet to come.<br>
<br>
<strong>Nina's Baby</strong></p>
        <p>I returned her greeting, and she immediately began searching through the tall grass nearby. She soon found what she was looking for.</p>
        <p>Reaching behind a log, she picked up a small bundle of black fur. Placing it on her back, where it clung tightly, she began walking toward me. She glanced up occasionally to make sure I was still there. She smacked her lips in excitement.</p>
        <p>She stopped next to me and sat down. Reaching behind her, she removed her baby from her back and held it toward me. Then she cradled it in her arms, patting it gently on the head.</p>
        <p>She looked at me questioningly and I clapped my hands in approval. The questioning look disappeared, and she seemed content. Through the glass I could hear a grunt of satisfaction.</p>
        <p>She then began to play with the baby, holding up its hands and feet and pointing to its fingers and toes. It was as if she were proudly showing me that it had the right parts.</p>
        <p>Now, each time I see any kind of ape portrayed as a monster, I remember Nina gently showing me her baby’s fingers and toes.</p>

          <strong>Nina the Gorilla</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by John V. Eickhoff</em><br><br>
Nina the gorilla was seven years old when I met her and her companions, Kiki and one other male. When I began working with them, I was doing a research project. My main job was to write down what each gorilla did at a particular time.</p>
        <p>Nina seemed to like me. When I stood outside the cage window, she ambled over to sit beside me. She looked over my shoulder as I wrote. She followed me around.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The research I did helped me understand the kinds of behavior that are acceptable in a gorilla troop. Gorillas behave differently toward one another, depending on whether the other animal is higher or lower in rank. The troop is led by the highest-ranking male, who is respected by the other gorillas. In the wild, he is responsible for the safety and well-being of the troop.<br>
<br>
<strong>Leader</strong></p>
        <p>Kiki was leader of the gorilla troop that lived at the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle, Washington. Almost from the beginning, he resented my presence.</p>
        <p>When he noticed me, he stiffened his arms and legs to make himself taller. He lifted his head and pressed his lips tightly together. He then strutted back and forth, his hair standing up. All of these behaviors are signals of aggression in gorillas.</p>
        <p>If this didn’t drive me away, he charged and hit the heavy glass that separated us. That is about as aggressive as a gorilla ever gets. This behavior is the same as that of a wild gorilla who is challenged by the actions of another male. Kiki seemed to think I was challenging his position, probably because I am a big man and because of the way Nina reacted to me.</p>
        <p>I tried to ease the tension between us by saying, in gorilla body language, “I recognize your dominance over me.” I did this by avoiding eye contact, turning my face away when he looked at me, and trying to make myself smaller when he approached.<br>
<br>
<strong>Gorilla Language</strong></p>
        <p>Gorillas communicate using body posture, facial expressions, and gestures. They can't speak as we do, partly because their lips, tongues, and vocal cords cannot make many of the sounds of human speech.</p>
        <p>They can make some sounds, about twenty, each of which has a different meaning. For example, a short grunt means, “I am content.” But most of their communication is not by sounds.</p>
        <p>By watching the gorillas closely and spending a lot of time “talking” to them, I found we could communicate on a simple level. I could give them the idea of what I wanted them to do, such as take their vitamin pills or move from one cage to another.</p>
        <p>I learned to tell when they were feeling irritable, content, happy, sad or playful. The gorillas learned that by gesturing they could ask to go outside or tell me that they wanted a certain food.</p>
        <p>It was a crude way to communicate, but it was all we needed.<br>
<br>
<strong>Big News</strong></p>
        <p>After working at the zoo for about six years, I moved to another city but continued to visit. One day, I read in the newspaper that Nina had given birth to her fourth baby. This was exciting news because gorilla births in zoos are fairly rare.</p>
        <p>I was anxious to see Nina and her baby, but it was several months before I got the chance. It had been nearly a year since I had visited the gorillas. I wondered if they would remember me after such a long time.</p>
        <p>As I entered the viewing area, I saw the gorillas foraging for food in their large, brushy yard. Nina was eating about a hundred feet away. As I approached the glass that separated us, she glanced in my direction and immediately froze in mid­chew.</p>
        <p>She tilted her head as if she wanted to confirm that I was really there. She then made the gesture that we had used as our greeting signal-a Jerk of her head while pursing her lips, as though throwing a kiss.</p>
        <p>She was showing me she recognized me. I was surprised she still remembered me, but a bigger surprise was yet to come.<br>
<br>
<strong>Nina's Baby</strong></p>
        <p>I returned her greeting, and she immediately began searching through the tall grass nearby. She soon found what she was looking for.</p>
        <p>Reaching behind a log, she picked up a small bundle of black fur. Placing it on her back, where it clung tightly, she began walking toward me. She glanced up occasionally to make sure I was still there. She smacked her lips in excitement.</p>
        <p>She stopped next to me and sat down. Reaching behind her, she removed her baby from her back and held it toward me. Then she cradled it in her arms, patting it gently on the head.</p>
        <p>She looked at me questioningly and I clapped my hands in approval. The questioning look disappeared, and she seemed content. Through the glass I could hear a grunt of satisfaction.</p>
        <p>She then began to play with the baby, holding up its hands and feet and pointing to its fingers and toes. It was as if she were proudly showing me that it had the right parts.</p>
        <p>Now, each time I see any kind of ape portrayed as a monster, I remember Nina gently showing me her baby’s fingers and toes.</p>

          <strong>Nina the Gorilla</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by John V. Eickhoff</em><br><br>
Nina the gorilla was seven years old when I met her and her companions, Kiki and one other male. When I began working with them, I was doing a research project. My main job was to write down what each gorilla did at a particular time.</p>
        <p>Nina seemed to like me. When I stood outside the cage window, she ambled over to sit beside me. She looked over my shoulder as I wrote. She followed me around.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The research I did helped me understand the kinds of behavior that are acceptable in a gorilla troop. Gorillas behave differently toward one another, depending on whether the other animal is higher or lower in rank. The troop is led by the highest-ranking male, who is respected by the other gorillas. In the wild, he is responsible for the safety and well-being of the troop.<br>
<br>
<strong>Leader</strong></p>
        <p>Kiki was leader of the gorilla troop that lived at the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle, Washington. Almost from the beginning, he resented my presence.</p>
        <p>When he noticed me, he stiffened his arms and legs to make himself taller. He lifted his head and pressed his lips tightly together. He then strutted back and forth, his hair standing up. All of these behaviors are signals of aggression in gorillas.</p>
        <p>If this didn’t drive me away, he charged and hit the heavy glass that separated us. That is about as aggressive as a gorilla ever gets. This behavior is the same as that of a wild gorilla who is challenged by the actions of another male. Kiki seemed to think I was challenging his position, probably because I am a big man and because of the way Nina reacted to me.</p>
        <p>I tried to ease the tension between us by saying, in gorilla body language, “I recognize your dominance over me.” I did this by avoiding eye contact, turning my face away when he looked at me, and trying to make myself smaller when he approached.<br>
<br>
<strong>Gorilla Language</strong></p>
        <p>Gorillas communicate using body posture, facial expressions, and gestures. They can't speak as we do, partly because their lips, tongues, and vocal cords cannot make many of the sounds of human speech.</p>
        <p>They can make some sounds, about twenty, each of which has a different meaning. For example, a short grunt means, “I am content.” But most of their communication is not by sounds.</p>
        <p>By watching the gorillas closely and spending a lot of time “talking” to them, I found we could communicate on a simple level. I could give them the idea of what I wanted them to do, such as take their vitamin pills or move from one cage to another.</p>
        <p>I learned to tell when they were feeling irritable, content, happy, sad or playful. The gorillas learned that by gesturing they could ask to go outside or tell me that they wanted a certain food.</p>
        <p>It was a crude way to communicate, but it was all we needed.<br>
<br>
<strong>Big News</strong></p>
        <p>After working at the zoo for about six years, I moved to another city but continued to visit. One day, I read in the newspaper that Nina had given birth to her fourth baby. This was exciting news because gorilla births in zoos are fairly rare.</p>
        <p>I was anxious to see Nina and her baby, but it was several months before I got the chance. It had been nearly a year since I had visited the gorillas. I wondered if they would remember me after such a long time.</p>
        <p>As I entered the viewing area, I saw the gorillas foraging for food in their large, brushy yard. Nina was eating about a hundred feet away. As I approached the glass that separated us, she glanced in my direction and immediately froze in mid­chew.</p>
        <p>She tilted her head as if she wanted to confirm that I was really there. She then made the gesture that we had used as our greeting signal-a Jerk of her head while pursing her lips, as though throwing a kiss.</p>
        <p>She was showing me she recognized me. I was surprised she still remembered me, but a bigger surprise was yet to come.<br>
<br>
<strong>Nina's Baby</strong></p>
        <p>I returned her greeting, and she immediately began searching through the tall grass nearby. She soon found what she was looking for.</p>
        <p>Reaching behind a log, she picked up a small bundle of black fur. Placing it on her back, where it clung tightly, she began walking toward me. She glanced up occasionally to make sure I was still there. She smacked her lips in excitement.</p>
        <p>She stopped next to me and sat down. Reaching behind her, she removed her baby from her back and held it toward me. Then she cradled it in her arms, patting it gently on the head.</p>
        <p>She looked at me questioningly and I clapped my hands in approval. The questioning look disappeared, and she seemed content. Through the glass I could hear a grunt of satisfaction.</p>
        <p>She then began to play with the baby, holding up its hands and feet and pointing to its fingers and toes. It was as if she were proudly showing me that it had the right parts.</p>
        <p>Now, each time I see any kind of ape portrayed as a monster, I remember Nina gently showing me her baby’s fingers and toes.</p>

          <strong>Nina the Gorilla</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by John V. Eickhoff</em><br><br>
Nina the gorilla was seven years old when I met her and her companions, Kiki and one other male. When I began working with them, I was doing a research project. My main job was to write down what each gorilla did at a particular time.</p>
        <p>Nina seemed to like me. When I stood outside the cage window, she ambled over to sit beside me. She looked over my shoulder as I wrote. She followed me around.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The research I did helped me understand the kinds of behavior that are acceptable in a gorilla troop. Gorillas behave differently toward one another, depending on whether the other animal is higher or lower in rank. The troop is led by the highest-ranking male, who is respected by the other gorillas. In the wild, he is responsible for the safety and well-being of the troop.<br>
<br>
<strong>Leader</strong></p>
        <p>Kiki was leader of the gorilla troop that lived at the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle, Washington. Almost from the beginning, he resented my presence.</p>
        <p>When he noticed me, he stiffened his arms and legs to make himself taller. He lifted his head and pressed his lips tightly together. He then strutted back and forth, his hair standing up. All of these behaviors are signals of aggression in gorillas.</p>
        <p>If this didn’t drive me away, he charged and hit the heavy glass that separated us. That is about as aggressive as a gorilla ever gets. This behavior is the same as that of a wild gorilla who is challenged by the actions of another male. Kiki seemed to think I was challenging his position, probably because I am a big man and because of the way Nina reacted to me.</p>
        <p>I tried to ease the tension between us by saying, in gorilla body language, “I recognize your dominance over me.” I did this by avoiding eye contact, turning my face away when he looked at me, and trying to make myself smaller when he approached.<br>
<br>
<strong>Gorilla Language</strong></p>
        <p>Gorillas communicate using body posture, facial expressions, and gestures. They can't speak as we do, partly because their lips, tongues, and vocal cords cannot make many of the sounds of human speech.</p>
        <p>They can make some sounds, about twenty, each of which has a different meaning. For example, a short grunt means, “I am content.” But most of their communication is not by sounds.</p>
        <p>By watching the gorillas closely and spending a lot of time “talking” to them, I found we could communicate on a simple level. I could give them the idea of what I wanted them to do, such as take their vitamin pills or move from one cage to another.</p>
        <p>I learned to tell when they were feeling irritable, content, happy, sad or playful. The gorillas learned that by gesturing they could ask to go outside or tell me that they wanted a certain food.</p>
        <p>It was a crude way to communicate, but it was all we needed.<br>
<br>
<strong>Big News</strong></p>
        <p>After working at the zoo for about six years, I moved to another city but continued to visit. One day, I read in the newspaper that Nina had given birth to her fourth baby. This was exciting news because gorilla births in zoos are fairly rare.</p>
        <p>I was anxious to see Nina and her baby, but it was several months before I got the chance. It had been nearly a year since I had visited the gorillas. I wondered if they would remember me after such a long time.</p>
        <p>As I entered the viewing area, I saw the gorillas foraging for food in their large, brushy yard. Nina was eating about a hundred feet away. As I approached the glass that separated us, she glanced in my direction and immediately froze in mid­chew.</p>
        <p>She tilted her head as if she wanted to confirm that I was really there. She then made the gesture that we had used as our greeting signal-a Jerk of her head while pursing her lips, as though throwing a kiss.</p>
        <p>She was showing me she recognized me. I was surprised she still remembered me, but a bigger surprise was yet to come.<br>
<br>
<strong>Nina's Baby</strong></p>
        <p>I returned her greeting, and she immediately began searching through the tall grass nearby. She soon found what she was looking for.</p>
        <p>Reaching behind a log, she picked up a small bundle of black fur. Placing it on her back, where it clung tightly, she began walking toward me. She glanced up occasionally to make sure I was still there. She smacked her lips in excitement.</p>
        <p>She stopped next to me and sat down. Reaching behind her, she removed her baby from her back and held it toward me. Then she cradled it in her arms, patting it gently on the head.</p>
        <p>She looked at me questioningly and I clapped my hands in approval. The questioning look disappeared, and she seemed content. Through the glass I could hear a grunt of satisfaction.</p>
        <p>She then began to play with the baby, holding up its hands and feet and pointing to its fingers and toes. It was as if she were proudly showing me that it had the right parts.</p>
        <p>Now, each time I see any kind of ape portrayed as a monster, I remember Nina gently showing me her baby’s fingers and toes.</p>

          <strong>Looking Back</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>By Beth Tolmach</em><br><br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I woke up feeling chilly on that frosty morning<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Picked up the golden key to work open my diary<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Leafed through the thick pages<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;And leaped back in time with memories</p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spring had brought raging clouds<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;That let the rain plummet upon the hills&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drops landed on our rooftop<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With satisfying tips and taps<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hurried people scurried<br>
10&nbsp;&nbsp; Where they needed to go,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trying to avoid the wetness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With colorful umbrellas in their palms&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Squishy mud lingered street side for weeks<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And ruined more than a few pairs of shoes</p>
        <p>15&nbsp;&nbsp;The spring mud disintegrated<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The clouds drifted into the mountains&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And rose the golden glory of Sun<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That shined upon our little town<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Warmed the sullen earth<br>
20&nbsp;&nbsp;And lighted up the scene where<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We all splashed around in the river<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rode our red bikes on the dirt paths&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And basked in the light<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was summertime<br>
25&nbsp;&nbsp; Green leaves faded to brown<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the air became sharp and crisp<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Autumn had crept in sneakily<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And here we lay in mounds of crunchy leaves<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The smell of apple pie from the oven<br>
30&nbsp;&nbsp;Drifting through cool air<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our shadows on the house side<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mirrored our images<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And as late November came about<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We piled on jackets and scarves<br>
35&nbsp;&nbsp;And dreaded the coldness that was&nbsp;coming up</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Winter stretched out like<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sports game in overtime<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forcing us to curl up by the fireside,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stare into the vibrant flames and<br>
40&nbsp;&nbsp;Drink hot cocoa with big marshmallows<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon enough, a white dust covered the&nbsp;land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And children frolicked in the snowy vista<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we stayed indoors,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slurped up hot chicken noodle soup,&nbsp;and<br>
45&nbsp;&nbsp;Watched winter come and go through<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;the windowpane<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And now it is early March<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can feel a small bit of spring in the air<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sit in my bed with the little key<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reminiscing about the past year<br>
50&nbsp;&nbsp; It is time to start something fresh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I lock the diary up and hide it away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And throw the key into my drawer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where it lands and makes a haunting&nbsp;ring<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the last noise of the old year<br>
55&nbsp; And following the ring,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comes the first silence of the new</p>

          <strong>Looking Back</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>By Beth Tolmach</em><br><br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I woke up feeling chilly on that frosty morning<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Picked up the golden key to work open my diary<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Leafed through the thick pages<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;And leaped back in time with memories</p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spring had brought raging clouds<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;That let the rain plummet upon the hills&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drops landed on our rooftop<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With satisfying tips and taps<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hurried people scurried<br>
10&nbsp;&nbsp; Where they needed to go,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trying to avoid the wetness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With colorful umbrellas in their palms&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Squishy mud lingered street side for weeks<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And ruined more than a few pairs of shoes</p>
        <p>15&nbsp;&nbsp;The spring mud disintegrated<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The clouds drifted into the mountains&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And rose the golden glory of Sun<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That shined upon our little town<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Warmed the sullen earth<br>
20&nbsp;&nbsp;And lighted up the scene where<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We all splashed around in the river<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rode our red bikes on the dirt paths&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And basked in the light<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was summertime<br>
25&nbsp;&nbsp; Green leaves faded to brown<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the air became sharp and crisp<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Autumn had crept in sneakily<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And here we lay in mounds of crunchy leaves<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The smell of apple pie from the oven<br>
30&nbsp;&nbsp;Drifting through cool air<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our shadows on the house side<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mirrored our images<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And as late November came about<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We piled on jackets and scarves<br>
35&nbsp;&nbsp;And dreaded the coldness that was&nbsp;coming up</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Winter stretched out like<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sports game in overtime<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forcing us to curl up by the fireside,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stare into the vibrant flames and<br>
40&nbsp;&nbsp;Drink hot cocoa with big marshmallows<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon enough, a white dust covered the&nbsp;land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And children frolicked in the snowy vista<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we stayed indoors,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slurped up hot chicken noodle soup,&nbsp;and<br>
45&nbsp;&nbsp;Watched winter come and go through<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;the windowpane<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And now it is early March<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can feel a small bit of spring in the air<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sit in my bed with the little key<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reminiscing about the past year<br>
50&nbsp;&nbsp; It is time to start something fresh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I lock the diary up and hide it away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And throw the key into my drawer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where it lands and makes a haunting&nbsp;ring<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the last noise of the old year<br>
55&nbsp; And following the ring,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comes the first silence of the new</p>

          <strong>Looking Back</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>By Beth Tolmach</em><br><br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I woke up feeling chilly on that frosty morning<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Picked up the golden key to work open my diary<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Leafed through the thick pages<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;And leaped back in time with memories</p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spring had brought raging clouds<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;That let the rain plummet upon the hills&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drops landed on our rooftop<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With satisfying tips and taps<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hurried people scurried<br>
10&nbsp;&nbsp; Where they needed to go,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trying to avoid the wetness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With colorful umbrellas in their palms&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Squishy mud lingered street side for weeks<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And ruined more than a few pairs of shoes</p>
        <p>15&nbsp;&nbsp;The spring mud disintegrated<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The clouds drifted into the mountains&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And rose the golden glory of Sun<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That shined upon our little town<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Warmed the sullen earth<br>
20&nbsp;&nbsp;And lighted up the scene where<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We all splashed around in the river<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rode our red bikes on the dirt paths&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And basked in the light<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was summertime<br>
25&nbsp;&nbsp; Green leaves faded to brown<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the air became sharp and crisp<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Autumn had crept in sneakily<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And here we lay in mounds of crunchy leaves<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The smell of apple pie from the oven<br>
30&nbsp;&nbsp;Drifting through cool air<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our shadows on the house side<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mirrored our images<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And as late November came about<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We piled on jackets and scarves<br>
35&nbsp;&nbsp;And dreaded the coldness that was&nbsp;coming up</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Winter stretched out like<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sports game in overtime<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forcing us to curl up by the fireside,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stare into the vibrant flames and<br>
40&nbsp;&nbsp;Drink hot cocoa with big marshmallows<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon enough, a white dust covered the&nbsp;land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And children frolicked in the snowy vista<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we stayed indoors,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slurped up hot chicken noodle soup,&nbsp;and<br>
45&nbsp;&nbsp;Watched winter come and go through<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;the windowpane<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And now it is early March<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can feel a small bit of spring in the air<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sit in my bed with the little key<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reminiscing about the past year<br>
50&nbsp;&nbsp; It is time to start something fresh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I lock the diary up and hide it away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And throw the key into my drawer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where it lands and makes a haunting&nbsp;ring<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the last noise of the old year<br>
55&nbsp; And following the ring,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comes the first silence of the new</p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;That let the rain plummet upon the hills&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drops landed on our rooftop<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With satisfying tips and taps<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hurried people scurried<br>
10&nbsp;&nbsp; Where they needed to go,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trying to avoid the wetness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With colorful umbrellas in their palms&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Squishy mud lingered street side for weeks<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And ruined more than a few pairs of shoes</p>
        <p>15&nbsp;&nbsp;The spring mud disintegrated<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The clouds drifted into the mountains&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And rose the golden glory of Sun<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That shined upon our little town<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Warmed the sullen earth<br>
20&nbsp;&nbsp;And lighted up the scene where<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We all splashed around in the river<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rode our red bikes on the dirt paths&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And basked in the light<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was summertime<br>
25&nbsp;&nbsp; Green leaves faded to brown<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the air became sharp and crisp<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Autumn had crept in sneakily<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And here we lay in mounds of crunchy leaves<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The smell of apple pie from the oven<br>
30&nbsp;&nbsp;Drifting through cool air<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our shadows on the house side<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mirrored our images<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And as late November came about<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We piled on jackets and scarves<br>
35&nbsp;&nbsp;And dreaded the coldness that was&nbsp;coming up</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Winter stretched out like<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sports game in overtime<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forcing us to curl up by the fireside,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stare into the vibrant flames and<br>
40&nbsp;&nbsp;Drink hot cocoa with big marshmallows<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon enough, a white dust covered the&nbsp;land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And children frolicked in the snowy vista<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we stayed indoors,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slurped up hot chicken noodle soup,&nbsp;and<br>
45&nbsp;&nbsp;Watched winter come and go through<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;the windowpane<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And now it is early March<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can feel a small bit of spring in the air<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sit in my bed with the little key<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reminiscing about the past year<br>
50&nbsp;&nbsp; It is time to start something fresh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I lock the diary up and hide it away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And throw the key into my drawer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where it lands and makes a haunting&nbsp;ring<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the last noise of the old year<br>
55&nbsp; And following the ring,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comes the first silence of the new</p>

​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Picked up the golden key to work open my diary<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And basked in the light<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was summertime<br>
25&nbsp;&nbsp; Green leaves faded to brown<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the air became sharp and crisp<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Autumn had crept in sneakily<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And here we lay in mounds of crunchy leaves<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The smell of apple pie from the oven<br>
30&nbsp;&nbsp;Drifting through cool air<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our shadows on the house side<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mirrored our images<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And as late November came about<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We piled on jackets and scarves<br>
35&nbsp;&nbsp;And dreaded the coldness that was&nbsp;coming up</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Winter stretched out like<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sports game in overtime<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forcing us to curl up by the fireside,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stare into the vibrant flames and<br>
40&nbsp;&nbsp;Drink hot cocoa with big marshmallows<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon enough, a white dust covered the&nbsp;land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And children frolicked in the snowy vista<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we stayed indoors,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slurped up hot chicken noodle soup,&nbsp;and<br>
45&nbsp;&nbsp;Watched winter come and go through<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;the windowpane<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And now it is early March<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can feel a small bit of spring in the air<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sit in my bed with the little key<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reminiscing about the past year<br>
50&nbsp;&nbsp; It is time to start something fresh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I lock the diary up and hide it away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And throw the key into my drawer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where it lands and makes a haunting&nbsp;ring<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the last noise of the old year<br>
55&nbsp; And following the ring,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comes the first silence of the new</p>
