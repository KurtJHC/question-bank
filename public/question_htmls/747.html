            <p>Weather had taken its toll on this school house. The paint, once a light shade of green, had faded into a sickly yellow. In some parts the paint was non-existent, peeled away to reveal the horizontal planks, which had undergone their own suffering. The window panes dated the home, that thick glass a testament to how older buildings were created to last. Those windows somehow added a touch of strength to the pathetic house. At the front of the house the porch awning looked to be leaning, its crooked shadow cutting across a wreath that added character to the door, even in its dead state. Overall, it may be old and aged, but the weathered school house still stood in the field coloured by autumn.</p>

            <p>Once upon a time the garden had been tended, with children running around, squealing with ecstasy. The paint had once seemed new. A man, presumably, had wiped sweat off his forehead while admiring his work. Did he get it right? His wife might have given him a loving nod of appreciation and squeezed his cheek. Then kissed him and gazed at the house before them where they would live until the day they died. That day came long ago.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The children left following their parent's passing. A modest house in the outskirts of nowhere was a thing of the past. Theirs was a generation with a thirst for the city. The grass grew, the children grew and only the house remained as small as ever.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The house would inevitably fall apart, and no one would know.</p>

            <p>You know those old, abandoned houses you see in zombie movies? This wasn't one of them, but it certainly wanted to be when it grew up. It was off to a good start as well. Worn away paint, rickety looking supports, open windows that looked exactly the right sort to make a lot of noise on a stormy night, while the roof leaks and the floorboards creak.</p>
            <p>It wasn't raining today at least, which was lucky. The land around the house was starting to be reclaimed by the wild, and I didn't care for coming out here at low light, when I'd probably trip on something, scratch my arm and get eaten by something wild knowing my luck. Nor was the house entirely abandoned, I noticed. The windows where clean, and fresh-looking curtains hung inside them.</p>

            <p>The house looked like it was dropped from a bi plane. So out of place surely it must have been put here by accident. No sidewalks, no driveways, no light posts. Not even a busted mailbox to suggest its connection to the outside world. The faded paint job was as dull as the dusty windows staring out at the constantly young forest in the distance. Miraculously the garland on the door was still in one piece. I almost felt bad for it. The dying leaves and flowers on it would never be able to find a resting place in the earth. Like the house, it had only this withered death of wear and tear to look forward to.</p>

            <p>Once upon a time the garden had been tended, with children running around, squealing with ecstasy. The paint had once seemed new. A man, presumably, had wiped sweat off his forehead while admiring his work. Did he get it right? His wife might have given him a loving nod of appreciation and squeezed his cheek. Then kissed him and gazed at the house before them where they would live until the day they died. That day came long ago.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The children left following their parent's passing. A modest house in the outskirts of nowhere was a thing of the past. Theirs was a generation with a thirst for the city. The grass grew, the children grew and only the house remained as small as ever.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The house would inevitably fall apart, and no one would know.</p>

            <p>You know those old, abandoned houses you see in zombie movies? This wasn't one of them, but it certainly wanted to be when it grew up. It was off to a good start as well. Worn away paint, rickety looking supports, open windows that looked exactly the right sort to make a lot of noise on a stormy night, while the roof leaks and the floorboards creak.</p>
            <p>It wasn't raining today at least, which was lucky. The land around the house was starting to be reclaimed by the wild, and I didn't care for coming out here at low light, when I'd probably trip on something, scratch my arm and get eaten by something wild knowing my luck. Nor was the house entirely abandoned, I noticed. The windows where clean, and fresh-looking curtains hung inside them.</p>

            <p>The house looked like it was dropped from a bi plane. So out of place surely it must have been put here by accident. No sidewalks, no driveways, no light posts. Not even a busted mailbox to suggest its connection to the outside world. The faded paint job was as dull as the dusty windows staring out at the constantly young forest in the distance. Miraculously the garland on the door was still in one piece. I almost felt bad for it. The dying leaves and flowers on it would never be able to find a resting place in the earth. Like the house, it had only this withered death of wear and tear to look forward to.</p>

            <p>Weather had taken its toll on this school house. The paint, once a light shade of green, had faded into a sickly yellow. In some parts the paint was non-existent, peeled away to reveal the horizontal planks, which had undergone their own suffering. The window panes dated the home, that thick glass a testament to how older buildings were created to last. Those windows somehow added a touch of strength to the pathetic house. At the front of the house the porch awning looked to be leaning, its crooked shadow cutting across a wreath that added character to the door, even in its dead state. Overall, it may be old and aged, but the weathered school house still stood in the field coloured by autumn.</p>

              <strong>&nbsp;Extract D : </strong>
            </p>
            <p>The house looked like it was dropped from a bi plane. So out of place surely it must have been put here by accident. No sidewalks, no driveways, no light posts. Not even a busted mailbox to suggest its connection to the outside world. The faded paint job was as dull as the dusty windows staring out at the constantly young forest in the distance. Miraculously the garland on the door was still in one piece. I almost felt bad for it. The dying leaves and flowers on it would never be able to find a resting place in the earth. Like the house, it had only this withered death of wear and tear to look forward to.</p>
