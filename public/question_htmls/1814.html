<br>
Animals in Unexpected Places</strong><br>
by Margaret S. Frezon<br>
<br>
1. Most of the time, we can easily guess a creature’s behavior based on its species. For example, fish swim in the water, birds fly through the sky and almost all mammals walk on land. However, there are a few interesting exceptions to these general rules.<br>
<br>
<strong>Owls Underground</strong><br>
<br>
2. In the western states of our country, you might see this unusual and amusing sight: fat little birds poking their heads up out of holes in the ground. Believe it or not, these birds are owls. Unlike other owls, however, they do not live in trees. Burrowing owls live in tunnels under the earth. They are found in deserts and open, dry grasslands where trees are scarce. By living underground, these owls manage to survive in the desert’s harsh, hot environment.<br>
<br>
3. These birds live in the same areas as prairie dogs. If a prairie dog abandons its burrow for any reason, the owl has a ready-made home. Researchers believe that burrowing owls, like prairie dogs, live in groupings called colonies.<br>
<br>
4. Burrowing owls are small, growing only about 10 inches tall. They are sandy brown with some white markings on their faces and stomachs. The owls have a rounded head and lack the ear tufts that other owls have. Their long legs and sharp beaks are useful in moving dirt.<br>
<br>
5. Active during both day and night hours, the owls feed on insects, spiders, mice, scorpions, and other small animals. They are sometimes also referred to as ground owls, prairie dog owls, tunnel owls, or hill owls.<br>
<br>
<strong>Fish in the Air</strong><br>
6. Most fish spend almost all their time in the water. Some species leap out briefly after food or for other reasons. “Flying fish,” however, leave the water for longer periods. They can glide through the air as much as 10 feet above the surface.<br>
<br>
7. Flying fish are found in parts of the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea and in other tropical waters. They live near the surface of the water, rather than deep in the sea. These fish usually swim, but at times they leap out of the water, soaring through the air above the waves. To do this, they move their tails, rapidly, accelerating to speeds as fast as 30 miles per hour. Then the fish leap out of the water, high into the air. They have very large pectoral fins that help them glide for great distances. For these fish, flying is not only a hobby but also a matter of survival; it helps them escape from their enemies.<br>
<br>
8. Flying fish are medium sized, measuring about 10 to 18 inches long, depending on the specific type of fish. Atlantic flying fish are usually greenish blue on top, with a lighter color underneath. Their wings are actually enlarged pectoral fins. Some types of flying fish have one pair of wings, and<br>
others have two pairs.<br>
<br>
9. A strong gust of wind will sometimes help to push the fish along, allowing them to cover as much&nbsp;as 30 feet in a single leap. Flying fish are able to glide, but they cannot steer. Some unlucky flying fish have actually leapt out of the water and landed on the decks of passing fishing boats.<br>
<br>
<strong>Kangaroos Up a Tree</strong><br>
<br>
10.Many people know about large kangaroos bounding effortlessly across the Australian wilderness. However, there are different types of kangaroos. Some are so small they might remind you more of a monkey than a kangaroo. You would have to look up to see the Goodfellow’s kangaroo because it spends much of its life in the branches of trees.<br>
<br>
11.Goodfellow’s kangaroos live in New Guinea, an island off the coast of Australia. They are at home in mountainous areas among the heavy vines and tree limbs of the area’s rainforests. They spend their time safely camouflaged in the dense foliage, where it is very difficult to see them. During the day, they sleep in the branches.<br>
<br>
12.The Goodfellow’s kangaroo is a marsupial, meaning that, like other kangaroos, it has a pouch. It is small, weighing about 15–20 pounds, or about as much as a small dog. Its body is approximately 30 inches long, and it has an equally long tail. Its brown fur is short and soft, with yellow markings. Its long curved claws help it hang onto branches.<br>
<br>
13.A kangaroo that lives in a tree must be an agile climber. These kangaroos easily jump from branch to branch, eating leaves, berries, and fruit. A baby tree kangaroo stays in its mother’s pouch much longer than kangaroos that live on the ground. This is probably because it takes more skill to climb around in the trees.<br>
<br>
14.After reading about underground owls, flying fish, and small kangaroos that live in trees, you know that some animals can be found in quite unexpected places!<br>

<br>
<strong>Kangaroos Up a Tree</strong><br>
<br>
10.Many people know about large kangaroos bounding effortlessly across the Australian wilderness. However, there are different types of kangaroos. Some are so small they might remind you more of a monkey than a kangaroo. You would have to look up to see the Goodfellow’s kangaroo because it spends much of its life in the branches of trees.<br>
<br>
11.Goodfellow’s kangaroos live in New Guinea, an island off the coast of Australia. They are at home in mountainous areas among the heavy vines and tree limbs of the area’s rainforests. They spend their time safely camouflaged in the dense foliage, where it is very difficult to see them. During the day, they sleep in the branches.<br>
<br>
12.The Goodfellow’s kangaroo is a marsupial, meaning that, like other kangaroos, it has a pouch. It is small, weighing about 15–20 pounds, or about as much as a small dog. Its body is approximately 30 inches long, and it has an equally long tail. Its brown fur is short and soft, with yellow markings. Its long curved claws help it hang onto branches.<br>
<br>
13.A kangaroo that lives in a tree must be an agile climber. These kangaroos easily jump from branch to branch, eating leaves, berries, and fruit. A baby tree kangaroo stays in its mother’s pouch much longer than kangaroos that live on the ground. This is probably because it takes more skill to climb around in the trees.<br>
<br>
14.After reading about underground owls, flying fish, and small kangaroos that live in trees, you know that some animals can be found in quite unexpected places!<br>

<br>
Animals in Unexpected Places</strong><br>
by Margaret S. Frezon<br>
<br>
1. Most of the time, we can easily guess a creature’s behavior based on its species. For example, fish swim in the water, birds fly through the sky and almost all mammals walk on land. However, there are a few interesting exceptions to these general rules.<br>
<br>
<strong>Owls Underground</strong><br>
<br>
2. In the western states of our country, you might see this unusual and amusing sight: fat little birds poking their heads up out of holes in the ground. Believe it or not, these birds are owls. Unlike other owls, however, they do not live in trees. Burrowing owls live in tunnels under the earth. They are found in deserts and open, dry grasslands where trees are scarce. By living underground, these owls manage to survive in the desert’s harsh, hot environment.<br>
<br>
3. These birds live in the same areas as prairie dogs. If a prairie dog abandons its burrow for any reason, the owl has a ready-made home. Researchers believe that burrowing owls, like prairie dogs, live in groupings called colonies.<br>
<br>
4. Burrowing owls are small, growing only about 10 inches tall. They are sandy brown with some white markings on their faces and stomachs. The owls have a rounded head and lack the ear tufts that other owls have. Their long legs and sharp beaks are useful in moving dirt.<br>
<br>
5. Active during both day and night hours, the owls feed on insects, spiders, mice, scorpions, and other small animals. They are sometimes also referred to as ground owls, prairie dog owls, tunnel owls, or hill owls.<br>
<br>
<strong>Fish in the Air</strong><br>
6. Most fish spend almost all their time in the water. Some species leap out briefly after food or for other reasons. “Flying fish,” however, leave the water for longer periods. They can glide through the air as much as 10 feet above the surface.<br>
<br>
7. Flying fish are found in parts of the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea and in other tropical waters. They live near the surface of the water, rather than deep in the sea. These fish usually swim, but at times they leap out of the water, soaring through the air above the waves. To do this, they move their tails, rapidly, accelerating to speeds as fast as 30 miles per hour. Then the fish leap out of the water, high into the air. They have very large pectoral fins that help them glide for great distances. For these fish, flying is not only a hobby but also a matter of survival; it helps them escape from their enemies.<br>
<br>
8. Flying fish are medium sized, measuring about 10 to 18 inches long, depending on the specific type of fish. Atlantic flying fish are usually greenish blue on top, with a lighter color underneath. Their wings are actually enlarged pectoral fins. Some types of flying fish have one pair of wings, and<br>
others have two pairs.<br>
<br>
9. A strong gust of wind will sometimes help to push the fish along, allowing them to cover as much&nbsp;as 30 feet in a single leap. Flying fish are able to glide, but they cannot steer. Some unlucky flying fish have actually leapt out of the water and landed on the decks of passing fishing boats.<br>

        <p><strong>QUESTIONS 8 – 12</strong><br><br><strong>Marco Polo and the “Million Lies”</strong><br><br>
by Nancy Beaulieu<br>
<br>
<strong>Young Adventurer</strong><br>
Marco Polo was born in Venice, Italy, in 1254. He was 17 when he set out for China with his father and uncle, a journey which lasted more than three years. The three travelers passed through vast deserts and across rugged mountain ranges. Marco met people from different lands and saw wondrous new places. He saw camels, which he called oxen with humps, and mountain goats, which he described as sheep with long curled horns. He heard the music of the sand dunesshifting in the wind. He climbed mountainsso high that the thin air made him dizzy. Marco wasfascinated by everything he saw.<br>
<br>
Marco Polo and his family reached China in 1275. At that time, Kublai Khan was the emperor. He was impressed with Marco and put the young man to work. Marco spent more than 16 yearsin Khan’sservice. He went on missionsto faraway lands and entertained Khan with stories of his travels. Then, in 1292, Marco asked for permission to return to Venice. Khan did not want to see Marco go, but he finally agreed. Marco and his family returned to Venice.<br>
<br>
<strong>“Marco Milione”</strong><br>
The Travels of Marco Polo was a popular book, but it did not earn Marco much respect. It was often referred to as “Il Milione.” By this the Italians meant “the million lies.” Some people even called him “Marco Milione.” Many of Marco’s stories were hard to believe. Besides the unusual animals he described, Marco told of other things difficult for most Europeans to imagine. For example, Marco described how the Chinese people read books printed on paper and used paper money. At that time, paper was rare in Europe. To people reading about Marco’s adventures, paper money and books printed on paper sounded like something from a<br>
fable.<br>
<br>
Marco also described a system that Khan’s empire used to rapidly deliver messages to faraway places. Marco’s countrymen thought this sounded impossible too. Who could blame them? It would be hundreds of years before a mail system was used in Europe. Even details about daily<br>
life in China seemed made up. Marco told about delicate china serving bowls that ordinary people used. At a time when most Europeans did not have silverware, this seemed<br>
unbelievable. Everyday clothes made from silk sounded like a fairy tale to Europeans, since most of them had just one change of woolen clothes.<br>
<br>
<strong>MisreadandMisunderstood</strong><br>
Much of what Marco described in his stories was later proven true. However, there are some parts where Marco’s memory may have been foggy, or Rustichello may have embellished the truth. Certainly no one else has ever seen any large birds that drop elephants from great heights and then eat the remains! It is also strange that Marco did not describe something as amazing as the Great Wall of China, which he must have seen.<br>
<br>
Whatever the complete truth about his book, one thing is certain: Marco Polo was a great explorer and adventurer.<br>

        <p><strong>QUESTIONS 8 – 12</strong><br><br><strong>Marco Polo and the “Million Lies”</strong><br><br>
by Nancy Beaulieu<br>
<br>
<strong>Young Adventurer</strong><br>
Marco Polo was born in Venice, Italy, in 1254. He was 17 when he set out for China with his father and uncle, a journey which lasted more than three years. The three travelers passed through vast deserts and across rugged mountain ranges. Marco met people from different lands and saw wondrous new places. He saw camels, which he called oxen with humps, and mountain goats, which he described as sheep with long curled horns. He heard the music of the sand dunesshifting in the wind. He climbed mountainsso high that the thin air made him dizzy. Marco wasfascinated by everything he saw.<br>
<br>
Marco Polo and his family reached China in 1275. At that time, Kublai Khan was the emperor. He was impressed with Marco and put the young man to work. Marco spent more than 16 yearsin Khan’sservice. He went on missionsto faraway lands and entertained Khan with stories of his travels. Then, in 1292, Marco asked for permission to return to Venice. Khan did not want to see Marco go, but he finally agreed. Marco and his family returned to Venice.<br>
<br>

It was often referred to as “Il Milione.” By this the Italians meant “the million lies.” Some people even called him “Marco Milione.” Many of Marco’s stories were hard to believe. Besides the unusual animals he described, Marco told of other things difficult for most Europeans to imagine. For example, Marco described how the Chinese people read books printed on paper and used paper money. At that time, paper was rare in Europe. To people reading about Marco’s adventures, paper money and books printed on paper sounded like something from a<br>

Marco also described a system that Khan’s empire used to rapidly deliver messages to faraway places. Marco’s countrymen thought this sounded impossible too. Who could blame them? It would be hundreds of years before a mail system was used in Europe. Even details about daily<br>

unbelievable. Everyday clothes made from silk sounded like a fairy tale to Europeans, since most of them had just one change of woolen clothes.<br>
<br>

Much of what Marco described in his stories was later proven true. However, there are some parts where Marco’s memory may have been foggy, or Rustichello may have embellished the truth.

        <p><strong>QUESTIONS 8 – 12</strong><br><br><strong>Marco Polo and the “Million Lies”</strong><br><br>
by Nancy Beaulieu<br>
<br>
<strong>Young Adventurer</strong><br>
Marco Polo was born in Venice, Italy, in 1254. He was 17 when he set out for China with his father and uncle, a journey which lasted more than three years. The three travelers passed through vast deserts and across rugged mountain ranges. Marco met people from different lands and saw wondrous new places. He saw camels, which he called oxen with humps, and mountain goats, which he described as sheep with long curled horns. He heard the music of the sand dunesshifting in the wind. He climbed mountainsso high that the thin air made him dizzy. Marco wasfascinated by everything he saw.<br>
<br>
Marco Polo and his family reached China in 1275. At that time, Kublai Khan was the emperor. He was impressed with Marco and put the young man to work. Marco spent more than 16 yearsin Khan’sservice. He went on missionsto faraway lands and entertained Khan with stories of his travels. Then, in 1292, Marco asked for permission to return to Venice. Khan did not want to see Marco go, but he finally agreed. Marco and his family returned to Venice.<br>
<br>
<strong>“Marco Milione”</strong><br>
The Travels of Marco Polo was a popular book, but it did not earn Marco much respect. It was often referred to as “Il Milione.” By this the Italians meant “the million lies.” Some people even called him “Marco Milione.” Many of Marco’s stories were hard to believe. Besides the unusual animals he described, Marco told of other things difficult for most Europeans to imagine. For example, Marco described how the Chinese people read books printed on paper and used paper money. At that time, paper was rare in Europe. To people reading about Marco’s adventures, paper money and books printed on paper sounded like something from a<br>
fable.<br>
<br>
Marco also described a system that Khan’s empire used to rapidly deliver messages to faraway places. Marco’s countrymen thought this sounded impossible too. Who could blame them? It would be hundreds of years before a mail system was used in Europe. Even details about daily<br>
life in China seemed made up. Marco told about delicate china serving bowls that ordinary people used. At a time when most Europeans did not have silverware, this seemed<br>
unbelievable. Everyday clothes made from silk sounded like a fairy tale to Europeans, since most of them had just one change of woolen clothes.<br>
<br>
<strong>MisreadandMisunderstood</strong><br>
Much of what Marco described in his stories was later proven true. However, there are some parts where Marco’s memory may have been foggy, or Rustichello may have embellished the truth. Certainly no one else has ever seen any large birds that drop elephants from great heights and then eat the remains! It is also strange that Marco did not describe something as amazing as the Great Wall of China, which he must have seen.<br>
<br>
Whatever the complete truth about his book, one thing is certain: Marco Polo was a great explorer and adventurer.<br>

        <p><strong>QUESTIONS 13 – 18<br>
<br>
Sweet Magnolia</strong><br>
by Virginia Kroll<br>
<br>
1 “Let’s go see the bayou,” said Grandma, and we got into her boat. Soon we came to a different sounding place. We got out of the boat, and I hushed so I could hear it all—tiny tickings, gentle jigglings, ripplings, and rustlings—little life sounds all around.<br>
<br>
2 “Talk about trees!” I gasped, looking up. They were hunched over like bent giants. Moss was hanging in shaggy clumps from their branches like ragged curtains. “The bayou,” I whispered.<br>
<br>
3 Suddenly I heard a tiny cheeping. There wassome pain and fear in it. “Over there,” said Grandma, pointing.<br>
<br>
4 I ran, then stopped short, so I wouldn’t step on the struggling bird. Grandma carefully scooped it up. She shook her head.<br>
<br>
5 “Can you fix it, Grandma?”<br>
<br>
6 Grandma warned me, “Sometimes nature doesn’t see things our way.” But she looked in my eyes, and we took the bird on home.<br>
<br>
7 “What happened to it, Grandma?” I asked.<br>
<br>
8 Grandma examined the panting bird. “Hmm. Broken leg. I reckon she was too impatient, Denise. Burst right out of her nest ahead of schedule. Couldn’t wait to get on with the<br>
springtime.”<br>
<br>
9 “What kind is she?” I asked.<br>
<br>
10 “A painted bunting,” Grandma said.<br>
<br>
11 She fed the bird with a tiny tube, then set the broken leg and taped it. I studied the soft feathers and fluffy markings.<br>
<br>
12 Grandma kept up the feedings day and night. I helped. The painted bunting grew bigger and more colorful and got its flight feathers. Pretty soon she was pecking seeds right out of my hand.<br>
<br>
13 “Don’t feed her from your hand all the time,” Grandma said, “or she won’t learn how to&nbsp;find seeds and insects on her own.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
14 The day she unwrapped the bunting’s leg, Grandma asked, “You gonna give this one a name? She’s yours. You found her, after all.”<br>
<br>
15 My heart skipped like a stone across a stream. Mine! Did Grandma mean it? Wait till Iona and Geneva saw the treasure I was bringing home!<br>
<br>
16 I looked at my bird. I thought about how she tried to fly too soon and how Grandma said she wasimpatient, just like the sweet magnolia flowers.<br>
<br>
17 “Sweet Magnolia!” I said. “That’s her name.”<br>
<br>
18 “My, my,” Grandma sighed. “You sure do have a way with words.” I felt proud.<br>
<br>
19 One morning after breakfast, Grandma said, “This is the big day. Come on.”<br>
<br>
20 Ifollowed,wondering what was so special. She went to Sweet Magnolia’s cage and opened the door.Then she stopped.“You ought to do it,Denise.You found her,after all.”<br>
<br>
21 “Do what, Grandma?” I asked.<br>
<br>
22 “Set her flying to the winds,” she answered.<br>
<br>
23 “But Grandma, she’s MINE!” I shouted. “You even said so. She’sthe treasure I’m taking home.”<br>
<br>
24 Grandma half-smiled, half-frowned. “I’m sorry, Denise. Maybe you misunderstood. She’s yours to help . . . yours to heal . . . yours to set free.”<br>
<br>
25 I put my hands on my hips and stamped my foot. “No.”<br>
<br>
26 “You love her, don’t you?” Grandma said.<br>
<br>
27 I thought for a moment. I gulped. I blinked hard. I opened the cage and slowly put my hand in.<br>

<br>
19 One morning after breakfast, Grandma said, “This is the big day. Come on.”<br>
<br>
20 Ifollowed,wondering what was so special. She went to Sweet Magnolia’s cage and opened the door.Then she stopped.“You ought to do it,Denise.You found her,after all.”<br>
<br>
21 “Do what, Grandma?” I asked.<br>
<br>
22 “Set her flying to the winds,” she answered.<br>
<br>
23 “But Grandma, she’s MINE!” I shouted. “You even said so. She’sthe treasure I’m taking home.”<br>
<br>
24 Grandma half-smiled, half-frowned. “I’m sorry, Denise. Maybe you misunderstood. She’s yours to help . . . yours to heal . . . yours to set free.”<br>
<br>
25 I put my hands on my hips and stamped my foot. “No.”<br>
<br>
26 “You love her, don’t you?” Grandma said.<br>
<br>
27 I thought for a moment. I gulped. I blinked hard. I opened the cage and slowly put my hand in.<br>

        <p><strong>QUESTIONS 13 – 18<br>
<br>
Sweet Magnolia</strong><br>
by Virginia Kroll<br>
<br>
1 “Let’s go see the bayou,” said Grandma, and we got into her boat. Soon we came to a different sounding place. We got out of the boat, and I hushed so I could hear it all—tiny tickings, gentle jigglings, ripplings, and rustlings—little life sounds all around.<br>
<br>
2 “Talk about trees!” I gasped, looking up. They were hunched over like bent giants. Moss was hanging in shaggy clumps from their branches like ragged curtains. “The bayou,” I whispered.<br>
<br>
3 Suddenly I heard a tiny cheeping. There wassome pain and fear in it. “Over there,” said Grandma, pointing.<br>
<br>
4 I ran, then stopped short, so I wouldn’t step on the struggling bird. Grandma carefully scooped it up. She shook her head.<br>
<br>
5 “Can you fix it, Grandma?”<br>
<br>
6 Grandma warned me, “Sometimes nature doesn’t see things our way.” But she looked in my eyes, and we took the bird on home.<br>
<br>
7 “What happened to it, Grandma?” I asked.<br>
<br>
8 Grandma examined the panting bird. “Hmm. Broken leg. I reckon she was too impatient, Denise. Burst right out of her nest ahead of schedule. Couldn’t wait to get on with the<br>
springtime.”<br>
<br>
9 “What kind is she?” I asked.<br>
<br>
10 “A painted bunting,” Grandma said.<br>
<br>
11 She fed the bird with a tiny tube, then set the broken leg and taped it. I studied the soft feathers and fluffy markings.<br>
<br>
12 Grandma kept up the feedings day and night. I helped. The painted bunting grew bigger and more colorful and got its flight feathers. Pretty soon she was pecking seeds right out of my hand.<br>
<br>
13 “Don’t feed her from your hand all the time,” Grandma said, “or she won’t learn how to&nbsp;find seeds and insects on her own.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
14 The day she unwrapped the bunting’s leg, Grandma asked, “You gonna give this one a name? She’s yours. You found her, after all.”<br>
<br>
15 My heart skipped like a stone across a stream. Mine! Did Grandma mean it? Wait till Iona and Geneva saw the treasure I was bringing home!<br>
<br>
16 I looked at my bird. I thought about how she tried to fly too soon and how Grandma said she wasimpatient, just like the sweet magnolia flowers.<br>
<br>
17 “Sweet Magnolia!” I said. “That’s her name.”<br>
<br>
18 “My, my,” Grandma sighed. “You sure do have a way with words.” I felt proud.<br>
<br>
19 One morning after breakfast, Grandma said, “This is the big day. Come on.”<br>
<br>
20 Ifollowed,wondering what was so special. She went to Sweet Magnolia’s cage and opened the door.Then she stopped.“You ought to do it,Denise.You found her,after all.”<br>
<br>
21 “Do what, Grandma?” I asked.<br>

22 “Set her flying to the winds,” she answered.<br>
<br>
23 “But Grandma, she’s MINE!” I shouted. “You even said so. She’sthe treasure I’m taking home.”<br>
<br>
24 Grandma half-smiled, half-frowned. “I’m sorry, Denise. Maybe you misunderstood. She’s yours to help . . . yours to heal . . . yours to set free.”<br>
<br>
25 I put my hands on my hips and stamped my foot. “No.”<br>
<br>
26 “You love her, don’t you?” Grandma said.<br>
<br>
27 I thought for a moment. I gulped. I blinked hard. I opened the cage and slowly put my hand in.<br>

        <p><strong>QUESTIONS 13 – 18<br>
<br>
Sweet Magnolia</strong><br>
by Virginia Kroll<br>
<br>
1 “Let’s go see the bayou,” said Grandma, and we got into her boat. Soon we came to a different sounding place. We got out of the boat, and I hushed so I could hear it all—tiny tickings, gentle jigglings, ripplings, and rustlings—little life sounds all around.<br>
<br>
2 “Talk about trees!” I gasped, looking up. They were hunched over like bent giants. Moss was hanging in shaggy clumps from their branches like ragged curtains. “The bayou,” I whispered.<br>
<br>
3 Suddenly I heard a tiny cheeping. There wassome pain and fear in it. “Over there,” said Grandma, pointing.<br>
<br>
4 I ran, then stopped short, so I wouldn’t step on the struggling bird. Grandma carefully scooped it up. She shook her head.<br>
<br>
5 “Can you fix it, Grandma?”<br>
<br>
6 Grandma warned me, “Sometimes nature doesn’t see things our way.” But she looked in my eyes, and we took the bird on home.<br>
<br>
7 “What happened to it, Grandma?” I asked.<br>
<br>
8 Grandma examined the panting bird. “Hmm. Broken leg. I reckon she was too impatient, Denise. Burst right out of her nest ahead of schedule. Couldn’t wait to get on with the<br>
springtime.”<br>
<br>
9 “What kind is she?” I asked.<br>
<br>
10 “A painted bunting,” Grandma said.<br>
<br>
11 She fed the bird with a tiny tube, then set the broken leg and taped it. I studied the soft feathers and fluffy markings.<br>
<br>
12 Grandma kept up the feedings day and night. I helped. The painted bunting grew bigger and more colorful and got its flight feathers. Pretty soon she was pecking seeds right out of my hand.<br>
<br>
13 “Don’t feed her from your hand all the time,” Grandma said, “or she won’t learn how to&nbsp;find seeds and insects on her own.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
14 The day she unwrapped the bunting’s leg, Grandma asked, “You gonna give this one a name? She’s yours. You found her, after all.”<br>
<br>
15 My heart skipped like a stone across a stream. Mine! Did Grandma mean it? Wait till Iona and Geneva saw the treasure I was bringing home!<br>
<br>
16 I looked at my bird. I thought about how she tried to fly too soon and how Grandma said she wasimpatient, just like the sweet magnolia flowers.<br>
<br>
17 “Sweet Magnolia!” I said. “That’s her name.”<br>
<br>
18 “My, my,” Grandma sighed. “You sure do have a way with words.” I felt proud.<br>
<br>
19 One morning after breakfast, Grandma said, “This is the big day. Come on.”<br>
<br>
20 Ifollowed,wondering what was so special. She went to Sweet Magnolia’s cage and opened the door.Then she stopped.“You ought to do it,Denise.You found her,after all.”<br>
<br>
21 “Do what, Grandma?” I asked.<br>
<br>
22 “Set her flying to the winds,” she answered.<br>
<br>
23 “But Grandma, she’s MINE!” I shouted. “You even said so. She’sthe treasure I’m taking home.”<br>
<br>
24 Grandma half-smiled, half-frowned. “I’m sorry, Denise. Maybe you misunderstood. She’s yours to help . . . yours to heal . . . yours to set free.”<br>
<br>
25 I put my hands on my hips and stamped my foot. “No.”<br>
<br>
26 “You love her, don’t you?” Grandma said.<br>
<br>
27 I thought for a moment. I gulped. I blinked hard. I opened the cage and slowly put my hand in.<br>
