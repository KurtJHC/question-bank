          <em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p><br><strong>Are Expensive Pillows Worth the Money?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Lumpy, bumpy, flat and smelly might not be Doc, Dopey or Bashful's distant cousins, but they may be adjectives used to describe an old, uncomfortable pillow, which can make you sleepy and grumpy.&nbsp;<strong>12</strong>&nbsp;……….&nbsp;But price isn’t necessarily a factor; a reasonably priced pillow may be just as comfortable as an expensive one.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Down to Feathers&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>In a 2012 blind study by "Consumer’s Report", participants preferred sleeping on a costlier down-filled pillow compared to a feather-filled pillow at about one-third the cost. If you’re shopping for the more expensive option, look for down-pillow buzzwords, such as “hypoallergenic”, “fill power” --- a fill power number of 600 is standard quality, while 800 or more means high quality, and “freshness assured” or “clean and dust-free”, as quality assurance.&nbsp;<strong>13</strong>&nbsp;……….&nbsp;But an inexpensive feather pillow slipped into a padded, protective pillow cover, or a down-alternative pillow offers a way to save some money, and possibly rest just as comfortably.&nbsp;<strong>14&nbsp;</strong>……….&nbsp;advises researchers at Harvard University, and may justify spending more money, if needed.<br>
<br>
<strong>Paying for Polyester&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>You could pay eight times the cost of an inexpensive polyester pillow for an expensive pillow, but, as the "Consumer's Report" study demonstrates, spending more money is likely going to mean getting better sleep.&nbsp;<strong>15&nbsp;</strong>……….&nbsp;If you sleep on your side, go for a thicker, firm pillow to fill in the space created by your shoulder.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Mind Your Memory Foam&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>The higher price of a memory-foam pillow may be highly overrated, the "Consumer's Report" study shows. Try an inexpensive memory-foam pillow, at around one-third the price of the costlier versions.&nbsp;<strong>16</strong>&nbsp;……….&nbsp;paying a bit more for a memory-foam pillow with a cooling-gel surface should help you rest easier.<br>
<br>
<strong>The Price of Longevity&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>Your old pillows need to be replaced --- possibly more often than you realise. You may have noticed that old pillows tend to “put on some weight” over the years. The added weight is the weight of skin cells, dust mites, fungus and mold that accumulate with time.&nbsp;<strong>17</strong>&nbsp;……….&nbsp;Before washing any pillow, refer to the care label and washing instructions. Replace your pillow at least every other year, but sooner if it becomes lumpy, bumpy, flat or smelly.</p>

A leader’s ability to plan meticulously is important, despite Moltke’s dictum that few plans last beyond the initial contact with the enemy. “Plans are worthless,” agreed Eisenhower. “Planning is everything.” It is often forgotten that one of the most successful war plans in modern history—Hitler’s blitzkrieg against the West that succeeded in knocking out France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Holland in six weeks in May and June 1940—was not the original one. When the first set of plans fell into Allied hands by accident only days before the assault was due to be launched, Erich von Manstein drew up a new one. It was this plan B that featured the famous sickle-cut maneuver, in which concentrated armor cut the Allies off from their supply bases, the Maginot Line was skirted, the mountainous Ardennes forest—hitherto thought impassable—was used as a conduit, and the Germans broke through at Sedan in six days and reached the Channel coast at Abbeville in only ten.<br>
<br>
{^<strong> Extract B</strong> ^}<br>
For planning in particular and for leadership in general a good memory is useful, or failing that an excellent filing system. Churchill had a photographic memory, and not just for music-hall songs and Shakespeare. He would spend up to thirty hours memorising his speeches and constantly practice them to make them word perfect, and would even make up ones he was not about to give but might be called upon to deliver sometime in the future. On occasion he would regale his entourage with speeches he would have given if he had been in the House of Commons at different periods of history. For a superb filing system one could hardly do better than Napoleon, who also had an excellent memory and who used his chief of staff, Marshal Berthier, to ensure that even in a carriage rattling along at full pace they were able to place geographically every unit in his army and send and receive messages as aides-de-camps rode up to the windows, grasp orders thrust through the windows, and rode off again to deliver them.<br>
<br>
{^ <strong>Extract C</strong> ^}<br>
“The reasonable man adapts himself to the world,” wrote George Bernard Shaw in Man and Superman, “the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.” A talent for well-timed unreasonableness is another attribute of the great leader. Queen Elizabeth I refused to name her successor despite continuous prompting from her Privy Council, thus protecting her country from the danger of civil war. She also refused to ratify the Treaty of Edinburgh early in her reign, despite the pleadings of her closest counsellor Lord Burghley, until the threat posed by the dukes of Guise had finally diminished. Elizabeth I had many of the attributes of a great war leader, in her oratory, in her determination and as a fine picker of men.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D&nbsp;</strong>^}<br>
Understanding the psychology of others is an important part of leadership. Today, it seems to be assumed that in order to lead one’s people one needs to have sprung from them, but that is not the case. Many of those who have exuded leadership ability hail from the leisured or moneyed class of their countries—Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Napoleon, Churchill, both Roosevelts, and John F. Kennedy among a long list of them—yet they all had a strong sense of what motivated soldiers and citizens who hailed from backgrounds far further down the social scale. A capacity to empathize is far more important than one’s class background. Churchill was born in a palace, the grandson of a duke, went to one of the top schools in the country and never took a bus in his life, but he could speak directly to the needs of what he called the cottage home. When commanding in the trenches of the Great War, he put his earlier campaigning experience to good use in always trying to ensure the men had their creature comforts, such as beer, fresh bread, and a good postal service to connect them with their families.<br>

It was this plan B that featured the famous sickle-cut maneuver, in which concentrated armor cut the Allies off from their supply bases, the Maginot Line was skirted, the mountainous Ardennes forest—hitherto thought impassable—was used as a conduit, and the Germans broke through at Sedan in six days and reached the Channel coast at Abbeville in only ten.<br>

For planning in particular and for leadership in general a good memory is useful, or failing that an excellent filing system. Churchill had a photographic memory, and not just for music-hall songs and Shakespeare. He would spend up to thirty hours memorising his speeches and constantly practice them to make them word perfect, and would even make up ones he was not about to give but might be called upon to deliver sometime in the future. On occasion he would regale his entourage with speeches he would have given if he had been in the House of Commons at different periods of history. For a superb filing system one could hardly do better than Napoleon, who also had an excellent memory and who used his chief of staff, Marshal Berthier, to ensure that even in a carriage rattling along at full pace they were able to place geographically every unit in his army and send and receive messages as aides-de-camps rode up to the windows, grasp orders thrust through the windows, and rode off again to deliver them.<br>

“The reasonable man adapts himself to the world,” wrote George Bernard Shaw in Man and Superman, “the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself.

Queen Elizabeth I refused to name her successor despite continuous prompting from her Privy Council, thus protecting her country from the danger of civil war. She also refused to ratify the Treaty of Edinburgh early in her reign, despite the pleadings of her closest counsellor Lord Burghley, until the threat posed by the dukes of Guise had finally diminished.

Understanding the psychology of others is an important part of leadership. Today, it seems to be assumed that in order to lead one’s people one needs to have sprung from them, but that is not the case. Many of those who have exuded leadership ability hail from the leisured or moneyed class of their countries—Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Napoleon, Churchill, both Roosevelts, and John F. Kennedy among a long list of them—yet they all had a strong sense of what motivated soldiers and citizens who hailed from backgrounds far further down the social scale. A capacity to empathize is far more important than one’s class background. Churchill was born in a palace, the grandson of a duke, went to one of the top schools in the country and never took a bus in his life, but he could speak directly to the needs of what he called the cottage home. When commanding in the trenches of the Great War, he put his earlier campaigning experience to good use in always trying to ensure the men had their creature comforts, such as beer, fresh bread, and a good postal service to connect them with their families.<br>

She also refused to ratify the Treaty of Edinburgh early in her reign, despite the pleadings of her closest counsellor Lord Burghley, until the threat posed by the dukes of Guise had finally diminished. Elizabeth I had many of the attributes of a great war leader, in her oratory, in her determination and as a fine picker of men.<br>

{^ <strong>Extract D</strong> ^}<br>
Understanding the psychology of others is an important part of leadership. Today, it seems to be assumed that in order to lead one’s people one needs to have sprung from them, but that is not the case. Many of those who have exuded leadership ability hail from the leisured or moneyed class of their countries—Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Napoleon, Churchill, both Roosevelts, and John F. Kennedy among a long list of them—yet they all had a strong sense of what motivated soldiers and citizens who hailed from backgrounds far further down the social scale. A capacity to empathize is far more important than one’s class background. Churchill was born in a palace, the grandson of a duke, went to one of the top schools in the country and never took a bus in his life, but he could speak directly to the needs of what he called the cottage home. When commanding in the trenches of the Great War, he put his earlier campaigning experience to good use in always trying to ensure the men had their creature comforts, such as beer, fresh bread, and a good postal service to connect them with their families.<br>

          <strong>The Jungle Book&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Rudyard Kipling&nbsp;</em><br><br>
There was a chorus of deep growls, and a young wolf in his fourth year flung back Shere Khan’s question to Akela: “What have the Free People to do with <span class="txt-underline"><strong>a man’s cub</strong></span>?” Now, the Law of the Jungle lays down that if there is any dispute as to the right of a cub to be accepted by the Pack, he must be spoken for by at least two members of the Pack who are not his father and mother.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Who speaks for this cub?” said Akela. “Among the Free People who speaks?” There was no answer and <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Mother Wolf got ready for what she knew would be her last fight</strong></span>, if things came to fighting.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then the only other creature who is allowed at the Pack Council—Baloo, the sleepy brown bear who teaches the wolf cubs the Law of the Jungle: old Baloo, who can come and go where he pleases because he eats only nuts and roots and honey—rose upon his hind quarters and grunted.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“The man’s cub—the man’s cub?” he said. “I speak for the man’s cub. There is no harm in a man’s cub. I have no gift of words, but I speak the truth. Let him run with the Pack, and be entered with the others. I myself will teach him.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“We need yet another,” said Akela. “Baloo has spoken, and he is our teacher for the young cubs. Who speaks besides Baloo?”</p>
        <p>A black shadow dropped down into the circle. It was Bagheera the Black Panther, inky black all over, but with the panther markings showing up in certain lights like the pattern of watered silk. Everybody knew Bagheera, and nobody cared to cross his path; for he was as cunning as Tabaqui, as bold as the wild buffalo, and as reckless as the wounded elephant. But he had a voice as soft as wild honey dripping from a tree, and a skin softer than down.</p>
        <p>“O Akela, and ye the Free People,” he purred, “I have no right in your assembly, but the Law of the Jungle says that if there is a doubt which is not a killing matter in regard to a new cub, the life of that cub may be bought at a price. And the Law does not say who may or may not pay that price. Am I right?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Good! Good!” said the young wolves, who are always hungry. “Listen to Bagheera. The cub can be bought for a price. It is the Law.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Knowing that I have no right to speak here, I ask your leave.”</p>
        <p>“Speak then,” cried twenty voices.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“To kill a naked cub is shame. Besides, he may make better sport for you when he is grown. Baloo has spoken in his behalf. Now to Baloo’s word I will add one bull, and a fat one, newly&nbsp;killed, not half a mile from here, if ye will accept the man’s cub according to the Law. Is it difficult?”</p>
        <p>There was a clamor of scores of voices, saying: “What matter? He will die in the winter rains. He will scorch in the sun. What harm can a naked frog do us? Let him run with the Pack. Where is the bull, Bagheera? Let him be accepted.” And then came Akela’s deep bay, crying: “Look well—look well, O Wolves!”</p>
        <p>Mowgli was still deeply interested in the pebbles, and he did not notice when the wolves came and looked at him one by one. At last, they all went down the hill for the dead bull, and only Akela, Bagheera, Baloo, and Mowgli’s own wolves were left. Shere Khan roared still in the night, for he was very angry that Mowgli had not been handed over to him.</p>
        <p>“Ay, roar well,” said Bagheera, under his whiskers, “for the time will come when this naked thing will make thee roar to another tune, or I know nothing of man.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“It was well done,” said Akela. “Men and their cubs are very wise. He may be a help in time.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Truly, a help in time of need; for none can hope to lead the Pack forever,” said Bagheera.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Akela said nothing. He was thinking of the time that comes to every leader of every pack when his strength goes from him and he gets feebler and feebler, till at last he is killed by the wolves and a new leader comes up—to be killed in his turn.</p>
        <p>“Take him away,” he said to Father Wolf, “and train him as befits one of the Free People.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And that is how Mowgli was entered into the Seeonee Wolf Pack for the price of a bull and on Baloo’s good word.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now you must be content to skip ten or eleven whole years, and only guess at all the wonderful life that Mowgli led among the wolves, because if it were written out it would fill ever so many books. He grew up with the cubs, though they, of course, were grown wolves almost before he was a child. And Father Wolf taught him his business, and the meaning of things in the jungle, till every rustle in the grass, every breath of the warm night air, every note of the owls above his head, every scratch of a bat’s claws as it roosted for a while in a tree, and every splash of every little fish jumping in a pool meant just as much to him as the work of his office means to a business man. When he was not learning he sat out in the sun and slept, and ate and went to sleep again. When he felt dirty or hot, he swam in the forest pools; and when he wanted honey (Baloo told him that honey and nuts were just as pleasant to eat as raw meat) he climbed up for it, and that Bagheera showed him how to do.</p>

          <strong>The Jungle Book&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Rudyard Kipling&nbsp;</em><br><br>
There was a chorus of deep growls, and a young wolf in his fourth year flung back Shere Khan’s question to Akela: “What have the Free People to do with <span class="txt-underline"><strong>a man’s cub</strong></span>?” Now, the Law of the Jungle lays down that if there is any dispute as to the right of a cub to be accepted by the Pack, he must be spoken for by at least two members of the Pack who are not his father and mother.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Who speaks for this cub?” said Akela. “Among the Free People who speaks?” There was no answer and <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Mother Wolf got ready for what she knew would be her last fight</strong></span>, if things came to fighting.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then the only other creature who is allowed at the Pack Council—Baloo, the sleepy brown bear who teaches the wolf cubs the Law of the Jungle: old Baloo, who can come and go where he pleases because he eats only nuts and roots and honey—rose upon his hind quarters and grunted.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“The man’s cub—the man’s cub?” he said. “I speak for the man’s cub. There is no harm in a man’s cub. I have no gift of words, but I speak the truth. Let him run with the Pack, and be entered with the others. I myself will teach him.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“We need yet another,” said Akela. “Baloo has spoken, and he is our teacher for the young cubs. Who speaks besides Baloo?”</p>
        <p>A black shadow dropped down into the circle. It was Bagheera the Black Panther, inky black all over, but with the panther markings showing up in certain lights like the pattern of watered silk. Everybody knew Bagheera, and nobody cared to cross his path; for he was as cunning as Tabaqui, as bold as the wild buffalo, and as reckless as the wounded elephant. But he had a voice as soft as wild honey dripping from a tree, and a skin softer than down.</p>
        <p>“O Akela, and ye the Free People,” he purred, “I have no right in your assembly, but the Law of the Jungle says that if there is a doubt which is not a killing matter in regard to a new cub, the life of that cub may be bought at a price. And the Law does not say who may or may not pay that price. Am I right?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Good! Good!” said the young wolves, who are always hungry. “Listen to Bagheera. The cub can be bought for a price. It is the Law.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Knowing that I have no right to speak here, I ask your leave.”</p>
        <p>“Speak then,” cried twenty voices.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“To kill a naked cub is shame. Besides, he may make better sport for you when he is grown. Baloo has spoken in his behalf. Now to Baloo’s word I will add one bull, and a fat one, newly&nbsp;killed, not half a mile from here, if ye will accept the man’s cub according to the Law. Is it difficult?”</p>
        <p>There was a clamor of scores of voices, saying: “What matter? He will die in the winter rains. He will scorch in the sun. What harm can a naked frog do us? Let him run with the Pack. Where is the bull, Bagheera? Let him be accepted.” And then came Akela’s deep bay, crying: “Look well—look well, O Wolves!”</p>
        <p>Mowgli was still deeply interested in the pebbles, and he did not notice when the wolves came and looked at him one by one. At last, they all went down the hill for the dead bull, and only Akela, Bagheera, Baloo, and Mowgli’s own wolves were left. Shere Khan roared still in the night, for he was very angry that Mowgli had not been handed over to him.</p>
        <p>“Ay, roar well,” said Bagheera, under his whiskers, “for the time will come when this naked thing will make thee roar to another tune, or I know nothing of man.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“It was well done,” said Akela. “Men and their cubs are very wise. He may be a help in time.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Truly, a help in time of need; for none can hope to lead the Pack forever,” said Bagheera.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Akela said nothing. He was thinking of the time that comes to every leader of every pack when his strength goes from him and he gets feebler and feebler, till at last he is killed by the wolves and a new leader comes up—to be killed in his turn.</p>
        <p>“Take him away,” he said to Father Wolf, “and train him as befits one of the Free People.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And that is how Mowgli was entered into the Seeonee Wolf Pack for the price of a bull and on Baloo’s good word.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now you must be content to skip ten or eleven whole years, and only guess at all the wonderful life that Mowgli led among the wolves, because if it were written out it would fill ever so many books. He grew up with the cubs, though they, of course, were grown wolves almost before he was a child. And Father Wolf taught him his business, and the meaning of things in the jungle, till every rustle in the grass, every breath of the warm night air, every note of the owls above his head, every scratch of a bat’s claws as it roosted for a while in a tree, and every splash of every little fish jumping in a pool meant just as much to him as the work of his office means to a business man. When he was not learning he sat out in the sun and slept, and ate and went to sleep again. When he felt dirty or hot, he swam in the forest pools; and when he wanted honey (Baloo told him that honey and nuts were just as pleasant to eat as raw meat) he climbed up for it, and that Bagheera showed him how to do.</p>

          <strong>The Jungle Book&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Rudyard Kipling&nbsp;</em><br><br>
There was a chorus of deep growls, and a young wolf in his fourth year flung back Shere Khan’s question to Akela: “What have the Free People to do with <span class="txt-underline"><strong>a man’s cub</strong></span>?” Now, the Law of the Jungle lays down that if there is any dispute as to the right of a cub to be accepted by the Pack, he must be spoken for by at least two members of the Pack who are not his father and mother.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Who speaks for this cub?” said Akela. “Among the Free People who speaks?” There was no answer and <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Mother Wolf got ready for what she knew would be her last fight</strong></span>, if things came to fighting.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then the only other creature who is allowed at the Pack Council—Baloo, the sleepy brown bear who teaches the wolf cubs the Law of the Jungle: old Baloo, who can come and go where he pleases because he eats only nuts and roots and honey—rose upon his hind quarters and grunted.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“The man’s cub—the man’s cub?” he said. “I speak for the man’s cub. There is no harm in a man’s cub. I have no gift of words, but I speak the truth. Let him run with the Pack, and be entered with the others. I myself will teach him.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“We need yet another,” said Akela. “Baloo has spoken, and he is our teacher for the young cubs. Who speaks besides Baloo?”</p>
        <p>A black shadow dropped down into the circle. It was Bagheera the Black Panther, inky black all over, but with the panther markings showing up in certain lights like the pattern of watered silk. Everybody knew Bagheera, and nobody cared to cross his path; for he was as cunning as Tabaqui, as bold as the wild buffalo, and as reckless as the wounded elephant. But he had a voice as soft as wild honey dripping from a tree, and a skin softer than down.</p>
        <p>“O Akela, and ye the Free People,” he purred, “I have no right in your assembly, but the Law of the Jungle says that if there is a doubt which is not a killing matter in regard to a new cub, the life of that cub may be bought at a price. And the Law does not say who may or may not pay that price. Am I right?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Good! Good!” said the young wolves, who are always hungry. “Listen to Bagheera. The cub can be bought for a price. It is the Law.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Knowing that I have no right to speak here, I ask your leave.”</p>
        <p>“Speak then,” cried twenty voices.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“To kill a naked cub is shame. Besides, he may make better sport for you when he is grown. Baloo has spoken in his behalf. Now to Baloo’s word I will add one bull, and a fat one, newly&nbsp;killed, not half a mile from here, if ye will accept the man’s cub according to the Law. Is it difficult?”</p>
        <p>There was a clamor of scores of voices, saying: “What matter? He will die in the winter rains. He will scorch in the sun. What harm can a naked frog do us? Let him run with the Pack. Where is the bull, Bagheera? Let him be accepted.” And then came Akela’s deep bay, crying: “Look well—look well, O Wolves!”</p>
        <p>Mowgli was still deeply interested in the pebbles, and he did not notice when the wolves came and looked at him one by one. At last, they all went down the hill for the dead bull, and only Akela, Bagheera, Baloo, and Mowgli’s own wolves were left. Shere Khan roared still in the night, for he was very angry that Mowgli had not been handed over to him.</p>
        <p>“Ay, roar well,” said Bagheera, under his whiskers, “for the time will come when this naked thing will make thee roar to another tune, or I know nothing of man.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“It was well done,” said Akela. “Men and their cubs are very wise. He may be a help in time.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Truly, a help in time of need; for none can hope to lead the Pack forever,” said Bagheera.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Akela said nothing. He was thinking of the time that comes to every leader of every pack when his strength goes from him and he gets feebler and feebler, till at last he is killed by the wolves and a new leader comes up—to be killed in his turn.</p>
        <p>“Take him away,” he said to Father Wolf, “and train him as befits one of the Free People.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And that is how Mowgli was entered into the Seeonee Wolf Pack for the price of a bull and on Baloo’s good word.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now you must be content to skip ten or eleven whole years, and only guess at all the wonderful life that Mowgli led among the wolves, because if it were written out it would fill ever so many books. He grew up with the cubs, though they, of course, were grown wolves almost before he was a child. And Father Wolf taught him his business, and the meaning of things in the jungle, till every rustle in the grass, every breath of the warm night air, every note of the owls above his head, every scratch of a bat’s claws as it roosted for a while in a tree, and every splash of every little fish jumping in a pool meant just as much to him as the work of his office means to a business man. When he was not learning he sat out in the sun and slept, and ate and went to sleep again. When he felt dirty or hot, he swam in the forest pools; and when he wanted honey (Baloo told him that honey and nuts were just as pleasant to eat as raw meat) he climbed up for it, and that Bagheera showed him how to do.</p>

        <p>The image of Uncle Sam is based on a combination of two earlier American characters: Yankee Doodle and Brother Jonathan. Yankee Doodle was a derogatory term the British used for colonial Americans during the Revolutionary War. <strong>12 ……….</strong> Though the origins of the name Uncle Sam are subject to some dispute, most historians believe that the name came from a New York merchant named Sam Wilson, known by his friends as “Uncle Sam”. <strong>13 ……….</strong> The barrels were stamped with the initials U.S., for United States, but many associated the initials with “Uncle Sam” Wilson. <strong>14 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>Illustrations of Uncle Sam, <strong>15 ……….,</strong> began appearing shortly after the War of 1812. British cartoonists from <em>Punch</em> magazine were the first to fully develop the image of Uncle Sam as a tall, bearded, thin figure. American cartoonist Thomas Nast cemented the image of Uncle Sam in his own drawings during the 1870s.</p>
        <p>By the early 1900s, Uncle Sam had become known worldwide as a symbol for the United States. <strong>16 ………. </strong>The U.S. government printed millions of these posters during World War I and used the image again during World War II. <strong>17 ………. </strong>Most depictions today closely resemble Flagg’s famous illustration.</p>

        <p>The image of Uncle Sam is based on a combination of two earlier American characters: Yankee Doodle and Brother Jonathan. Yankee Doodle was a derogatory term the British used for colonial Americans during the Revolutionary War. <strong>12 ……….</strong> Though the origins of the name Uncle Sam are subject to some dispute, most historians believe that the name came from a New York merchant named Sam Wilson, known by his friends as “Uncle Sam”. <strong>13 ……….</strong> The barrels were stamped with the initials U.S., for United States, but many associated the initials with “Uncle Sam” Wilson. <strong>14 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>Illustrations of Uncle Sam, <strong>15 ……….,</strong> began appearing shortly after the War of 1812. British cartoonists from <em>Punch</em> magazine were the first to fully develop the image of Uncle Sam as a tall, bearded, thin figure. American cartoonist Thomas Nast cemented the image of Uncle Sam in his own drawings during the 1870s.</p>
        <p>By the early 1900s, Uncle Sam had become known worldwide as a symbol for the United States. <strong>16 ………. </strong>The U.S. government printed millions of these posters during World War I and used the image again during World War II. <strong>17 ………. </strong>Most depictions today closely resemble Flagg’s famous illustration.</p>

A problem with expectations was made famous by the Charles Dickens 1861 novel, "Great Expectations". The main character, Pip, inherits money from a secret benefactor. He views this fortune as a stepping stone to marrying the girl of his dreams.<br>
<br>
When he ultimately learned that the money was not necessarily part of that larger plan, he realised that he had taken for granted so many important relationships and gifts in his life. His expectations had robbed him of fully appreciating his reality.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong> ^}<br>
Research backs up the idea that we may not fully appreciate what we have when we are expecting more or comparing what we have to what we could have. One study found that participants who were exposed to a subliminal reminder of wealth spent less time savouring a chocolate bar and exhibited less enjoyment of the experience than other subjects who weren't reminded of wealth.<br>
<br>
This is an interesting study that can remind us all to try to savour our chocolate (and lives) more, and perhaps to try not to remind ourselves of what we don't have. This study can also remind us, however, of how easy it is to let our thoughts colour our enjoyment of what we actually have.<br>
<br>
How many times have we focused so much on something we wanted that we didn't truly savour what we had? How often might our expectations for great things make us feel like what we have isn't really that great (when there are many people who have less)?<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C&nbsp;</strong>^}<br>
Our expectations can get the better of us when we expect more than what is realistic in a given situation. We might expect our partners to live up to what we see in romance films, our jobs to be idealised versions we had as children, or even our lives to match up to what we see on Instagram.<br>
<br>
Our expectations can create significant stress when they don't match up to reality. Also consider how social media can greatly contribute to this: we compare our own worst moments (those not deemed to be shareable online) to others' best moments, which very often are filtered to seem perfect. We may not even realise this mismatched comparison.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D&nbsp;</strong>^}<br>
If you'd like to get out of the expectations vs. reality trap, it all comes down to awareness. Becoming aware of what you are expecting is a great start. Becoming aware of what you "should" be expecting is also a wise idea.<br>
<br>
When you find that what is happening is not what you expected, actively look for the positives in what you have. You may find that once you get over the disappointment, you have something you didn't initially realise you wanted. This helps you to be more appreciative of what you have.</div>
