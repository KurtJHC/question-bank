            <strong>Rhodopis and the Slippers</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> Long ago Rhodopis left her home in Greece and went far away to Egypt, where she worked as a housemaid. Rhodopis didn’t look like the other housemaids, so they often mistreated her.</p>
        <p><strong><em>2</em></strong> “Rhodopis, make us something to eat! Wash our clothes!” the housemaids screamed. They also blamed Rhodopis for all their mistakes.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> One day the master of the house saw Rhodopis dancing as she did her work. He was charmed by how gracefully Rhodopis danced, so he had a special pair of beautiful slippers made for her. Angered by the gift, the other housemaids treated Rhodopis even worse than before.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> A month later, the pharaoh, or ruler, of Egypt announced a great feast. Even servants were invited, as long as they finished their work. However, the housemaids gave Rhodopis so much of their work that she wasn’t able to go.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> Later, while everyone was at the feast, Rhodopis sat alone by the Nile River. “What good are these?” she asked as she pulled the slippers from her feet. Suddenly a falcon flew down and stole one slipper. With a heavy heart, Rhodopis watched as the falcon flew away.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> At the same time that Rhodopis sat on the shore of the river, the pharaoh’s son Amasis sat alone at the great feast. To his surprise a falcon dropped a slipper onto his lap. Amasis knew this was a sign. The maiden who wore the slipper would be his princess.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> The next day Amasis began his search. Women young and old tried on the slipper, but it fit none of them. Soon Amasis arrived at the house where Rhodopis lived. The other housemaids oiled their feet, but still the slipper wouldn’t fit. Then Amasis saw Rhodopis watching from a distance and called her over. The slipper fit perfectly.</p>

            <strong>A Star for a Prince</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> In Persia long ago a girl named Settareh, which means “star,” was born with a star-shaped mark on her cheek. Settareh’s mother died. Later her father married another woman who already had two daughters of her own. Shortly afterward Settareh’s father became ill and died, leaving Settareh to be raised by her stepmother.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> Settareh’s stepmother and stepsisters treated her very unkindly. They took away her fine clothes and made her wear their old clothes. She had to do many of their chores. They let her eat only what was left after they had finished, so she often went hungry.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> One day the family was invited to the prince’s royal ball. The stepmother gave her daughters and Settareh money to buy new dresses in town. While Settareh looked for a dress to buy, she felt weak. As she bought something to eat, she thought, “I will still have enough money for a dress.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> “Please, can you spare some food?” a beggar asked. The beggar looked thin and weak from starvation. Without a thought Settareh spent the rest of her money on food for the beggar.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> “Please take this,” the beggar smiled, offering Settareh a small blue jug. Although it was cracked, Settareh accepted the old woman’s gift.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “Fool!” Settareh’s stepsisters laughed when she returned without a dress. Later they left for the ball without her.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> “If only I had a dress,” Settareh sighed, holding the jug. Suddenly she was wearing a beautiful dress and matching anklets</p>
        <p>around her ankles.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “But how will I get to the ball?” No sooner had Settareh spoken than she was there.</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="95%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766040209/dn4yr3goyeqptkokhqpu.png" alt="ASS_Y3_EN_12">


        </p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> Fearing her stepmother and stepsisters would see her new dress, Settareh stayed where they wouldn’t notice her. She was sitting alone when the prince walked up and introduced himself. She had a wonderful time talking and laughing with the prince. Then she noticed the time. She fled so she could be home to change before her stepmother and stepsisters arrived.</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> The prince was heartbroken as he watched Settareh leave. As he walked sadly outside the palace, he came across one of her anklets on the ground. He decided that he must find Settareh again and make her his wife. The next day he began his search.</p>
        <p>He asked every woman in the land to try on the anklet, but it was too small. Finally he came to Settareh’s house. Her stepsisters pushed and pushed, but the anklet would not fit. The prince was about to leave when he saw small footprints in the dirt. “Who made these?” he demanded.</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> “I did,” Settareh said from behind her stepsisters. Keeping her head down, she slipped on the anklet. When she looked up at the prince, he recognized the star on her cheek.</p>

            <strong>A Star for a Prince</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> In Persia long ago a girl named Settareh, which means “star,” was born with a star-shaped mark on her cheek. Settareh’s mother died. Later her father married another woman who already had two daughters of her own. Shortly afterward Settareh’s father became ill and died, leaving Settareh to be raised by her stepmother.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> Settareh’s stepmother and stepsisters treated her very unkindly. They took away her fine clothes and made her wear their old clothes. She had to do many of their chores. They let her eat only what was left after they had finished, so she often went hungry.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> One day the family was invited to the prince’s royal ball. The stepmother gave her daughters and Settareh money to buy new dresses in town. While Settareh looked for a dress to buy, she felt weak. As she bought something to eat, she thought, “I will still have enough money for a dress.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> “Please, can you spare some food?” a beggar asked. The beggar looked thin and weak from starvation. Without a thought Settareh spent the rest of her money on food for the beggar.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> “Please take this,” the beggar smiled, offering Settareh a small blue jug. Although it was cracked, Settareh accepted the old woman’s gift.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “Fool!” Settareh’s stepsisters laughed when she returned without a dress. Later they left for the ball without her.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> “If only I had a dress,” Settareh sighed, holding the jug. Suddenly she was wearing a beautiful dress and matching anklets</p>
        <p>around her ankles.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “But how will I get to the ball?” No sooner had Settareh spoken than she was there.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> Fearing her stepmother and stepsisters would see her new dress, Settareh stayed where they wouldn’t notice her. She was sitting alone when the prince walked up and introduced himself. She had a wonderful time talking and laughing with the prince. Then she noticed the time. She fled so she could be home to change before her stepmother and stepsisters arrived.</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> The prince was heartbroken as he watched Settareh leave. As he walked sadly outside the palace, he came across one of her anklets on the ground. He decided that he must find Settareh again and make her his wife. The next day he began his search.</p>
        <p>He asked every woman in the land to try on the anklet, but it was too small. Finally he came to Settareh’s house. Her stepsisters pushed and pushed, but the anklet would not fit. The prince was about to leave when he saw small footprints in the dirt. “Who made these?” he demanded.</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> “I did,” Settareh said from behind her stepsisters. Keeping her head down, she slipped on the anklet. When she looked up at the prince, he recognized the star on her cheek.</p>

            <strong>A Star for a Prince</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> In Persia long ago a girl named Settareh, which means “star,” was born with a star-shaped mark on her cheek. Settareh’s mother died. Later her father married another woman who already had two daughters of her own. Shortly afterward Settareh’s father became ill and died, leaving Settareh to be raised by her stepmother.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> Settareh’s stepmother and stepsisters treated her very unkindly. They took away her fine clothes and made her wear their old clothes. She had to do many of their chores. They let her eat only what was left after they had finished, so she often went hungry.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> One day the family was invited to the prince’s royal ball. The stepmother gave her daughters and Settareh money to buy new dresses in town. While Settareh looked for a dress to buy, she felt weak. As she bought something to eat, she thought, “I will still have enough money for a dress.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> “Please, can you spare some food?” a beggar asked. The beggar looked thin and weak from starvation. Without a thought Settareh spent the rest of her money on food for the beggar.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> “Please take this,” the beggar smiled, offering Settareh a small blue jug. Although it was cracked, Settareh accepted the old woman’s gift.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “Fool!” Settareh’s stepsisters laughed when she returned without a dress. Later they left for the ball without her.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> “If only I had a dress,” Settareh sighed, holding the jug. Suddenly she was wearing a beautiful dress and matching anklets</p>
        <p>around her ankles.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “But how will I get to the ball?” No sooner had Settareh spoken than she was there.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> Fearing her stepmother and stepsisters would see her new dress, Settareh stayed where they wouldn’t notice her. She was sitting alone when the prince walked up and introduced himself. She had a wonderful time talking and laughing with the prince. Then she noticed the time. She fled so she could be home to change before her stepmother and stepsisters arrived.</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> The prince was heartbroken as he watched Settareh leave. As he walked sadly outside the palace, he came across one of her anklets on the ground. He decided that he must find Settareh again and make her his wife. The next day he began his search.</p>
        <p>He asked every woman in the land to try on the anklet, but it was too small. Finally he came to Settareh’s house. Her stepsisters pushed and pushed, but the anklet would not fit. The prince was about to leave when he saw small footprints in the dirt. “Who made these?” he demanded.</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> “I did,” Settareh said from behind her stepsisters. Keeping her head down, she slipped on the anklet. When she looked up at the prince, he recognized the star on her cheek.</p>

        <p>around her ankles.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “But how will I get to the ball?” No sooner had Settareh spoken than she was there.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> Fearing her stepmother and stepsisters would see her new dress, Settareh stayed where they wouldn’t notice her. She was sitting alone when the prince walked up and introduced himself. She had a wonderful time talking and laughing with the prince. Then she noticed the time. She fled so she could be home to change before her stepmother and stepsisters arrived.</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> The prince was heartbroken as he watched Settareh leave. As he walked sadly outside the palace, he came across one of her anklets on the ground. He decided that he must find Settareh again and make her his wife. The next day he began his search.</p>
        <p>He asked every woman in the land to try on the anklet, but it was too small. Finally he came to Settareh’s house. Her stepsisters pushed and pushed, but the anklet would not fit. The prince was about to leave when he saw small footprints in the dirt. “Who made these?” he demanded.</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> “I did,” Settareh said from behind her stepsisters. Keeping her head down, she slipped on the anklet. When she looked up at the prince, he recognized the star on her cheek.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em>&nbsp;Long ago Rhodopis left her home in Greece and went far away to Egypt, where she worked as a housemaid. Rhodopis didn’t look like the other housemaids, so they often mistreated her.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em>&nbsp;“Rhodopis, make us something to eat! Wash our clothes!” the housemaids screamed. They also blamed Rhodopis for all their mistakes.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em>&nbsp;One day the master of the house saw Rhodopis dancing as she did her work. He was charmed by how gracefully Rhodopis danced, so he had a special pair of beautiful slippers made for her. Angered by the gift, the other housemaids treated Rhodopis even worse than before.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em>&nbsp;A month later, the pharaoh, or ruler, of Egypt announced a great feast. Even servants were invited, as long as they finished their work. However, the housemaids gave Rhodopis so much of their work that she wasn’t able to go.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em>&nbsp;Later, while everyone was at the feast, Rhodopis sat alone by the Nile River. “What good are these?” she asked as she pulled the slippers from her feet. Suddenly a falcon flew down and stole one slipper. With a heavy heart, Rhodopis watched as the falcon flew away.</p>

            <strong>A Star for a Prince</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p><strong><em>1</em></strong> In Persia long ago a girl named Settareh, which means “star,” was born with a star-shaped mark on her cheek. Settareh’s mother died. Later her father married another woman who already had two daughters of her own. Shortly afterward Settareh’s father became ill and died, leaving Settareh to be raised by her stepmother.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> Settareh’s stepmother and stepsisters treated her very unkindly. They took away her fine clothes and made her wear their old clothes. She had to do many of their chores. They let her eat only what was left after they had finished, so she often went hungry.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> One day the family was invited to the prince’s royal ball. The stepmother gave her daughters and Settareh money to buy new dresses in town. While Settareh looked for a dress to buy, she felt weak. As she bought something to eat, she thought, “I will still have enough money for a dress.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> “Please, can you spare some food?” a beggar asked. The beggar looked thin and weak from starvation. Without a thought Settareh spent the rest of her money on food for the beggar.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> “Please take this,” the beggar smiled, offering Settareh a small blue jug. Although it was cracked, Settareh accepted the old woman’s gift.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “Fool!” Settareh’s stepsisters laughed when she returned without a dress. Later they left for the ball without her.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> “If only I had a dress,” Settareh sighed, holding the jug. Suddenly she was wearing a beautiful dress and matching anklets</p>
        <p>around her ankles.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “But how will I get to the ball?” No sooner had Settareh spoken than she was there.</p>

        <p><strong><em>1</em></strong> In Persia long ago a girl named Settareh, which means “star,” was born with a star-shaped mark on her cheek. Settareh’s mother died. Later her father married another woman who already had two daughters of her own. Shortly afterward Settareh’s father became ill and died, leaving Settareh to be raised by her stepmother.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> Settareh’s stepmother and stepsisters treated her very unkindly. They took away her fine clothes and made her wear their old clothes. She had to do many of their chores. They let her eat only what was left after they had finished, so she often went hungry.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> One day the family was invited to the prince’s royal ball. The stepmother gave her daughters and Settareh money to buy new dresses in town. While Settareh looked for a dress to buy, she felt weak. As she bought something to eat, she thought, “I will still have enough money for a dress.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> “Please, can you spare some food?” a beggar asked. The beggar looked thin and weak from starvation. Without a thought Settareh spent the rest of her money on food for the beggar.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> “Please take this,” the beggar smiled, offering Settareh a small blue jug. Although it was cracked, Settareh accepted the old woman’s gift.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “Fool!” Settareh’s stepsisters laughed when she returned without a dress. Later they left for the ball without her.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> “If only I had a dress,” Settareh sighed, holding the jug. Suddenly she was wearing a beautiful dress and matching anklets</p>
        <p>around her ankles.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “But how will I get to the ball?” No sooner had Settareh spoken than she was there.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> Fearing her stepmother and stepsisters would see her new dress, Settareh stayed where they wouldn’t notice her. She was sitting alone when the prince walked up and introduced himself. She had a wonderful time talking and laughing with the prince. Then she noticed the time. She fled so she could be home to change before her stepmother and stepsisters arrived.</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> The prince was heartbroken as he watched Settareh leave. As he walked sadly outside the palace, he came across one of her anklets on the ground. He decided that he must find Settareh again and make her his wife. The next day he began his search.</p>
        <p>He asked every woman in the land to try on the anklet, but it was too small. Finally he came to Settareh’s house. Her stepsisters pushed and pushed, but the anklet would not fit. The prince was about to leave when he saw small footprints in the dirt. “Who made these?” he demanded.</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> “I did,” Settareh said from behind her stepsisters. Keeping her head down, she slipped on the anklet. When she looked up at the prince, he recognized the star on her cheek.</p>

            <strong>Rhodopis and the Slippers</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em>&nbsp;Long ago Rhodopis left her home in Greece and went far away to Egypt, where she worked as a housemaid. Rhodopis didn’t look like the other housemaids, so they often mistreated her.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em>&nbsp;“Rhodopis, make us something to eat! Wash our clothes!” the housemaids screamed. They also blamed Rhodopis for all their mistakes.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em>&nbsp;One day the master of the house saw Rhodopis dancing as she did her work. He was charmed by how gracefully Rhodopis danced, so he had a special pair of beautiful slippers made for her. Angered by the gift, the other housemaids treated Rhodopis even worse than before.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em>&nbsp;A month later, the pharaoh, or ruler, of Egypt announced a great feast. Even servants were invited, as long as they finished their work. However, the housemaids gave Rhodopis so much of their work that she wasn’t able to go.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em>&nbsp;Later, while everyone was at the feast, Rhodopis sat alone by the Nile River. “What good are these?” she asked as she pulled the slippers from her feet. Suddenly a falcon flew down and stole one slipper. With a heavy heart, Rhodopis watched as the falcon flew away.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>6&nbsp;At the same time that Rhodopis sat on the shore of the river, the pharaoh’s son Amasis sat alone at the great feast. To his surprise a falcon dropped a slipper onto his lap. Amasis knew this was a sign. The maiden who wore the slipper would be his princess.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em>&nbsp;The next day Amasis began his search. Women young and old tried on the slipper, but it fit none of them. Soon Amasis arrived at the house where Rhodopis lived. The other housemaids oiled their feet, but still the slipper wouldn’t fit. Then Amasis saw Rhodopis watching from a distance and called her over. The slipper fit perfectly.</p>

          <strong>A School on Rails</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> Anne and Jim were visiting Grandpa. They liked the time after supper when they usually sat and talked. Grandpa often told them stories about the “old days,” when he was a boy. Sometimes his stories were funny. Other times they were sad. Most of his stories were about how things used to be.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> “Last week I found a picture of a school I went to when I was a boy. Let me show it to you.” Grandpa went to his desk and brought back an old, faded photograph.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> Jim looked at it and said, “But, Grandpa, this looks like a train!”</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> “It was my school for a while,” Grandpa said. “Would you like to hear about it?”</p>
        <p><strong><em>5</em></strong> “A school in a train?” asked Anne.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “I have to hear this!” exclaimed Jim.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> Grandpa looked at the picture silently for a moment. “When I was a boy, my father worked for the railroad in Canada,” he began. “His job was to take care of sections of railroad track in remote areas. The workers’ families lived along the tracks in small groups many miles from other towns or people. There was no school. Everyone knew this was a problem, but no one knew what to do about it.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “At last someone had an idea. A railroad car was turned into a schoolroom, and school was brought to us! It stopped at settlements where there were enough children to attend and stayed for several weeks. Then it moved on to the next settlement. There was a teacher on the train who taught the lessons.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> “Where did the teacher live?” asked Jim.</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> “The teacher lived in the railroad car! He had a small kitchen with a sink and stove and a living area with a dining room, bedroom, and bathroom. There was no electricity on the train. A small furnace burned coal to keep the school car warm.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> “It doesn’t look much like a school,” Anne said, looking at the picture again.</p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> “In many ways it was just an ordinary railroad car,” Grandpa said. “It had comfortable cushioned seats and wood-paneled walls lined with windows. However, they did modify some things. The seats were turned to face each other, and a table was put in between each pair. At the front of the car were chalkboards, maps, and a desk for the teacher. Rows of shelves held books and other supplies.</p>

        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> “Our parents didn’t have to make us go to school. We were happy for the chance to go. Any child who was able to get to the school car was allowed to attend, so the school car served the children of loggers, farmers, and miners in the area, too. I had 10 classmates.</p>
        <p><em><strong>14</strong></em> “School lasted from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M., with about an hour for lunch and recess. We learned most of the same lessons as students in regular schools did. The school car stayed for about six weeks. Then it was pushed back onto the main track, hitched to an engine, and pulled to the next settlement. While the school car was away, we did homework. When it returned, we were ready to continue to learn in our school on rails.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>15</strong></em> “Does it still exist?” Anne asked.</p>
        <p><em><strong>16</strong></em> “No,” Grandpa answered. “After a while, things changed. School cars aren’t around any longer. More people moved into the area. New roads were built, and towns were established. Schoolhouses were erected, too. My family moved to a small town. Other families sent their children to school in nearby towns. The school car wasn’t needed anymore.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>17</strong></em> “Too bad,” Jim muttered.</p>
        <p><em><strong>18</strong></em> “Oh, it’s probably for the best,” Grandpa added. “There was too much work for one teacher, and the time between visits was too long. Sometimes the homework was difficult, and no one could help. Still, while it was around, the school car was a special place for many of us.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>19</strong></em> “Do you remember the children in this picture?” Anne asked.</p>
        <p><em><strong>20</strong></em> “Some of them,” answered Grandpa. “But I remember all of those cold Canadian winters! After we do the dishes, I’ll tell you all about them.”</p>

          <strong>A School on Rails</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> Anne and Jim were visiting Grandpa. They liked the time after supper when they usually sat and talked. Grandpa often told them stories about the “old days,” when he was a boy. Sometimes his stories were funny. Other times they were sad. Most of his stories were about how things used to be.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> “Last week I found a picture of a school I went to when I was a boy. Let me show it to you.” Grandpa went to his desk and brought back an old, faded photograph.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> Jim looked at it and said, “But, Grandpa, this looks like a train!”</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> “It was my school for a while,” Grandpa said. “Would you like to hear about it?”</p>
        <p><strong><em>5</em></strong> “A school in a train?” asked Anne.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “I have to hear this!” exclaimed Jim.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> Grandpa looked at the picture silently for a moment. “When I was a boy, my father worked for the railroad in Canada,” he began. “His job was to take care of sections of railroad track in remote areas. The workers’ families lived along the tracks in small groups many miles from other towns or people. There was no school. Everyone knew this was a problem, but no one knew what to do about it.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “At last someone had an idea. A railroad car was turned into a schoolroom, and school was brought to us! It stopped at settlements where there were enough children to attend and stayed for several weeks. Then it moved on to the next settlement. There was a teacher on the train who taught the lessons.”</p>

        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> “Our parents didn’t have to make us go to school. We were happy for the chance to go. Any child who was able to get to the school car was allowed to attend, so the school car served the children of loggers, farmers, and miners in the area, too. I had 10 classmates.</p>
        <p><em><strong>14</strong></em> “School lasted from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M., with about an hour for lunch and recess. We learned most of the same lessons as students in regular schools did. The school car stayed for about six weeks. Then it was pushed back onto the main track, hitched to an engine, and pulled to the next settlement. While the school car was away, we did homework. When it returned, we were ready to continue to learn in our school on rails.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>15</strong></em> “Does it still exist?” Anne asked.</p>
        <p><em><strong>16</strong></em> “No,” Grandpa answered. “After a while, things changed. School cars aren’t around any longer. More people moved into the area. New roads were built, and towns were established. Schoolhouses were erected, too. My family moved to a small town. Other families sent their children to school in nearby towns. The school car wasn’t needed anymore.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>17</strong></em> “Too bad,” Jim muttered.</p>
        <p><em><strong>18</strong></em> “Oh, it’s probably for the best,” Grandpa added. “There was too much work for one teacher, and the time between visits was too long. Sometimes the homework was difficult, and no one could help. Still, while it was around, the school car was a special place for many of us.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>19</strong></em> “Do you remember the children in this picture?” Anne asked.</p>
        <p><em><strong>20</strong></em> “Some of them,” answered Grandpa. “But I remember all of those cold Canadian winters! After we do the dishes, I’ll tell you all about them.”</p>

          <strong>A School on Rails</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> Anne and Jim were visiting Grandpa. They liked the time after supper when they usually sat and talked. Grandpa often told them stories about the “old days,” when he was a boy. Sometimes his stories were funny. Other times they were sad. Most of his stories were about how things used to be.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> “Last week I found a picture of a school I went to when I was a boy. Let me show it to you.” Grandpa went to his desk and brought back an old, faded photograph.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> Jim looked at it and said, “But, Grandpa, this looks like a train!”</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> “It was my school for a while,” Grandpa said. “Would you like to hear about it?”</p>
        <p><strong><em>5</em></strong> “A school in a train?” asked Anne.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “I have to hear this!” exclaimed Jim.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> Grandpa looked at the picture silently for a moment. “When I was a boy, my father worked for the railroad in Canada,” he began. “His job was to take care of sections of railroad track in remote areas. The workers’ families lived along the tracks in small groups many miles from other towns or people. There was no school. Everyone knew this was a problem, but no one knew what to do about it.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “At last someone had an idea. A railroad car was turned into a schoolroom, and school was brought to us! It stopped at settlements where there were enough children to attend and stayed for several weeks. Then it moved on to the next settlement. There was a teacher on the train who taught the lessons.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> “Where did the teacher live?” asked Jim.</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> “The teacher lived in the railroad car! He had a small kitchen with a sink and stove and a living area with a dining room, bedroom, and bathroom. There was no electricity on the train. A small furnace burned coal to keep the school car warm.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> “It doesn’t look much like a school,” Anne said, looking at the picture again.</p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> “In many ways it was just an ordinary railroad car,” Grandpa said. “It had comfortable cushioned seats and wood-paneled walls lined with windows. However, they did modify some things. The seats were turned to face each other, and a table was put in between each pair. At the front of the car were chalkboards, maps, and a desk for the teacher. Rows of shelves held books and other supplies.</p>

        <p><em><strong>18</strong></em> “Oh, it’s probably for the best,” Grandpa added. “There was too much work for one teacher, and the time between visits was too long. Sometimes the homework was difficult, and no one could help. Still, while it was around, the school car was a special place for many of us.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>19</strong></em> “Do you remember the children in this picture?” Anne asked.</p>
        <p><em><strong>20</strong></em> “Some of them,” answered Grandpa. “But I remember all of those cold Canadian winters! After we do the dishes, I’ll tell you all about them.”</p>

          <strong>A School on Rails</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> Anne and Jim were visiting Grandpa. They liked the time after supper when they usually sat and talked. Grandpa often told them stories about the “old days,” when he was a boy. Sometimes his stories were funny. Other times they were sad. Most of his stories were about how things used to be.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> “Last week I found a picture of a school I went to when I was a boy. Let me show it to you.” Grandpa went to his desk and brought back an old, faded photograph.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> Jim looked at it and said, “But, Grandpa, this looks like a train!”</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> “It was my school for a while,” Grandpa said. “Would you like to hear about it?”</p>
        <p><strong><em>5</em></strong> “A school in a train?” asked Anne.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “I have to hear this!” exclaimed Jim.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> Grandpa looked at the picture silently for a moment. “When I was a boy, my father worked for the railroad in Canada,” he began. “His job was to take care of sections of railroad track in remote areas. The workers’ families lived along the tracks in small groups many miles from other towns or people. There was no school. Everyone knew this was a problem, but no one knew what to do about it.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “At last someone had an idea. A railroad car was turned into a schoolroom, and school was brought to us! It stopped at settlements where there were enough children to attend and stayed for several weeks. Then it moved on to the next settlement. There was a teacher on the train who taught the lessons.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> “Where did the teacher live?” asked Jim.</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> “The teacher lived in the railroad car! He had a small kitchen with a sink and stove and a living area with a dining room, bedroom, and bathroom. There was no electricity on the train. A small furnace burned coal to keep the school car warm.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> “It doesn’t look much like a school,” Anne said, looking at the picture again.</p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> “In many ways it was just an ordinary railroad car,” Grandpa said. “It had comfortable cushioned seats and wood-paneled walls lined with windows. However, they did modify some things. The seats were turned to face each other, and a table was put in between each pair. At the front of the car were chalkboards, maps, and a desk for the teacher. Rows of shelves held books and other supplies.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> “Our parents didn’t have to make us go to school. We were happy for the chance to go. Any child who was able to get to the school car was allowed to attend, so the school car served the children of loggers, farmers, and miners in the area, too. I had 10 classmates.</p>
        <p><em><strong>14</strong></em> “School lasted from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M., with about an hour for lunch and recess. We learned most of the same lessons as students in regular schools did. The school car stayed for about six weeks. Then it was pushed back onto the main track, hitched to an engine, and pulled to the next settlement. While the school car was away, we did homework. When it returned, we were ready to continue to learn in our school on rails.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>15</strong></em> “Does it still exist?” Anne asked.</p>
        <p><em><strong>16</strong></em> “No,” Grandpa answered. “After a while, things changed. School cars aren’t around any longer. More people moved into the area. New roads were built, and towns were established. Schoolhouses were erected, too. My family moved to a small town. Other families sent their children to school in nearby towns. The school car wasn’t needed anymore.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>17</strong></em> “Too bad,” Jim muttered.</p>
        <p><em><strong>18</strong></em> “Oh, it’s probably for the best,” Grandpa added. “There was too much work for one teacher, and the time between visits was too long. Sometimes the homework was difficult, and no one could help. Still, while it was around, the school car was a special place for many of us.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>19</strong></em> “Do you remember the children in this picture?” Anne asked.</p>
        <p><em><strong>20</strong></em> “Some of them,” answered Grandpa. “But I remember all of those cold Canadian winters! After we do the dishes, I’ll tell you all about them.”</p>

          <strong>A School on Rails</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> Anne and Jim were visiting Grandpa. They liked the time after supper when they usually sat and talked. Grandpa often told them stories about the “old days,” when he was a boy. Sometimes his stories were funny. Other times they were sad. Most of his stories were about how things used to be.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> “Last week I found a picture of a school I went to when I was a boy. Let me show it to you.” Grandpa went to his desk and brought back an old, faded photograph.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> Jim looked at it and said, “But, Grandpa, this looks like a train!”</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> “It was my school for a while,” Grandpa said. “Would you like to hear about it?”</p>
        <p><strong><em>5</em></strong> “A school in a train?” asked Anne.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “I have to hear this!” exclaimed Jim.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> Grandpa looked at the picture silently for a moment. “When I was a boy, my father worked for the railroad in Canada,” he began. “His job was to take care of sections of railroad track in remote areas. The workers’ families lived along the tracks in small groups many miles from other towns or people. There was no school. Everyone knew this was a problem, but no one knew what to do about it.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “At last someone had an idea. A railroad car was turned into a schoolroom, and school was brought to us! It stopped at settlements where there were enough children to attend and stayed for several weeks. Then it moved on to the next settlement. There was a teacher on the train who taught the lessons.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> “Where did the teacher live?” asked Jim.</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> “The teacher lived in the railroad car! He had a small kitchen with a sink and stove and a living area with a dining room, bedroom, and bathroom. There was no electricity on the train. A small furnace burned coal to keep the school car warm.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> “It doesn’t look much like a school,” Anne said, looking at the picture again.</p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> “In many ways it was just an ordinary railroad car,” Grandpa said. “It had comfortable cushioned seats and wood-paneled walls lined with windows. However, they did modify some things. The seats were turned to face each other, and a table was put in between each pair. At the front of the car were chalkboards, maps, and a desk for the teacher. Rows of shelves held books and other supplies.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> “Our parents didn’t have to make us go to school. We were happy for the chance to go. Any child who was able to get to the school car was allowed to attend, so the school car served the children of loggers, farmers, and miners in the area, too. I had 10 classmates.</p>
        <p><em><strong>14</strong></em> “School lasted from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M., with about an hour for lunch and recess. We learned most of the same lessons as students in regular schools did. The school car stayed for about six weeks. Then it was pushed back onto the main track, hitched to an engine, and pulled to the next settlement. While the school car was away, we did homework. When it returned, we were ready to continue to learn in our school on rails.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>15</strong></em> “Does it still exist?” Anne asked.</p>
        <p><em><strong>16</strong></em> “No,” Grandpa answered. “After a while, things changed. School cars aren’t around any longer. More people moved into the area. New roads were built, and towns were established. Schoolhouses were erected, too. My family moved to a small town. Other families sent their children to school in nearby towns. The school car wasn’t needed anymore.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>17</strong></em> “Too bad,” Jim muttered.</p>
        <p><em><strong>18</strong></em> “Oh, it’s probably for the best,” Grandpa added. “There was too much work for one teacher, and the time between visits was too long. Sometimes the homework was difficult, and no one could help. Still, while it was around, the school car was a special place for many of us.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>19</strong></em> “Do you remember the children in this picture?” Anne asked.</p>
        <p><em><strong>20</strong></em> “Some of them,” answered Grandpa. “But I remember all of those cold Canadian winters! After we do the dishes, I’ll tell you all about them.”</p>

          <strong>A School on Rails</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> Anne and Jim were visiting Grandpa. They liked the time after supper when they usually sat and talked. Grandpa often told them stories about the “old days,” when he was a boy. Sometimes his stories were funny. Other times they were sad. Most of his stories were about how things used to be.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> “Last week I found a picture of a school I went to when I was a boy. Let me show it to you.” Grandpa went to his desk and brought back an old, faded photograph.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> Jim looked at it and said, “But, Grandpa, this looks like a train!”</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> “It was my school for a while,” Grandpa said. “Would you like to hear about it?”</p>
        <p><strong><em>5</em></strong> “A school in a train?” asked Anne.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “I have to hear this!” exclaimed Jim.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> Grandpa looked at the picture silently for a moment. “When I was a boy, my father worked for the railroad in Canada,” he began. “His job was to take care of sections of railroad track in remote areas. The workers’ families lived along the tracks in small groups many miles from other towns or people. There was no school. Everyone knew this was a problem, but no one knew what to do about it.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “At last someone had an idea. A railroad car was turned into a schoolroom, and school was brought to us! It stopped at settlements where there were enough children to attend and stayed for several weeks. Then it moved on to the next settlement. There was a teacher on the train who taught the lessons.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> “Where did the teacher live?” asked Jim.</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> “The teacher lived in the railroad car! He had a small kitchen with a sink and stove and a living area with a dining room, bedroom, and bathroom. There was no electricity on the train. A small furnace burned coal to keep the school car warm.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> “It doesn’t look much like a school,” Anne said, looking at the picture again.</p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> “In many ways it was just an ordinary railroad car,” Grandpa said. “It had comfortable cushioned seats and wood-paneled walls lined with windows. However, they did modify some things. The seats were turned to face each other, and a table was put in between each pair. At the front of the car were chalkboards, maps, and a desk for the teacher. Rows of shelves held books and other supplies.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> “Our parents didn’t have to make us go to school. We were happy for the chance to go. Any child who was able to get to the school car was allowed to attend, so the school car served the children of loggers, farmers, and miners in the area, too. I had 10 classmates.</p>
        <p><em><strong>14</strong></em> “School lasted from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M., with about an hour for lunch and recess. We learned most of the same lessons as students in regular schools did. The school car stayed for about six weeks. Then it was pushed back onto the main track, hitched to an engine, and pulled to the next settlement. While the school car was away, we did homework. When it returned, we were ready to continue to learn in our school on rails.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>15</strong></em> “Does it still exist?” Anne asked.</p>
        <p><em><strong>16</strong></em> “No,” Grandpa answered. “After a while, things changed. School cars aren’t around any longer. More people moved into the area. New roads were built, and towns were established. Schoolhouses were erected, too. My family moved to a small town. Other families sent their children to school in nearby towns. The school car wasn’t needed anymore.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>17</strong></em> “Too bad,” Jim muttered.</p>
        <p><em><strong>18</strong></em> “Oh, it’s probably for the best,” Grandpa added. “There was too much work for one teacher, and the time between visits was too long. Sometimes the homework was difficult, and no one could help. Still, while it was around, the school car was a special place for many of us.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>19</strong></em> “Do you remember the children in this picture?” Anne asked.</p>
        <p><em><strong>20</strong></em> “Some of them,” answered Grandpa. “But I remember all of those cold Canadian winters! After we do the dishes, I’ll tell you all about them.”</p>

          <strong>A School on Rails</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> Anne and Jim were visiting Grandpa. They liked the time after supper when they usually sat and talked. Grandpa often told them stories about the “old days,” when he was a boy. Sometimes his stories were funny. Other times they were sad. Most of his stories were about how things used to be.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> “Last week I found a picture of a school I went to when I was a boy. Let me show it to you.” Grandpa went to his desk and brought back an old, faded photograph.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> Jim looked at it and said, “But, Grandpa, this looks like a train!”</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> “It was my school for a while,” Grandpa said. “Would you like to hear about it?”</p>
        <p><strong><em>5</em></strong> “A school in a train?” asked Anne.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “I have to hear this!” exclaimed Jim.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> Grandpa looked at the picture silently for a moment. “When I was a boy, my father worked for the railroad in Canada,” he began. “His job was to take care of sections of railroad track in remote areas. The workers’ families lived along the tracks in small groups many miles from other towns or people. There was no school. Everyone knew this was a problem, but no one knew what to do about it.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “At last someone had an idea. A railroad car was turned into a schoolroom, and school was brought to us! It stopped at settlements where there were enough children to attend and stayed for several weeks. Then it moved on to the next settlement. There was a teacher on the train who taught the lessons.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> “Where did the teacher live?” asked Jim.</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> “The teacher lived in the railroad car! He had a small kitchen with a sink and stove and a living area with a dining room, bedroom, and bathroom. There was no electricity on the train. A small furnace burned coal to keep the school car warm.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> “It doesn’t look much like a school,” Anne said, looking at the picture again.</p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> “In many ways it was just an ordinary railroad car,” Grandpa said. “It had comfortable cushioned seats and wood-paneled walls lined with windows. However, they did modify some things. The seats were turned to face each other, and a table was put in between each pair. At the front of the car were chalkboards, maps, and a desk for the teacher. Rows of shelves held books and other supplies.</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="100%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766024040/c5rck0tfgfbag3vzxh9n.png" alt="ASS_Y3_EN_29">


        </p>
        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> “Our parents didn’t have to make us go to school. We were happy for the chance to go. Any child who was able to get to the school car was allowed to attend, so the school car served the children of loggers, farmers, and miners in the area, too. I had 10 classmates.</p>
        <p><em><strong>14</strong></em> “School lasted from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M., with about an hour for lunch and recess. We learned most of the same lessons as students in regular schools did. The school car stayed for about six weeks. Then it was pushed back onto the main track, hitched to an engine, and pulled to the next settlement. While the school car was away, we did homework. When it returned, we were ready to continue to learn in our school on rails.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>15</strong></em> “Does it still exist?” Anne asked.</p>
        <p><em><strong>16</strong></em> “No,” Grandpa answered. “After a while, things changed. School cars aren’t around any longer. More people moved into the area. New roads were built, and towns were established. Schoolhouses were erected, too. My family moved to a small town. Other families sent their children to school in nearby towns. The school car wasn’t needed anymore.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>17</strong></em> “Too bad,” Jim muttered.</p>
        <p><em><strong>18</strong></em> “Oh, it’s probably for the best,” Grandpa added. “There was too much work for one teacher, and the time between visits was too long. Sometimes the homework was difficult, and no one could help. Still, while it was around, the school car was a special place for many of us.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>19</strong></em> “Do you remember the children in this picture?” Anne asked.</p>
        <p><em><strong>20</strong></em> “Some of them,” answered Grandpa. “But I remember all of those cold Canadian winters! After we do the dishes, I’ll tell you all about them.”</p>
