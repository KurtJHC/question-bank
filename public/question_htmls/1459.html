Miscommunication happens often enough face to face. But it happens far more frequently over text messages.<br>
<br>
Alice was texting back and forth with her friend when suddenly she went silent after a simple question. In the middle of a meeting, John received a three-page text message from his wife. Sandy accidently sent a personal text message to the wrong person causing a series of awkward responses. All of these misunderstandings could be avoided by following a few simple guidelines.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Here are the top texting rules: Know your audience. Double check everything. Text alone. Texting is casual conversation only, not serious. Always respond, but don’t open a text message unless you intend to respond immediately. Know the difference between useful and non-useful texting. Remember that pictures are not secure and don’t presume that texting is confidential.<br>

In 2021, buying the best phone means looking for something that should last you a few years. Smartphones’ upgrade cycles are slowing down for a reason. Even at lower prices, it’s getting harder and harder to buy a lemon. In other words, you don’t have to spend a huge amount to get something great, as a bunch of great smartphones are available for around $800.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
It’s harder than ever to decide between everything in that range, but for most people, our pick for the best phone is the Apple iPhone 12. Luckily, if you’re looking for a nocompromise smartphone at any price, the choices over a thousand dollars are much clearer. If you like Android, the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra is incredibly good. And if you want to get the best smartphone on a budget, you can find something really good for under $500 or even under $400.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
By texting less and calling more, I was reminded that people are always nicer on the phone than on text. Face to face they are even nicer than that. Arguments are resolved more quickly. But talking on the phone scares people. Technology has created a new rigidity when it comes to conversation. Calling is usually planned and scheduled. I still text all the time. But I am calling more too. I am back in the habit, and for me, it is infinitely more satisfying to have a conversation that is two sided and flexible and unpredictable. No device will be ever able to replace personal conversation.&nbsp;<br>

Should a young child have a mobile? Most mobiles offer almost complete access to the internet and are much harder to filter and control than your home computer. A mobile also gives the outside world, including undesirables, another way to communicate with a child.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Mobiles also put your child at risk for getting in trouble if limits aren’t in place. Or a child might make prank calls or be blamed for them if a classmate takes their phone and uses it to make inappropriate calls.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Whether or not your child is ready for or needs a mobile is something you will have to decide for yourself. Make sure that your child can handle the responsibility for a mobile before you buy one. When getting your younger child, a mobile, consider putting some limits in place.&nbsp;<br>
