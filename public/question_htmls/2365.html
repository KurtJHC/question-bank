        <p><em>Read this article. Then answer questions 18 through 22.</em><br><br><strong>Why We Play</strong><br><br>
Why play games? Because they are fun, of course, and a lot more besides. Following the rules . . . planning your next move . . . acting as a team member . . . these are all “game” ideas that you will run into throughout your life.</p>
        <p>Think about some of the games you played as a young child, such as hopscotch and hide-and-go-seek. These games are more than a hundred years old, and children all over the world play some variation of them.</p>
        <p>The games of children’s cultures are entertaining and fun. But perhaps more importantly, they translate life into exciting dramas that teach children some of the basic rules they will be expected to follow the rest of their lives, such as taking turns and cooperating.</p>
        <p>Many children’s games have a practical side. Children around the world play games that prepare them for work they will do as grown-ups. For instance, some Saudi Arabian children live in the desert interior. They play a game called bones, which sharpens the hand-eye coordination needed in hunting.</p>
        <p>Many sports encourage national or local pride. The most famous games of all, the Olympic Games, bring athletes from around the world together to engage in friendly competition. Spectators wave flags, knowing that a gold medal is a win for an entire country, not just the athlete who earned it.</p>
        <p>One of the most poignant images of the games is watching a gold medal-winning athlete stand on the podium as his or her national anthem is played. For countries experiencing turmoil either in the form of natural disasters or war, an Olympic win can mean so much.</p>
        <p>Sports are also a unifying event. Soccer is the most popular sport in the world. People on all continents play the game—some for fun and some for a living. Nicolette Iribarne, a soccer player from California, has discovered a way to spread hope through soccer. Iribarne created Fútbol 4 Refugees after participating in an international soccer tournament. The mission of the group is to provide children living in refugee camps with soccer balls. Other groups such as Playing for Peace and Right to Play provide opportunities for children who otherwise might never play soccer or throw a Frisbee.</p>
        <p>The next time you play your favorite game or sport, think about why you enjoy it. What skills are needed to excel in your favorite game or sport? Do you think these skills will help you in other aspects of your life? But most importantly, the next time you play, have fun!</p>

        <p><em>Read this excerpt from Hello, America. Then answer questions 23 through 28.</em><br><br><strong>Mother Has a Job</strong><br><em>by Livia Bitton-Jackson</em><br><br>
[^cstable^]The book Hello, America chronicles the experiences of a young woman and her mother who have emigrated from Hungary to America in the early 1950s. In this passage, the two reveal the fun they have working together to adapt to their new life in America.[^/cstable^]<br>
<br>
In the morning Mother and I travel together to work. Rising at the crack of dawn, I love the adventure of tiptoeing around in the dark living room where we sleep, whispering to each other so as not to wake Aunt Celia and Uncle Martin in the bedroom, then leaving the house soundlessly and making our way to the subway station in semidarkness. By the time we reach Kings Highway, the rising day splatters an eerie light on the deserted avenue ordinarily swarming with human traffic, and on the shuttered storefronts and fruit stands now cozily wrapped in layers of canvas. There is a sense of mystery—a sense of power—in being here before the rest of the world awakens . . . as if witnessing the beginning of time.<br>
<br>
We love traveling together on the subway, Mother and I. It’s fun to observe our fellow subway riders, exchange jokes and asides<sup>1</sup> in Hungarian, play guessing games as to their identities, their ages, and their jobs and make bets as to where they’d be getting off.<br>
<br>
In a couple of weeks Mother becomes familiar with the train route, and she no longer allows me to accompany her.<br>
<br>
“But I’ll miss the fun of traveling together in the morning,” I protest.<br>
<br>
“So will I. But it comes at a sacrifice. In order to accompany me, you must rise an hour earlier, losing an hour’s sleep. You need that extra hour of sleep.” Mother is firm, and I have no choice but to comply and regretfully give up on our morning fun.<br>
<br>
“I hope you’ll have time to teach me English. Now that I have a job and travel alone on the subway, I’ll need to improve my vocabulary. I don’t want to depend on you every time I need to make a phone call in English, or want to take public transport.”<br>
<br>
“Okay, madam,” I agree in a happy, jocular tone. “How about today? Let’s have our first lesson this evening!”<br>
<br>
Every evening I grill Mother in vocabulary and grammar, and indeed in a couple of weeks she learns enough English to do marketing on her own and travel freely by subway.<br>

        <p><em>Read this excerpt from Hello, America. Then answer questions 23 through 28.</em><br><br><strong>Mother Has a Job</strong><br><em>by Livia Bitton-Jackson</em><br><br>
[^cstable^]The book Hello, America chronicles the experiences of a young woman and her mother who have emigrated from Hungary to America in the early 1950s. In this passage, the two reveal the fun they have working together to adapt to their new life in America.[^/cstable^]<br>
<br>
In the morning Mother and I travel together to work. Rising at the crack of dawn, I love the adventure of tiptoeing around in the dark living room where we sleep, whispering to each other so as not to wake Aunt Celia and Uncle Martin in the bedroom, then leaving the house soundlessly and making our way to the subway station in semidarkness. By the time we reach Kings Highway, the rising day splatters an eerie light on the deserted avenue ordinarily swarming with human traffic, and on the shuttered storefronts and fruit stands now cozily wrapped in layers of canvas. There is a sense of mystery—a sense of power—in being here before the rest of the world awakens . . . as if witnessing the beginning of time.<br>
<br>
We love traveling together on the subway, Mother and I. It’s fun to observe our fellow subway riders, exchange jokes and asides<sup>1</sup> in Hungarian, play guessing games as to their identities, their ages, and their jobs and make bets as to where they’d be getting off.<br>
<br>
In a couple of weeks Mother becomes familiar with the train route, and she no longer allows me to accompany her.<br>
<br>
“But I’ll miss the fun of traveling together in the morning,” I protest.<br>
<br>
“So will I. But it comes at a sacrifice. In order to accompany me, you must rise an hour earlier, losing an hour’s sleep. You need that extra hour of sleep.” Mother is firm, and I have no choice but to comply and regretfully give up on our morning fun.<br>
<br>
“I hope you’ll have time to teach me English. Now that I have a job and travel alone on the subway, I’ll need to improve my vocabulary. I don’t want to depend on you every time I need to make a phone call in English, or want to take public transport.”<br>
<br>
“Okay, madam,” I agree in a happy, jocular tone. “How about today? Let’s have our first lesson this evening!”<br>
<br>
Every evening I grill Mother in vocabulary and grammar, and indeed in a couple of weeks she learns enough English to do marketing on her own and travel freely by subway.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who, in the fear of God, didst bear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sword of power, a nation’s trust!<br>
5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In sorrow by thy bier we stand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amid the awe that hushes all,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And speak the anguish of a land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That shook with horror at thy fall.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy task is done; the bound are free;<br>
10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We bear thee to an honored grave,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose proudest monument shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The broken fetters of the slave.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pure was thy life; its bloody close<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath placed thee with the sons of light,<br>
15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the noble host of those<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who perished in the cause of Right.</p>

        <p><em>Read this article. Then answer questions 1 through 5.</em><br><br><strong>Frozen Bubbles</strong><br><em>by Verlie Hutchens</em><br><br>
What would happen if you tried to blow a soap bubble in below-freezing weather?Would it freeze solid and fall to the ground? Would you have to hit it with a hammer to break it? These questions occurred to me onecold winter day. It was too cold to play in the snow, but it was a perfect time to experiment with blowing frozen bubbles.</p>
        <p>To blow frozen bubbles, I had to wait until the air outside was very cold. (For this activity, that meant 10 degrees below 0 Fahrenheit or colder.) I didn’t have the bubble stuff that comes in a jar, so I used dishwashing soap. Adding a drop of glycerin made the soap work even better. (I found glycerin at a pharmacy.) Ichose a place out of the wind, and blew bubbles the same way I always do. I watched to see what would happen. Here’s what I learned.</p>
        <p>If the temperature is low enough, the skin of the bubble frosts over, becoming cloudy instead of clear. And what about those rainbow swirls you see in soap bubbles?

        <p><em>Read this article. Then answer questions 1 through 5.</em><br><br><strong>Frozen Bubbles</strong><br><em>by Verlie Hutchens</em><br><br>
What would happen if you tried to blow a soap bubble in below-freezing weather?Would it freeze solid and fall to the ground? Would you have to hit it with a hammer to break it? These questions occurred to me onecold winter day. It was too cold to play in the snow, but it was a perfect time to experiment with blowing frozen bubbles.</p>
        <p>To blow frozen bubbles, I had to wait until the air outside was very cold. (For this activity, that meant 10 degrees below 0 Fahrenheit or colder.) I didn’t have the bubble stuff that comes in a jar, so I used dishwashing soap. Adding a drop of glycerin made the soap work even better. (I found glycerin at a pharmacy.) Ichose a place out of the wind, and blew bubbles the same way I always do. I watched to see what would happen. Here’s what I learned.</p>
        <p>If the temperature is low enough, the skin of the bubble frosts over, becoming cloudy instead of clear. And what about those rainbow swirls you see in soap bubbles? The rainbow colors stay even when the bubbles frost, but they don’t swirl anymore. The bubbles still float in the air. They don’t fall to the ground any faster than they would on a warm summer day.</p>
        <p>When these frozen bubbles break, they don’t turn into droplets as summer bubbles do. They turn into sparkling rainbow confetti and flutter to the ground. Sometimes a frozen bubble will roll across the snow without breaking. If it breaks, it may leave a leathery bubble skin on the ground. If nothing disturbs the bubble, it may stay there for a long time.</p>
        <p>Sometimes I could catch a bubble and hold it until the heat of my hand made it pop.</p>
        <p>I learned one other thing about blowing frozen bubbles. It’s so much fun, I want to try it again next year!</p>
