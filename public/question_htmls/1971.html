If you’re anything like me patience is something that doesn’t come easily: whether it be having to stand in endless queues; trying to get hold of someone only to be put on hold having gone through endless options; waiting for your concoctions to cook properly when you’re ‘starving’ (just recently I was so impatient for some pasta to cook that I ended up serving it semi-raw; which would have been delicious had I waited for a whole two more minutes).&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The list is endless… Of course, we are all becoming conditioned to live in the fast lane, with the comparative luxury of things happening quickly and immediately. The monumental technological advances of the last 10 years alone enable us to communicate, book, organise, shop, email, bank, socially connect, and show the world the evidence of all our endeavours at the speed of lightning!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
What is more serious is, having established a major goal in life, to subsequently have to undergo a never-ending WAITING GAME for it to happen – during which time it seems there is no choice but to endure delay after an obstacle or new challenge. But in the majority of situations impatience achieves nothing, apart from making us feel irritated, annoyed, jumpy, unfocused… and certainly does absolutely nothing to hurry things up!<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Once there were two companies who were competitors to each other in selling toothpaste and toothbrushes. After few years, they realised the need for toothbrushes for kids. Both the companies were aware that the first company to come out with the product would have the higher chance of dominating the market.<br>
<br>
The first company, instead of doing any research, took the logical approach. Adults have bigger hands and need long and thick toothbrushes, but kids have smaller hands and need smaller, thinner toothbrushes. Without a second thought, they designed and produced a kid’s toothbrush in a few weeks and launched it in the market.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The second company, however, did extensive research. They went to hundreds of kids and observed the way they held the toothbrush and brushed their teeth. The info they received also included feedback on what kids wanted. The second company decided they needed a toothbrush similar to adults in terms of size but with some grooves, because kids, instead of holding the toothbrush in their fingers like adults, clung to the toothbrush.<br>
<br>
So instead of making a small toothbrush like the first company, they went with a bigger toothbrush which helps the child to brush effectively. In addition, they also added more colours and cartoon characters to the toothbrush to make it attractive to the kids. Soon they launched the toothbrush on the market and sold a record number of toothbrushes, and they started to dominate the market.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
So, how do you learn to be more patient? When establishing a new goal in life, decide whether or not you’re in it for the long-term. Be realistic and prepare yourself for possible delays in the process. Accept that at times you may have to take a few steps back to find a new path, so to speak. Try as much as possible to live in and enjoy the present moment rather than worrying about what needs to happen in the future.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
If you’re struggling with a new task or skill, leave it and come back to it a bit later on, with fresh eyes. Be tolerant, not just with others but with yourself. The person who suffers most from your own impatience is you!&nbsp;<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Robert the Bruce was crowned King of Scotland in 1306 and eventually led Scotland to victory in the First War of Scottish Independence against the English. The king was the one who won Scotland’s independence — it’s no wonder he lives on in legend as a national hero.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But things weren’t always so sunny for King Robert at first, and that’s where the spider comes into the story. After the English had repeatedly defeated his armies, Robert was forced into hiding. Legend has it that when Robert’s spirits were broken, he took refuge in a cave.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Sitting in the cave, he noticed a small spider attempting to weave a web. The spider tried and failed over and over. Each time the spider fell, it climbed back up to try again. Finally, the spider’s silk took hold, and the spider managed to spin a web.<br>
<br>
Robert the Bruce saw himself reflected in the spider’s struggle. After watching the spider finally succeed, Robert found the inspiration to return and fight the English, believing patience and determination would win in the end.<br>
<br>
He was finally victorious against the King of England in the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. This triumph ultimately turned the tides towards later winning the independence of Scotland in 1328.<br>

Once there were two companies who were competitors to each other in selling toothpaste and toothbrushes. After few years, they realised the need for toothbrushes for kids. Both the companies were aware that the first company to come out with the product would have the higher chance of dominating the market.<br>
<br>
The first company, instead of doing any research, took the logical approach. Adults have bigger hands and need long and thick toothbrushes, but kids have smaller hands and need smaller, thinner toothbrushes. Without a second thought, they designed and produced a kid’s toothbrush in a few weeks and launched it in the market.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The second company, however, did extensive research. They went to hundreds of kids and observed the way they held the toothbrush and brushed their teeth. The info they received also included feedback on what kids wanted. The second company decided they needed a toothbrush similar to adults in terms of size but with some grooves, because kids, instead of holding the toothbrush in their fingers like adults, clung to the toothbrush.<br>
<br>
So instead of making a small toothbrush like the first company, they went with a bigger toothbrush which helps the child to brush effectively. In addition, they also added more colours and cartoon characters to the toothbrush to make it attractive to the kids. Soon they launched the toothbrush on the market and sold a record number of toothbrushes, and they started to dominate the market.&nbsp;<br>

So, how do you learn to be more patient? When establishing a new goal in life, decide whether or not you’re in it for the long-term. Be realistic and prepare yourself for possible delays in the process. Accept that at times you may have to take a few steps back to find a new path, so to speak. Try as much as possible to live in and enjoy the present moment rather than worrying about what needs to happen in the future.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
If you’re struggling with a new task or skill, leave it and come back to it a bit later on, with fresh eyes. Be tolerant, not just with others but with yourself. The person who suffers most from your own impatience is you!&nbsp;<br>

Robert the Bruce was crowned King of Scotland in 1306 and eventually led Scotland to victory in the First War of Scottish Independence against the English. The king was the one who won Scotland’s independence — it’s no wonder he lives on in legend as a national hero.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But things weren’t always so sunny for King Robert at first, and that’s where the spider comes into the story. After the English had repeatedly defeated his armies, Robert was forced into hiding. Legend has it that when Robert’s spirits were broken, he took refuge in a cave.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Sitting in the cave, he noticed a small spider attempting to weave a web. The spider tried and failed over and over. Each time the spider fell, it climbed back up to try again. Finally, the spider’s silk took hold, and the spider managed to spin a web.<br>
<br>
Robert the Bruce saw himself reflected in the spider’s struggle. After watching the spider finally succeed, Robert found the inspiration to return and fight the English, believing patience and determination would win in the end.<br>
<br>
He was finally victorious against the King of England in the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. This triumph ultimately turned the tides towards later winning the independence of Scotland in 1328.<br>

If you’re anything like me patience is something that doesn’t come easily: whether it be having to stand in endless queues; trying to get hold of someone only to be put on hold having gone through endless options; waiting for your concoctions to cook properly when you’re ‘starving’ (just recently I was so impatient for some pasta to cook that I ended up serving it semi-raw; which would have been delicious had I waited for a whole two more minutes).&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The list is endless… Of course, we are all becoming conditioned to live in the fast lane, with the comparative luxury of things happening quickly and immediately. The monumental technological advances of the last 10 years alone enable us to communicate, book, organise, shop, email, bank, socially connect, and show the world the evidence of all our endeavours at the speed of lightning!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
What is more serious is, having established a major goal in life, to subsequently have to undergo a never-ending WAITING GAME for it to happen – during which time it seems there is no choice but to endure delay after an obstacle or new challenge. But in the majority of situations impatience achieves nothing, apart from making us feel irritated, annoyed, jumpy, unfocused… and certainly does absolutely nothing to hurry things up!<br>

Try as much as possible to live in and enjoy the present moment rather than worrying about what needs to happen in the future.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
If you’re struggling with a new task or skill, leave it and come back to it a bit later on, with fresh eyes. Be tolerant, not just with others but with yourself. The person who suffers most from your own impatience is you!&nbsp;<br>

Robert the Bruce was crowned King of Scotland in 1306 and eventually led Scotland to victory in the First War of Scottish Independence against the English. The king was the one who won Scotland’s independence — it’s no wonder he lives on in legend as a national hero.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But things weren’t always so sunny for King Robert at first, and that’s where the spider comes into the story. After the English had repeatedly defeated his armies, Robert was forced into hiding. Legend has it that when Robert’s spirits were broken, he took refuge in a cave.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Sitting in the cave, he noticed a small spider attempting to weave a web. The spider tried and failed over and over. Each time the spider fell, it climbed back up to try again. Finally, the spider’s silk took hold, and the spider managed to spin a web.<br>
<br>
Robert the Bruce saw himself reflected in the spider’s struggle. After watching the spider finally succeed, Robert found the inspiration to return and fight the English, believing patience and determination would win in the end.<br>
<br>
He was finally victorious against the King of England in the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. This triumph ultimately turned the tides towards later winning the independence of Scotland in 1328.<br>

If you’re anything like me patience is something that doesn’t come easily: whether it be having to stand in endless queues; trying to get hold of someone only to be put on hold having gone through endless options; waiting for your concoctions to cook properly when you’re ‘starving’ (just recently I was so impatient for some pasta to cook that I ended up serving it semi-raw; which would have been delicious had I waited for a whole two more minutes).&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The list is endless… Of course, we are all becoming conditioned to live in the fast lane, with the comparative luxury of things happening quickly and immediately. The monumental technological advances of the last 10 years alone enable us to communicate, book, organise, shop, email, bank, socially connect, and show the world the evidence of all our endeavours at the speed of lightning!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
What is more serious is, having established a major goal in life, to subsequently have to undergo a never-ending WAITING GAME for it to happen – during which time it seems there is no choice but to endure delay after an obstacle or new challenge. But in the majority of situations impatience achieves nothing, apart from making us feel irritated, annoyed, jumpy, unfocused… and certainly does absolutely nothing to hurry things up!<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Once there were two companies who were competitors to each other in selling toothpaste and toothbrushes. After few years, they realised the need for toothbrushes for kids. Both the companies were aware that the first company to come out with the product would have the higher chance of dominating the market.<br>
<br>
The first company, instead of doing any research, took the logical approach. Adults have bigger hands and need long and thick toothbrushes, but kids have smaller hands and need smaller, thinner toothbrushes. Without a second thought, they designed and produced a kid’s toothbrush in a few weeks and launched it in the market.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The second company, however, did extensive research. They went to hundreds of kids and observed the way they held the toothbrush and brushed their teeth. The info they received also included feedback on what kids wanted. The second company decided they needed a toothbrush similar to adults in terms of size but with some grooves, because kids, instead of holding the toothbrush in their fingers like adults, clung to the toothbrush.<br>
<br>
So instead of making a small toothbrush like the first company, they went with a bigger toothbrush which helps the child to brush effectively. In addition, they also added more colours and cartoon characters to the toothbrush to make it attractive to the kids. Soon they launched the toothbrush on the market and sold a record number of toothbrushes, and they started to dominate the market.&nbsp;<br>

The Earth is divided into four main layers. The dense, hot inner core (yellow), the molten outer core (orange), the mantle (red), and the thin crust (brown), which supports all life in the known universe.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The hard, brittle crust extends from Earth's surface to the so-called Mohorovicic discontinuity, nicknamed the Moho. The Moho is not located at a uniform depth, but about 10 kilometers below the seafloor and about 35 kilometers beneath the surface of continents.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Beneath the Moho is the mantle, the viscous layer that makes up more than half of Earth's volume. The mantle is divided from the core by the Gutenberg discontinuity, about 2,880 kilometers beneath Earth's surface. The outer core is molten and liquid iron and nickel, while the inner core is solid and much more dense than either iron or nickel at the surface.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
What does it take for an alien planet to host life as we know it on Earth? A lot, as it turns out. Despite a paper last year claiming that there may be 300 million planets in our galaxy that are “potentially habitable,” new research published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society confounds that view.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Suggesting that Earth-like conditions on potentially habitable planets may be much rarer than previously thought, this new analysis of known exoplanets focuses on photosynthesis. 4,422 exoplanets have been discovered thus far by astronomers, but only a handful are considered to be potentially habitable.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Photosynthesis is how plants use sunlight, water and carbon dioxide to create oxygen and energy. Given that photosynthesis has been critical in enabling complex biospheres of the type found on Earth, for an exoplanet to be potentially habitable therefore means it would develop an oxygen-based atmosphere. Photosynthesis requires liquid water. Only exoplanets that are the right temperature — not too hot, not too cold — could host such a thing on their surface. So how many rocky, Earth-sized exoplanets are in this so-called “Goldilock’s Zone?” Not many, suggests this research. The study reveals only one planet that comes close to receiving enough sunshine to sustain a large biosphere that could be detected — Kepler−442b<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
When did humans first walk the surface of Planet Earth? The oldest Homo sapiens fossils that anthropologists have found thus far date to around 315,000 years ago. That means we can say that modern humans are at least that old.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But our lineage likely extends further back in time — we just don’t have the fossils to prove it. DNA evidence drawn from comparisons of different human genomes, as well as those of close cousins like Neanderthals and Denisovans, put the split between the three groups at least 400,000 years ago. So, it’s possible that Homo sapiens are over half a million years old.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
How serious will the Earth’s over-population problem be in the future? For the first time in modern history, the world’s population is expected to virtually stop growing by the end of this century, due in large part to falling global fertility rates, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of new data from the United Nations.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
By 2100, the world’s population is projected to reach approximately 10.9 billion, with annual growth of less than 0.1% – a steep decline from the current rate. Between 1950 and today, the world’s population grew between 1% and 2% each year, with the number of people rising from 2.5 billion to more than 7.7 billion.<br>

The Earth is divided into four main layers. The dense, hot inner core (yellow), the molten outer core (orange), the mantle (red), and the thin crust (brown), which supports all life in the known universe.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The hard, brittle crust extends from Earth's surface to the so-called Mohorovicic discontinuity, nicknamed the Moho. The Moho is not located at a uniform depth, but about 10 kilometers below the seafloor and about 35 kilometers beneath the surface of continents.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Beneath the Moho is the mantle, the viscous layer that makes up more than half of Earth's volume. The mantle is divided from the core by the Gutenberg discontinuity, about 2,880 kilometers beneath Earth's surface. The outer core is molten and liquid iron and nickel, while the inner core is solid and much more dense than either iron or nickel at the surface.<br>

What does it take for an alien planet to host life as we know it on Earth? A lot, as it turns out. Despite a paper last year claiming that there may be 300 million planets in our galaxy that are “potentially habitable,” new research published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society confounds that view.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Suggesting that Earth-like conditions on potentially habitable planets may be much rarer than previously thought, this new analysis of known exoplanets focuses on photosynthesis. 4,422 exoplanets have been discovered thus far by astronomers, but only a handful are considered to be potentially habitable.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Photosynthesis is how plants use sunlight, water and carbon dioxide to create oxygen and energy. Given that photosynthesis has been critical in enabling complex biospheres of the type found on Earth, for an exoplanet to be potentially habitable therefore means it would develop an oxygen-based atmosphere. Photosynthesis requires liquid water. Only exoplanets that are the right temperature — not too hot, not too cold — could host such a thing on their surface. So how many rocky, Earth-sized exoplanets are in this so-called “Goldilock’s Zone?” Not many, suggests this research. The study reveals only one planet that comes close to receiving enough sunshine to sustain a large biosphere that could be detected — Kepler−442b<br>

When did humans first walk the surface of Planet Earth? The oldest Homo sapiens fossils that anthropologists have found thus far date to around 315,000 years ago. That means we can say that modern humans are at least that old.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But our lineage likely extends further back in time — we just don’t have the fossils to prove it. DNA evidence drawn from comparisons of different human genomes, as well as those of close cousins like Neanderthals and Denisovans, put the split between the three groups at least 400,000 years ago. So, it’s possible that Homo sapiens are over half a million years old.<br>

How serious will the Earth’s over-population problem be in the future? For the first time in modern history, the world’s population is expected to virtually stop growing by the end of this century, due in large part to falling global fertility rates, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of new data from the United Nations.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
​By 2100, the world’s population is projected to reach approximately 10.9 billion, with annual growth of less than 0.1% – a steep decline from the current rate. Between 1950 and today, the world’s population grew between 1% and 2% each year, with the number of people rising from 2.5 billion to more than 7.7 billion.<br>

The Earth is divided into four main layers. The dense, hot inner core (yellow), the molten outer core (orange), the mantle (red), and the thin crust (brown), which supports all life in the known universe.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The hard, brittle crust extends from Earth's surface to the so-called Mohorovicic discontinuity, nicknamed the Moho. The Moho is not located at a uniform depth, but about 10 kilometers below the seafloor and about 35 kilometers beneath the surface of continents.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Beneath the Moho is the mantle, the viscous layer that makes up more than half of Earth's volume. The mantle is divided from the core by the Gutenberg discontinuity, about 2,880 kilometers beneath Earth's surface. The outer core is molten and liquid iron and nickel, while the inner core is solid and much more dense than either iron or nickel at the surface.<br>

What does it take for an alien planet to host life as we know it on Earth? A lot, as it turns out. Despite a paper last year claiming that there may be 300 million planets in our galaxy that are “potentially habitable,” new research published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society confounds that view.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Suggesting that Earth-like conditions on potentially habitable planets may be much rarer than previously thought, this new analysis of known exoplanets focuses on photosynthesis. 4,422 exoplanets have been discovered thus far by astronomers, but only a handful are considered to be potentially habitable.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Photosynthesis is how plants use sunlight, water and carbon dioxide to create oxygen and energy. Given that photosynthesis has been critical in enabling complex biospheres of the type found on Earth, for an exoplanet to be potentially habitable therefore means it would develop an oxygen-based atmosphere. Photosynthesis requires liquid water. Only exoplanets that are the right temperature — not too hot, not too cold — could host such a thing on their surface. So how many rocky, Earth-sized exoplanets are in this so-called “Goldilock’s Zone?” Not many, suggests this research. The study reveals only one planet that comes close to receiving enough sunshine to sustain a large biosphere that could be detected — Kepler−442b<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
When did humans first walk the surface of Planet Earth? The oldest Homo sapiens fossils that anthropologists have found thus far date to around 315,000 years ago. That means we can say that modern humans are at least that old.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But our lineage likely extends further back in time — we just don’t have the fossils to prove it. DNA evidence drawn from comparisons of different human genomes, as well as those of close cousins like Neanderthals and Denisovans, put the split between the three groups at least 400,000 years ago. So, it’s possible that Homo sapiens are over half a million years old.<br>

How serious will the Earth’s over-population problem be in the future? For the first time in modern history, the world’s population is expected to virtually stop growing by the end of this century, due in large part to falling global fertility rates, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of new data from the United Nations.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
​By 2100, the world’s population is projected to reach approximately 10.9 billion, with annual growth of less than 0.1% – a steep decline from the current rate. Between 1950 and today, the world’s population grew between 1% and 2% each year, with the number of people rising from 2.5 billion to more than 7.7 billion.<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
How serious will the Earth’s over-population problem be in the future? For the first time in modern history, the world’s population is expected to virtually stop growing by the end of this century, due in large part to falling global fertility rates, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of new data from the United Nations.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
​By 2100, the world’s population is projected to reach approximately 10.9 billion, with annual growth of less than 0.1% – a steep decline from the current rate. Between 1950 and today, the world’s population grew between 1% and 2% each year, with the number of people rising from 2.5 billion to more than 7.7 billion.<br>

  Based off her findings, Sammi made the following statements:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; I.&nbsp; The most common food group present in the depths studied were invertebrates.<br>
&nbsp; II.&nbsp; Mollusks always decreased in concentration with increasing water depth.<br>
&nbsp; III.&nbsp; The amount of algae at 3 000 m below sea level is 60% less the amount of invertebrates at that depth.<br>
