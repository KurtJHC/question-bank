If you love the Outback, in the heart of Australia lies Alice Springs, a surprising town brimming with arts, culture and history. Surrounded by hauntingly beautiful mountain ranges is a city surprisingly full of arts, events and culture despite its remoteness. Known simply as "Alice", it's the beating heart of Australia's Red Centre. Alice is a fascinating spot to explore Australia's Aboriginal culture and unique wildlife. Alice Springs is also a great base for exploring Uluru, Kata Tjuta, Kings Canyon, the West MacDonnell Ranges. But start your day in the town’s pedestrian-only main street, Todd Mall, and grab breakfast at one of the bustling cafés. The trendy Cafe Uccello offers homemade cannoli and nutritious breakfast bowls in a pink setting. Then, stroll through the historic Olive Pink Botanic Gardens and admire the native flora before grabbing a bite at the onsite eatery, Bean Tree Café. Complete your culinary adventure with a three-course barbecue dinner at Earth Sanctuary and gain insight into ecology, culture and astronomy, as offered by your hosts.<br>

<p>They say that "Home is where the heart is." For a lot of people who move to other cities to pursue studies, run businesses or move ahead in careers, their hearts are still firmly placed in their original home towns or villages. Your home towns will always have a special place in your heart, with countless happy memories of your youth; places where you played cricket, the little shop at the corner, visits from the cousins etc. It’s the one place where you don’t need to put in an effort to fit in. You just know that you belong! The way of life, the dialect and the humdrum of everyday life puts you at ease and gives you peace of mind. You know all the shortcuts, long-cuts, hang outs and routes. The street food you get there is out of the world. And you know what the best thing about this place is? The local people; silly or cool, crazy or kind, they're your people! Life would be incomplete without the get-togethers with childhood friends and those delightful family gatherings. It’s a thriving community, composed of all those nosy, yet endearing neighbours and uncles and aunties of your neighbourhood. And from this motley group of people, you learn a lot of valuable lessons.<br>

We've all heard of holidays from hell. But what about going on a holiday&nbsp;to&nbsp;The Hell, a town tucked away in the Swartberg mountains in South Africa? Its other name is&nbsp;Gamkaskloof. This secret and secluded place is a hidden gem often by-passed by travellers who are put off either by its name, or by the rather treacherous but beautiful, one-and-only road that would take them there. This road was built almost single handedly by Koos Van Zyl and his bulldozer in 1963. Prior to this, the&nbsp;small community of settlers&nbsp;who lived there were isolated from the outside world. Legend has it that, only two years after World War One had finished, did the people in The Hell find out there had been a world war. But once the road opened many left for the comparable bright lights of neighbouring towns. The natural beauty of The Hell, located in a&nbsp;magnificent kloof, walled in by majestic mountains (combined with fascinating history as recounted by the locals, should you stop for a chat) makes The Hell a special place worth visiting for those who enjoy leaving the beaten track. So, how did The Hell get its nickname?&nbsp;Certainly not from its own inhabitants! The general explanation is from British tax collectors and/or stock inspectors who had to endure the arduous voyage there and back in the line of duty. And I am sure, back then with no road it really did feel like a hellish trip! Or maybe it was from the soldiers who used to suffer an across-the-mountains endurance trip to The Hell and back.<br>

The Australian town of Coober Pedy looks like something straight out of a movie—probably because it is. In 1985, Mel Gibson, Tina Turner and a team of filmmakers descended onto this barren mining town in the South Australian Outback to shoot ‘Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome’. The otherworldly landscape, which is checkered with ruddy-coloured mounds of sandstone was the perfect backdrop for the post-apocalyptic movie. It has also forced the town’s residents underground—literally. The main attractions of the city include the dugouts, houses, churches, and 4-star hotels built underground. Nothing about Coober Pedy is for the faint of heart. For starters, it’s hot—really hot. In the summer, temperatures creep up to 45°C. Before the city passed a tree-planting initiative encouraging residents to plant seeds around town, its tallest tree was a sculpture built from scraps of metal. Even grass is considered a commodity in Coober Pedy. The thin veil of red dust that settles on roadways, cars and buildings is a reminder of Coober Pedy’s strange charm. There really is no other place like it on—or below—Earth.</p>

It’s a thriving community, composed of all those nosy, yet endearing neighbours and uncles and aunties of your neighbourhood. And from this motley group of people, you learn a lot of valuable lessons.<br>

We've all heard of holidays from hell. But what about going on a holiday&nbsp;to&nbsp;The Hell, a town tucked away in the Swartberg mountains in South Africa? Its other name is&nbsp;Gamkaskloof. This secret and secluded place is a hidden gem often by-passed by travellers who are put off either by its name, or by the rather treacherous but beautiful, one-and-only road that would take them there. This road was built almost single handedly by Koos Van Zyl and his bulldozer in 1963. Prior to this, the&nbsp;small community of settlers&nbsp;who lived there were isolated from the outside world. Legend has it that, only two years after World War One had finished, did the people in The Hell find out there had been a world war. But once the road opened many left for the comparable bright lights of neighbouring towns. The natural beauty of The Hell, located in a&nbsp;magnificent kloof, walled in by majestic mountains (combined with fascinating history as recounted by the locals, should you stop for a chat) makes The Hell a special place worth visiting for those who enjoy leaving the beaten track. So, how did The Hell get its nickname?&nbsp;Certainly not from its own inhabitants! The general explanation is from British tax collectors and/or stock inspectors who had to endure the arduous voyage there and back in the line of duty. And I am sure, back then with no road it really did feel like a hellish trip! Or maybe it was from the soldiers who used to suffer an across-the-mountains endurance trip to The Hell and back.<br>

The Australian town of Coober Pedy looks like something straight out of a movie—probably because it is. In 1985, Mel Gibson, Tina Turner and a team of filmmakers descended onto this barren mining town in the South Australian Outback to shoot ‘Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome’. The otherworldly landscape, which is checkered with ruddy-coloured mounds of sandstone was the perfect backdrop for the post-apocalyptic movie. It has also forced the town’s residents underground—literally. The main attractions of the city include the dugouts, houses, churches, and 4-star hotels built underground. Nothing about Coober Pedy is for the faint of heart. For starters, it’s hot—really hot. In the summer, temperatures creep up to 45°C. Before the city passed a tree-planting initiative encouraging residents to plant seeds around town, its tallest tree was a sculpture built from scraps of metal. Even grass is considered a commodity in Coober Pedy. The thin veil of red dust that settles on roadways, cars and buildings is a reminder of Coober Pedy’s strange charm. There really is no other place like it on—or below—Earth.</p>

If you love the Outback, in the heart of Australia lies Alice Springs, a surprising town brimming with arts, culture and history. Surrounded by hauntingly beautiful mountain ranges is a city surprisingly full of arts, events and culture despite its remoteness. Known simply as "Alice", it's the beating heart of Australia's Red Centre. Alice is a fascinating spot to explore Australia's Aboriginal culture and unique wildlife. Alice Springs is also a great base for exploring Uluru, Kata Tjuta, Kings Canyon, the West MacDonnell Ranges. But start your day in the town’s pedestrian-only main street, Todd Mall, and grab breakfast at one of the bustling cafés. The trendy Cafe Uccello offers homemade cannoli and nutritious breakfast bowls in a pink setting. Then, stroll through the historic Olive Pink Botanic Gardens and admire the native flora before grabbing a bite at the onsite eatery, Bean Tree Café. Complete your culinary adventure with a three-course barbecue dinner at Earth Sanctuary and gain insight into ecology, culture and astronomy, as offered by your hosts.<br>

<p>They say that "Home is where the heart is." For a lot of people who move to other cities to pursue studies, run businesses or move ahead in careers, their hearts are still firmly placed in their original home towns or villages. Your home towns will always have a special place in your heart, with countless happy memories of your youth; places where you played cricket, the little shop at the corner, visits from the cousins etc. It’s the one place where you don’t need to put in an effort to fit in. You just know that you belong! The way of life, the dialect and the humdrum of everyday life puts you at ease and gives you peace of mind. You know all the shortcuts, long-cuts, hang outs and routes. The street food you get there is out of the world. And you know what the best thing about this place is? The local people; silly or cool, crazy or kind, they're your people!
