        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Chester poked his head into his older sister’s room.</em></p>
        <p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>“Hi, Denise,” he said.</em></p>
        <p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>“Chester, get out!” Denise screamed. “I told you never to come into my room again. What part of your pea-sized brain finds that hard to understand?”</em></p>
        <p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>“Gee,” Chester sighed. “What’s your problem?”</em></p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What sane person would scream at her brother just for saying “hello”? Every time Denise gets a minute to herself, Chester shows up. Even though she’s told him to leave her alone, he listens to her phone conversations and tells her secrets at the dinner table. To Denise, Chester’s more of a bother than a brother.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What you get in a sibling (brother or sister) is pretty much the luck of the draw. You have no control over who your brothers and sisters are; you’re simply stuck with what you’ve got. You may be one of the lucky ones who has “sibs” who are your best friends. Then again, you may not be so lucky.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are relationships with siblings such a big deal? Because you live with these people day in and day out. Learning to get along with them can help you learn about yourself. You also learn how to get along in the other relationships you’ll have in life. Here are some common roles siblings play. Chances are you’ll recognize your sibs in these descriptions.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Roles Siblings Play</strong>
        </p>
        <p>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• <strong>Pests</strong>—Chester illustrates this role perfectly. What Denise can’t see because of her anger is that Chester really admires his older sister. He’s always around because the dull, everyday details of her life are interesting to him. He likes being near her.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• <strong>Protectors</strong>—It’s common for sibs to protect each other. If Denise saw some kids calling Chester names, you can bet she’d forget what a pest he is and run to his rescue. This is normal, says Celia Anita Decker, author of <em>Children: The Early Years</em>. She says that sibs protect each other most often in four situations. They do it when “there is an age gap of three or more years, when siblings come from large families, when children are unsupervised outside, and when peers attack a younger sibling in a physical or verbal way.” Have you ever noticed that, while it seems OK for you to call your brother or sister a name, you sure don’t want anyone else doing it?</p>
        <p>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• <strong>Rivals</strong>—Some siblings compete with each other for Mom’s or Dad’s attention and praise, often without even knowing it. Helen Gum Westlake and Donald G. Westlake, authors of <em>Relationships and Family Living</em>, explain that rivalry is greatest when the children are between 18 and 36 months apart in age. If you start to feel jealous of a sibling who gets better grades than you or is a better athlete, that’s because rivalry and envy feed off each other. One leads to the other. But there is good news. “Children normally lose their obvious symptoms of jealousy as they grow older and become absorbed in interests outside their family,” write the Westlakes.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• <strong>Fighters</strong>—Sibs don’t have to be rivals to fight. Some sibs fight intensely about everything—from sharing space to borrowing clothes or using the bathroom. If your home is a battleground, your entire family would appreciate it if you and your sib could declare a truce. Setting up fair rules and respecting each other’s needs can help end wars on the home front.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• <strong>Friends</strong>—Sibling friendships make the fighting, rivalry, and annoyances worthwhile. Even siblings who claim to despise each other can grow to be best friends. Sibs are natural playmates, and each time you set goals (for work or fun) and make them happen, you build family ties. No other friends know you better or care more for your welfare.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>How to Win the Sibling Game</strong>
        </p>
        <p>13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sibling can be friend, foe, or a little of both. If you play the game right, though, you’ll learn how to get along with your sibs before it’s time to move out of the house.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Rule 1: Respect your opponent.</strong>&nbsp;Earn points by showing your sibs a little respect. Remember, to earn it for yourself you must also give it. So, respect each other’s property, privacy, space, and needs. Be sure to talk to, instead of yell at, each other at least once each day.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Rule 2: Set the rules.</strong>&nbsp;Decide what bugs you, then set ground rules. If it’s privacy you crave, create a “Knock before entering” or “Keep out of my closet” rule. Once you set the rules, follow them and play fair. You may want to ask your parents to act as mediators and help you set up these rules.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Rule 3: Give a little, get a little.</strong>&nbsp;Do your sibs think your stuff is theirs simply because you share the same last name? You can protect your possessions by letting sibs use some of them—and declaring the important ones “off-limits.”</p>
        <p>17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Rule 4: Know what to hold on to.</strong> When something is important to you, find a way to save it. For example, how can you get the privacy you need? Maybe you can take an unused attic or basement and make it your own. Another idea: Talk to your sibs about dividing your room into “privacy zones.” Feeling satisfied about what matters most to you can make you more patient in other areas.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Rule 5: Know when to give in.</strong>&nbsp;Sometimes giving in to small arguments can help you settle the big ones more peacefully. If you and a sib are arguing over something small, give in and move on.</p>
        <p>19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Rule 6: When you win, don’t brag.</strong>&nbsp;Keep your attitude fair and friendly. This will show sibs you respect them and value your family ties.</p>
        <p>20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sibling relationships aren’t always easy. But, in the end, there is usually a big payoff. A bond between sibs can last a lifetime, often getting stronger as years go by. When you think about it, it’s the longest relationship you will ever have—from the very beginning of your life to the end. Wouldn’t it be nice to make it a great one?</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Chester poked his head into his older sister’s room.</em></p>
        <p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>“Hi, Denise,” he said.</em></p>
        <p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>“Chester, get out!” Denise screamed. “I told you never to come into my room again. What part of your pea-sized brain finds that hard to understand?”</em></p>
        <p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>“Gee,” Chester sighed. “What’s your problem?”</em></p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What sane person would scream at her brother just for saying “hello”? Every time Denise gets a minute to herself, Chester shows up. Even though she’s told him to leave her alone, he listens to her phone conversations and tells her secrets at the dinner table. To Denise, Chester’s more of a bother than a brother.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What you get in a sibling (brother or sister) is pretty much the luck of the draw. You have no control over who your brothers and sisters are; you’re simply stuck with what you’ve got. You may be one of the lucky ones who has “sibs” who are your best friends. Then again, you may not be so lucky.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are relationships with siblings such a big deal? Because you live with these people day in and day out. Learning to get along with them can help you learn about yourself. You also learn how to get along in the other relationships you’ll have in life. Here are some common roles siblings play. Chances are you’ll recognize your sibs in these descriptions.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Roles Siblings Play</strong>
        </p>
        <p>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• <strong>Pests</strong>—Chester illustrates this role perfectly. What Denise can’t see because of her anger is that Chester really admires his older sister. He’s always around because the dull, everyday details of her life are interesting to him. He likes being near her.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• <strong>Protectors</strong>—It’s common for sibs to protect each other. If Denise saw some kids calling Chester names, you can bet she’d forget what a pest he is and run to his rescue. This is normal, says Celia Anita Decker, author of <em>Children: The Early Years</em>. She says that sibs protect each other most often in four situations. They do it when “there is an age gap of three or more years, when siblings come from large families, when children are unsupervised outside, and when peers attack a younger sibling in a physical or verbal way.” Have you ever noticed that, while it seems OK for you to call your brother or sister a name, you sure don’t want anyone else doing it?</p>
        <p>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• <strong>Rivals</strong>—Some siblings compete with each other for Mom’s or Dad’s attention and praise, often without even knowing it. Helen Gum Westlake and Donald G. Westlake, authors of <em>Relationships and Family Living</em>, explain that rivalry is greatest when the children are between 18 and 36 months apart in age. If you start to feel jealous of a sibling who gets better grades than you or is a better athlete, that’s because rivalry and envy feed off each other. One leads to the other. But there is good news. “Children normally lose their obvious symptoms of jealousy as they grow older and become absorbed in interests outside their family,” write the Westlakes.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• <strong>Fighters</strong>—Sibs don’t have to be rivals to fight. Some sibs fight intensely about everything—from sharing space to borrowing clothes or using the bathroom. If your home is a battleground, your entire family would appreciate it if you and your sib could declare a truce. Setting up fair rules and respecting each other’s needs can help end wars on the home front.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• <strong>Friends</strong>—Sibling friendships make the fighting, rivalry, and annoyances worthwhile. Even siblings who claim to despise each other can grow to be best friends. Sibs are natural playmates, and each time you set goals (for work or fun) and make them happen, you build family ties. No other friends know you better or care more for your welfare.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>How to Win the Sibling Game</strong>
        </p>
        <p>13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sibling can be friend, foe, or a little of both. If you play the game right, though, you’ll learn how to get along with your sibs before it’s time to move out of the house.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Rule 1: Respect your opponent.</strong>&nbsp;Earn points by showing your sibs a little respect. Remember, to earn it for yourself you must also give it. So, respect each other’s property, privacy, space, and needs. Be sure to talk to, instead of yell at, each other at least once each day.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Rule 2: Set the rules.</strong>&nbsp;Decide what bugs you, then set ground rules. If it’s privacy you crave, create a “Knock before entering” or “Keep out of my closet” rule. Once you set the rules, follow them and play fair. You may want to ask your parents to act as mediators and help you set up these rules.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Rule 3: Give a little, get a little.</strong>&nbsp;Do your sibs think your stuff is theirs simply because you share the same last name? You can protect your possessions by letting sibs use some of them—and declaring the important ones “off-limits.”</p>
        <p>17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Rule 4: Know what to hold on to.</strong> When something is important to you, find a way to save it. For example, how can you get the privacy you need? Maybe you can take an unused attic or basement and make it your own. Another idea: Talk to your sibs about dividing your room into “privacy zones.” Feeling satisfied about what matters most to you can make you more patient in other areas.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Rule 5: Know when to give in.</strong>&nbsp;Sometimes giving in to small arguments can help you settle the big ones more peacefully. If you and a sib are arguing over something small, give in and move on.</p>
        <p>19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Rule 6: When you win, don’t brag.</strong>&nbsp;Keep your attitude fair and friendly. This will show sibs you respect them and value your family ties.</p>
        <p>20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sibling relationships aren’t always easy. But, in the end, there is usually a big payoff. A bond between sibs can last a lifetime, often getting stronger as years go by. When you think about it, it’s the longest relationship you will ever have—from the very beginning of your life to the end. Wouldn’t it be nice to make it a great one?</p>

        <p>1&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoga is a discipline and a science—but also a fun way to exercise your body and your mind. Some yoga poses are held statue-like, while others are very active and involve jumping movements. Doing statue-like poses will build concentration skills, physical strength, and flexibility that will help you in school or at work. The more active poses will build strong muscles for endurance and better performance in sports and other activities. When you learn how to breathe deeper and slower by practicing yoga breathing exercises, you’ll feel calm and relaxed. Breathing exercises will also help you sleep better and wake up in a better mood, ready to face another day with good energy and a smile.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp;&nbsp; You can practice yoga poses by yourself, with a friend, or with a group of friends. You can practice any time of the day or evening, outdoors on the grass, or in a spacious room indoors, and you never need anything but your own body. You will be amazed at how strong you can become by practicing yoga often, and your friends will be impressed by what you can teach them.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s important to start with the Basic Poses to begin building the strength, flexibility, and endurance that more advanced yoga requires. After you become stronger, you can begin to learn the more difficult poses. . . .</p>
        <p>
          <strong>What You Need to Know About Yoga</strong>
        </p>
        <p>4&nbsp;&nbsp; Many forms of yoga and yogic meditation are described in the ancient writings of India, where yoga was developed over 5,000 years ago, but in this book we will focus mainly on the form known as <em>hatha yoga</em>. This type of yoga is a complete system of poses, movements, breathing, relaxation, and concentration that promotes total health and well-being—mental, physical, and spiritual. People who do hatha yoga regularly can quickly increase their physical strength, flexibility, and coordination; clear energy blocks; and develop greater mental clarity, focus, and concentration—qualities essential for success in all areas of life.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoga poses tone the internal organs of the body while toning muscles, keeping the muscular structure strong, and improving circulation. When you hold a pose, the circulation of blood bathes a particular area of the body to rejuvenate<sup>1</sup> glands and cells, and to calm nerves.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
                  <img width="94%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766040240/w8qw6ldsl57fwzveu5yg.png" alt="STT17_RC_16_1">


        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>6&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoga practice focuses strongly on the brain and the spinal cord, the two principal centers of the body’s nervous system. While some yoga poses are designed for energizing the body, others are aimed specifically at calming and focusing the mind. Keeping the nerves calm and healthy is very important to maintaining a healthy mind and body. A nervous state or negative emotions like anger can have harmful physical or mental effects if these emotions and mental states occur often or last a long time. The deep breathing methods and calming poses learned in yoga ease nervous tension and help to keep your brain and nervous system working well. At the same time they help you calm your emotions and redirect energy into constructive channels.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp;&nbsp; Yogic breathing exercises produce life energy, or <em>prana</em>, which circulates through hundreds of energy channels (called <em>nadis</em>) throughout the body and clears blocked energy. The creators of yoga discovered seven energy centers, called <em>chakras</em>, running along the spine. Chakras absorb prana and send it along the energy channels to the blood, nervous system, and glands.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of the seven chakras affects specific glands, areas, and functions of the body. Each chakra activates a particular kind of energy that impacts our emotional, mental, and spiritual selves. If a particular part of your body feels “tight,” uneasy, achy, or painful, a yoga pose can be selected to move more blood and energy into that area. With yoga poses, chakras are stimulated and energy blocks are released so that the physical stress or emotional upset can heal. Practicing yoga poses keeps the energy channels clear and the chakras open, resulting in a healthy, balanced state. . . .</p>
        <p>9&nbsp;&nbsp; A person who practices yoga faithfully will eventually lose self-consciousness about his or her body and can begin to “let go of ego.” According to yoga philosophy, at this point the body is considered a fit vehicle for the soul. Although the form of yoga you will learn in this book does not involve spiritual meditations, practicing yoga poses that are calming to your body and spirit will allow you to experience a calm, peaceful, meditative state. As you continue to practice yoga, a quiet mind will emerge spontaneously and naturally. As you learn to focus your mind while holding a yoga pose, you will also improve your concentration and learning skills, and find it easier to maintain a positive mental attitude.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoga offers a different approach to strengthening and moving the body than sports and other types of physical activity. It gives you a chance to listen to your own body’s needs by tuning in and learning which parts need direct attention for healing or strengthening. Instead of exerting energy to the point where your body feels exhausted, in doing yoga you will feel increased energy as you focus inward on proper alignment<sup>2</sup> of the body while holding a pose.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp;&nbsp; Many yoga poses were inspired by animals and insects. Observing them to learn their secrets of staying strong and healthy, the creators of yoga developed a series of poses that focus on the special qualities and abilities of different animals and insects—their strength, agility, poise, or determination. Being aware of these life forms and their qualities helps you use your powers of visualization to strengthen your practice of yoga. Some of the classical poses in this book have been renamed to make them easier to visualize. . . .</p>
        <p>12&nbsp;&nbsp; When you practice yoga, you will notice that you become much more aware of your body. You will feel more alive and energized, and aware of how all the parts of your body are made to work together, in harmony. You will stand taller and be more poised, presenting a positive self-image to the world.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoga teaches balance of mind, body, and spirit. It is a discipline that promotes selfawareness and a strong sense of self, without overinflating the ego. Yoga is part of a system that, for centuries, has been used to build character and compassion, and is a basis for learning unconditional love of oneself and others. . . .</p>

        <p>9&nbsp;&nbsp; A person who practices yoga faithfully will eventually lose self-consciousness about his or her body and can begin to “let go of ego.” According to yoga philosophy, at this point the body is considered a fit vehicle for the soul. Although the form of yoga you will learn in this book does not involve spiritual meditations, practicing yoga poses that are calming to your body and spirit will allow you to experience a calm, peaceful, meditative state. As you continue to practice yoga, a quiet mind will emerge spontaneously and naturally. As you learn to focus your mind while holding a yoga pose, you will also improve your concentration and learning skills, and find it easier to maintain a positive mental attitude.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoga offers a different approach to strengthening and moving the body than sports and other types of physical activity. It gives you a chance to listen to your own body’s needs by tuning in and learning which parts need direct attention for healing or strengthening. Instead of exerting energy to the point where your body feels exhausted, in doing yoga you will feel increased energy as you focus inward on proper alignment<sup>2</sup> of the body while holding a pose.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp;&nbsp; Many yoga poses were inspired by animals and insects. Observing them to learn their secrets of staying strong and healthy, the creators of yoga developed a series of poses that focus on the special qualities and abilities of different animals and insects—their strength, agility, poise, or determination. Being aware of these life forms and their qualities helps you use your powers of visualization to strengthen your practice of yoga. Some of the classical poses in this book have been renamed to make them easier to visualize. . . .</p>
        <p>12&nbsp;&nbsp; When you practice yoga, you will notice that you become much more aware of your body. You will feel more alive and energized, and aware of how all the parts of your body are made to work together, in harmony. You will stand taller and be more poised, presenting a positive self-image to the world.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoga teaches balance of mind, body, and spirit. It is a discipline that promotes selfawareness and a strong sense of self, without overinflating the ego. Yoga is part of a system that, for centuries, has been used to build character and compassion, and is a basis for learning unconditional love of oneself and others. . . .</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoga is a discipline and a science—but also a fun way to exercise your body and your mind. Some yoga poses are held statue-like, while others are very active and involve jumping movements. Doing statue-like poses will build concentration skills, physical strength, and flexibility that will help you in school or at work. The more active poses will build strong muscles for endurance and better performance in sports and other activities. When you learn how to breathe deeper and slower by practicing yoga breathing exercises, you’ll feel calm and relaxed. Breathing exercises will also help you sleep better and wake up in a better mood, ready to face another day with good energy and a smile.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp;&nbsp; You can practice yoga poses by yourself, with a friend, or with a group of friends. You can practice any time of the day or evening, outdoors on the grass, or in a spacious room indoors, and you never need anything but your own body. You will be amazed at how strong you can become by practicing yoga often, and your friends will be impressed by what you can teach them.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s important to start with the Basic Poses to begin building the strength, flexibility, and endurance that more advanced yoga requires. After you become stronger, you can begin to learn the more difficult poses. . . .</p>
        <p>
          <strong>What You Need to Know About Yoga</strong>
        </p>
        <p>4&nbsp;&nbsp; Many forms of yoga and yogic meditation are described in the ancient writings of India, where yoga was developed over 5,000 years ago, but in this book we will focus mainly on the form known as <em>hatha yoga</em>. This type of yoga is a complete system of poses, movements, breathing, relaxation, and concentration that promotes total health and well-being—mental, physical, and spiritual. People who do hatha yoga regularly can quickly increase their physical strength, flexibility, and coordination; clear energy blocks; and develop greater mental clarity, focus, and concentration—qualities essential for success in all areas of life.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoga poses tone the internal organs of the body while toning muscles, keeping the muscular structure strong, and improving circulation. When you hold a pose, the circulation of blood bathes a particular area of the body to rejuvenate<sup>1</sup> glands and cells, and to calm nerves.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
                  <img width="94%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766046717/k9gbjvxsaqfq6ojtflnu.png" alt="STT17_RC_16_1">


        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>6&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoga practice focuses strongly on the brain and the spinal cord, the two principal centers of the body’s nervous system. While some yoga poses are designed for energizing the body, others are aimed specifically at calming and focusing the mind. Keeping the nerves calm and healthy is very important to maintaining a healthy mind and body. A nervous state or negative emotions like anger can have harmful physical or mental effects if these emotions and mental states occur often or last a long time. The deep breathing methods and calming poses learned in yoga ease nervous tension and help to keep your brain and nervous system working well. At the same time they help you calm your emotions and redirect energy into constructive channels.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp;&nbsp; Yogic breathing exercises produce life energy, or <em>prana</em>, which circulates through hundreds of energy channels (called <em>nadis</em>) throughout the body and clears blocked energy. The creators of yoga discovered seven energy centers, called <em>chakras</em>, running along the spine. Chakras absorb prana and send it along the energy channels to the blood, nervous system, and glands.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of the seven chakras affects specific glands, areas, and functions of the body. Each chakra activates a particular kind of energy that impacts our emotional, mental, and spiritual selves. If a particular part of your body feels “tight,” uneasy, achy, or painful, a yoga pose can be selected to move more blood and energy into that area. With yoga poses, chakras are stimulated and energy blocks are released so that the physical stress or emotional upset can heal. Practicing yoga poses keeps the energy channels clear and the chakras open, resulting in a healthy, balanced state. . . .</p>
        <p>9&nbsp;&nbsp; A person who practices yoga faithfully will eventually lose self-consciousness about his or her body and can begin to “let go of ego.” According to yoga philosophy, at this point the body is considered a fit vehicle for the soul. Although the form of yoga you will learn in this book does not involve spiritual meditations, practicing yoga poses that are calming to your body and spirit will allow you to experience a calm, peaceful, meditative state. As you continue to practice yoga, a quiet mind will emerge spontaneously and naturally. As you learn to focus your mind while holding a yoga pose, you will also improve your concentration and learning skills, and find it easier to maintain a positive mental attitude.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoga offers a different approach to strengthening and moving the body than sports and other types of physical activity. It gives you a chance to listen to your own body’s needs by tuning in and learning which parts need direct attention for healing or strengthening. Instead of exerting energy to the point where your body feels exhausted, in doing yoga you will feel increased energy as you focus inward on proper alignment<sup>2</sup> of the body while holding a pose.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp;&nbsp; Many yoga poses were inspired by animals and insects. Observing them to learn their secrets of staying strong and healthy, the creators of yoga developed a series of poses that focus on the special qualities and abilities of different animals and insects—their strength, agility, poise, or determination. Being aware of these life forms and their qualities helps you use your powers of visualization to strengthen your practice of yoga. Some of the classical poses in this book have been renamed to make them easier to visualize. . . .</p>

You will feel more alive and energized, and aware of how all the parts of your body are made to work together, in harmony.

        <p>1&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoga is a discipline and a science—but also a fun way to exercise your body and your mind. Some yoga poses are held statue-like, while others are very active and involve jumping movements. Doing statue-like poses will build concentration skills, physical strength, and flexibility that will help you in school or at work. The more active poses will build strong muscles for endurance and better performance in sports and other activities. When you learn how to breathe deeper and slower by practicing yoga breathing exercises, you’ll feel calm and relaxed. Breathing exercises will also help you sleep better and wake up in a better mood, ready to face another day with good energy and a smile.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp;&nbsp; You can practice yoga poses by yourself, with a friend, or with a group of friends. You can practice any time of the day or evening, outdoors on the grass, or in a spacious room indoors, and you never need anything but your own body. You will be amazed at how strong you can become by practicing yoga often, and your friends will be impressed by what you can teach them.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s important to start with the Basic Poses to begin building the strength, flexibility, and endurance that more advanced yoga requires. After you become stronger, you can begin to learn the more difficult poses. . . .</p>

          <strong>What You Need to Know About Yoga</strong>
        </p>
        <p>4&nbsp;&nbsp; Many forms of yoga and yogic meditation are described in the ancient writings of India, where yoga was developed over 5,000 years ago, but in this book we will focus mainly on the form known as <em>hatha yoga</em>. This type of yoga is a complete system of poses, movements, breathing, relaxation, and concentration that promotes total health and well-being—mental, physical, and spiritual. People who do hatha yoga regularly can quickly increase their physical strength, flexibility, and coordination; clear energy blocks; and develop greater mental clarity, focus, and concentration—qualities essential for success in all areas of life.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoga poses tone the internal organs of the body while toning muscles, keeping the muscular structure strong, and improving circulation. When you hold a pose, the circulation of blood bathes a particular area of the body to rejuvenate<sup>1</sup> glands and cells, and to calm nerves.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>6&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoga practice focuses strongly on the brain and the spinal cord, the two principal centers of the body’s nervous system. While some yoga poses are designed for energizing the body, others are aimed specifically at calming and focusing the mind. Keeping the nerves calm and healthy is very important to maintaining a healthy mind and body. A nervous state or negative emotions like anger can have harmful physical or mental effects if these emotions and mental states occur often or last a long time. The deep breathing methods and calming poses learned in yoga ease nervous tension and help to keep your brain and nervous system working well. At the same time they help you calm your emotions and redirect energy into constructive channels.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp;&nbsp; Yogic breathing exercises produce life energy, or <em>prana</em>, which circulates through hundreds of energy channels (called <em>nadis</em>) throughout the body and clears blocked energy. The creators of yoga discovered seven energy centers, called <em>chakras</em>, running along the spine. Chakras absorb prana and send it along the energy channels to the blood, nervous system, and glands.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of the seven chakras affects specific glands, areas, and functions of the body. Each chakra activates a particular kind of energy that impacts our emotional, mental, and spiritual selves. If a particular part of your body feels “tight,” uneasy, achy, or painful, a yoga pose can be selected to move more blood and energy into that area. With yoga poses, chakras are stimulated and energy blocks are released so that the physical stress or emotional upset can heal. Practicing yoga poses keeps the energy channels clear and the chakras open, resulting in a healthy, balanced state. . . .</p>
        <p>9&nbsp;&nbsp; A person who practices yoga faithfully will eventually lose self-consciousness about his or her body and can begin to “let go of ego.” According to yoga philosophy, at this point the body is considered a fit vehicle for the soul. Although the form of yoga you will learn in this book does not involve spiritual meditations, practicing yoga poses that are calming to your body and spirit will allow you to experience a calm, peaceful, meditative state. As you continue to practice yoga, a quiet mind will emerge spontaneously and naturally. As you learn to focus your mind while holding a yoga pose, you will also improve your concentration and learning skills, and find it easier to maintain a positive mental attitude.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoga offers a different approach to strengthening and moving the body than sports and other types of physical activity. It gives you a chance to listen to your own body’s needs by tuning in and learning which parts need direct attention for healing or strengthening. Instead of exerting energy to the point where your body feels exhausted, in doing yoga you will feel increased energy as you focus inward on proper alignment<sup>2</sup> of the body while holding a pose.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp;&nbsp; Many yoga poses were inspired by animals and insects. Observing them to learn their secrets of staying strong and healthy, the creators of yoga developed a series of poses that focus on the special qualities and abilities of different animals and insects—their strength, agility, poise, or determination. Being aware of these life forms and their qualities helps you use your powers of visualization to strengthen your practice of yoga. Some of the classical poses in this book have been renamed to make them easier to visualize. . . .</p>
        <p>12&nbsp;&nbsp; When you practice yoga, you will notice that you become much more aware of your body. You will feel more alive and energized, and aware of how all the parts of your body are made to work together, in harmony. You will stand taller and be more poised, presenting a positive self-image to the world.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoga teaches balance of mind, body, and spirit. It is a discipline that promotes selfawareness and a strong sense of self, without overinflating the ego. Yoga is part of a system that, for centuries, has been used to build character and compassion, and is a basis for learning unconditional love of oneself and others. . . .</p>

        <p>1&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoga is a discipline and a science—but also a fun way to exercise your body and your mind. Some yoga poses are held statue-like, while others are very active and involve jumping movements. Doing statue-like poses will build concentration skills, physical strength, and flexibility that will help you in school or at work. The more active poses will build strong muscles for endurance and better performance in sports and other activities. When you learn how to breathe deeper and slower by practicing yoga breathing exercises, you’ll feel calm and relaxed. Breathing exercises will also help you sleep better and wake up in a better mood, ready to face another day with good energy and a smile.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp;&nbsp; You can practice yoga poses by yourself, with a friend, or with a group of friends. You can practice any time of the day or evening, outdoors on the grass, or in a spacious room indoors, and you never need anything but your own body. You will be amazed at how strong you can become by practicing yoga often, and your friends will be impressed by what you can teach them.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s important to start with the Basic Poses to begin building the strength, flexibility, and endurance that more advanced yoga requires. After you become stronger, you can begin to learn the more difficult poses. . . .</p>
        <p>
          <strong>What You Need to Know About Yoga</strong>
        </p>
        <p>4&nbsp;&nbsp; Many forms of yoga and yogic meditation are described in the ancient writings of India, where yoga was developed over 5,000 years ago, but in this book we will focus mainly on the form known as <em>hatha yoga</em>. This type of yoga is a complete system of poses, movements, breathing, relaxation, and concentration that promotes total health and well-being—mental, physical, and spiritual. People who do hatha yoga regularly can quickly increase their physical strength, flexibility, and coordination; clear energy blocks; and develop greater mental clarity, focus, and concentration—qualities essential for success in all areas of life.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoga poses tone the internal organs of the body while toning muscles, keeping the muscular structure strong, and improving circulation. When you hold a pose, the circulation of blood bathes a particular area of the body to rejuvenate<sup>1</sup> glands and cells, and to calm nerves.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
                  <img width="94%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766030597/tvol7tfsirvj1rsrhsus.png" alt="STT17_RC_16_1">


        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>6&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoga practice focuses strongly on the brain and the spinal cord, the two principal centers of the body’s nervous system. While some yoga poses are designed for energizing the body, others are aimed specifically at calming and focusing the mind. Keeping the nerves calm and healthy is very important to maintaining a healthy mind and body. A nervous state or negative emotions like anger can have harmful physical or mental effects if these emotions and mental states occur often or last a long time. The deep breathing methods and calming poses learned in yoga ease nervous tension and help to keep your brain and nervous system working well. At the same time they help you calm your emotions and redirect energy into constructive channels.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp;&nbsp; Yogic breathing exercises produce life energy, or <em>prana</em>, which circulates through hundreds of energy channels (called <em>nadis</em>) throughout the body and clears blocked energy. The creators of yoga discovered seven energy centers, called <em>chakras</em>, running along the spine. Chakras absorb prana and send it along the energy channels to the blood, nervous system, and glands.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of the seven chakras affects specific glands, areas, and functions of the body. Each chakra activates a particular kind of energy that impacts our emotional, mental, and spiritual selves. If a particular part of your body feels “tight,” uneasy, achy, or painful, a yoga pose can be selected to move more blood and energy into that area. With yoga poses, chakras are stimulated and energy blocks are released so that the physical stress or emotional upset can heal. Practicing yoga poses keeps the energy channels clear and the chakras open, resulting in a healthy, balanced state. . . .</p>
        <p>9&nbsp;&nbsp; A person who practices yoga faithfully will eventually lose self-consciousness about his or her body and can begin to “let go of ego.” According to yoga philosophy, at this point the body is considered a fit vehicle for the soul. Although the form of yoga you will learn in this book does not involve spiritual meditations, practicing yoga poses that are calming to your body and spirit will allow you to experience a calm, peaceful, meditative state. As you continue to practice yoga, a quiet mind will emerge spontaneously and naturally. As you learn to focus your mind while holding a yoga pose, you will also improve your concentration and learning skills, and find it easier to maintain a positive mental attitude.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoga offers a different approach to strengthening and moving the body than sports and other types of physical activity. It gives you a chance to listen to your own body’s needs by tuning in and learning which parts need direct attention for healing or strengthening. Instead of exerting energy to the point where your body feels exhausted, in doing yoga you will feel increased energy as you focus inward on proper alignment<sup>2</sup> of the body while holding a pose.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp;&nbsp; Many yoga poses were inspired by animals and insects. Observing them to learn their secrets of staying strong and healthy, the creators of yoga developed a series of poses that focus on the special qualities and abilities of different animals and insects—their strength, agility, poise, or determination. Being aware of these life forms and their qualities helps you use your powers of visualization to strengthen your practice of yoga. Some of the classical poses in this book have been renamed to make them easier to visualize. . . .</p>
        <p>12&nbsp;&nbsp; When you practice yoga, you will notice that you become much more aware of your body. You will feel more alive and energized, and aware of how all the parts of your body are made to work together, in harmony. You will stand taller and be more poised, presenting a positive self-image to the world.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoga teaches balance of mind, body, and spirit. It is a discipline that promotes selfawareness and a strong sense of self, without overinflating the ego. Yoga is part of a system that, for centuries, has been used to build character and compassion, and is a basis for learning unconditional love of oneself and others. . . .</p>
