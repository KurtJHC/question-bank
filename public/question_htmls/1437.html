Native Americans were great inventors. For example, corn was cultivated by ancient farmers 10,000 years ago. Native Americans then taught European colonists to grow the crop. Everybody knows corn, but they don’t know it’s a food that wouldn’t exist without human intervention. Farmers in southern Mexico selectively bred a wild grass, for many generations to enlarge the ear and develop kernels that were soft enough for humans to eat. Later, their invention spread throughout the Western Hemisphere.<br>
<br>
Native American inventions were appropriated by Europeans with their trading networks and manufacturing infrastructure, who sometimes added improvements. For example, rubber was developed by Native Americans, and then Columbus took a rubber ball back to Europe. After Charles Goodyear developed the vulcanisation process in the 1830s to allow rubber to withstand heat and cold, colonisers developed vast rubber tree plantations in Asia to produce the raw material for factories. Now, rubber is used all over the world.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The Inuit in the Arctic developed the concept of a small, narrow boat, with a sealed cockpit to protect the paddler from sinking in the event that the craft capsized. The classic vessels were fashioned entirely from natural materials, with wood or whalebone frames covered by stitched sealskin or other animal hides. Today, the kayaks in use across the world are sometimes built from modern materials such as plastic and carbon fibre, but the design is still essentially the same.<br>

Forty million years ago, horses first emerged in North America, but after migrating to Asia, horses disappeared from this continent at least 10,000 years ago. So, for millennia, Native Americans travelled and hunted on foot, relying on dogs as miniature pack animals.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
When Christopher Columbus brought two dozen horses on his second voyage to the New World in 1493, he couldn’t have imagined how reintroducing the horse to North America would transform Native American life, especially for the buffalo-hunting Plains Indians, for whom the swift and loyal horse was a marriage made in heaven.<br>
<br>
When Columbus and other Spanish explorers arrived in Hispaniola on horseback, the native Taíno of the Caribbean were terrified by what they saw as a half-man, half-beast. They had never seen a creature that had human beings riding on it. As more Native tribes encountered the horse, that initial fear gave way to awe for the animal’s speed and power. With the dog as their closest reference, Indians gave this mythical new creature names like “elk dog”, “sky dog” and “holy dog”. The Spanish quickly realised that the last thing they wanted was for Indians to have horses, because that would put them on equal footing, but that’s exactly what happened.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
In the early 1800s, the sovereign Cherokee nation covered a vast region that included northwest Georgia and adjacent land in Tennessee, North Carolina and Alabama. Under the terms of an 1819 treaty, the United States guaranteed that Cherokee land would be off-limits to white settlers forever. Forever lasted less than 20 years. Although the treaty mandated the removal of “all white people who have intruded, or may hereafter intrude, on the lands of the Cherokees,” the United States instead forcibly removed more than 15,000 Cherokees in 1838 and 1839.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
As many as 4,000 died of disease, starvation and exposure during their detention and forced migration through nine states that became known as the “Trail of Tears”. The last of the Cherokee completed the Trail of Tears in March 1839. Decades later, a Confederate soldier who participated in the forced migration recalled, “I fought through the Civil War and saw men shot to pieces and slaughtered by the thousands, but the Cherokee removal was the cruelest work I ever knew.”&nbsp;<br>

Before European contact, the temperate, hospitable California area had more people (+/- 300,000 in 1600’s) than any other. It was also more diverse. Its estimated 100 different tribes and groups spoke more spoke over 200 dialects. In fact, California’s language landscape was more complex than that of Europe.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Despite this great diversity, most native Californians lived very similar lives. They did not practise much agriculture. Instead, they organised themselves into small, family-based bands of hunter-gatherers known as tribelets. Inter-tribelet relationships, based on wellestablished systems of trade and common rights, were generally peaceful.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But although gold spelled prosperity and power for the white settlers who arrived in California in 1849 and after, it meant disaster for the state’s peaceful indigenous population. An estimated 100,000 Native Americans died during the first two years of the Gold Rush alone. Today, despite all odds, California has the United States’ largest Native American population and is home to 109 federally recognised tribes.&nbsp;<br>
