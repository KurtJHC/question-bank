<p>Most people around the world have heard of Disney but people may not know about who Walt Disney was as a man and all of his fantastic achievements. Walter Elias Disney was born on 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;December 1901, in Chicago, USA. He was a motion picture and television producer as well as a pioneer of cartoon films. He created the extraordinarily famous cartoon character, Mickey Mouse and was the founder of the thrilling and family fun theme parks, Disneyland and Disney World.<br>
<br>
On 15<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;December 1966, Disney sadly died from lung cancer. Soon after his death, a very bizarre rumour began spreading that Disney’s body was frozen and buried beneath the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland California. It was thought that somehow when medical technology was advanced enough, he could be brought back to life. Disney’s daughter, Diane, has stated that this is definitely just a rumour but can anyone really be sure?<br>
&nbsp;<br>

Disney and his brother, Roy founded The Walt Disney Studios after working at Kansas City Film Ad Company. During his time working at the ad company, he made cut out animated commercials and started playing around with hand drawn animation using cameras. This really sparked his interest in animation and led to him opening up his own studio.<br>
<br>
In the late 1920s, the cartoons featuring Mickey Mouse and his friends were created. The first successful film starring the lovable Mickey Mouse was called Steamboat Willie. It’s hard to imagine now, with all the technology we have today, but at the time, sound was only just beginning to be available in films. Walt Disney voiced Mickey Mouse and the character was drawn by Ub Iwerks, the chief animator at the studio. Steamboat Willie and Mickey Mouse were an immediate hit with the general public. This was the start of the popularity of the enthusiastic, little mouse whom we still love today.<br>

During the time that Disney was alive, he produced more than 100 feature films. His first full-length animated film premiered in 1937 and that film was Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. It was so unbelievably successful that it generated $1.499 million. That was a huge amount of money in those days and an even greater achievement because it was during the Great Depression. The Great Depression (1929-1939) was the worst economic crisis in the history of the industrialised world. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs also won eight Oscars, which are awards for artistic and technical excellence in the film industry.</p>

<p>This immense success motivated The Walt Disney Studios to keep producing full-length films. In 1964, Walt Disney’s final masterpiece was the motion picture Mary Poppins. He produced it by himself and it was a mix of live action and animation. Since his death in 1966, The Walt Disney Studios has produced a massive number of entertaining and very iconic films and television shows. There are simply too many to mention here!<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
In 1955, in California, USA, Disney opened its first, fantastic, family friendly theme park called Disneyland. The land was once an orange grove and was transformed into a world of wonder, excitement and where dreams come true. Disneyland soon had a reputation as the ultimate family destination. Children and adults alike could enjoy the food, rides and meet the all-important and special Disney characters. The theme park was very profitable and tourists were swiftly coming from all over the world. Disneyland theme parks are now located in Orlando, Florida, Tokyo, Paris, Hong Kong and Shanghai. There are now several Disney Worlds and Disney Resorts. At the multiple Disney Resorts, families can stay in variety of Disney themed hotel rooms, villas, bungalows and even camp, to have the ultimate, unforgettable Disney experience.<br>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing </strong><br><em>by Judy Blume&nbsp;</em><br><br>
I won Dribble at Jimmy Fargo's birthday party. All the other guys got to take home goldfish in little plastic bags. I won him because I guessed there were three hundred and forty-eight jelly beans in Mrs. Fargo's jar. Really, there were four hundred and twenty-three, she told us later. Still, my guess was closest. "Peter Warren Hatcher is the big winner!" Mrs. Fargo announced.</p>
        <p>At first, I felt bad that I didn't get a goldfish too. Then Jimmy handed me a glass bowl. Inside there was some water and three rocks. A tiny green turtle was sleeping on the biggest rock. All the other guys looked at their goldfish. I knew what they were thinking. They wished they could have tiny green turtles too.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I named my turtle Dribble while I was walking home from Jimmy's party. I live at 25 West 68th Street. It's an old apartment building. But it's got one of the best elevators in New York City. There are mirrors all around. You can see yourself from every angle. There's a soft, cushioned bench to sit on if you're too tired to stand. The elevator operator's name is Henry Bevelheimer. He lets us call him Henry because Bevelheimer's very hard to say.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Our apartment's on the twelfth floor. But I don't have to tell Henry. He already knows. He knows everybody in the building. He's that smart! He even knows I'm nine and in fourth grade.</p>
        <p>I showed him Dribble right away. “I won him at a birthday party," I said.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Henry smiled. "Your mother's going to be surprised."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Henry was right. My mother was really surprised. Her mouth opened when I said, "Just look at what I won at Jimmy Fargo's birthday party." I held up my tiny green turtle. "I've already named him . . . Dribble! Isn't that a great name for a turtle?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My mother made a face. "I don't like the way he smells," she said.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"What do you mean?" I asked. I put my nose right down close to him. I didn't smell anything but turtle. So Dribble smells like turtle, I thought. Well, he's supposed to. That's what he is!</p>
        <p>"And I'm not going to take care of him either," my mother added.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Of course you're not," I told her. "He's my turtle. And I'm the one who's going to take care of him."</p>
        <p>"You're going to change his water and clean out his bowl and feed him and all of that?" she asked.</p>
        <p>"Yes," I said. "And even more. I'm going to see to it that he's happy!"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This time my mother made a funny noise. Like a groan.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I went into my bedroom. I put Dribble on top of my dresser. I tried to pet him and tell him he would be happy living with me. But it isn't easy to pet a turtle. They aren't soft and furry and they don't lick you or anything. Still, I had my very own pet at last.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Later, when I sat down at the dinner table, my mother said, "I smell turtle. Peter, go and scrub your hands!"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Some people might think that my mother is my biggest problem. She doesn't like turtles and she's always telling me to scrub my hands. That doesn't mean just run them under the water. Scrub means I'm supposed to use soap and rub my hands together. Then I've got to rinse and dry them. I ought to know by now. I've heard it enough!&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But my mother isn't my biggest problem. Neither is my father. He spends a lot of time watching commercials on TV. That's because he's in the advertising business. These days his favourite commercial is the one about Juicy-O. He wrote it himself. And the president of the Juicy-O company liked it so much he sent my father a whole crate of Juicy-O for our family to drink. It tastes like a combination of oranges, pineapples, grapefruits, pears, and bananas. (And if you want to know the truth, I'm getting pretty sick of drinking it.) But JuicyO isn't my biggest problem either.</p>
        <p>My biggest problem is my brother, Farley Drexel Hatcher. He's two-and-a-half years old. Everybody calls him Fudge. I feel sorry for him if he's going to grow up with a name like Fudge, but I don't say a word. It's none of my business.</p>
        <p>Fudge is always in my way. He messes up everything he sees. And when he gets mad he throws himself flat on the floor and he screams. And he kicks. And he bangs his fists. The only time I really like him is when he's sleeping. He sucks four fingers on his left hand and makes a slurping noise.</p>
        <p>When Fudge saw Dribble he said, "Ohhhhh see!"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And I said, "That's my turtle, get it? Mine! You don't touch him."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Fudge said, "No touch." Then he laughed like crazy.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing</strong><br><em>by Judy Blume&nbsp;</em><br><br>
​I won Dribble at Jimmy Fargo's birthday party. All the other guys got to take home goldfish in little plastic bags. I won him because I guessed there were three hundred and forty-eight jelly beans in Mrs. Fargo's jar. Really, there were four hundred and twenty-three, she told us later. Still, my guess was closest. "Peter Warren Hatcher is the big winner!" Mrs. Fargo announced.</p>
        <p>At first, I felt bad that I didn't get a goldfish too. Then Jimmy handed me a glass bowl. Inside there was some water and three rocks. A tiny green turtle was sleeping on the biggest rock. All the other guys looked at their goldfish. I knew what they were thinking. They wished they could have tiny green turtles too.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I named my turtle Dribble while I was walking home from Jimmy's party. I live at 25 West 68th Street. It's an old apartment building. But it's got one of the best elevators in New York City. There are mirrors all around. You can see yourself from every angle. There's a soft, cushioned bench to sit on if you're too tired to stand. The elevator operator's name is Henry Bevelheimer. He lets us call him Henry because Bevelheimer's very hard to say.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Our apartment's on the twelfth floor. But I don't have to tell Henry. He already knows. He knows everybody in the building. He's that smart! He even knows I'm nine and in fourth grade.</p>
        <p>I showed him Dribble right away. “I won him at a birthday party," I said.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Henry smiled. "Your mother's going to be surprised."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Henry was right. My mother was really surprised. Her mouth opened when I said, "Just look at what I won at Jimmy Fargo's birthday party." I held up my tiny green turtle. "I've already named him . . . Dribble! Isn't that a great name for a turtle?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My mother made a face. "I don't like the way he smells," she said.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"What do you mean?" I asked. I put my nose right down close to him. I didn't smell anything but turtle. So Dribble smells like turtle, I thought. Well, he's supposed to. That's what he is!</p>
        <p>"And I'm not going to take care of him either," my mother added.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Of course you're not," I told her. "He's my turtle. And I'm the one who's going to take care of him."</p>
        <p>"You're going to change his water and clean out his bowl and feed him and all of that?" she asked.</p>
        <p>"Yes," I said. "And even more. I'm going to see to it that he's happy!"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This time my mother made a funny noise. Like a groan.&nbsp;</p>

These days his favourite commercial is the one about Juicy-O. He wrote it himself. And the president of the Juicy-O company liked it so much he sent my father a whole crate of Juicy-O for our family to drink. It tastes like a combination of oranges, pineapples, grapefruits, pears, and bananas. (And if you want to know the truth, I'm getting pretty sick of drinking it.) But JuicyO isn't my biggest problem either.</p>
        <p>My biggest problem is my brother, Farley Drexel Hatcher. He's two-and-a-half years old. Everybody calls him Fudge. I feel sorry for him if he's going to grow up with a name like Fudge, but I don't say a word. It's none of my business.</p>
        <p>Fudge is always in my way. He messes up everything he sees. And when he gets mad he throws himself flat on the floor and he screams. And he kicks. And he bangs his fists. The only time I really like him is when he's sleeping. He sucks four fingers on his left hand and makes a slurping noise.</p>
        <p>When Fudge saw Dribble he said, "Ohhhhh see!"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And I said, "That's my turtle, get it? Mine! You don't touch him."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Fudge said, "No touch." Then he laughed like crazy.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing</strong><br><em>by Judy Blume&nbsp;</em><br><br>
​I won Dribble at Jimmy Fargo's birthday party. All the other guys got to take home goldfish in little plastic bags. I won him because I guessed there were three hundred and forty-eight jelly beans in Mrs. Fargo's jar. Really, there were four hundred and twenty-three, she told us later. Still, my guess was closest. "Peter Warren Hatcher is the big winner!" Mrs. Fargo announced.</p>
        <p>At first, I felt bad that I didn't get a goldfish too. Then Jimmy handed me a glass bowl. Inside there was some water and three rocks. A tiny green turtle was sleeping on the biggest rock. All the other guys looked at their goldfish. I knew what they were thinking. They wished they could have tiny green turtles too.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I named my turtle Dribble while I was walking home from Jimmy's party. I live at 25 West 68th Street. It's an old apartment building. But it's got one of the best elevators in New York City. There are mirrors all around. You can see yourself from every angle. There's a soft, cushioned bench to sit on if you're too tired to stand. The elevator operator's name is Henry Bevelheimer. He lets us call him Henry because Bevelheimer's very hard to say.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Our apartment's on the twelfth floor. But I don't have to tell Henry. He already knows. He knows everybody in the building. He's that smart! He even knows I'm nine and in fourth grade.</p>
        <p>I showed him Dribble right away. “I won him at a birthday party," I said.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Henry smiled. "Your mother's going to be surprised."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Henry was right. My mother was really surprised. Her mouth opened when I said, "Just look at what I won at Jimmy Fargo's birthday party." I held up my tiny green turtle. "I've already named him . . . Dribble! Isn't that a great name for a turtle?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My mother made a face. "I don't like the way he smells," she said.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"What do you mean?" I asked. I put my nose right down close to him. I didn't smell anything but turtle. So Dribble smells like turtle, I thought. Well, he's supposed to. That's what he is!</p>
        <p>"And I'm not going to take care of him either," my mother added.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Of course you're not," I told her. "He's my turtle. And I'm the one who's going to take care of him."</p>
        <p>"You're going to change his water and clean out his bowl and feed him and all of that?" she asked.</p>
        <p>"Yes," I said. "And even more. I'm going to see to it that he's happy!"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This time my mother made a funny noise. Like a groan.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I went into my bedroom. I put Dribble on top of my dresser. I tried to pet him and tell him he would be happy living with me. But it isn't easy to pet a turtle. They aren't soft and furry and they don't lick you or anything. Still, I had my very own pet at last.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Later, when I sat down at the dinner table, my mother said, "I smell turtle. Peter, go and scrub your hands!"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Some people might think that my mother is my biggest problem. She doesn't like turtles and she's always telling me to scrub my hands. That doesn't mean just run them under the water. Scrub means I'm supposed to use soap and rub my hands together. Then I've got to rinse and dry them. I ought to know by now. I've heard it enough!&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But my mother isn't my biggest problem. Neither is my father. He spends a lot of time watching commercials on TV. That's because he's in the advertising business. These days his favourite commercial is the one about Juicy-O. He wrote it himself. And the president of the Juicy-O company liked it so much he sent my father a whole crate of Juicy-O for our family to drink. It tastes like a combination of oranges, pineapples, grapefruits, pears, and bananas. (And if you want to know the truth, I'm getting pretty sick of drinking it.) But JuicyO isn't my biggest problem either.</p>

The only time I really like him is when he's sleeping. He sucks four fingers on his left hand and makes a slurping noise.</p>
        <p>When Fudge saw Dribble he said, "Ohhhhh see!"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And I said, "That's my turtle, get it? Mine! You don't touch him."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Fudge said, "No touch." Then he laughed like crazy.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing</strong><br><em>by Judy Blume&nbsp;</em><br><br>
​I won Dribble at Jimmy Fargo's birthday party. All the other guys got to take home goldfish in little plastic bags. I won him because I guessed there were three hundred and forty-eight jelly beans in Mrs. Fargo's jar. Really, there were four hundred and twenty-three, she told us later. Still, my guess was closest. "Peter Warren Hatcher is the big winner!" Mrs. Fargo announced.</p>
        <p>At first, I felt bad that I didn't get a goldfish too. Then Jimmy handed me a glass bowl. Inside there was some water and three rocks. A tiny green turtle was sleeping on the biggest rock. All the other guys looked at their goldfish. I knew what they were thinking. They wished they could have tiny green turtles too.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I named my turtle Dribble while I was walking home from Jimmy's party. I live at 25 West 68th Street. It's an old apartment building. But it's got one of the best elevators in New York City. There are mirrors all around. You can see yourself from every angle. There's a soft, cushioned bench to sit on if you're too tired to stand. The elevator operator's name is Henry Bevelheimer. He lets us call him Henry because Bevelheimer's very hard to say.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Our apartment's on the twelfth floor. But I don't have to tell Henry. He already knows. He knows everybody in the building. He's that smart! He even knows I'm nine and in fourth grade.</p>
        <p>I showed him Dribble right away. “I won him at a birthday party," I said.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Henry smiled. "Your mother's going to be surprised."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Henry was right. My mother was really surprised. Her mouth opened when I said, "Just look at what I won at Jimmy Fargo's birthday party." I held up my tiny green turtle. "I've already named him . . . Dribble! Isn't that a great name for a turtle?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My mother made a face. "I don't like the way he smells," she said.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"What do you mean?" I asked. I put my nose right down close to him. I didn't smell anything but turtle. So Dribble smells like turtle, I thought. Well, he's supposed to. That's what he is!</p>
        <p>"And I'm not going to take care of him either," my mother added.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Of course you're not," I told her. "He's my turtle. And I'm the one who's going to take care of him."</p>
        <p>"You're going to change his water and clean out his bowl and feed him and all of that?" she asked.</p>
        <p>"Yes," I said. "And even more. I'm going to see to it that he's happy!"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This time my mother made a funny noise. Like a groan.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I went into my bedroom. I put Dribble on top of my dresser. I tried to pet him and tell him he would be happy living with me. But it isn't easy to pet a turtle. They aren't soft and furry and they don't lick you or anything. Still, I had my very own pet at last.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Later, when I sat down at the dinner table, my mother said, "I smell turtle. Peter, go and scrub your hands!"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Some people might think that my mother is my biggest problem. She doesn't like turtles and she's always telling me to scrub my hands. That doesn't mean just run them under the water. Scrub means I'm supposed to use soap and rub my hands together. Then I've got to rinse and dry them. I ought to know by now. I've heard it enough!&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But my mother isn't my biggest problem. Neither is my father. He spends a lot of time watching commercials on TV. That's because he's in the advertising business. These days his favourite commercial is the one about Juicy-O. He wrote it himself. And the president of the Juicy-O company liked it so much he sent my father a whole crate of Juicy-O for our family to drink. It tastes like a combination of oranges, pineapples, grapefruits, pears, and bananas. (And if you want to know the truth, I'm getting pretty sick of drinking it.) But JuicyO isn't my biggest problem either.</p>
        <p>My biggest problem is my brother, Farley Drexel Hatcher. He's two-and-a-half years old. Everybody calls him Fudge. I feel sorry for him if he's going to grow up with a name like Fudge, but I don't say a word. It's none of my business.</p>
        <p>Fudge is always in my way. He messes up everything he sees. And when he gets mad he throws himself flat on the floor and he screams. And he kicks. And he bangs his fists. The only time I really like him is when he's sleeping. He sucks four fingers on his left hand and makes a slurping noise.</p>
        <p>When Fudge saw Dribble he said, "Ohhhhh see!"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And I said, "That's my turtle, get it? Mine! You don't touch him."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Fudge said, "No touch." Then he laughed like crazy.</p>

See the kitten on the wall,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
sporting with the leaves that fall,&nbsp;<br>
Withered leaves one-two-three,<br>
from the lofty elder tree!<br>
Through the calm and frosty air,<br>
of this morning bright and fair…<br>
- But the kitten, how she starts;<br>
Crouches, stretches, paws and darts!<br>
First at one, and then its fellow,<br>
Just as light and just as yellow;<br>
There are many now – now one –<br>
now they stop and there are none;<br>
What intenseness of desire, in her&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline"><strong>upward eye of fire</strong></span>!&nbsp;<br>
With a tiger-leap half way,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
now she meets the coming prey,&nbsp;<br>
Lets it go as fast, and then,&nbsp;<br>
has it in her power again:&nbsp;<br>
Now she works with three or four,&nbsp;<br>
like an Indian Conjurer;&nbsp;<br>
Quick as he in feats of art,&nbsp;<br>
far beyond in joy of heart.</p>
