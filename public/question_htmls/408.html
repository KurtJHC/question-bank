          <strong>Animals in Unexpected Places</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">by Margaret S. Frezon</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Most of the time, we can easily guess a creature’s behavior based on its species. For example, fish swim in the water, birds fly through the sky and almost all mammals walk on land. However, there are a few interesting exceptions to these general rules.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Owls Underground</strong>
        </p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the western states of our country, you might see this unusual and amusing sight: fat little birds poking their heads up out of holes in the ground. Believe it or not, these birds are owls. Unlike other owls, however, they do not live in trees. Burrowing owls live in tunnels under the earth. They are found in deserts and open, dry grasslands where trees are scarce. By living underground, these owls manage to survive in the desert’s harsh, hot environment.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These birds live in the same areas as prairie dogs. If a prairie dog abandons its burrow for any reason, the owl has a ready-made home. Researchers believe that burrowing owls, like prairie dogs, live in groupings called colonies.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Burrowing owls are small, growing only about 10 inches tall. They are sandy brown with some white markings on their faces and stomachs. The owls have a rounded head and lack the ear tufts that other owls have. Their long legs and sharp beaks are useful in moving dirt.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Active during both day and night hours, the owls feed on insects, spiders, mice, scorpions, and other small animals. They are sometimes also referred to as ground owls, prairie dog owls, tunnel owls, or hill owls.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Fish in the Air</strong>
        </p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Most fish spend almost all their time in the water. Some species leap out briefly after food or for other reasons. “Flying fish,” however, leave the water for longer periods. They can glide through the air as much as 10 feet above the surface.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Flying fish are found in parts of the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea and in other tropical waters. They live near the surface of the water, rather than deep in the sea. These fish usually swim, but at times they leap out of the water, soaring through the air above the waves. To do this, they move their tails, rapidly, accelerating to speeds as fast as 30 miles per hour. Then the fish leap out of the water, high into the air. They have very large pectoral fins that help them glide for great distances. For these fish, flying is not only a hobby but also a matter of survival; it helps them escape from their enemies.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Flying fish are medium sized, measuring about 10 to 18 inches long, depending on the specific type of fish. Atlantic flying fish are usually greenish blue on top, with a lighter color underneath. Their wings are actually enlarged pectoral fins. Some types of flying fish have one pair of wings, and others have two pairs.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A strong gust of wind will sometimes help to push the fish along, allowing them to cover as much as 30 feet in a single leap. Flying fish are able to glide, but they cannot steer. Some unlucky flying fish have actually leapt out of the water and landed on the decks of passing fishing boats.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Kangaroos Up a Tree</strong>
        </p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Many people know about large kangaroos bounding effortlessly across the Australian wilderness. However, there are different types of kangaroos. Some are so small they might remind you more of a monkey than a kangaroo. You would have to look up to see the Goodfellow’s kangaroo because it spends much of its life in the branches of trees.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Goodfellow’s kangaroos live in New Guinea, an island off the coast of Australia. They are at home in mountainous areas among the heavy vines and tree limbs of the area’s rainforests. They spend their time safely camouflaged in the dense foliage, where it is very difficult to see them. During the day, they sleep in the branches.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Goodfellow’s kangaroo is a marsupial, meaning that, like other kangaroos, it has a pouch. It is small, weighing about 15–20 pounds, or about as much as a small dog. Its body is approximately 30 inches long, and it has an equally long tail. Its brown fur is short and soft, with yellow markings. Its long curved claws help it hang onto branches.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A kangaroo that lives in a tree must be an agile climber. These kangaroos easily jump from branch to branch, eating leaves, berries, and fruit. A baby tree kangaroo stays in its mother’s pouch much longer than kangaroos that live on the ground. This is probably because it takes more skill to climb around in the trees.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After reading about underground owls, flying fish, and small kangaroos that live in trees, you know that some animals can be found in quite unexpected places!</p>

          <strong>Animals in Unexpected Places</strong>

        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Most of the time, we can easily guess a creature’s behavior based on its species. For example, fish swim in the water, birds fly through the sky and almost all mammals walk on land. However, there are a few interesting exceptions to these general rules.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Owls Underground</strong>
        </p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the western states of our country, you might see this unusual and amusing sight: fat little birds poking their heads up out of holes in the ground. Believe it or not, these birds are owls. Unlike other owls, however, they do not live in trees. Burrowing owls live in tunnels under the earth. They are found in deserts and open, dry grasslands where trees are scarce. By living underground, these owls manage to survive in the desert’s harsh, hot environment.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These birds live in the same areas as prairie dogs. If a prairie dog abandons its burrow for any reason, the owl has a ready-made home. Researchers believe that burrowing owls, like prairie dogs, live in groupings called colonies.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Burrowing owls are small, growing only about 10 inches tall. They are sandy brown with some white markings on their faces and stomachs. The owls have a rounded head and lack the ear tufts that other owls have. Their long legs and sharp beaks are useful in moving dirt.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Active during both day and night hours, the owls feed on insects, spiders, mice, scorpions, and other small animals. They are sometimes also referred to as ground owls, prairie dog owls, tunnel owls, or hill owls.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Fish in the Air</strong>
        </p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Most fish spend almost all their time in the water. Some species leap out briefly after food or for other reasons. “Flying fish,” however, leave the water for longer periods. They can glide through the air as much as 10 feet above the surface.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Flying fish are found in parts of the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea and in other tropical waters. They live near the surface of the water, rather than deep in the sea. These fish usually swim, but at times they leap out of the water, soaring through the air above the waves. To do this, they move their tails, rapidly, accelerating to speeds as fast as 30 miles per hour. Then the fish leap out of the water, high into the air. They have very large pectoral fins that help them glide for great distances. For these fish, flying is not only a hobby but also a matter of survival; it helps them escape from their enemies.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Flying fish are medium sized, measuring about 10 to 18 inches long, depending on the specific type of fish. Atlantic flying fish are usually greenish blue on top, with a lighter color underneath. Their wings are actually enlarged pectoral fins. Some types of flying fish have one pair of wings, and others have two pairs.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A strong gust of wind will sometimes help to push the fish along, allowing them to cover as much as 30 feet in a single leap. Flying fish are able to glide, but they cannot steer. Some unlucky flying fish have actually leapt out of the water and landed on the decks of passing fishing boats.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Kangaroos Up a Tree</strong>
        </p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Many people know about large kangaroos bounding effortlessly across the Australian wilderness. However, there are different types of kangaroos. Some are so small they might remind you more of a monkey than a kangaroo. You would have to look up to see the Goodfellow’s kangaroo because it spends much of its life in the branches of trees.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Goodfellow’s kangaroos live in New Guinea, an island off the coast of Australia. They are at home in mountainous areas among the heavy vines and tree limbs of the area’s rainforests. They spend their time safely camouflaged in the dense foliage, where it is very difficult to see them. During the day, they sleep in the branches.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Goodfellow’s kangaroo is a marsupial, meaning that, like other kangaroos, it has a pouch. It is small, weighing about 15–20 pounds, or about as much as a small dog. Its body is approximately 30 inches long, and it has an equally long tail. Its brown fur is short and soft, with yellow markings. Its long curved claws help it hang onto branches.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A kangaroo that lives in a tree must be an agile climber. These kangaroos easily jump from branch to branch, eating leaves, berries, and fruit. A baby tree kangaroo stays in its mother’s pouch much longer than kangaroos that live on the ground. This is probably because it takes more skill to climb around in the trees.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After reading about underground owls, flying fish, and small kangaroos that live in trees, you know that some animals can be found in quite unexpected places!</p>

        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the western states of our country, you might see this unusual and amusing sight: fat little birds poking their heads up out of holes in the ground. Believe it or not, these birds are owls. Unlike other owls, however, they do not live in trees. Burrowing owls live in tunnels under the earth. They are found in deserts and open, dry grasslands where trees are scarce. By living underground, these owls manage to survive in the desert’s harsh, hot environment.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These birds live in the same areas as prairie dogs. If a prairie dog abandons its burrow for any reason, the owl has a ready-made home. Researchers believe that burrowing owls, like prairie dogs, live in groupings called colonies.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Burrowing owls are small, growing only about 10 inches tall. They are sandy brown with some white markings on their faces and stomachs. The owls have a rounded head and lack the ear tufts that other owls have. Their long legs and sharp beaks are useful in moving dirt.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Active during both day and night hours, the owls feed on insects, spiders, mice, scorpions, and other small animals. They are sometimes also referred to as ground owls, prairie dog owls, tunnel owls, or hill owls.</p>

          <strong>Fish in the Air</strong>
        </p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Most fish spend almost all their time in the water. Some species leap out briefly after food or for other reasons. “Flying fish,” however, leave the water for longer periods. They can glide through the air as much as 10 feet above the surface.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Flying fish are found in parts of the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea and in other tropical waters. They live near the surface of the water, rather than deep in the sea. These fish usually swim, but at times they leap out of the water, soaring through the air above the waves. To do this, they move their tails, rapidly, accelerating to speeds as fast as 30 miles per hour. Then the fish leap out of the water, high into the air. They have very large pectoral fins that help them glide for great distances. For these fish, flying is not only a hobby but also a matter of survival; it helps them escape from their enemies.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Flying fish are medium sized, measuring about 10 to 18 inches long, depending on the specific type of fish. Atlantic flying fish are usually greenish blue on top, with a lighter color underneath. Their wings are actually enlarged pectoral fins. Some types of flying fish have one pair of wings, and others have two pairs.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A strong gust of wind will sometimes help to push the fish along, allowing them to cover as much as 30 feet in a single leap. Flying fish are able to glide, but they cannot steer. Some unlucky flying fish have actually leapt out of the water and landed on the decks of passing fishing boats.</p>

          <strong>Kangaroos Up a Tree</strong>
        </p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Many people know about large kangaroos bounding effortlessly across the Australian wilderness. However, there are different types of kangaroos. Some are so small they might remind you more of a monkey than a kangaroo. You would have to look up to see the Goodfellow’s kangaroo because it spends much of its life in the branches of trees.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Goodfellow’s kangaroos live in New Guinea, an island off the coast of Australia. They are at home in mountainous areas among the heavy vines and tree limbs of the area’s rainforests. They spend their time safely camouflaged in the dense foliage, where it is very difficult to see them. During the day, they sleep in the branches.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Goodfellow’s kangaroo is a marsupial, meaning that, like other kangaroos, it has a pouch. It is small, weighing about 15–20 pounds, or about as much as a small dog. Its body is approximately 30 inches long, and it has an equally long tail. Its brown fur is short and soft, with yellow markings. Its long curved claws help it hang onto branches.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A kangaroo that lives in a tree must be an agile climber. These kangaroos easily jump from branch to branch, eating leaves, berries, and fruit. A baby tree kangaroo stays in its mother’s pouch much longer than kangaroos that live on the ground. This is probably because it takes more skill to climb around in the trees.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After reading about underground owls, flying fish, and small kangaroos that live in trees, you know that some animals can be found in quite unexpected places!</p>

        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These birds live in the same areas as prairie dogs. If a prairie dog abandons its burrow for any reason, the owl has a ready-made home. Researchers believe that burrowing owls, like prairie dogs, live in groupings called colonies.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Burrowing owls are small, growing only about 10 inches tall. They are sandy brown with some white markings on their faces and stomachs. The owls have a rounded head and lack the ear tufts that other owls have. Their long legs and sharp beaks are useful in moving dirt.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Active during both day and night hours, the owls feed on insects, spiders, mice, scorpions, and other small animals. They are sometimes also referred to as ground owls, prairie dog owls, tunnel owls, or hill owls.</p>

          <strong>Fish in the Air</strong>
        </p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Most fish spend almost all their time in the water. Some species leap out briefly after food or for other reasons. “Flying fish,” however, leave the water for longer periods. They can glide through the air as much as 10 feet above the surface.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Flying fish are found in parts of the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea and in other tropical waters. They live near the surface of the water, rather than deep in the sea. These fish usually swim, but at times they leap out of the water, soaring through the air above the waves. To do this, they move their tails, rapidly, accelerating to speeds as fast as 30 miles per hour. Then the fish leap out of the water, high into the air. They have very large pectoral fins that help them glide for great distances. For these fish, flying is not only a hobby but also a matter of survival; it helps them escape from their enemies.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Flying fish are medium sized, measuring about 10 to 18 inches long, depending on the specific type of fish. Atlantic flying fish are usually greenish blue on top, with a lighter color underneath. Their wings are actually enlarged pectoral fins. Some types of flying fish have one pair of wings, and others have two pairs.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A strong gust of wind will sometimes help to push the fish along, allowing them to cover as much as 30 feet in a single leap. Flying fish are able to glide, but they cannot steer. Some unlucky flying fish have actually leapt out of the water and landed on the decks of passing fishing boats.</p>

          <strong>Kangaroos Up a Tree</strong>
        </p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Many people know about large kangaroos bounding effortlessly across the Australian wilderness. However, there are different types of kangaroos. Some are so small they might remind you more of a monkey than a kangaroo. You would have to look up to see the Goodfellow’s kangaroo because it spends much of its life in the branches of trees.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Goodfellow’s kangaroos live in New Guinea, an island off the coast of Australia. They are at home in mountainous areas among the heavy vines and tree limbs of the area’s rainforests. They spend their time safely camouflaged in the dense foliage, where it is very difficult to see them. During the day, they sleep in the branches.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Goodfellow’s kangaroo is a marsupial, meaning that, like other kangaroos, it has a pouch. It is small, weighing about 15–20 pounds, or about as much as a small dog. Its body is approximately 30 inches long, and it has an equally long tail. Its brown fur is short and soft, with yellow markings. Its long curved claws help it hang onto branches.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A kangaroo that lives in a tree must be an agile climber. These kangaroos easily jump from branch to branch, eating leaves, berries, and fruit. A baby tree kangaroo stays in its mother’s pouch much longer than kangaroos that live on the ground. This is probably because it takes more skill to climb around in the trees.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After reading about underground owls, flying fish, and small kangaroos that live in trees, you know that some animals can be found in quite unexpected places!</p>

        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Active during both day and night hours, the owls feed on insects, spiders, mice, scorpions, and other small animals. They are sometimes also referred to as ground owls, prairie dog owls, tunnel owls, or hill owls.</p>

          <strong>Fish in the Air</strong>
        </p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Most fish spend almost all their time in the water. Some species leap out briefly after food or for other reasons. “Flying fish,” however, leave the water for longer periods. They can glide through the air as much as 10 feet above the surface.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Flying fish are found in parts of the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea and in other tropical waters. They live near the surface of the water, rather than deep in the sea. These fish usually swim, but at times they leap out of the water, soaring through the air above the waves. To do this, they move their tails, rapidly, accelerating to speeds as fast as 30 miles per hour. Then the fish leap out of the water, high into the air. They have very large pectoral fins that help them glide for great distances. For these fish, flying is not only a hobby but also a matter of survival; it helps them escape from their enemies.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Flying fish are medium sized, measuring about 10 to 18 inches long, depending on the specific type of fish. Atlantic flying fish are usually greenish blue on top, with a lighter color underneath. Their wings are actually enlarged pectoral fins. Some types of flying fish have one pair of wings, and others have two pairs.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A strong gust of wind will sometimes help to push the fish along, allowing them to cover as much as 30 feet in a single leap. Flying fish are able to glide, but they cannot steer. Some unlucky flying fish have actually leapt out of the water and landed on the decks of passing fishing boats.</p>

          <strong>Kangaroos Up a Tree</strong>
        </p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Many people know about large kangaroos bounding effortlessly across the Australian wilderness. However, there are different types of kangaroos. Some are so small they might remind you more of a monkey than a kangaroo. You would have to look up to see the Goodfellow’s kangaroo because it spends much of its life in the branches of trees.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Goodfellow’s kangaroos live in New Guinea, an island off the coast of Australia. They are at home in mountainous areas among the heavy vines and tree limbs of the area’s rainforests. They spend their time safely camouflaged in the dense foliage, where it is very difficult to see them. During the day, they sleep in the branches.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Goodfellow’s kangaroo is a marsupial, meaning that, like other kangaroos, it has a pouch. It is small, weighing about 15–20 pounds, or about as much as a small dog. Its body is approximately 30 inches long, and it has an equally long tail. Its brown fur is short and soft, with yellow markings. Its long curved claws help it hang onto branches.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A kangaroo that lives in a tree must be an agile climber. These kangaroos easily jump from branch to branch, eating leaves, berries, and fruit. A baby tree kangaroo stays in its mother’s pouch much longer than kangaroos that live on the ground. This is probably because it takes more skill to climb around in the trees.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After reading about underground owls, flying fish, and small kangaroos that live in trees, you know that some animals can be found in quite unexpected places!</p>

          <strong>Painted Into a Corner</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">by Amy Bearce</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn’t know which was more humiliating— watching all of the potential customers walk right past my table or seeing them line up at Julie’s table. I sat back and pretended I couldn’t care less, but the truth was I was hurt.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two weeks ago my teacher began class by announcing a new project. We had to create a product to sell to the community at the Business Day Fair in the gym. All the students in the class had to design and create something to sell. We also had to keep track of the costs of the product as well as the profit we made. Whoever made the most profit would win the Young Business Leader award.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately my mind began soaring. Perhaps I could make beautiful jewelry that everyone would pay a fortune for. Or maybe I could sew pajamas and sell those. Of course, I’d have to learn how to sew first. I imagined myself with hundreds of customers lined up at my table, my Young Business Leader trophy sitting next to me, shining in the beautiful sunlight. . . .</p>
        <p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night I shared my ideas with my mom. Smiling, she broke the news to me that using silver wire and beads as the raw material for my proposed jewelry project would be expensive. Moreover, the idea for pajamas was flawed because I already had a reputation as someone who couldn’t even sew a button on a shirt.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With cold water thrown on my first two ideas, I finally came up with a plan we both thought would work. I would create and sell decorative ceramic ornaments. I had been in a ceramics class all summer, so I knew that I could get plain ceramic ornaments and paint them. All I would have left to do would be to install a hook and—presto!</p>
        <p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next morning at school I ran up to Julie, my best friend, and said, “Hey, have you come up with an idea for Business Day?”</p>
        <p>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Yes,” she said, “but I’m not telling anyone what it is before the sale.”</p>
        <p>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I blinked and felt a pang in my stomach. Julie and I usually shared everything. Why was she being so cautious?</p>
        <p>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stiffly I replied, “Oh, well, I have an idea too,” and quickly walked away. I couldn’t believe that my best friend was keeping secrets from me.</p>

          <strong>Sweet Magnolia</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">by Virginia Kroll</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Let’s go see the bayou,” said Grandma, and we got into her boat. Soon we came to a different sounding place. We got out of the boat, and I hushed so I could hear it all—tiny tickings, gentle jigglings, ripplings, and rustlings—little life sounds all around.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Talk about trees!” I gasped, looking up. They were hunched over like bent giants. Moss was hanging in shaggy clumps from their branches like ragged curtains. “The bayou,” I whispered.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly I heard a tiny cheeping. There was some pain and fear in it. “Over there,” said Grandma, pointing.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ran, then stopped short, so I wouldn’t step on the struggling bird. Grandma carefully scooped it up. She shook her head.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Can you fix it, Grandma?”</p>
        <p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grandma warned me, “Sometimes nature doesn’t see things our way.” But she looked in my eyes, and we took the bird on home.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “What happened to it, Grandma?” I asked.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grandma examined the panting bird. “Hmm. Broken leg. I reckon she was too impatient, Denise. Burst right out of her nest ahead of schedule. Couldn’t wait to get on with the springtime.”</p>
        <p>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “What kind is she?” I asked.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp;&nbsp; “A painted bunting,” Grandma said.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp;&nbsp; She fed the bird with a tiny tube, then set the broken leg and taped it. I studied the soft feathers and fluffy markings.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grandma kept up the feedings day and night. I helped. The painted bunting grew bigger and more colorful and got its flight feathers. Pretty soon she was pecking seeds right out of my hand.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Don’t feed her from your hand all the time,” Grandma said, “or she won’t learn how to find seeds and insects on her own.”</p>
        <p>14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day she unwrapped the bunting’s leg, Grandma asked, “You gonna give this one a name? She’s yours. You found her, after all.”</p>
        <p>15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart skipped like a stone across a stream. Mine! Did Grandma mean it? Wait till Iona and Geneva saw the treasure I was bringing home!</p>
        <p>16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked at my bird. I thought about how she tried to fly too soon and how Grandma said she was impatient, just like the sweet magnolia flowers.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Sweet Magnolia!” I said. “That’s her name.”</p>
        <p>18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“My, my,” Grandma sighed. “You sure do have a way with words.” I felt proud.</p>
        <p>19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One morning after breakfast, Grandma said, “This is the big day. Come on.”</p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;I followed, wondering what was so special. She went to Sweet Magnolia’s cage and opened the door. Then she stopped. “You ought to do it, Denise. You found her, after all.”</p>
        <p>21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do what, Grandma?” I asked.</p>
        <p>22&nbsp; &nbsp;“Set her flying to the winds,” she answered.</p>
        <p>23&nbsp; &nbsp;“But Grandma, she’s MINE!” I shouted. “You even said so. She’s the treasure I’m taking home.”</p>
        <p>24&nbsp; &nbsp;Grandma half-smiled, half-frowned. “I’m sorry, Denise. Maybe you &nbsp;&nbsp;misunderstood. She’s yours to help . . . yours to heal . . . yours to set free.”</p>
        <p>25&nbsp; &nbsp; I put my hands on my hips and stamped my foot. “No.”</p>
        <p>26&nbsp; &nbsp;“You love her, don’t you?” Grandma said.</p>
        <p>27&nbsp; &nbsp;I thought for a moment. I gulped. I blinked hard. I opened the cage and slowly put my hand in.</p>

          <strong>Questions 31 – 35 are based on the passage that follows<br>
<em>Excerpt from “Mabel” by Emma Warburton</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There is, however, something still and holy in the early morning, when the sin and folly of nature has slept, or seemed to sleep, and life again awakes with fresh energy to labor. The dew from heaven has not fallen upon the herb alone, it seems to rest upon the spirit of man which rises full of renewed strength to that toil before which it sank heavily at eve; and as Captain Clair felt the breeze rising with its dewy incense to heaven, his mind seemed to receive fresh impetus, and his thoughts a higher tone. <span class="txt-underline">Languidly</span> as he pursued his way, his eye drank in the beauties of a new country, with all the fervour of a poetical imagination.</p>
        <p>On the right and left of the village, as he entered it, were high hills, covered with brushwood, a few cottages, with their simple gardens, lay in the hollow, and the church, standing nearly alone, was built a little above these, having the hill on the left immediately behind it. There was great beauty in that simple church, with that thickly covered hill above, and nothing near to disturb its solemnity.</p>
        <p>Further on, the hills opened, and gave a view of the whole country beyond, presenting a scene of loveliness very common in our fertile island. A small but beautiful river wound through the valley, carrying life and fertility along its banks. Wide spreading oaks and tall beeches, with the graceful birch and chestnut trees bending their lower branches nearly to the green turf beneath, enclosed the grounds of the Manor House, which, built on a gentle ascent, looked down on the peaceful valley below.</p>
        <p>The house, itself, was a fine old building, well suited to the habits of a country gentleman, though not so large as the gardens and plantation surrounding it, might have admitted. These had been gradually acquired by each successive owner of the mansion, who took pleasure in adding to the family estate by purchasing all property immediately adjoining, but had wisely refrained from patching and spoiling the house itself.</p>
