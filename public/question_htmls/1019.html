        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>A Glasshouse of Stars</strong>&nbsp;by Shirley Marr&nbsp;<br><br>
You have arrived for a better life at the New House in the New Land. It has been a long journey, the first time you’ve ever been on an aeroplane. It was nerve-racking when they checked the suitcases at the airport, even though your family has next to no possessions, let alone anything to hide. You didn’t know what big meant until you saw the city with the glass towers that touched the sky, the suburbs with houses so close together. You tell yourself everything is going to be fine. The hardest part is over. You made it.</p>
        <p>Ma Ma’s knuckles are white from grasping the yellow protective talisman with both hands. Ba Ba pretends superstitions are for ignorant people. He inserts the key into the door. He doesn’t turn the handle.</p>
        <p>The rag doll that Ma Ma made out of an old rice sack is clasped tightly in your arms – you are much too old for her any more, but she’s all you have. You stare up at the huge white columns propping up the crumbly tofu triangle of a roof. The long drop down to earth from the winding stone staircase you have climbed creates the same scary feeling in your stomach.</p>
        <p>You turn instinctively towards Ma Ma’s side as you used to do, to bury your face inside the folds of her dress. But now that she is huge with child, she has taken to gently nudging you away, so you pull back before she does.</p>
        <p>‘I didn’t expect it to be . . . a mansion,’ says Ma Ma.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Houses in the New Land are all supposed to be big. I have been warned,’ replies Ba Ba.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You stare up, disorientated. You don’t know if the house is truly too big or if it’s only big because you’re used to living in a cramped space.</p>
        <p>Long fingers of cactus reach all the way up to the second floor, covering the walls like hands on a face. Balanced on the roof at the very top is a third storey, a single room with a semicircular window like an open eye.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A light inside the window flickers on and then off again. A wink. No, it is just your imagination. But what a strange thing to imagine. You look over at your parents, but they don’t seem to have noticed.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The cold winter wind blows, an icy chill that none of you have ever felt before. The amber pane in the middle of the front door is frosted and blind. Ba Ba rattles at the handle, which appears to be stuck. Suddenly, it gives way and you all tumble into a musty darkness.</p>
        <p>It takes your eyes a while to adjust. Soon you realise you are staring at a world made completely out of dark brown wood and motes of dust that float past your nose like magic.</p>
        <p>Ba Ba turns the hallway light on and everything is a yellow glow. He takes the talisman off Ma Ma and sticks it outside, above the front doorframe, where the wind flaps it all about. You think the protection spell written on it is for babies, because magic is childish, but you are relieved all the same.</p>
        <p>Inside the house, on the brown brick wall facing the entrance, Ba Ba places an octagon with a piece of mirror in the middle called a bagua. To reflect bad luck away. Later, he will go outside, light incense sticks and thank First Uncle for your new home.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This is how things are. Like the bagua on the wall. Like the fact your parents seem much more relieved now that the bagua is up. Like the fact you have come to this New Land to start a new and better life. You don’t question it.</p>

You have arrived for a better life at the New House in the New Land. It has been a long journey, the first time you’ve ever been on an aeroplane.

You stare up at the huge white columns propping up the crumbly tofu triangle of a roof.

        <p><em>Read the poem below by E.H then answer the questions</em>.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>The Attic&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
There was a creaking in her attic,&nbsp;<br>
The kind that settles in your bones,&nbsp;<br>
Makes your heart flee when you have the thought,&nbsp;<br>
Of facing it alone.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Her mind made it an object,&nbsp;<br>
With each creak sending her numb,&nbsp;<br>
Like the noise possessed a pair of hands,&nbsp;<br>
Wrapped tight around each lung.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The world told her to fear it,&nbsp;<br>
“There’s nothing good in the unknown”,&nbsp;<br>
And she wandered if they’d ever faced&nbsp;<br>
The creaking on their own.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So she built herself a ladder&nbsp;<br>
From the thoughts that screamed to stop,&nbsp;<br>
And she climbed it to the darkness&nbsp;<br>
Waiting at the very top,&nbsp;<br>
There inside her attic,&nbsp;<br>
Prepared to fight it to the death.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Her fingers shook against the switch&nbsp;<br>
And fear gripped at her breath;&nbsp;<br>
As the light flickered above her&nbsp;<br>
Not a monster was in view,&nbsp;<br>
But a group of dreams she’d dare not have&nbsp;<br>
In fear they’d not come true.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The creaking in her attic&nbsp;<br>
Had been a plea unto her heart,&nbsp;<br>
A dare to face the unknown&nbsp;<br>
And release them from the dark.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Because you won’t encounter freedom&nbsp;<br>
If you give in to your fright.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Sometimes the bravest thing you’ll ever do&nbsp;<br>
Is just turn on the light.</p>

        <p>So she built herself a ladder&nbsp;<br>

        <p>Her fingers shook against the switch&nbsp;<br>

Not a monster was in view,&nbsp;<br>
But a group of dreams she’d dare not have&nbsp;<br>
In fear they’d not come true.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The creaking in her attic&nbsp;<br>

A dare to face the unknown&nbsp;<br>

If you give in to your fright.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Are Expensive Pillows Worth the Money?</strong><br><br>
Lumpy, bumpy, flat and smelly might not be Doc, Dopey or Bashful's distant cousins, but they may be adjectives used to describe an old, uncomfortable pillow, which can make you sleepy and grumpy. <strong>12 ………. </strong>But price isn’t necessarily a factor; a reasonably priced pillow may be just as comfortable as an expensive one.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Down to Feathers&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>In a 2012 blind study by "Consumer’s Report", participants preferred sleeping on a costlier down-filled pillow compared to a feather-filled pillow at about one-third the cost. If you’re shopping for the more expensive option, look for down-pillow buzzwords, such as “hypoallergenic”, “fill power” --- a fill power number of 600 is standard quality, while 800 or more means high quality, and “freshness assured” or “clean and dust-free”, as quality assurance. <strong>13 ……….</strong> But an inexpensive feather pillow slipped into a padded, protective pillow cover, or a down-alternative pillow offers a way to save some money, and possibly rest just as comfortably. <strong>14 ……….</strong> advises researchers at Harvard University, and may justify spending more money, if needed.<br>
<br>
<strong>Paying for Polyester&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>You could pay eight times the cost of an inexpensive polyester pillow for an expensive pillow, but, as the "Consumer's Report" study demonstrates, spending more money is likely going to mean getting better sleep. <strong>15 ……….</strong> If you sleep on your side, go for a thicker, firm pillow to fill in the space created by your shoulder.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Mind Your Memory Foam&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>The higher price of a memory-foam pillow may be highly overrated, the "Consumer's Report" study shows. Try an inexpensive memory-foam pillow, at around one-third the price of the costlier versions. <strong>16 ………. </strong>paying a bit more for a memory-foam pillow with a cooling-gel surface should help you rest easier.<br>
<br>
<strong>The Price of Longevity&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>Your old pillows need to be replaced --- possibly more often than you realise. You may have noticed that old pillows tend to “put on some weight” over the years. The added weight is the weight of skin cells, dust mites, fungus and mold that accumulate with time.<strong> 17 ………. </strong>Before washing any pillow, refer to the care label and washing instructions. Replace your pillow at least every other year, but sooner if it becomes lumpy, bumpy, flat or smelly.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Are Expensive Pillows Worth the Money?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Lumpy, bumpy, flat and smelly might not be Doc, Dopey or Bashful's distant cousins, but they may be adjectives used to describe an old, uncomfortable pillow, which can make you sleepy and grumpy.&nbsp;<strong>12</strong>&nbsp;……….&nbsp;But price isn’t necessarily a factor; a reasonably priced pillow may be just as comfortable as an expensive one.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Down to Feathers&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>In a 2012 blind study by "Consumer’s Report", participants preferred sleeping on a costlier down-filled pillow compared to a feather-filled pillow at about one-third the cost. If you’re shopping for the more expensive option, look for down-pillow buzzwords, such as “hypoallergenic”, “fill power” --- a fill power number of 600 is standard quality, while 800 or more means high quality, and “freshness assured” or “clean and dust-free”, as quality assurance.&nbsp;<strong>13</strong>&nbsp;……….&nbsp;But an inexpensive feather pillow slipped into a padded, protective pillow cover, or a down-alternative pillow offers a way to save some money, and possibly rest just as comfortably.&nbsp;<strong>14</strong>&nbsp;……….&nbsp;advises researchers at Harvard University, and may justify spending more money, if needed.<br>
<br>
<strong>Paying for Polyester&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>You could pay eight times the cost of an inexpensive polyester pillow for an expensive pillow, but, as the "Consumer's Report" study demonstrates, spending more money is likely going to mean getting better sleep.&nbsp;<strong>15</strong>&nbsp;……….&nbsp;If you sleep on your side, go for a thicker, firm pillow to fill in the space created by your shoulder.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Mind Your Memory Foam&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>The higher price of a memory-foam pillow may be highly overrated, the "Consumer's Report" study shows. Try an inexpensive memory-foam pillow, at around one-third the price of the costlier versions.&nbsp;<strong>16</strong>&nbsp;……….&nbsp;paying a bit more for a memory-foam pillow with a cooling-gel surface should help you rest easier.<br>
<br>
<strong>The Price of Longevity</strong>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Your old pillows need to be replaced --- possibly more often than you realise. You may have noticed that old pillows tend to “put on some weight” over the years. The added weight is the weight of skin cells, dust mites, fungus and mold that accumulate with time.&nbsp;<strong>17</strong>&nbsp;……….&nbsp;Before washing any pillow, refer to the care label and washing instructions. Replace your pillow at least every other year, but sooner if it becomes lumpy, bumpy, flat or smelly.</p>

          <em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p><br><strong>Are Expensive Pillows Worth the Money?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Lumpy, bumpy, flat and smelly might not be Doc, Dopey or Bashful's distant cousins, but they may be adjectives used to describe an old, uncomfortable pillow, which can make you sleepy and grumpy.&nbsp;<strong>12</strong>&nbsp;……….&nbsp;But price isn’t necessarily a factor; a reasonably priced pillow may be just as comfortable as an expensive one.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Down to Feathers&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>In a 2012 blind study by "Consumer’s Report", participants preferred sleeping on a costlier down-filled pillow compared to a feather-filled pillow at about one-third the cost. If you’re shopping for the more expensive option, look for down-pillow buzzwords, such as “hypoallergenic”, “fill power” --- a fill power number of 600 is standard quality, while 800 or more means high quality, and “freshness assured” or “clean and dust-free”, as quality assurance.&nbsp;<strong>13</strong>&nbsp;……….&nbsp;But an inexpensive feather pillow slipped into a padded, protective pillow cover, or a down-alternative pillow offers a way to save some money, and possibly rest just as comfortably.&nbsp;<strong>14</strong>&nbsp;……….&nbsp;advises researchers at Harvard University, and may justify spending more money, if needed.<br>
<br>
<strong>Paying for Polyester&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>You could pay eight times the cost of an inexpensive polyester pillow for an expensive pillow, but, as the "Consumer's Report" study demonstrates, spending more money is likely going to mean getting better sleep.&nbsp;<strong>15</strong>&nbsp;……….&nbsp;If you sleep on your side, go for a thicker, firm pillow to fill in the space created by your shoulder.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Mind Your Memory Foam&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>The higher price of a memory-foam pillow may be highly overrated, the "Consumer's Report" study shows. Try an inexpensive memory-foam pillow, at around one-third the price of the costlier versions.&nbsp;<strong>16</strong>&nbsp;……….&nbsp;paying a bit more for a memory-foam pillow with a cooling-gel surface should help you rest easier.<br>
<br>
<strong>The Price of Longevity&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>Your old pillows need to be replaced --- possibly more often than you realise. You may have noticed that old pillows tend to “put on some weight” over the years. The added weight is the weight of skin cells, dust mites, fungus and mold that accumulate with time.&nbsp;<strong>17</strong>&nbsp;……….&nbsp;Before washing any pillow, refer to the care label and washing instructions. Replace your pillow at least every other year, but sooner if it becomes lumpy, bumpy, flat or smelly.</p>

        <p>You could pay eight times the cost of an inexpensive polyester pillow for an expensive pillow, but, as the "Consumer's Report" study demonstrates, spending more money is likely going to mean getting better sleep.&nbsp;<strong>15&nbsp;</strong>……….&nbsp;If you sleep on your side, go for a thicker, firm pillow to fill in the space created by your shoulder.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Mind Your Memory Foam&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>The higher price of a memory-foam pillow may be highly overrated, the "Consumer's Report" study shows. Try an inexpensive memory-foam pillow, at around one-third the price of the costlier versions.&nbsp;<strong>16</strong>&nbsp;……….&nbsp;paying a bit more for a memory-foam pillow with a cooling-gel surface should help you rest easier.<br>
<br>
<strong>The Price of Longevity&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>Your old pillows need to be replaced --- possibly more often than you realise. You may have noticed that old pillows tend to “put on some weight” over the years. The added weight is the weight of skin cells, dust mites, fungus and mold that accumulate with time.&nbsp;<strong>17</strong>&nbsp;……….&nbsp;Before washing any pillow, refer to the care label and washing instructions. Replace your pillow at least every other year, but sooner if it becomes lumpy, bumpy, flat or smelly.</p>

A leader’s ability to plan meticulously is important, despite Moltke’s dictum that few plans last beyond the initial contact with the enemy. “Plans are worthless,” agreed Eisenhower. “Planning is everything.” It is often forgotten that one of the most successful war plans in modern history—Hitler’s blitzkrieg against the West that succeeded in knocking out France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Holland in six weeks in May and June 1940—was not the original one. When the first set of plans fell into Allied hands by accident only days before the assault was due to be launched, Erich von Manstein drew up a new one. It was this plan B that featured the famous sickle-cut maneuver, in which concentrated armor cut the Allies off from their supply bases, the Maginot Line was skirted, the mountainous Ardennes forest—hitherto thought impassable—was used as a conduit, and the Germans broke through at Sedan in six days and reached the Channel coast at Abbeville in only ten.<br>
<br>
{^<strong> Extract B</strong> ^}<br>
For planning in particular and for leadership in general a good memory is useful, or failing that an excellent filing system. Churchill had a photographic memory, and not just for music-hall songs and Shakespeare. He would spend up to thirty hours memorising his speeches and constantly practice them to make them word perfect, and would even make up ones he was not about to give but might be called upon to deliver sometime in the future. On occasion he would regale his entourage with speeches he would have given if he had been in the House of Commons at different periods of history. For a superb filing system one could hardly do better than Napoleon, who also had an excellent memory and who used his chief of staff, Marshal Berthier, to ensure that even in a carriage rattling along at full pace they were able to place geographically every unit in his army and send and receive messages as aides-de-camps rode up to the windows, grasp orders thrust through the windows, and rode off again to deliver them.<br>
<br>
{^ <strong>Extract C</strong> ^}<br>
“The reasonable man adapts himself to the world,” wrote George Bernard Shaw in Man and Superman, “the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.” A talent for well-timed unreasonableness is another attribute of the great leader. Queen Elizabeth I refused to name her successor despite continuous prompting from her Privy Council, thus protecting her country from the danger of civil war. She also refused to ratify the Treaty of Edinburgh early in her reign, despite the pleadings of her closest counsellor Lord Burghley, until the threat posed by the dukes of Guise had finally diminished. Elizabeth I had many of the attributes of a great war leader, in her oratory, in her determination and as a fine picker of men.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D&nbsp;</strong>^}<br>
Understanding the psychology of others is an important part of leadership. Today, it seems to be assumed that in order to lead one’s people one needs to have sprung from them, but that is not the case. Many of those who have exuded leadership ability hail from the leisured or moneyed class of their countries—Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Napoleon, Churchill, both Roosevelts, and John F. Kennedy among a long list of them—yet they all had a strong sense of what motivated soldiers and citizens who hailed from backgrounds far further down the social scale. A capacity to empathize is far more important than one’s class background. Churchill was born in a palace, the grandson of a duke, went to one of the top schools in the country and never took a bus in his life, but he could speak directly to the needs of what he called the cottage home. When commanding in the trenches of the Great War, he put his earlier campaigning experience to good use in always trying to ensure the men had their creature comforts, such as beer, fresh bread, and a good postal service to connect them with their families.<br>

            <p>Understanding the psychology of others is an important part of leadership. Today, it seems to be assumed that in order to lead one’s people one needs to have sprung from them, but that is not the case. Many of those who have exuded leadership ability hail from the leisured or moneyed class of their countries—Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Napoleon, Churchill, both Roosevelts, and John F. Kennedy among a long list of them— yet they all had a strong sense of what motivated soldiers and citizens who hailed from backgrounds far further down the social scale. A capacity to empathize is far more important than one’s class background. Churchill was born in a palace, the grandson of a duke, went to one of the top schools in the country and never took a bus in his life, but he could speak directly to the needs of what he called the cottage home. When commanding in the trenches of the Great War, he put his earlier campaigning experience to good use in always trying to ensure the men had their creature comforts, such as beer, fresh bread, and a good postal service to connect them with their families.</p>

            <p>A leader’s ability to plan meticulously is important, despite Moltke’s dictum that few plans last beyond the initial contact with the enemy. “Plans are worthless,” agreed Eisenhower. “Planning is everything.” It is often forgotten that one of the most successful war plans in modern history—Hitler’s blitzkrieg against the West that succeeded in knocking out France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Holland in six weeks in May and June 1940—was not the original one. When the first set of plans fell into Allied hands by accident only days before the assault was due to be launched, Erich von Manstein drew up a new one. It was this plan B that featured the famous sickle-cut maneuver, in which concentrated armor cut the Allies off from their supply bases, the Maginot Line was skirted, the mountainous Ardennes forest—hitherto thought impassable—was used as a conduit, and the Germans broke through at Sedan in six days and reached the Channel coast at Abbeville in only ten.</p>

            <p>For planning in particular and for leadership in general a good memory is useful, or failing that an excellent filing system. Churchill had a photographic memory, and not just for music-hall songs and Shakespeare. He would spend up to thirty hours memorising his speeches and constantly practice them to make them word perfect, and would even make up ones he was not about to give but might be called upon to deliver sometime in the future. On occasion he would regale his entourage with speeches he would have given if he had been in the House of Commons at different periods of history. For a superb filing system one could hardly do better than Napoleon, who also had an excellent memory and who used his chief of staff, Marshal Berthier, to ensure that even in a carriage rattling along at full pace they were able to place geographically every unit in his army and send and receive messages as aides-de-camps rode up to the windows, grasp orders thrust through the windows, and rode off again to deliver them.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>“The reasonable man adapts himself to the world,” wrote George Bernard Shaw in Man and Superman, “the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself.

She also refused to ratify the Treaty of Edinburgh early in her reign, despite the pleadings of her closest counsellor Lord Burghley, until the threat posed by the dukes of Guise had finally diminished. Elizabeth I had many of the attributes of a great war leader, in her oratory, in her determination and as a fine picker of men.</p>

            <p>A leader’s ability to plan meticulously is important, despite Moltke’s dictum that few plans last beyond the initial contact with the enemy. “Plans are worthless,” agreed Eisenhower. “Planning is everything.” It is often forgotten that one of the most successful war plans in modern history—Hitler’s blitzkrieg against the West that succeeded in knocking out France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Holland in six weeks in May and June 1940—was not the original one. When the first set of plans fell into Allied hands by accident only days before the assault was due to be launched, Erich von Manstein drew up a new one. It was this plan B that featured the famous sickle-cut maneuver, in which concentrated armor cut the Allies off from their supply bases, the Maginot Line was skirted, the mountainous Ardennes forest—hitherto thought impassable—was used as a conduit, and the Germans broke through at Sedan in six days and reached the Channel coast at Abbeville in only ten.</p>

            <p>For planning in particular and for leadership in general a good memory is useful, or failing that an excellent filing system. Churchill had a photographic memory, and not just for music-hall songs and Shakespeare. He would spend up to thirty hours memorising his speeches and constantly practice them to make them word perfect, and would even make up ones he was not about to give but might be called upon to deliver sometime in the future. On occasion he would regale his entourage with speeches he would have given if he had been in the House of Commons at different periods of history. For a superb filing system one could hardly do better than Napoleon, who also had an excellent memory and who used his chief of staff, Marshal Berthier, to ensure that even in a carriage rattling along at full pace they were able to place geographically every unit in his army and send and receive messages as aides-de-camps rode up to the windows, grasp orders thrust through the windows, and rode off again to deliver them.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>“The reasonable man adapts himself to the world,” wrote George Bernard Shaw in Man and Superman, “the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.” A talent for well-timed unreasonableness is another attribute of the great leader. Queen Elizabeth I refused to name her successor despite continuous prompting from her Privy Council, thus protecting her country from the danger of civil war. She also refused to ratify the Treaty of Edinburgh early in her reign, despite the pleadings of her closest counsellor Lord Burghley, until the threat posed by the dukes of Guise had finally diminished. Elizabeth I had many of the attributes of a great war leader, in her oratory, in her determination and as a fine picker of men.</p>

            <p>Understanding the psychology of others is an important part of leadership. Today, it seems to be assumed that in order to lead one’s people one needs to have sprung from them, but that is not the case. Many of those who have exuded leadership ability hail from the leisured or moneyed class of their countries—Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Napoleon, Churchill, both Roosevelts, and John F. Kennedy among a long list of them— yet they all had a strong sense of what motivated soldiers and citizens who hailed from backgrounds far further down the social scale. A capacity to empathize is far more important than one’s class background. Churchill was born in a palace, the grandson of a duke, went to one of the top schools in the country and never took a bus in his life, but he could speak directly to the needs of what he called the cottage home. When commanding in the trenches of the Great War, he put his earlier campaigning experience to good use in always trying to ensure the men had their creature comforts, such as beer, fresh bread, and a good postal service to connect them with their families.</p>

            <p>For planning in particular and for leadership in general a good memory is useful, or failing that an excellent filing system. Churchill had a photographic memory, and not just for music-hall songs and Shakespeare. He would spend up to thirty hours memorising his speeches and constantly practice them to make them word perfect, and would even make up ones he was not about to give but might be called upon to deliver sometime in the future. On occasion he would regale his entourage with speeches he would have given if he had been in the House of Commons at different periods of history. For a superb filing system one could hardly do better than Napoleon, who also had an excellent memory and who used his chief of staff, Marshal Berthier, to ensure that even in a carriage rattling along at full pace they were able to place geographically every unit in his army and send and receive messages as aides-de-camps rode up to the windows, grasp orders thrust through the windows, and rode off again to deliver them.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>“The reasonable man adapts himself to the world,” wrote George Bernard Shaw in Man and Superman, “the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.” A talent for well-timed unreasonableness is another attribute of the great leader. Queen Elizabeth I refused to name her successor despite continuous prompting from her Privy Council, thus protecting her country from the danger of civil war. She also refused to ratify the Treaty of Edinburgh early in her reign, despite the pleadings of her closest counsellor Lord Burghley, until the threat posed by the dukes of Guise had finally diminished. Elizabeth I had many of the attributes of a great war leader, in her oratory, in her determination and as a fine picker of men.</p>

            <p>Understanding the psychology of others is an important part of leadership. Today, it seems to be assumed that in order to lead one’s people one needs to have sprung from them, but that is not the case. Many of those who have exuded leadership ability hail from the leisured or moneyed class of their countries—Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Napoleon, Churchill, both Roosevelts, and John F. Kennedy among a long list of them— yet they all had a strong sense of what motivated soldiers and citizens who hailed from backgrounds far further down the social scale. A capacity to empathize is far more important than one’s class background. Churchill was born in a palace, the grandson of a duke, went to one of the top schools in the country and never took a bus in his life, but he could speak directly to the needs of what he called the cottage home. When commanding in the trenches of the Great War, he put his earlier campaigning experience to good use in always trying to ensure the men had their creature comforts, such as beer, fresh bread, and a good postal service to connect them with their families.</p>

            <p>A leader’s ability to plan meticulously is important, despite Moltke’s dictum that few plans last beyond the initial contact with the enemy. “Plans are worthless,” agreed Eisenhower. “Planning is everything.” It is often forgotten that one of the most successful war plans in modern history—Hitler’s blitzkrieg against the West that succeeded in knocking out France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Holland in six weeks in May and June 1940—was not the original one. When the first set of plans fell into Allied hands by accident only days before the assault was due to be launched, Erich von Manstein drew up a new one. It was this plan B that featured the famous sickle-cut maneuver, in which concentrated armor cut the Allies off from their supply bases, the Maginot Line was skirted, the mountainous Ardennes forest—hitherto thought impassable—was used as a conduit, and the Germans broke through at Sedan in six days and reached the Channel coast at Abbeville in only ten.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>A Glasshouse of Stars&nbsp;</strong><em>by Shirley Marr&nbsp;</em><br><br>
You have arrived for a better life at the New House in the New Land. It has been a long journey, the first time you’ve ever been on an aeroplane. It was nerve-racking when they checked the suitcases at the airport, even though your family has next to no possessions, let alone anything to hide. You didn’t know what big meant until you saw the city with the glass towers that touched the sky, the suburbs with houses so close together. You tell yourself everything is going to be fine. The hardest part is over. You made it.</p>
        <p>Ma Ma’s knuckles are white from grasping the yellow protective talisman with both hands. Ba Ba pretends superstitions are for ignorant people. He inserts the key into the door. He doesn’t turn the handle.</p>
        <p>The rag doll that Ma Ma made out of an old rice sack is clasped tightly in your arms – you are much too old for her any more, but she’s all you have. You stare up at the huge white columns propping up the crumbly tofu triangle of a roof. The long drop down to earth from the winding stone staircase you have climbed creates the same scary feeling in your stomach.</p>
        <p>You turn instinctively towards Ma Ma’s side as you used to do, to bury your face inside the folds of her dress. But now that she is huge with child, she has taken to gently nudging you away, so you pull back before she does.</p>
        <p>‘I didn’t expect it to be . . . a mansion,’ says Ma Ma.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Houses in the New Land are all supposed to be big. I have been warned,’ replies Ba Ba.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You stare up, disorientated. You don’t know if the house is truly too big or if it’s only big because you’re used to living in a cramped space.</p>
        <p>Long fingers of cactus reach all the way up to the second floor, covering the walls like hands on a face. Balanced on the roof at the very top is a third storey, a single room with a semicircular window like an open eye.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A light inside the window flickers on and then off again. A wink. No, it is just your imagination. But what a strange thing to imagine. You look over at your parents, but they don’t seem to have noticed.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The cold winter wind blows, an icy chill that none of you have ever felt before. The amber pane in the middle of the front door is frosted and blind. Ba Ba rattles at the handle, which appears to be stuck. Suddenly, it gives way and you all tumble into a musty darkness.</p>
        <p>It takes your eyes a while to adjust. Soon you realise you are staring at a world made completely out of dark brown wood and motes of dust that float past your nose like magic.</p>
        <p>Ba Ba turns the hallway light on and everything is a yellow glow. He takes the talisman off Ma Ma and sticks it outside, above the front doorframe, where the wind flaps it all about. You think the protection spell written on it is for babies, because magic is childish, but you are relieved all the same.</p>
        <p>Inside the house, on the brown brick wall facing the entrance, Ba Ba places an octagon with a piece of mirror in the middle called a bagua. To reflect bad luck away. Later, he will go outside, light incense sticks and thank First Uncle for your new home.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This is how things are. Like the bagua on the wall. Like the fact your parents seem much more relieved now that the bagua is up. Like the fact you have come to this New Land to start a new and better life. You don’t question it.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>A Glasshouse of Stars</strong>&nbsp;by Shirley Marr&nbsp;<br><br>
You have arrived for a better life at the New House in the New Land. It has been a long journey, the first time you’ve ever been on an aeroplane. It was nerve-racking when they checked the suitcases at the airport, even though your family has next to no possessions, let alone anything to hide. You didn’t know what big meant until you saw the city with the glass towers that touched the sky, the suburbs with houses so close together. You tell yourself everything is going to be fine. The hardest part is over. You made it.</p>
        <p>Ma Ma’s knuckles are white from grasping the yellow protective talisman with both hands. Ba Ba pretends superstitions are for ignorant people. He inserts the key into the door. He doesn’t turn the handle.</p>
        <p>The rag doll that Ma Ma made out of an old rice sack is clasped tightly in your arms – you are much too old for her any more, but she’s all you have. You stare up at the huge white columns propping up the crumbly tofu triangle of a roof. The long drop down to earth from the winding stone staircase you have climbed creates the same scary feeling in your stomach.</p>
        <p>You turn instinctively towards Ma Ma’s side as you used to do, to bury your face inside the folds of her dress. But now that she is huge with child, she has taken to gently nudging you away, so you pull back before she does.</p>
        <p>‘I didn’t expect it to be . . . a mansion,’ says Ma Ma.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Houses in the New Land are all supposed to be big. I have been warned,’ replies Ba Ba.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You stare up, disorientated. You don’t know if the house is truly too big or if it’s only big because you’re used to living in a cramped space.</p>
        <p>Long fingers of cactus reach all the way up to the second floor, covering the walls like hands on a face. Balanced on the roof at the very top is a third storey, a single room with a semicircular window like an open eye.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A light inside the window flickers on and then off again. A wink. No, it is just your imagination. But what a strange thing to imagine. You look over at your parents, but they don’t seem to have noticed.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The cold winter wind blows, an icy chill that none of you have ever felt before. The amber pane in the middle of the front door is frosted and blind. Ba Ba rattles at the handle, which appears to be stuck. Suddenly, it gives way and you all tumble into a musty darkness.</p>
        <p>It takes your eyes a while to adjust. Soon you realise you are staring at a world made completely out of dark brown wood and motes of dust that float past your nose like magic.</p>
        <p>Ba Ba turns the hallway light on and everything is a yellow glow. He takes the talisman off Ma Ma and sticks it outside, above the front doorframe, where the wind flaps it all about. You think the protection spell written on it is for babies, because magic is childish, but you are relieved all the same.</p>
        <p>Inside the house, on the brown brick wall facing the entrance, Ba Ba places an octagon with a piece of mirror in the middle called a bagua. To reflect bad luck away. Later, he will go outside, light incense sticks and thank First Uncle for your new home.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This is how things are. Like the bagua on the wall. Like the fact your parents seem much more relieved now that the bagua is up. Like the fact you have come to this New Land to start a new and better life. You don’t question it.</p>

        <p>You turn instinctively towards Ma Ma’s side as you used to do, to bury your face inside the folds of her dress. But now that she is huge with child, she has taken to gently nudging you away, so you pull back before she does.</p>
        <p>‘I didn’t expect it to be . . . a mansion,’ says Ma Ma.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Houses in the New Land are all supposed to be big. I have been warned,’ replies Ba Ba.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You stare up, disorientated. You don’t know if the house is truly too big or if it’s only big because you’re used to living in a cramped space.</p>
        <p>Long fingers of cactus reach all the way up to the second floor, covering the walls like hands on a face. Balanced on the roof at the very top is a third storey, a single room with a semicircular window like an open eye.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A light inside the window flickers on and then off again. A wink. No, it is just your imagination. But what a strange thing to imagine. You look over at your parents, but they don’t seem to have noticed.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The cold winter wind blows, an icy chill that none of you have ever felt before. The amber pane in the middle of the front door is frosted and blind. Ba Ba rattles at the handle, which appears to be stuck. Suddenly, it gives way and you all tumble into a musty darkness.</p>
        <p>It takes your eyes a while to adjust. Soon you realise you are staring at a world made completely out of dark brown wood and motes of dust that float past your nose like magic.</p>
        <p>Ba Ba turns the hallway light on and everything is a yellow glow. He takes the talisman off Ma Ma and sticks it outside, above the front doorframe, where the wind flaps it all about. You think the protection spell written on it is for babies, because magic is childish, but you are relieved all the same.</p>
        <p>Inside the house, on the brown brick wall facing the entrance, Ba Ba places an octagon with a piece of mirror in the middle called a bagua. To reflect bad luck away. Later, he will go outside, light incense sticks and thank First Uncle for your new home.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This is how things are. Like the bagua on the wall. Like the fact your parents seem much more relieved now that the bagua is up. Like the fact you have come to this New Land to start a new and better life. You don’t question it.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>A Glasshouse of Stars</strong>&nbsp;by Shirley Marr&nbsp;<br><br>
You have arrived for a better life at the New House in the New Land. It has been a long journey, the first time you’ve ever been on an aeroplane. It was nerve-racking when they checked the suitcases at the airport, even though your family has next to no possessions, let alone anything to hide. You didn’t know what big meant until you saw the city with the glass towers that touched the sky, the suburbs with houses so close together. You tell yourself everything is going to be fine. The hardest part is over. You made it.</p>
        <p>Ma Ma’s knuckles are white from grasping the yellow protective talisman with both hands. Ba Ba pretends superstitions are for ignorant people. He inserts the key into the door. He doesn’t turn the handle.</p>
        <p>The rag doll that Ma Ma made out of an old rice sack is clasped tightly in your arms – you are much too old for her any more, but she’s all you have. You stare up at the huge white columns propping up the crumbly tofu triangle of a roof. The long drop down to earth from the winding stone staircase you have climbed creates the same scary feeling in your stomach.</p>
        <p>You turn instinctively towards Ma Ma’s side as you used to do, to bury your face inside the folds of her dress. But now that she is huge with child, she has taken to gently nudging you away, so you pull back before she does.</p>
        <p>‘I didn’t expect it to be . . . a mansion,’ says Ma Ma.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Houses in the New Land are all supposed to be big. I have been warned,’ replies Ba Ba.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You stare up, disorientated. You don’t know if the house is truly too big or if it’s only big because you’re used to living in a cramped space.</p>
        <p>Long fingers of cactus reach all the way up to the second floor, covering the walls like hands on a face. Balanced on the roof at the very top is a third storey, a single room with a semicircular window like an open eye.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A light inside the window flickers on and then off again. A wink. No, it is just your imagination. But what a strange thing to imagine. You look over at your parents, but they don’t seem to have noticed.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The cold winter wind blows, an icy chill that none of you have ever felt before. The amber pane in the middle of the front door is frosted and blind. Ba Ba rattles at the handle, which appears to be stuck. Suddenly, it gives way and you all tumble into a musty darkness.</p>
        <p>It takes your eyes a while to adjust. Soon you realise you are staring at a world made completely out of dark brown wood and motes of dust that float past your nose like magic.</p>
        <p>Ba Ba turns the hallway light on and everything is a yellow glow. He takes the talisman off Ma Ma and sticks it outside, above the front doorframe, where the wind flaps it all about. You think the protection spell written on it is for babies, because magic is childish, but you are relieved all the same.</p>
        <p>Inside the house, on the brown brick wall facing the entrance, Ba Ba places an octagon with a piece of mirror in the middle called a bagua. To reflect bad luck away. Later, he will go outside, light incense sticks and thank First Uncle for your new home.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This is how things are. Like the bagua on the wall. Like the fact your parents seem much more relieved now that the bagua is up. Like the fact you have come to this New Land to start a new and better life. You don’t question it.</p>

        <p><em>Read the poem below by E.H then answer the questions</em>.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>The Attic&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
There was a creaking in her attic,&nbsp;<br>
The kind that settles in your bones,&nbsp;<br>
Makes your heart flee when you have the thought,&nbsp;<br>
Of facing it alone.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Her mind made it an object,&nbsp;<br>
With each creak sending her numb,&nbsp;<br>
Like the noise possessed a pair of hands,&nbsp;<br>
Wrapped tight around each lung.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The world told her to fear it,&nbsp;<br>
“There’s nothing good in the unknown”,&nbsp;<br>
And she wandered if they’d ever faced&nbsp;<br>
The creaking on their own.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So she built herself a ladder&nbsp;<br>
From the thoughts that screamed to stop,&nbsp;<br>
And she climbed it to the darkness&nbsp;<br>
Waiting at the very top,&nbsp;<br>
There inside her attic,&nbsp;<br>
Prepared to fight it to the death.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Her fingers shook against the switch&nbsp;<br>
And fear gripped at her breath;&nbsp;<br>
As the light flickered above her&nbsp;<br>
Not a monster was in view,&nbsp;<br>
But a group of dreams she’d dare not have&nbsp;<br>
In fear they’d not come true.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The creaking in her attic&nbsp;<br>
Had been a plea unto her heart,&nbsp;<br>
A dare to face the unknown&nbsp;<br>
And release them from the dark.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Because you won’t encounter freedom&nbsp;<br>
If you give in to your fright.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Sometimes the bravest thing you’ll ever do&nbsp;<br>
Is just turn on the light.</p>
