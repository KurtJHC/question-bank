          <strong>Film vs Digital – A Photo Comparison&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Film is the golden standard of photography. Nothing compares – not even digital. A good example of this is when a film company like Fujifilm tries to match film’s beautiful colour consistency. Such an ‘advancement’ in technology is nothing more than a marketing gimmick. Film is manufactured in various formats to suit a variety of cameras. <strong>31 ……….</strong> More specifically, when the film stock is larger, so is the photon count on the film stock’s surface.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One of the key elements of film photography is the creative control offered throughout the processing and editing stages. Rather than being a bulk-edit workflow as experienced in digital, there is a staged process involved with film. It is a process that is both enjoyable and challenging but still one that you have full control over. One of the biggest advantages of film editing is the greater level of light management within the darkroom environment. <strong>32 ……….</strong> Digital files can be impossible to recover from such issues.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>While it is convenient that digital editing can be done in-camera or on a digital device, it is often done on the go. There is fulfillment and enjoyment in our busy world to be gained in slowing down and working within a darkroom lab. Alternatively, many are now taking the time to work on high-resolution scans from film photography outings. <strong>33 ………. </strong>Those in the digital world live in constant fear of computer crashes, hard drive failures, or even memory card corruption. There is nothing worse than a memory card read error while in the field or while trying to import images onto a computer.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Like it or not, the costs involved in photography’s creative pursuit are a key consideration for many people. Both film and digital have unique cost considerations worth exploring – however, film photography has a gentler approach with a lower financial burden. With film, your up-front costs are far less as film cameras’ price is significantly lower than that of a modern DSLR or mirrorless kit. <strong>34 ………. </strong>Plus, you are shackled with the other drawbacks of being locked into the digital medium.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Film photography spreads its costs out throughout your life as a photographer. Aside from the camera, the ongoing cost of film is a low-cost element – buying in bulk is always a smart choice as you are more likely to get out and shoot with a bag full of film. Plus, you save a little on each roll with a bulk lot.<strong> 35 ……….</strong> A popular solution is to manage lab costs by opting for digital scans of your film. These scans are of the highest quality and retain all the quality and detail of your original shots. Plus, you now have full creative control of which direction you want to head and how much you want to spend.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You can now take your digital scans and edit them further with your preferred editing software – or not at all. <strong>36 ………. </strong>And, if you are so inclined, you can, of course, share your work on your site, blog, or via social media platforms. Either way, it is evident that you will invest much less with film throughout your photography life than you would through digital. Film cameras last lifetimes while digital-only last as long as their circuits hold-up.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Film vs Digital – A Photo Comparison&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Film is the golden standard of photography. Nothing compares – not even digital. A good example of this is when a film company like Fujifilm tries to match film’s beautiful colour consistency. Such an ‘advancement’ in technology is nothing more than a marketing gimmick. Film is manufactured in various formats to suit a variety of cameras. <strong>31 ……….</strong> More specifically, when the film stock is larger, so is the photon count on the film stock’s surface.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One of the key elements of film photography is the creative control offered throughout the processing and editing stages. Rather than being a bulk-edit workflow as experienced in digital, there is a staged process involved with film. It is a process that is both enjoyable and challenging but still one that you have full control over. One of the biggest advantages of film editing is the greater level of light management within the darkroom environment. <strong>32 ……….</strong> Digital files can be impossible to recover from such issues.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>While it is convenient that digital editing can be done in-camera or on a digital device, it is often done on the go. There is fulfillment and enjoyment in our busy world to be gained in slowing down and working within a darkroom lab. Alternatively, many are now taking the time to work on high-resolution scans from film photography outings. <strong>33 ………. </strong>Those in the digital world live in constant fear of computer crashes, hard drive failures, or even memory card corruption. There is nothing worse than a memory card read error while in the field or while trying to import images onto a computer.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Like it or not, the costs involved in photography’s creative pursuit are a key consideration for many people. Both film and digital have unique cost considerations worth exploring – however, film photography has a gentler approach with a lower financial burden. With film, your up-front costs are far less as film cameras’ price is significantly lower than that of a modern DSLR or mirrorless kit. <strong>34 ………. </strong>Plus, you are shackled with the other drawbacks of being locked into the digital medium.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Film photography spreads its costs out throughout your life as a photographer. Aside from the camera, the ongoing cost of film is a low-cost element – buying in bulk is always a smart choice as you are more likely to get out and shoot with a bag full of film. Plus, you save a little on each roll with a bulk lot.<strong> 35 ……….</strong> A popular solution is to manage lab costs by opting for digital scans of your film. These scans are of the highest quality and retain all the quality and detail of your original shots. Plus, you now have full creative control of which direction you want to head and how much you want to spend.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You can now take your digital scans and edit them further with your preferred editing software – or not at all. <strong>36 ………. </strong>And, if you are so inclined, you can, of course, share your work on your site, blog, or via social media platforms. Either way, it is evident that you will invest much less with film throughout your photography life than you would through digital. Film cameras last lifetimes while digital-only last as long as their circuits hold-up.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Film vs Digital – A Photo Comparison&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Film is the golden standard of photography. Nothing compares – not even digital. A good example of this is when a film company like Fujifilm tries to match film’s beautiful colour consistency. Such an ‘advancement’ in technology is nothing more than a marketing gimmick. Film is manufactured in various formats to suit a variety of cameras. <strong>31 ……….</strong> More specifically, when the film stock is larger, so is the photon count on the film stock’s surface.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One of the key elements of film photography is the creative control offered throughout the processing and editing stages. Rather than being a bulk-edit workflow as experienced in digital, there is a staged process involved with film. It is a process that is both enjoyable and challenging but still one that you have full control over. One of the biggest advantages of film editing is the greater level of light management within the darkroom environment. <strong>32 ……….</strong> Digital files can be impossible to recover from such issues.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>While it is convenient that digital editing can be done in-camera or on a digital device, it is often done on the go. There is fulfillment and enjoyment in our busy world to be gained in slowing down and working within a darkroom lab. Alternatively, many are now taking the time to work on high-resolution scans from film photography outings. <strong>33 ………. </strong>Those in the digital world live in constant fear of computer crashes, hard drive failures, or even memory card corruption. There is nothing worse than a memory card read error while in the field or while trying to import images onto a computer.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Like it or not, the costs involved in photography’s creative pursuit are a key consideration for many people. Both film and digital have unique cost considerations worth exploring – however, film photography has a gentler approach with a lower financial burden. With film, your up-front costs are far less as film cameras’ price is significantly lower than that of a modern DSLR or mirrorless kit. <strong>34 ………. </strong>Plus, you are shackled with the other drawbacks of being locked into the digital medium.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Film photography spreads its costs out throughout your life as a photographer. Aside from the camera, the ongoing cost of film is a low-cost element – buying in bulk is always a smart choice as you are more likely to get out and shoot with a bag full of film. Plus, you save a little on each roll with a bulk lot.<strong> 35 ……….</strong> A popular solution is to manage lab costs by opting for digital scans of your film. These scans are of the highest quality and retain all the quality and detail of your original shots. Plus, you now have full creative control of which direction you want to head and how much you want to spend.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You can now take your digital scans and edit them further with your preferred editing software – or not at all. <strong>36 ………. </strong>And, if you are so inclined, you can, of course, share your work on your site, blog, or via social media platforms. Either way, it is evident that you will invest much less with film throughout your photography life than you would through digital. Film cameras last lifetimes while digital-only last as long as their circuits hold-up.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Film vs Digital – A Photo Comparison&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Film is the golden standard of photography. Nothing compares – not even digital. A good example of this is when a film company like Fujifilm tries to match film’s beautiful colour consistency. Such an ‘advancement’ in technology is nothing more than a marketing gimmick. Film is manufactured in various formats to suit a variety of cameras. <strong>31 ……….</strong> More specifically, when the film stock is larger, so is the photon count on the film stock’s surface.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One of the key elements of film photography is the creative control offered throughout the processing and editing stages. Rather than being a bulk-edit workflow as experienced in digital, there is a staged process involved with film. It is a process that is both enjoyable and challenging but still one that you have full control over. One of the biggest advantages of film editing is the greater level of light management within the darkroom environment. <strong>32 ……….</strong> Digital files can be impossible to recover from such issues.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>While it is convenient that digital editing can be done in-camera or on a digital device, it is often done on the go. There is fulfillment and enjoyment in our busy world to be gained in slowing down and working within a darkroom lab. Alternatively, many are now taking the time to work on high-resolution scans from film photography outings. <strong>33 ………. </strong>Those in the digital world live in constant fear of computer crashes, hard drive failures, or even memory card corruption. There is nothing worse than a memory card read error while in the field or while trying to import images onto a computer.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Like it or not, the costs involved in photography’s creative pursuit are a key consideration for many people. Both film and digital have unique cost considerations worth exploring – however, film photography has a gentler approach with a lower financial burden. With film, your up-front costs are far less as film cameras’ price is significantly lower than that of a modern DSLR or mirrorless kit. <strong>34 ………. </strong>Plus, you are shackled with the other drawbacks of being locked into the digital medium.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Film photography spreads its costs out throughout your life as a photographer. Aside from the camera, the ongoing cost of film is a low-cost element – buying in bulk is always a smart choice as you are more likely to get out and shoot with a bag full of film. Plus, you save a little on each roll with a bulk lot.<strong> 35 ……….</strong> A popular solution is to manage lab costs by opting for digital scans of your film. These scans are of the highest quality and retain all the quality and detail of your original shots. Plus, you now have full creative control of which direction you want to head and how much you want to spend.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You can now take your digital scans and edit them further with your preferred editing software – or not at all. <strong>36 ………. </strong>And, if you are so inclined, you can, of course, share your work on your site, blog, or via social media platforms. Either way, it is evident that you will invest much less with film throughout your photography life than you would through digital. Film cameras last lifetimes while digital-only last as long as their circuits hold-up.&nbsp;</p>

  There is a pattern that has puzzled mathematicians for years.<br>
This pattern is called “3x + 1”. You can start with any positive number you like and follow the rule. The theory is that no matter what number you start with, it will always, eventually, end in 1.<br>
<br>
There are four examples below starting with 24, 17, 7 and 6.&nbsp;<br>

  Currently, the final English exam is open book, meaning that students can bring in their books and refer to them during the exam to help them answer the questions. English teacher, Mr Goodes believes that students are only scoring well because they have the answers to the questions right in front of them in their books. Mr Goodes wants to change the exam from open book to closed book.<br>
