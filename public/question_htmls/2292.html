<br>
<strong>Horse</strong>, <em>(Equus caballus)</em>, a hoofed herbivorous mammal of the family Equidae. It comprises a single species, <em>Equus caballus</em>, whose numerous varieties are called breeds. Before the advent of mechanised vehicles, the horse was widely used as a draft animal, and riding on horseback was one of the chief means of transportation.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
In prehistoric times the wild horse was probably first hunted for food. Research suggests that domestication had taken place by approximately 6,000 years ago. It is supposed that the horse was first used by a tribe of Indo-European origin that lived in the steppes north of the chain of mountains adjacent to the Black and Caspian seas. Influenced by climate, food, and humans, the horse rapidly acquired its present form.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The relationship of the horse to humans has been unique. The horse is a partner and friend. It has ploughed fields and brought in the harvest, hauled goods and conveyed passengers, followed game and tracked cattle, and carried combatants into battle and adventurers to unknown lands. It has provided recreation in the form of jousts, tournaments, carousels, and the sport of riding. The influence of the horse is expressed in the English language in such terms as chivalry and cavalier, which connote honour, respect, good manners, and straightforwardness.<br>

<br>
Old Zoey knew his mood well enough and whinnied her warning, backing off into the dark recesses of the stable, but she need not have warned me for I sensed his intention. One look at the raised stick sent my heart thumping wildly with fear. Terrified, I knew I could not run, for there was nowhere to go, so I put my back to him and lashed out behind me. I felt my hooves strike home. I heard a cry of pain and turned to see him crawling out of the stable door dragging one leg stiffly behind him and muttering words of cruel vengeance.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
That next morning both Albert and his father came out together to the stables. His father was walking with a pronounced limp. They were carrying a collar each and I could see that Albert had been crying for his pale cheeks were stained with tears. They stood together at the stable door. I noticed with infinite pride and pleasure that my Albert was already taller than his father whose face was drawn and lined with pain. ‘If your mother hadn’t begged me last night, Albert, I’d have shot that horse on the spot. He could’ve killed me. Now I’m warning you, if that animal is not ploughing straight as an arrow inside a week, he’ll be sold on, and that’s a promise. It’s up to you. You say you can deal with him, and I’ll give you just one chance. He won’t let me go near him. He’s wild and vicious, and unless you make it your business to tame him and train him inside that week, he’s going. Do you understand? That horse has to earn his keep like everyone else around here – I don’t care how showy he is – that horse has got to learn how to work. And I’ll promise you another thing, Albert, if I have to lose that bet, then he has to go.’ He dropped the collar on the ground and turned on his heel to go. ‘Father,’ said Albert with resolution in his voice. ‘I’ll train Joey – I’ll train him to plough all right – but you must promise never to raise a stick to him again. He can’t be handled that way, I know him, Father. I know him as if he were my own brother.’ ‘You train him, Albert, you handle him. Don’t care how you do it. I don’t want to know,’ said his father dismissively. ‘I’ll not go near the brute again. I’d shoot him first.’<br>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of horses. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Horse-drawn streetcars first appeared in American cities in the early 1830s when the New York &amp; Harlem Railroad began running trains from Harlem to 27<sup>th</sup> Street, substituting horses for steam south of that point as required by a city statute. By 1838, the railroad possessed one hundred horses, forty cars, and four locomotives, with a depot and stables at 27<sup>th</sup> Street. Four horses pulled the car along iron strips laid on granite blocks. The tracks rose several inches above the street surface and provided a smooth ride for the vehicle on the rails, but proved a hindrance to cross town traffic. In 1845, the New York Common Council prohibited steam locomotives below 32nd Street, a limit extended in 1856 to 42<sup>nd</sup> Street, and the number of horse-drawn cars expanded. Passenger loads grew rapidly, as the streetcar provided a smoother ride and cheaper fares than the omnibus.<br>

<br>
“Opinions are like butts; everyone has one,” my Dad told me over the phone as I was crying. I had just come back from a riding lesson where I spent almost the entire lesson trying to hold back tears while I was being lectured about how unknowledgeable I was about horses.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
When the time comes to finally buy your own horse it can be intimidating, but mostly it should be an exciting time for any rider. I could not wait to start looking around. I was, of course, open to advice from my mentors and parents because it’s a big financial decision, but ultimately, I ’ m a grown woman, it’s my money, and it will be my horse.<br>
<br>
When I first announced that I would be buying a horse, the horror stories I heard filled me with anxiety. I was made to feel as though I was going to be just another fool who would be scammed because of my lack of years in the equestrian world. I was told how many horses I should look at, how long I should take before responding to an offer on a horse, and so on, as if there is some secret formula for buying the perfect horse at the perfect time and at the perfect price. Every horse I looked at was too old, too young, too green, skinny, crazy, or too expensive. The list went on and I got to the point where I felt defeated and close to giving up on buying a horse at all because it would never be the right horse for me. I was even told:<em> All you see is a horse with four legs and a tail; I see much more. I was terrified of offending and upsetting these people.&nbsp;</em><br>

<br>
When looking at music, we can assign a category based on various musical elements. For example, genres can be defined by the use of specific instruments. If the piece was being played in a certain style using orchestral instruments, then we could classify it as classical music. Similarly, if the instruments were highly distorted guitars, we would classify as rock or heavy metal.<br>
<br>
Some genres are based on instruments and timing. Blues music uses a series of patterns and is played by a traditional live band using guitars and a drum kit. Likewise, drum and bass use a very fast bpm and are primarily electronic.<br>
<br>
The most recognised genres is pop music, which is simply because of the mass media proliferation. Pop music can take cues from any other genre. Over the years, lots of different styles have become pop music. Everything from R&amp;B, soul, funk, rock and folk has been popularised and played on mainstream radio stations. While hip-hop and rap music have taken over the charts recently, pop music is still the ‘most heard’ of all music genres.<br>
<br>
What’s incredibly interesting about music is that both geography and culture play a huge role in the popularity of music. Your own home-town probably has its own music scene where one type of music is more prevalent. There are literally thousands of different genres of music. Music in the modern age is incredibly diverse and every genre borrows something from another, then evolves.&nbsp;<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme on the theme of music. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Rhythm and blues, commonly known as R&amp;B, is a musical genre developed by African Americans in the 1940s that’s been continuously refined through the present day. R&amp;B was derived from gospel, jazz, folk and traditional blues music and was the father of rock ‘n’ roll. R&amp;B notably diverged from rock music in later decades.<br>
<br>
Contemporary R&amp;B is often driven by keyboards, synthesisers, strong bass lines, and looped drumbeats. In this sense, it has more in common with hip hop than rock music. Contemporary R&amp;B songs regularly top charts, making R&amp;B one of the most commercially successful genres in the modern music industry.<br>
<br>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme on the theme of music. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky is widely considered the most popular Russian composer in history. He manifested a clear interest in music from childhood, and his earliest musical impressions came from an orchestrina in the family home. At age four, he made his first recorded attempt at composition, a song written with his younger sister Alexandra. His work includes the 'The Sleeping Beauty' and 'The Nutcracker'. His music has always had great appeal for the general public in virtue of its tuneful, open-hearted melodies, impressive harmonies, and colourful, picturesque orchestration, all of which evoke a profound emotional response.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's work was first publicly performed in 1865. In 1868, his First Symphony was well-received. In 1874, he established himself with Piano Concerto No.1 in B-flat Minor. Tchaikovsky resigned from the Moscow Conservatory in 1878 and spent the rest of his career composing yet more prolifically. Tchaikovsky is most celebrated for his ballets, specifically Swan Lake, The Sleeping Beauty and The Nutcracker. He died in St. Petersburg on November 6, 1893.<br>

Who are the greatest singing voices of all time? Whether it's a soaring soprano or distinctive baritone, a great voice is the cornerstone of great music. When paired with stunning compositions and expert instrumentation, an iconic voice helps create iconic songs. Below is a look at the all-time great voices in music, ranging from R&amp;B icons to opera stars, pop chanteuses and everyone in between.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
First of our top 31 is Barbra Streisand. Barbra is a truly prolific talent who's earned the coveted EGOT — an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony — Barbra Streisand's distinctive voice has been a fixture of American music since the 1960s. Throughout the years, she's recorded 50 full-length albums, and notched hits with songs like "Woman in Love" and "Why Did I Choose You".&nbsp;<br>
