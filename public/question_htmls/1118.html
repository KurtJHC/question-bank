            <p>I think just about every parent thinks their children are special. And all children are special - I truly believe that. I used to just think that was something people said, but the more I have lived, I see how every single child has something special to offer this world. They don’t all get a chance to show it or use it, but if they are encouraged in what is their special talent, or personality trait, or interest, they will be able to shine. My older son has perfect pitch in music. My middle son understood computers from the age of 2. My daughter knows any song she has heard by heart after hearing it once. My daughter is severely autistic, and both my sons have had their own challenges in life. Being special doesn’t mean you are better than anyone else or should feel superior. But I think it is part of the job of a parent to recognise what is special about their kids.</p>

            <p>I am in Grade 5 at a school near Adarani Tea Garden in Tripura in India. One day when Baba (my father) came home from work, he asked if I had completed my homework. He got very angry when I said I hadn’t. The next day, he took me to his workplace - the tea garden. Baba is a tea picker and spends the entire day in the garden, even if it rains or the sun is too hot. He said, “Look, Vishnu. If you don’t study hard enough, you will not get the&nbsp;right education. And if you don’t get the right education, you will not get a good job. If you don’t get a good job, you’ll have to work in the tea garden like I do. And trust me son, you’ll not love this job. If you are able to do what you love, you will never feel like it’s a burden.”&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>When I came back home, I thought about what Baba had said and started studying hard. And today I was announced as the best student of my class. I think now I will be able to do what I love to, and it won’t feel like a burden to me.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Once upon a time there was a King who had no child and wanted to choose a worthy successor to his throne after he passed away. He called all the young children in his kingdom to his palace one day and said: “I feel it is time for me to choose the next King. I am going to give each one of you one very special seed today. I want you all to go home, plant the seed, water it, nurture it, and come back here to me exactly one year from today with the plant you have grown from this one seed. Whoever grows the best plant will be the Crown Prince, the next King after me.” There was one small shy boy who was there that day and he, like the others, received a seed from the King.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>One year later the children all lined up with their pots. The King inspected all the pots and then escorted the small shy boy to the throne and said to everyone: “One year ago I gave all of you a seed. I told you to take the seed, plant it, water it, and bring it back to me today. But I gave you all boiled seeds that would not grow. Except this honest boy, you have all brought me beautiful plants with exotic flowers. I know you substituted another seed for the one I gave you. This boy was the only one with the sincerity to nurture the barren seed for one whole year with dedication, hope and perseverance and had the courage and honesty to bring me the desolate pot with my seed in it. Therefore, I select him as my Crown Prince to be the next King...!”&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Children need to know that courage isn’t about something magical that happens inside us to make us ‘not scared’. It’s about something magical that happens inside us to make us push through fear, self-doubt, anxiety, and do the things that feel hard or risky or frightening. Sometimes, courage only has to happen for seconds at a time – just long enough to be brave enough. There’s something else that kids need to know about courage – you don’t always see the effects of it straight away. Courage might mean being kind to the new kid in class, trying something new, speaking up for something they believe in. Often, these things don’t come with fireworks or applause. In fact, they rarely do. The differences they make can take time to reveal, but when actions are driven by courage, the differences those actions make will always be there, gently taking shape and changing their very important corners of the world in some way.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>My Room&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My room had no treasures in it until last Thursday night. But it does now. It’s an object. Small, scrolled silver with a fine hinge. Good to hold in your hand or to press against your hot cheek.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My grandfather came to visit last Thursday night and he gave gifts to my sister Nellie and to me. He gave Nellie an old silver hairbrush that had been my Grandma’s. She was really pleased with it and I think she was a bit sorry for me with my gift – the silver scrolled object. But I liked my gift very much. And when Nellie had gone off to the movies, my grandfather told me a story that made me like it even more.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Once, when he was a boy, my grandfather’s dad, Alex had been the best fisherman on Blackheath Beach. Alex went fishing there, often alone. There was a smart young man from Brisbane who came there on holiday. He was determined to go fishing, though he knew nothing about it and nagged and nagged Alex until he agreed to take him out in his boat, even though did he not particularly like the arrogant bloke.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They fished the afternoon away with Danny getting annoyed as Alex caught many fish and he hardly anything worthwhile. Late in the afternoon, Alex began to pull up anchor.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘There’ll be a storm for sure,’ he told Danny. Danny was annoyed at having caught so few fish.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘I’m paying you well and you agreed to six hours,’ he said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘You can have your money back, but I’m not going to stay out here in a storm,’ Alex replied.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Well just another half an hour,’ Danny wheedled.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘It’ll be hard work getting back in. I can promise you,’ Alex replied.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Scared of water, are you?’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘<span class="txt-underline"><strong>No, just respectful,</strong></span>’ said Alex quietly. Of course, Alex’s prediction was right. A storm blew up quickly and they had a terrible struggle to bring the little boat in. It veered off near the headland in a raging wind and carried them towards the deserted Redhead Beach. But short of the surf the boat overturned and filled and went under in a matter of minutes. Now Alex was a fisherman and a swimmer but Danny, as it turns out was neither. He clung to Alex and it was all Alex could do to drag the heavy fellow through the wild surf. Alex, who was as determined as he was strong, was carrying the now inert body and dragged it through the waves and onto the beach at Redhead.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Alex was exhausted and realised that if he left the unconscious man on the beach he would surely die. But Alex was also a practical man. He saw what was needed to be done and set about doing it. Within minutes he’d found a shelter under a ledge of rock for Danny who was now shivering and moaning. He collected driftwood and the brittle bushes growing amongst the scattered rocks, and made a neat pile against the cliff face.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And then he took from his sodden shirt pocket a small shiny object made of scrolled silver that had a hinged top. It sprung open, revealing tinder dry matches inside. Enough of them to light an unwilling spluttering fire that turned slowly, slowly into a healthy warming fire and that finally blazed with a heat that breathed life back into Danny’s frozen body and warmed Alex as he fed the fire the whole night long. They were found by neighbours who came looking for them the next day when it was calm. ‘Storm stopped you two last night, did it? Had a tough time of it, eh?’ they asked.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Nothing we couldn’t handle,’ Danny blurted out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When Grandad offered me the gift, he said, ‘My father, Alex gave me this silver match case as I’m giving it to you, Sally.’ And he added, ‘Treasure it, because it saved two men’s lives. And one of them was forever grateful.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My room had no treasure in it until last Thursday night. But it does now.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>My Room&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My room had no treasures in it until last Thursday night. But it does now. It’s an object. Small, scrolled silver with a fine hinge. Good to hold in your hand or to press against your hot cheek.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My grandfather came to visit last Thursday night and he gave gifts to my sister Nellie and to me. He gave Nellie an old silver hairbrush that had been my Grandma’s. She was really pleased with it and I think she was a bit sorry for me with my gift – the silver scrolled object. But I liked my gift very much. And when Nellie had gone off to the movies, my grandfather told me a story that made me like it even more.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Once, when he was a boy, my grandfather’s dad, Alex had been the best fisherman on Blackheath Beach. Alex went fishing there, often alone. There was a smart young man from Brisbane who came there on holiday. He was determined to go fishing, though he knew nothing about it and nagged and nagged Alex until he agreed to take him out in his boat, even though did he not particularly like the arrogant bloke.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They fished the afternoon away with Danny getting annoyed as Alex caught many fish and he hardly anything worthwhile. Late in the afternoon, Alex began to pull up anchor.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘There’ll be a storm for sure,’ he told Danny. Danny was annoyed at having caught so few fish.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘I’m paying you well and you agreed to six hours,’ he said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘You can have your money back, but I’m not going to stay out here in a storm,’ Alex replied.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Well just another half an hour,’ Danny wheedled.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘It’ll be hard work getting back in. I can promise you,’ Alex replied.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>‘Scared of water, are you?’&nbsp;</p>

He clung to Alex and it was all Alex could do to drag the heavy fellow through the wild surf. Alex, who was as determined as he was strong, was carrying the now inert body and dragged it through the waves and onto the beach at Redhead.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Alex was exhausted and realised that if he left the unconscious man on the beach he would surely die. But Alex was also a practical man. He saw what was needed to be done and set about doing it. Within minutes he’d found a shelter under a ledge of rock for Danny who was now shivering and moaning. He collected driftwood and the brittle bushes growing amongst the scattered rocks, and made a neat pile against the cliff face.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And then he took from his sodden shirt pocket a small shiny object made of scrolled silver that had a hinged top. It sprung open, revealing tinder dry matches inside. Enough of them to light an unwilling spluttering fire that turned slowly, slowly into a healthy warming fire and that finally blazed with a heat that breathed life back into Danny’s frozen body and warmed Alex as he fed the fire the whole night long. They were found by neighbours who came looking for them the next day when it was calm. ‘Storm stopped you two last night, did it? Had a tough time of it, eh?’ they asked.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Nothing we couldn’t handle,’ Danny blurted out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When Grandad offered me the gift, he said, ‘My father, Alex gave me this silver match case as I’m giving it to you, Sally.’ And he added, ‘Treasure it, because it saved two men’s lives. And one of them was forever grateful.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My room had no treasure in it until last Thursday night. But it does now.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>My Room&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My room had no treasures in it until last Thursday night. But it does now. It’s an object. Small, scrolled silver with a fine hinge. Good to hold in your hand or to press against your hot cheek.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My grandfather came to visit last Thursday night and he gave gifts to my sister Nellie and to me. He gave Nellie an old silver hairbrush that had been my Grandma’s. She was really pleased with it and I think she was a bit sorry for me with my gift – the silver scrolled object. But I liked my gift very much. And when Nellie had gone off to the movies, my grandfather told me a story that made me like it even more.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Once, when he was a boy, my grandfather’s dad, Alex had been the best fisherman on Blackheath Beach. Alex went fishing there, often alone. There was a smart young man from Brisbane who came there on holiday. He was determined to go fishing, though he knew nothing about it and nagged and nagged Alex until he agreed to take him out in his boat, even though did he not particularly like the arrogant bloke.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They fished the afternoon away with Danny getting annoyed as Alex caught many fish and he hardly anything worthwhile. Late in the afternoon, Alex began to pull up anchor.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘There’ll be a storm for sure,’ he told Danny. Danny was annoyed at having caught so few fish.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘I’m paying you well and you agreed to six hours,’ he said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘You can have your money back, but I’m not going to stay out here in a storm,’ Alex replied.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Well just another half an hour,’ Danny wheedled.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘It’ll be hard work getting back in. I can promise you,’ Alex replied.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Scared of water, are you?’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘<span class="txt-underline"><strong>No, just respectful,</strong></span>’ said Alex quietly. Of course, Alex’s prediction was right. A storm blew up quickly and they had a terrible struggle to bring the little boat in. It veered off near the headland in a raging wind and carried them towards the deserted Redhead Beach. But short of the surf the boat overturned and filled and went under in a matter of minutes. Now Alex was a fisherman and a swimmer but Danny, as it turns out was neither.

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>My Room&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My room had no treasures in it until last Thursday night. But it does now. It’s an object. Small, scrolled silver with a fine hinge. Good to hold in your hand or to press against your hot cheek.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My grandfather came to visit last Thursday night and he gave gifts to my sister Nellie and to me. He gave Nellie an old silver hairbrush that had been my Grandma’s. She was really pleased with it and I think she was a bit sorry for me with my gift – the silver scrolled object. But I liked my gift very much. And when Nellie had gone off to the movies, my grandfather told me a story that made me like it even more.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Once, when he was a boy, my grandfather’s dad, Alex had been the best fisherman on Blackheath Beach. Alex went fishing there, often alone. There was a smart young man from Brisbane who came there on holiday. He was determined to go fishing, though he knew nothing about it and nagged and nagged Alex until he agreed to take him out in his boat, even though did he not particularly like the arrogant bloke.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They fished the afternoon away with Danny getting annoyed as Alex caught many fish and he hardly anything worthwhile. Late in the afternoon, Alex began to pull up anchor.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘There’ll be a storm for sure,’ he told Danny. Danny was annoyed at having caught so few fish.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘I’m paying you well and you agreed to six hours,’ he said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘You can have your money back, but I’m not going to stay out here in a storm,’ Alex replied.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Well just another half an hour,’ Danny wheedled.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘It’ll be hard work getting back in. I can promise you,’ Alex replied.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Scared of water, are you?’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘<span class="txt-underline"><strong>No, just respectful,</strong></span>’ said Alex quietly. Of course, Alex’s prediction was right. A storm blew up quickly and they had a terrible struggle to bring the little boat in. It veered off near the headland in a raging wind and carried them towards the deserted Redhead Beach. But short of the surf the boat overturned and filled and went under in a matter of minutes. Now Alex was a fisherman and a swimmer but Danny, as it turns out was neither. He clung to Alex and it was all Alex could do to drag the heavy fellow through the wild surf. Alex, who was as determined as he was strong, was carrying the now inert body and dragged it through the waves and onto the beach at Redhead.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Alex was exhausted and realised that if he left the unconscious man on the beach he would surely die. But Alex was also a practical man. He saw what was needed to be done and set about doing it. Within minutes he’d found a shelter under a ledge of rock for Danny who was now shivering and moaning. He collected driftwood and the brittle bushes growing amongst the scattered rocks, and made a neat pile against the cliff face.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And then he took from his sodden shirt pocket a small shiny object made of scrolled silver that had a hinged top. It sprung open, revealing tinder dry matches inside. Enough of them to light an unwilling spluttering fire that turned slowly, slowly into a healthy warming fire and that finally blazed with a heat that breathed life back into Danny’s frozen body and warmed Alex as he fed the fire the whole night long. They were found by neighbours who came looking for them the next day when it was calm. ‘Storm stopped you two last night, did it? Had a tough time of it, eh?’ they asked.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Nothing we couldn’t handle,’ Danny blurted out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When Grandad offered me the gift, he said, ‘My father, Alex gave me this silver match case as I’m giving it to you, Sally.’ And he added, ‘Treasure it, because it saved two men’s lives. And one of them was forever grateful.’&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>My Room&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My room had no treasures in it until last Thursday night. But it does now. It’s an object. Small, scrolled silver with a fine hinge. Good to hold in your hand or to press against your hot cheek.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My grandfather came to visit last Thursday night and he gave gifts to my sister Nellie and to me. He gave Nellie an old silver hairbrush that had been my Grandma’s. She was really pleased with it and I think she was a bit sorry for me with my gift – the silver scrolled object. But I liked my gift very much. And when Nellie had gone off to the movies, my grandfather told me a story that made me like it even more.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Once, when he was a boy, my grandfather’s dad, Alex had been the best fisherman on Blackheath Beach. Alex went fishing there, often alone. There was a smart young man from Brisbane who came there on holiday. He was determined to go fishing, though he knew nothing about it and nagged and nagged Alex until he agreed to take him out in his boat, even though did he not particularly like the arrogant bloke.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They fished the afternoon away with Danny getting annoyed as Alex caught many fish and he hardly anything worthwhile. Late in the afternoon, Alex began to pull up anchor.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘There’ll be a storm for sure,’ he told Danny. Danny was annoyed at having caught so few fish.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘I’m paying you well and you agreed to six hours,’ he said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘You can have your money back, but I’m not going to stay out here in a storm,’ Alex replied.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Well just another half an hour,’ Danny wheedled.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘It’ll be hard work getting back in. I can promise you,’ Alex replied.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Scared of water, are you?’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘<span class="txt-underline"><strong>No, just respectful,</strong></span>’ said Alex quietly. Of course, Alex’s prediction was right. A storm blew up quickly and they had a terrible struggle to bring the little boat in. It veered off near the headland in a raging wind and carried them towards the deserted Redhead Beach. But short of the surf the boat overturned and filled and went under in a matter of minutes. Now Alex was a fisherman and a swimmer but Danny, as it turns out was neither. He clung to Alex and it was all Alex could do to drag the heavy fellow through the wild surf. Alex, who was as determined as he was strong, was carrying the now inert body and dragged it through the waves and onto the beach at Redhead.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Alex was exhausted and realised that if he left the unconscious man on the beach he would surely die. But Alex was also a practical man. He saw what was needed to be done and set about doing it. Within minutes he’d found a shelter under a ledge of rock for Danny who was now shivering and moaning. He collected driftwood and the brittle bushes growing amongst the scattered rocks, and made a neat pile against the cliff face.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And then he took from his sodden shirt pocket a small shiny object made of scrolled silver that had a hinged top. It sprung open, revealing tinder dry matches inside. Enough of them to light an unwilling spluttering fire that turned slowly, slowly into a healthy warming fire and that finally blazed with a heat that breathed life back into Danny’s frozen body and warmed Alex as he fed the fire the whole night long. They were found by neighbours who came looking for them the next day when it was calm. ‘Storm stopped you two last night, did it? Had a tough time of it, eh?’ they asked.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Nothing we couldn’t handle,’ Danny blurted out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When Grandad offered me the gift, he said, ‘My father, Alex gave me this silver match case as I’m giving it to you, Sally.’ And he added, ‘Treasure it, because it saved two men’s lives. And one of them was forever grateful.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My room had no treasure in it until last Thursday night. But it does now.&nbsp;</p>

The Queen has ruled for longer than any other Monarch in British history. She has become a much loved and respected figure across the globe. <strong>15 ……….</strong> This includes many historic overseas visits. Known for her sense of duty and her devotion to a life of service, she has been an important figurehead for the UK and the Commonwealth during times of enormous social change.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, continues to carry out a full programme of engagements, from visits to charities and schools, to hosting visiting Heads of State, to leading the nation in Remembrance and celebratory events. All these are supported by other members of the Royal Family.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>16 ……….</strong> The Queen has links - as Royal Patron or President - with over 600 charities, military associations, professional bodies and public service organisations. These vary from well-established international charities to smaller bodies working in a specialist area or on a local basis only.</p>
        <p>Her patronages and charities cover a wide range of issues, from opportunities for young people, to the preservation of wildlife and the environment.<strong> 17 ………. </strong>It allows their enormous achievements and contributions to society to be recognised.</p>
        <p>
          <em>I think I speak for my generation when I say that the example and continuity provided by The Queen is very rare among leaders.<strong> 18 ………. </strong>- The Duke of Cambridge</em>
        </p>
        <p>Her Majesty supports and encourages achievement in all walks of life through the annual programme of Investiture honours award ceremonies, Garden Parties, receptions and other awards given in her name. <strong>19 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>The Queen carries out all of her duties against the backdrop of a full personal life. Britain has seen her raise four children and welcome grandchildren, and now great-grandchildren to the Royal Family. <strong>20 ……….</strong> Other members of the Royal Family also continue to offer vital support through their work in the UK and overseas.</p>

The Queen has ruled for longer than any other Monarch in British history. She has become a much loved and respected figure across the globe. <strong>15 ……….</strong> This includes many historic overseas visits. Known for her sense of duty and her devotion to a life of service, she has been an important figurehead for the UK and the Commonwealth during times of enormous social change.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, continues to carry out a full programme of engagements, from visits to charities and schools, to hosting visiting Heads of State, to leading the nation in Remembrance and celebratory events. All these are supported by other members of the Royal Family.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>16 ……….</strong> The Queen has links - as Royal Patron or President - with over 600 charities, military associations, professional bodies and public service organisations. These vary from well-established international charities to smaller bodies working in a specialist area or on a local basis only.</p>
        <p>Her patronages and charities cover a wide range of issues, from opportunities for young people, to the preservation of wildlife and the environment.<strong> 17 ………. </strong>It allows their enormous achievements and contributions to society to be recognised.</p>
        <p>
          <em>I think I speak for my generation when I say that the example and continuity provided by The Queen is very rare among leaders.<strong> 18 ………. </strong>- The Duke of Cambridge</em>
        </p>
        <p>Her Majesty supports and encourages achievement in all walks of life through the annual programme of Investiture honours award ceremonies, Garden Parties, receptions and other awards given in her name. <strong>19 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>The Queen carries out all of her duties against the backdrop of a full personal life. Britain has seen her raise four children and welcome grandchildren, and now great-grandchildren to the Royal Family. <strong>20 ……….</strong> Other members of the Royal Family also continue to offer vital support through their work in the UK and overseas.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Her Majesty the Queen&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
The Queen has ruled for longer than any other Monarch in British history. She has become a much loved and respected figure across the globe. <strong>15 ……….</strong> This includes many historic overseas visits. Known for her sense of duty and her devotion to a life of service, she has been an important figurehead for the UK and the Commonwealth during times of enormous social change.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, continues to carry out a full programme of engagements, from visits to charities and schools, to hosting visiting Heads of State, to leading the nation in Remembrance and celebratory events. All these are supported by other members of the Royal Family.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>16 ……….</strong> The Queen has links - as Royal Patron or President - with over 600 charities, military associations, professional bodies and public service organisations. These vary from well-established international charities to smaller bodies working in a specialist area or on a local basis only.</p>
        <p>Her patronages and charities cover a wide range of issues, from opportunities for young people, to the preservation of wildlife and the environment.<strong> 17 ………. </strong>It allows their enormous achievements and contributions to society to be recognised.</p>
        <p>
          <em>I think I speak for my generation when I say that the example and continuity provided by The Queen is very rare among leaders.<strong> 18 ………. </strong>- The Duke of Cambridge</em>
        </p>
        <p>Her Majesty supports and encourages achievement in all walks of life through the annual programme of Investiture honours award ceremonies, Garden Parties, receptions and other awards given in her name. <strong>19 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>The Queen carries out all of her duties against the backdrop of a full personal life. Britain has seen her raise four children and welcome grandchildren, and now great-grandchildren to the Royal Family. <strong>20 ……….</strong> Other members of the Royal Family also continue to offer vital support through their work in the UK and overseas.</p>

I think just about every parent thinks their children are special. And all children are special - I truly believe that. I used to just think that was something people said, but the more I have lived, I see how every single child has something special to offer this world. They<br>
don’t all get a chance to show it or use it, but if they are encouraged in what is their special talent, or personality trait, or interest, they will be able to shine. My older son has perfect pitch in music. My middle son understood computers from the age of 2. My daughter knows any song she has heard by heart after hearing it once. My daughter is severely autistic, and both my sons have had their own challenges in life. Being special doesn’t mean you are better than anyone else or should feel superior. But I think it is part of the job of a parent to recognise what is special about their kids.<br>

I am in Grade 5 at a school near Adarani Tea Garden in Tripura in India. One day when Baba (my father) came home from work, he asked if I had completed my homework. He got very angry when I said I hadn’t. The next day, he took me to his workplace - the tea garden. Baba is a tea picker and spends the entire day in the garden, even if it rains or the sun is too hot. He said, “Look, Vishnu. If you don’t study hard enough, you will not get the&nbsp;right education. And if you don’t get the right education, you will not get a good job. If you don’t get a good job, you’ll have to work in the tea garden like I do. And trust me son, you’ll not love this job. If you are able to do what you love, you will never feel like it’s a burden.”<br>
<br>
When I came back home, I thought about what Baba had said and started studying hard. And today I was announced as the best student of my class. I think now I will be able to do what I love to, and it won’t feel like a burden to me.<br>

Once upon a time there was a King who had no child and wanted to choose a worthy successor to his throne after he passed away. He called all the young children in his kingdom to his palace one day and said: “I feel it is time for me to choose the next King. I am going to give each one of you one very special seed today. I want you all to go home, plant the seed, water it, nurture it, and come back here to me exactly one year from today with the plant you have grown from this one seed. Whoever grows the best plant will be the Crown Prince, the next King after me.” There was one small shy boy who was there that day and he, like the others, received a seed from the King.<br>
<br>
One year later the children all lined up with their pots. The King inspected all the pots and then escorted the small shy boy to the throne and said to everyone: “One year ago I gave all of you a seed. I told you to take the seed, plant it, water it, and bring it back to me today. But I gave you all boiled seeds that would not grow. Except this honest boy, you have all brought me beautiful plants with exotic flowers. I know you substituted another seed for the one I gave you. This boy was the only one with the sincerity to nurture the barren seed for one whole year with dedication, hope and perseverance and had the courage and honesty to bring me the desolate pot with my seed in it. Therefore, I select him as my Crown Prince to be the next King...!”<br>

Children need to know that courage isn’t about something magical that happens inside us to make us ‘not scared’. It’s about something magical that happens inside us to make us push through fear, self-doubt, anxiety, and do the things that feel hard or risky or frightening. Sometimes, courage only has to happen for seconds at a time – just long enough to be brave enough. There’s something else that kids need to know about courage – you don’t always see the effects of it straight away. Courage might mean being kind to the new kid in class, trying something new, speaking up for something they believe in. Often, these things don’t come with fireworks or applause. In fact, they rarely do. The differences they make can take time to reveal, but when actions are driven by courage, the differences those actions make will always be there, gently taking shape and changing their very important corners of the world in some way.</div>

            <p>Children need to know that courage isn’t about something magical that happens inside us to make us ‘not scared’. It’s about something magical that happens inside us to make us push through fear, self-doubt, anxiety, and do the things that feel hard or risky or frightening. Sometimes, courage only has to happen for seconds at a time – just long enough to be brave enough. There’s something else that kids need to know about courage – you don’t always see the effects of it straight away. Courage might mean being kind to the new kid in class, trying something new, speaking up for something they believe in. Often, these things don’t come with fireworks or applause. In fact, they rarely do. The differences they make can take time to reveal, but when actions are driven by courage, the differences those actions make will always be there, gently taking shape and changing their very important corners of the world in some way.</p>

            <p>I think just about every parent thinks their children are special. And all children are special - I truly believe that. I used to just think that was something people said, but the more I have lived, I see how every single child has something special to offer this world. They don’t all get a chance to show it or use it, but if they are encouraged in what is their special talent, or personality trait, or interest, they will be able to shine. My older son has perfect pitch in music. My middle son understood computers from the age of 2. My daughter knows any song she has heard by heart after hearing it once. My daughter is severely autistic, and both my sons have had their own challenges in life. Being special doesn’t mean you are better than anyone else or should feel superior. But I think it is part of the job of a parent to recognise what is special about their kids.</p>

            <p>I am in Grade 5 at a school near Adarani Tea Garden in Tripura in India. One day when Baba (my father) came home from work, he asked if I had completed my homework. He got very angry when I said I hadn’t. The next day, he took me to his workplace - the tea garden. Baba is a tea picker and spends the entire day in the garden, even if it rains or the sun is too hot. He said, “Look, Vishnu. If you don’t study hard enough, you will not get the&nbsp;right education. And if you don’t get the right education, you will not get a good job. If you don’t get a good job, you’ll have to work in the tea garden like I do. And trust me son, you’ll not love this job. If you are able to do what you love, you will never feel like it’s a burden.”&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>When I came back home, I thought about what Baba had said and started studying hard. And today I was announced as the best student of my class. I think now I will be able to do what I love to, and it won’t feel like a burden to me.&nbsp;</p>

I want you all to go home, plant the seed, water it, nurture it, and come back here to me exactly one year from today with the plant you have grown from this one seed. Whoever grows the best plant will be the Crown Prince, the next King after me.” There was one small shy boy who was there that day and he, like the others, received a seed from the King.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Children need to know that courage isn’t about something magical that happens inside us to make us ‘not scared’. It’s about something magical that happens inside us to make us push through fear, self-doubt, anxiety, and do the things that feel hard or risky or frightening. Sometimes, courage only has to happen for seconds at a time – just long enough to be brave enough. There’s something else that kids need to know about courage – you don’t always see the effects of it straight away. Courage might mean being kind to the new kid in class, trying something new, speaking up for something they believe in. Often, these things don’t come with fireworks or applause. In fact, they rarely do. The differences they make can take time to reveal, but when actions are driven by courage, the differences those actions make will always be there, gently taking shape and changing their very important corners of the world in some way.</p>

            <p>I think just about every parent thinks their children are special. And all children are special - I truly believe that. I used to just think that was something people said, but the more I have lived, I see how every single child has something special to offer this world. They don’t all get a chance to show it or use it, but if they are encouraged in what is their special talent, or personality trait, or interest, they will be able to shine. My older son has perfect pitch in music. My middle son understood computers from the age of 2. My daughter knows any song she has heard by heart after hearing it once. My daughter is severely autistic, and both my sons have had their own challenges in life. Being special doesn’t mean you are better than anyone else or should feel superior. But I think it is part of the job of a parent to recognise what is special about their kids.</p>

            <p>I am in Grade 5 at a school near Adarani Tea Garden in Tripura in India. One day when Baba (my father) came home from work, he asked if I had completed my homework. He got very angry when I said I hadn’t. The next day, he took me to his workplace - the tea garden. Baba is a tea picker and spends the entire day in the garden, even if it rains or the sun is too hot. He said, “Look, Vishnu. If you don’t study hard enough, you will not get the&nbsp;right education. And if you don’t get the right education, you will not get a good job. If you don’t get a good job, you’ll have to work in the tea garden like I do. And trust me son, you’ll not love this job. If you are able to do what you love, you will never feel like it’s a burden.”&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>When I came back home, I thought about what Baba had said and started studying hard. And today I was announced as the best student of my class. I think now I will be able to do what I love to, and it won’t feel like a burden to me.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Once upon a time there was a King who had no child and wanted to choose a worthy successor to his throne after he passed away. He called all the young children in his kingdom to his palace one day and said: “I feel it is time for me to choose the next King. I am going to give each one of you one very special seed today. I want you all to go home, plant the seed, water it, nurture it, and come back here to me exactly one year from today with the plant you have grown from this one seed. Whoever grows the best plant will be the Crown Prince, the next King after me.” There was one small shy boy who was there that day and he, like the others, received a seed from the King.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>One year later the children all lined up with their pots. The King inspected all the pots and then escorted the small shy boy to the throne and said to everyone: “One year ago I gave all of you a seed. I told you to take the seed, plant it, water it, and bring it back to me today. But I gave you all boiled seeds that would not grow. Except this honest boy, you have all brought me beautiful plants with exotic flowers. I know you substituted another seed for the one I gave you. This boy was the only one with the sincerity to nurture the barren seed for one whole year with dedication, hope and perseverance and had the courage and honesty to bring me the desolate pot with my seed in it. Therefore, I select him as my Crown Prince to be the next King...!”&nbsp;</p>

              <strong>Extract A</strong>
            </p>
            <p>I think just about every parent thinks their children are special. And all children are special - I truly believe that. I used to just think that was something people said, but the more I have lived, I see how every single child has something special to offer this world. They don’t all get a chance to show it or use it, but if they are encouraged in what is their special talent, or personality trait, or interest, they will be able to shine. My older son has perfect pitch in music. My middle son understood computers from the age of 2. My daughter knows any song she has heard by heart after hearing it once. My daughter is severely autistic, and both my sons have had their own challenges in life. Being special doesn’t mean you are better than anyone else or should feel superior. But I think it is part of the job of a parent to recognise what is special about their kids.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I am in Grade 5 at a school near Adarani Tea Garden in Tripura in India. One day when Baba (my father) came home from work, he asked if I had completed my homework. He got very angry when I said I hadn’t. The next day, he took me to his workplace - the tea garden. Baba is a tea picker and spends the entire day in the garden, even if it rains or the sun is too hot. He said, “Look, Vishnu. If you don’t study hard enough, you will not get the&nbsp;right education. And if you don’t get the right education, you will not get a good job. If you don’t get a good job, you’ll have to work in the tea garden like I do. And trust me son, you’ll not love this job. If you are able to do what you love, you will never feel like it’s a burden.”&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>When I came back home, I thought about what Baba had said and started studying hard. And today I was announced as the best student of my class. I think now I will be able to do what I love to, and it won’t feel like a burden to me.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Once upon a time there was a King who had no child and wanted to choose a worthy successor to his throne after he passed away. He called all the young children in his kingdom to his palace one day and said: “I feel it is time for me to choose the next King. I am going to give each one of you one very special seed today. I want you all to go home, plant the seed, water it, nurture it, and come back here to me exactly one year from today with the plant you have grown from this one seed. Whoever grows the best plant will be the Crown Prince, the next King after me.” There was one small shy boy who was there that day and he, like the others, received a seed from the King.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>One year later the children all lined up with their pots. The King inspected all the pots and then escorted the small shy boy to the throne and said to everyone: “One year ago I gave all of you a seed. I told you to take the seed, plant it, water it, and bring it back to me today. But I gave you all boiled seeds that would not grow. Except this honest boy, you have all brought me beautiful plants with exotic flowers. I know you substituted another seed for the one I gave you. This boy was the only one with the sincerity to nurture the barren seed for one whole year with dedication, hope and perseverance and had the courage and honesty to bring me the desolate pot with my seed in it. Therefore, I select him as my Crown Prince to be the next King...!”&nbsp;</p>

            </p>
            <p>Children need to know that courage isn’t about something magical that happens inside us to make us ‘not scared’. It’s about something magical that happens inside us to make us push through fear, self-doubt, anxiety, and do the things that feel hard or risky or frightening. Sometimes, courage only has to happen for seconds at a time – just long enough to be brave enough. There’s something else that kids need to know about courage – you don’t always see the effects of it straight away. Courage might mean being kind to the new kid in class, trying something new, speaking up for something they believe in. Often, these things don’t come with fireworks or applause. In fact, they rarely do. The differences they make can take time to reveal, but when actions are driven by courage, the differences those actions make will always be there, gently taking shape and changing their very important corners of the world in some way.</p>
