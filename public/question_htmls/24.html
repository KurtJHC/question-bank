          <strong>Alexander the Great</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Philip and His Son</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If the Greek cities had stayed friends and allies, like they were when they fought against the Persians, Greece would have been a strong country.&nbsp; But instead, Sparta and Athens fought.&nbsp; They were like brothers who were too busy arguing with each other to notice that a bully is coming!</p>
        <p><br>
In this case, the bully was a king named Philip, who ruled a country called Macedonia.&nbsp; Philip noticed that Athens and Sparta had become weaker and weaker after years of battle.&nbsp; And so he came down into Greece with his army and conquered the Greek cities.&nbsp; They barely had enough energy to resist.</p>
        <p><br>
Now Philip ruled Macedonia and Greece.&nbsp; But he wanted even more cities.&nbsp; He wanted to sail across the Aegean Sea to Asia Minor and take over the Persian Empire as well.&nbsp; But before he could attack Persia, Philip died.&nbsp; And his son Alexander took over his throne.</p>
        <p><br>
Do you know what the name “Alexander” means?&nbsp; It means “Ruler of men.”&nbsp; Alexander became one of the most famous “rulers of men” ever.&nbsp; He was known by the whole world as “Alexander the Great.”</p>
        <p><br>
Alexander had always been an unusual boy.&nbsp; Even as a child, he was strong and brave.&nbsp; Nothing scared him!&nbsp; When he was still a small boy, he went with his father Philip to look at a warhorse that Philip wanted to buy.&nbsp; The horse, a huge black stallion named Bucephalas, bucked and kicked constantly.&nbsp; No one could ride him.</p>
        <p><br>
“He’s too wild,” King Philip said.&nbsp; “I don’t want him.&nbsp; I would never be able to manage him.”</p>
        <p><br>
“I can ride him!” Alexander said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;“Nonsense!” Philip said.&nbsp; “You’re too little.”</p>
        <p><br>
“But I can!” Alexander insisted.</p>
        <p>“If you can ride him, I’ll buy him for you,” Philip promised.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Alexander had been watching Bucephalas carefully.&nbsp; He noticed the horse kicked and reared whenever the sun threw his shadow on the ground in front of him.&nbsp; Alexander thought that the huge stallion was frightened of his shadow.&nbsp; So he walked fearlessly up to the horse, took his bridle, and turned him so that he couldn’t see his shadow.&nbsp; Instantly, Bucephalas stood still.&nbsp; He allowed Alexander to mount him and ride him around.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;<br>
Philip bought the horse for Alexander.&nbsp; And when Alexander became king after his father’s death, the great black stallion Bucephalas always carried him into battle.&nbsp; He even named a city after his horse – he called it Bucephela!</p>
        <p><br>
Alexander had many opportunities to ride his warhorse into battle.&nbsp; His father Philip had conquered Greece, but Alexander had even larger goals in mind.&nbsp; He wanted to rule Persia.&nbsp; The Persians had given up trying to conquer Greece, but their empire was still the largest in the world – it stretched all the way from Asia Minor to India.&nbsp; And Alexander wanted it.</p>
        <p><br>
When Alexander met the Persian army in Asia Minor, he used his cavalry – soldiers riding on horseback – to push the Persians back.&nbsp; Asia Minor was now his!&nbsp; But could he conquer the rest of the Persian Empire?</p>
        <p><br>
According to one story, Alexander stopped at a city in Asia Minor and saw there, in the city’s centre, a chariot tied to its axle with a huge, complicated knot of rope, larger than a man’s head.&nbsp; “What is that?” he asked.</p>
        <p><br>
“That is the Gordian Knot,” the people told him.&nbsp; “We have a legend about it.&nbsp; The man who loosens that knot will rule all the rest of Asia.&nbsp; But it is impossible to untie the knot.&nbsp; Hundreds of men have tried, and no one has ever succeeded!”</p>
        <p><br>
Alexander studied the knot carefully.&nbsp; Then he took out his sword and sliced the knot in half.</p>
        <p><br>
“There,” he said.&nbsp; “I have loosened the knot.”</p>
        <p><br>
No one had ever thought of doing that before!&nbsp; But the prophecy of the knot came true.&nbsp; Alexander conquered all the rest of Asia.&nbsp; He went south into Egypt and was crowned the pharaoh of Egypt.&nbsp; And then he came back up into Mesopotamia and took over the rest of the Persian Empire.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;<br>
Now Alexander was king of more land than anyone else had ever ruled.&nbsp; He was truly “Alexander the Great” – the ruler of the greatest empire the world had ever seen.</p>

Do you know what the name “Alexander” means?&nbsp; It means “Ruler of men.”&nbsp; Alexander became one of the most famous “rulers of men” ever.&nbsp; He was known by the whole world as “Alexander the Great.”</p>
        <p><br>
Alexander had always been an unusual boy.&nbsp; Even as a child, he was strong and brave.&nbsp; Nothing scared him!&nbsp; When he was still a small boy, he went with his father Philip to look at a warhorse that Philip wanted to buy.&nbsp; The horse, a huge black stallion named Bucephalas, bucked and kicked constantly.&nbsp; No one could ride him.</p>
        <p><br>
“He’s too wild,” King Philip said.&nbsp; “I don’t want him.&nbsp; I would never be able to manage him.”</p>
        <p><br>
“I can ride him!” Alexander said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;“Nonsense!” Philip said.&nbsp; “You’re too little.”</p>
        <p><br>
“But I can!” Alexander insisted.</p>
        <p>“If you can ride him, I’ll buy him for you,” Philip promised.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Alexander had been watching Bucephalas carefully.&nbsp; He noticed the horse kicked and reared whenever the sun threw his shadow on the ground in front of him.&nbsp; Alexander thought that the huge stallion was frightened of his shadow.&nbsp; So he walked fearlessly up to the horse, took his bridle, and turned him so that he couldn’t see his shadow.&nbsp; Instantly, Bucephalas stood still.&nbsp; He allowed Alexander to mount him and ride him around.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;<br>
Philip bought the horse for Alexander.&nbsp; And when Alexander became king after his father’s death, the great black stallion Bucephalas always carried him into battle.&nbsp; He even named a city after his horse – he called it Bucephela!</p>
        <p><br>
Alexander had many opportunities to ride his warhorse into battle.&nbsp; His father Philip had conquered Greece, but Alexander had even larger goals in mind.&nbsp; He wanted to rule Persia.&nbsp; The Persians had given up trying to conquer Greece, but their empire was still the largest in the world – it stretched all the way from Asia Minor to India.&nbsp; And Alexander wanted it.</p>
        <p><br>
When Alexander met the Persian army in Asia Minor, he used his cavalry – soldiers riding on horseback – to push the Persians back.&nbsp; Asia Minor was now his!&nbsp; But could he conquer the rest of the Persian Empire?</p>
        <p><br>
According to one story, Alexander stopped at a city in Asia Minor and saw there, in the city’s centre, a chariot tied to its axle with a huge, complicated knot of rope, larger than a man’s head.&nbsp; “What is that?” he asked.</p>
        <p><br>
“That is the Gordian Knot,” the people told him.&nbsp; “We have a legend about it.&nbsp; The man who loosens that knot will rule all the rest of Asia.&nbsp; But it is impossible to untie the knot.&nbsp; Hundreds of men have tried, and no one has ever succeeded!”</p>
        <p><br>
Alexander studied the knot carefully.&nbsp; Then he took out his sword and sliced the knot in half.</p>
        <p><br>
“There,” he said.&nbsp; “I have loosened the knot.”</p>
        <p><br>
No one had ever thought of doing that before!&nbsp; But the prophecy of the knot came true.&nbsp; Alexander conquered all the rest of Asia.&nbsp; He went south into Egypt and was crowned the pharaoh of Egypt.&nbsp; And then he came back up into Mesopotamia and took over the rest of the Persian Empire.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;<br>
Now Alexander was king of more land than anyone else had ever ruled.&nbsp; He was truly “Alexander the Great” – the ruler of the greatest empire the world had ever seen.</p>

          <strong>Alexander the Great</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Philip and His Son</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If the Greek cities had stayed friends and allies, like they were when they fought against the Persians, Greece would have been a strong country.&nbsp; But instead, Sparta and Athens fought.&nbsp; They were like brothers who were too busy arguing with each other to notice that a bully is coming!</p>
        <p><br>
In this case, the bully was a king named Philip, who ruled a country called Macedonia.&nbsp; Philip noticed that Athens and Sparta had become weaker and weaker after years of battle.&nbsp; And so he came down into Greece with his army and conquered the Greek cities.&nbsp; They barely had enough energy to resist.</p>
        <p><br>
Now Philip ruled Macedonia and Greece.&nbsp; But he wanted even more cities.&nbsp; He wanted to sail across the Aegean Sea to Asia Minor and take over the Persian Empire as well.&nbsp; But before he could attack Persia, Philip died.&nbsp; And his son Alexander took over his throne.</p>
        <p><br>
Do you know what the name “Alexander” means?&nbsp; It means “Ruler of men.”&nbsp; Alexander became one of the most famous “rulers of men” ever.&nbsp; He was known by the whole world as “Alexander the Great.”</p>

          <strong>Twilight in The Land of Nowhen</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Nury Vittachi</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The most important week in the history of the universe (and this is not an exaggeration, as you will realise when you read on) began like any other, with a-yeuchh-Monday morning. It didn't seem like a special day. In fact, it wasn't even a particularly nice one.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The clouds were not white and fluffy.&nbsp; The birds were not singing.<br>
The sky was not blue. It was just sort of paper-white all over, like someone had forgotten to paint it in. The air was clear but icy, like my heart. Gusts of freezing wind hurt my nose and ears. The birds hadn't woken up yet. And no one was talking.</p>
        <p>Not that it was quiet. We live at the bottom of a hill, so every now and then the iiiieeeeeeeerrrrrrr of a bus or car straining up the slope fills the air.</p>
        <p><br>
That momentous morning I stood at the bus stop and thought about three horrible things.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1. I was starting a new school in a new town. I had precisely zero acquaintances to help me through the week.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>2. It was the first day of a new term. There were not going to be any holidays for weeks and weeks and weeks.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>3. I had a really bad feeling that, instead of making friends, I would acquire dangerous, lifelong enemies who loathed me.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I don't know where that last thought came from. Except for the fact that I had been to six schools in my thirteen years. Every time I started a new one, I made no friends but acquired a new set of DANGEROUS, LIFELONG ENEMIES WHO LOATHED ME. Get the picture?</p>
        <p><br>
So there we were, a shivering clump, standing on the windy corner and staring at the top of the hill. Everyone was focused on the point where the school bus would eventually appear. Lots of people were sniffing. Everyone seemed to have a bad cold. I was fingering a bruise on my forehead where I had accidentally walked into a door. My family was standing next to me. That means my dad. He's the only family I have. A slightly older girl was standing on the other side of him. I noticed in a blurry sort of way that she was looking at me.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Danger danger danger.</p>
        <p>Then she did it.</p>
        <p>'Hi. What's your name?' I heard her say.</p>
        <p>Argghhh! If there's one thing I hate hate HATE, it's friendly people. Why do they insist on saying hello? There is absolutely no need for that sort of behaviour. You'll have noticed that I hadn't&nbsp; done anything to her. I didn't reply or look in her direction, but turned to my dad. He was reading an engineering magazine, as usual, and ignored my tugs at his elbow.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'What's-' the girl started to repeat.</p>
        <p>'Simon,' I spat, not looking at her.</p>
        <p>'-your name?'</p>
        <p>'I don't know,' I explained, starting to feel hot. 'I don't know.'</p>
        <p>'Huh?'<br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She probably thought she hadn't heard me right. I could tell because she wrinkled her forehead and tilted her head to one side. That's what people usually do when they talk to me.</p>
        <p><br>
'Whose class are you in?' she asked.</p>
        <p>'Um, ah, two weeks,' I said, desperately.</p>
        <p>She looked baffled, but pressed on-the idiot. 'Lived here long?'</p>
        <p>'Art. Art. You know, painting and stuff.'</p>
        <p><br>
The girl tilted her head to the other side. I think she was trying to decide whether I was obnoxious or crazy: the usual reaction.</p>
        <p>I'm a conundrum, that's what I am.</p>

          <strong>Twilight in The Land of Nowhen</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Nury Vittachi</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The most important week in the history of the universe (and this is not an exaggeration, as you will realise when you read on) began like any other, with a-yeuchh-Monday morning. It didn't seem like a special day. In fact, it wasn't even a particularly nice one.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The clouds were not white and fluffy.&nbsp; The birds were not singing.<br>
The sky was not blue. It was just sort of paper-white all over, like someone had forgotten to paint it in. The air was clear but icy, like my heart. Gusts of freezing wind hurt my nose and ears. The birds hadn't woken up yet. And no one was talking.</p>
        <p>Not that it was quiet. We live at the bottom of a hill, so every now and then the iiiieeeeeeeerrrrrrr of a bus or car straining up the slope fills the air.</p>
        <p><br>
That momentous morning I stood at the bus stop and thought about three horrible things.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1. I was starting a new school in a new town. I had precisely zero acquaintances to help me through the week.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>2. It was the first day of a new term. There were not going to be any holidays for weeks and weeks and weeks.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>3. I had a really bad feeling that, instead of making friends, I would acquire dangerous, lifelong enemies who loathed me.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I don't know where that last thought came from. Except for the fact that I had been to six schools in my thirteen years. Every time I started a new one, I made no friends but acquired a new set of DANGEROUS, LIFELONG ENEMIES WHO LOATHED ME. Get the picture?</p>
        <p><br>
So there we were, a shivering clump, standing on the windy corner and staring at the top of the hill. Everyone was focused on the point where the school bus would eventually appear. Lots of people were sniffing. Everyone seemed to have a bad cold. I was fingering a bruise on my forehead where I had accidentally walked into a door. My family was standing next to me. That means my dad. He's the only family I have. A slightly older girl was standing on the other side of him. I noticed in a blurry sort of way that she was looking at me.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Danger danger danger.</p>
        <p>Then she did it.</p>
        <p>'Hi. What's your name?' I heard her say.</p>
        <p>Argghhh! If there's one thing I hate hate HATE, it's friendly people. Why do they insist on saying hello? There is absolutely no need for that sort of behaviour. You'll have noticed that I hadn't&nbsp;done anything to her. I didn't reply or look in her direction, but turned to my dad. He was reading an engineering magazine, as usual, and ignored my tugs at his elbow.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'What's-' the girl started to repeat.</p>
        <p>'Simon,' I spat, not looking at her.</p>
        <p>'-your name?'</p>
        <p>'I don't know,' I explained, starting to feel hot. 'I don't know.'</p>

          <strong>Twilight in The Land of Nowhen</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Nury Vittachi</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The most important week in the history of the universe (and this is not an exaggeration, as you will realise when you read on) began like any other, with a-yeuchh-Monday morning. It didn't seem like a special day. In fact, it wasn't even a particularly nice one.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The clouds were not white and fluffy.&nbsp; The birds were not singing.<br>
The sky was not blue. It was just sort of paper-white all over, like someone had forgotten to paint it in. The air was clear but icy, like my heart. Gusts of freezing wind hurt my nose and ears. The birds hadn't woken up yet. And no one was talking.</p>
        <p>Not that it was quiet. We live at the bottom of a hill, so every now and then the iiiieeeeeeeerrrrrrr of a bus or car straining up the slope fills the air.</p>
        <p><br>
That momentous morning I stood at the bus stop and thought about three horrible things.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1. I was starting a new school in a new town. I had precisely zero acquaintances to help me through the week.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>2. It was the first day of a new term. There were not going to be any holidays for weeks and weeks and weeks.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>3. I had a really bad feeling that, instead of making friends, I would acquire dangerous, lifelong enemies who loathed me.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I don't know where that last thought came from. Except for the fact that I had been to six schools in my thirteen years. Every time I started a new one, I made no friends but acquired a new set of DANGEROUS, LIFELONG ENEMIES WHO LOATHED ME. Get the picture?</p>
        <p><br>
So there we were, a shivering clump, standing on the windy corner and staring at the top of the hill. Everyone was focused on the point where the school bus would eventually appear. Lots of people were sniffing. Everyone seemed to have a bad cold. I was fingering a bruise on my forehead where I had accidentally walked into a door. My family was standing next to me. That means my dad. He's the only family I have. A slightly older girl was standing on the other side of him. I noticed in a blurry sort of way that she was looking at me.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Danger danger danger.</p>
        <p>Then she did it.</p>
        <p>'Hi. What's your name?' I heard her say.</p>
        <p>Argghhh! If there's one thing I hate hate HATE, it's friendly people. Why do they insist on saying hello? There is absolutely no need for that sort of behaviour. You'll have noticed that I hadn't&nbsp;done anything to her. I didn't reply or look in her direction, but turned to my dad. He was reading an engineering magazine, as usual, and ignored my tugs at his elbow.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'What's-' the girl started to repeat.</p>
        <p>'Simon,' I spat, not looking at her.</p>
        <p>'-your name?'</p>
        <p>'I don't know,' I explained, starting to feel hot. 'I don't know.'</p>
        <p>'Huh?'<br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She probably thought she hadn't heard me right. I could tell because she wrinkled her forehead and tilted her head to one side. That's what people usually do when they talk to me.</p>
        <p><br>
'Whose class are you in?' she asked.</p>
        <p>'Um, ah, two weeks,' I said, desperately.</p>
        <p>She looked baffled, but pressed on-the idiot. 'Lived here long?'</p>
        <p>'Art. Art. You know, painting and stuff.'</p>
        <p><br>
The girl tilted her head to the other side. I think she was trying to decide whether I was obnoxious or crazy: the usual reaction.</p>
        <p>I'm a conundrum, that's what I am.</p>

          <strong>Twilight in The Land of Nowhen</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Nury Vittachi</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The most important week in the history of the universe (and this is not an exaggeration, as you will realise when you read on) began like any other, with a-yeuchh-Monday morning. It didn't seem like a special day. In fact, it wasn't even a particularly nice one.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The clouds were not white and fluffy.&nbsp; The birds were not singing.<br>
The sky was not blue. It was just sort of paper-white all over, like someone had forgotten to paint it in. The air was clear but icy, like my heart. Gusts of freezing wind hurt my nose and ears. The birds hadn't woken up yet. And no one was talking.</p>
        <p>Not that it was quiet. We live at the bottom of a hill, so every now and then the iiiieeeeeeeerrrrrrr of a bus or car straining up the slope fills the air.</p>
        <p><br>
That momentous morning I stood at the bus stop and thought about three horrible things.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1. I was starting a new school in a new town. I had precisely zero acquaintances to help me through the week.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>2. It was the first day of a new term. There were not going to be any holidays for weeks and weeks and weeks.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>3. I had a really bad feeling that, instead of making friends, I would acquire dangerous, lifelong enemies who loathed me.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I don't know where that last thought came from. Except for the fact that I had been to six schools in my thirteen years. Every time I started a new one, I made no friends but acquired a new set of DANGEROUS, LIFELONG ENEMIES WHO LOATHED ME. Get the picture?</p>
        <p><br>
So there we were, a shivering clump, standing on the windy corner and staring at the top of the hill. Everyone was focused on the point where the school bus would eventually appear. Lots of people were sniffing. Everyone seemed to have a bad cold. I was fingering a bruise on my forehead where I had accidentally walked into a door. My family was standing next to me. That means my dad. He's the only family I have. A slightly older girl was standing on the other side of him. I noticed in a blurry sort of way that she was looking at me.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Danger danger danger.</p>
        <p>Then she did it.</p>
        <p>'Hi. What's your name?' I heard her say.</p>
        <p>Argghhh! If there's one thing I hate hate HATE, it's friendly people. Why do they insist on saying hello? There is absolutely no need for that sort of behaviour. You'll have noticed that I hadn't&nbsp;done anything to her. I didn't reply or look in her direction, but turned to my dad. He was reading an engineering magazine, as usual, and ignored my tugs at his elbow.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'What's-' the girl started to repeat.</p>
        <p>'Simon,' I spat, not looking at her.</p>
        <p>'-your name?'</p>
        <p>'I don't know,' I explained, starting to feel hot. 'I don't know.'</p>
        <p>'Huh?'<br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She probably thought she hadn't heard me right. I could tell because she wrinkled her forehead and tilted her head to one side. That's what people usually do when they talk to me.</p>
        <p><br>
'Whose class are you in?' she asked.</p>
        <p>'Um, ah, two weeks,' I said, desperately.</p>
        <p>She looked baffled, but pressed on-the idiot. 'Lived here long?'</p>
        <p>'Art. Art. You know, painting and stuff.'</p>
        <p><br>
The girl tilted her head to the other side. I think she was trying to decide whether I was obnoxious or crazy: the usual reaction.</p>
        <p>I'm a conundrum, that's what I am.</p>

          <strong>JULIA&nbsp; ROBERTS &nbsp;AND DAKOTA &nbsp;FANNING</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>The Charlotte's Web </em>stars celebrate Christmas, pets, friends, books, and more of their favourite things. By Kate Meyers</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As a young girl growing up in Smyrna, Georgia, Julia Roberts remembers, the E.B. White classic Charlotte's Web held a prominent place in her family’s home.</p>
        <p>"I can still see the cover of the book – with that little sketch of Fern and Wilbur – sitting on our bookshelf," says Roberts, 39. "It's such a timeless story."</p>
        <p>Now, as the mother of 2-year-old twins, Phinnaeus and Hazel, Roberts is putting her own spin on the bittersweet barnyard tale. She's lending her voice to the indefatigable gray spider, Charlotte, alongside 12-year-old Dakota Fanning, who plays the young girl, Fern, in the live-action movie adaptation, now in theatres.</p>
        <p>With the holidays quickly approaching, the two reunited to talk to LIFE about loyal friends, Christmas traditions, and why "some pig" named Wilbur matters.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LIFE</strong>: What part of <em>Charlotte's Web</em> resonates most with you?</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: The idea of feeling all alone and needing someone to scoop you up and say "I’ll be your friend." Everybody's had a moment where they felt like that, and you wished somebody would come and sit with you at lunch or ask you to the dance.</p>
        <p><strong>FANNING</strong>: There are so many messages about being a loyal friend. Wilbur didn't know Charlotte was going to die, but he treated her so great for the time she was alive.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LIFE</strong>: Do you have a friend who came through for you in a time of need, like Charlotte did for Wilbur?</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: My friend Paige Sampson. When we were growing up together 25 years ago, neither of us had that connected group. We sort of found each other and formed our own group of two.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LIFE</strong>: Where did you find each other?</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: In health class. I told her I liked her outfit. She was wearing a peach top with these three-quarter pants and two little suede belts.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LIFE</strong>: What are some of your favourite children’s books?</p>
        <p><strong>FANNING</strong>: I’ve read most of the classics, like <em>Little Women</em> and <em>The Secret Garden</em>. When I watch <em>Little Women</em>, I’m always like, “If I had gotten to be in that movie, who would I have wanted to play?” Probably the little one, Amy.</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: I remember liking the <em>Frog and Toad Together</em> books and <em>Harry the Dirty Dog</em>. My kids are still too young for them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LIFE</strong>: What are you reading to your kids now?</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: <em>Good Night, Maisy. First Book of Sushi</em>, which they love and we read almost every night.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LIFE</strong>: Did being a mom have anything to do with you signing on for <em>Charlotte's Web</em>?</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: At the time, they were just teeny-tiny new babies, so I didn't think, Oh, one day . . . It was more like, "Charlotte is the spider, right?" I was so not mentally alert at that time in my life. So my husband [cameraman Danny Moder] and I watched the [1973] cartoon, and I remembered loving it as a kid.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LIFE</strong>: Have the twins seen you on the screen at all?</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: I think my son saw me on TV once for a split second and said "Mommy!" But when Hazel sees any mom figure in a book, she says "Mommy".</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LIFE</strong>: A touching part of <em>Charlotte's Web</em> is Fern's love for her family's pig, Wilbur. Do either of you have a pet that's special to you?</p>
        <p><strong>FANNING</strong>: I have a dog, Lewellen, who's a Schnoodle – [part] miniature schnauzer, [part] toy poodle. She's 8 months old, and I love her as much as Fern loved Wilbur. And I have a horse, Goldie [which Kurt Russell gave her after they filmed 2005’s Dreamer]. I ride her on the weekends.</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: I had a dog named Satchmo I loved when I was a kid. He was a basset hound and eventually died, as all good pets do. When I became a grown-up and first moved to [New Mexico], I went to the pound and got a dog – a guy named Diego, who I had for 12 years. He was a mutt and looked like an old coyote. He died two summers ago, and it was devastating to me. He was my best pal.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LIFE</strong>: You're both Georgia-born girls who knit. Are either of you knitting anything for Christmas?</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: I'm currently knitting an orange sweater for myself.</p>
        <p><strong>FANNING</strong>: I'm really bad, because I haven't even knitted my sister [Elle, 8] a scarf.</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: You should get on it. Get yourself some big needles. You know what's fun is knitting a poncho.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LIFE</strong>: What’s your idea of a great Christmas gift?</p>
        <p><strong>FANNING</strong>: Dog and horse stuff. All pink. I'm into my pets.</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: My friend Paige and I are reading a book together, Eat, Pray, Love [by Elizabeth Gilbert], and we keep calling each other, saying "What page are you on?" It's about a woman's sojourn through three countries, and it's fantastic. It's what I'm giving all my girlfriends for Christmas.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LIFE</strong>: Any holiday movies that you love to watch?</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: The<em> Charlie Brown </em>specials are fun.</p>
        <p><strong>FANNING</strong>: Rudolph, every Christmas Eve.</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: It used to be more fun before you had TiVo, when you had to have the TV on at 7:30 and be ready to watch.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LIFE</strong>: What's great about Christmas?</p>
        <p><strong>FANNING</strong>: The present part, but the other parts are so important.</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: I cook until I collapse. I do a big turkey, lots of sides – potatoes, beans, biscuits. And pies and cake. For me, Christmas is a day to eat, relax, and be with your family and your friends.</p>

        <p><em>The Charlotte's Web </em>stars celebrate Christmas, pets, friends, books, and more of their favourite things. By Kate Meyers</p>

And I have a horse, Goldie [which Kurt Russell gave her after they filmed 2005’s Dreamer]. I ride her on the weekends.</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: I had a dog named Satchmo I loved when I was a kid. He was a basset hound and eventually died, as all good pets do. When I became a grown-up and first moved to [New Mexico], I went to the pound and got a dog – a guy named Diego, who I had for 12 years. He was a mutt and looked like an old coyote. He died two summers ago, and it was devastating to me. He was my best pal.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LIFE</strong>: You're both Georgia-born girls who knit. Are either of you knitting anything for Christmas?</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: I'm currently knitting an orange sweater for myself.</p>
        <p><strong>FANNING</strong>: I'm really bad, because I haven't even knitted my sister [Elle, 8] a scarf.</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: You should get on it. Get yourself some big needles. You know what's fun is knitting a poncho.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LIFE</strong>: What’s your idea of a great Christmas gift?</p>
        <p><strong>FANNING</strong>: Dog and horse stuff. All pink. I'm into my pets.</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: My friend Paige and I are reading a book together, Eat, Pray, Love [by Elizabeth Gilbert], and we keep calling each other, saying "What page are you on?" It's about a woman's sojourn through three countries, and it's fantastic. It's what I'm giving all my girlfriends for Christmas.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LIFE</strong>: Any holiday movies that you love to watch?</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: The <em>Charlie Brown</em> specials are fun.</p>
        <p><strong>FANNING</strong>: Rudolph, every Christmas Eve.</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: It used to be more fun before you had TiVo, when you had to have the TV on at 7:30 and be ready to watch.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LIFE</strong>: What's great about Christmas?</p>
        <p><strong>FANNING</strong>: The present part, but the other parts are so important.</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: I cook until I collapse. I do a big turkey, lots of sides – potatoes, beans, biscuits. And pies and cake. For me, Christmas is a day to eat, relax, and be with your family and your friends.</p>

          <strong>JULIA&nbsp; ROBERTS &nbsp;AND DAKOTA &nbsp;FANNING</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>The Charlotte's Web </em>stars celebrate Christmas, pets, friends, books, and more of their favourite things. By Kate Meyers</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As a young girl growing up in Smyrna, Georgia, Julia Roberts remembers, the E.B. White classic <em>Charlotte's Web </em>held a prominent place in her family’s home.</p>
        <p>"I can still see the cover of the book – with that little sketch of Fern and Wilbur – sitting on our bookshelf," says Roberts, 39. "It's such a timeless story."</p>
        <p>Now, as the mother of 2-year-old twins, Phinnaeus and Hazel, Roberts is putting her own spin on the bittersweet barnyard tale. She's lending her voice to the indefatigable gray spider, Charlotte, alongside 12-year-old Dakota Fanning, who plays the young girl, Fern, in the live-action movie adaptation, now in theatres.</p>
        <p>With the holidays quickly approaching, the two reunited to talk to LIFE about loyal friends, Christmas traditions, and why "some pig" named Wilbur matters.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LIFE</strong>: What part of <em>Charlotte's Web</em> resonates most with you?</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: The idea of feeling all alone and needing someone to scoop you up and say "I’ll be your friend." Everybody's had a moment where they felt like that, and you wished somebody would come and sit with you at lunch or ask you to the dance.</p>
        <p><strong>FANNING</strong>: There are so many messages about being a loyal friend. Wilbur didn't know Charlotte was going to die, but he treated her so great for the time she was alive.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LIFE</strong>: Do you have a friend who came through for you in a time of need, like Charlotte did for Wilbur?</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: My friend Paige Sampson. When we were growing up together 25 years ago, neither of us had that connected group. We sort of found each other and formed our own group of two.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LIFE</strong>: Where did you find each other?</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: In health class. I told her I liked her outfit. She was wearing a peach top with these three-quarter pants and two little suede belts.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LIFE</strong>: What are some of your favourite children’s books?</p>
        <p><strong>FANNING</strong>: I’ve read most of the classics, like <em>Little Women </em>and <em>The Secret Garden</em>. When I watch <em>Little Women</em>, I’m always like, “If I had gotten to be in that movie, who would I have wanted to play?” Probably the little one, Amy.</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: I remember liking the <em>Frog and Toad Together</em> books and <em>Harry the Dirty Dog</em>. My kids are still too young for them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LIFE</strong>: What are you reading to your kids now?</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: <em>Good Night, Maisy. First Book of Sushi</em>, which they love and we read almost every night.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LIFE</strong>: Did being a mom have anything to do with you signing on for Charlotte's Web?</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: At the time, they were just teeny-tiny new babies, so I didn't think, Oh, one day . . . It was more like, "Charlotte is the spider, right?" I was so not mentally alert at that time in my life. So my husband [cameraman Danny Moder] and I watched the [1973] cartoon, and I remembered loving it as a kid.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LIFE</strong>: Have the twins seen you on the screen at all?</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: I think my son saw me on TV once for a split second and said "Mommy!" But when Hazel sees any mom figure in a book, she says "Mommy".</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LIFE</strong>: A touching part of <em>Charlotte's Web</em> is Fern's love for her family's pig, Wilbur. Do either of you have a pet that's special to you?</p>
        <p><strong>FANNING</strong>: I have a dog, Lewellen, who's a Schnoodle – [part] miniature schnauzer, [part] toy poodle. She's 8 months old, and I love her as much as Fern loved Wilbur. And I have a horse, Goldie [which Kurt Russell gave her after they filmed 2005’s Dreamer]. I ride her on the weekends.</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: I had a dog named Satchmo I loved when I was a kid. He was a basset hound and eventually died, as all good pets do. When I became a grown-up and first moved to [New Mexico], I went to the pound and got a dog – a guy named Diego, who I had for 12 years. He was a mutt and looked like an old coyote. He died two summers ago, and it was devastating to me. He was my best pal.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LIFE</strong>: You're both Georgia-born girls who knit. Are either of you knitting anything for Christmas?</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: I'm currently knitting an orange sweater for myself.</p>
        <p><strong>FANNING</strong>: I'm really bad, because I haven't even knitted my sister [Elle, 8] a scarf.</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: You should get on it. Get yourself some big needles. You know what's fun is knitting a poncho.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LIFE</strong>: What’s your idea of a great Christmas gift?</p>
        <p><strong>FANNING</strong>: Dog and horse stuff. All pink. I'm into my pets.</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: My friend Paige and I are reading a book together, Eat, Pray, Love [by Elizabeth Gilbert], and we keep calling each other, saying "What page are you on?" It's about a woman's sojourn through three countries, and it's fantastic. It's what I'm giving all my girlfriends for Christmas.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LIFE</strong>: Any holiday movies that you love to watch?</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: The <em>Charlie Brown</em> specials are fun.</p>
        <p><strong>FANNING</strong>: Rudolph, every Christmas Eve.</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: It used to be more fun before you had TiVo, when you had to have the TV on at 7:30 and be ready to watch.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LIFE</strong>: What's great about Christmas?</p>
        <p><strong>FANNING</strong>: The present part, but the other parts are so important.</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: I cook until I collapse. I do a big turkey, lots of sides – potatoes, beans, biscuits. And pies and cake. For me, Christmas is a day to eat, relax, and be with your family and your friends.</p>

        <p>With the holidays quickly approaching, the two reunited to talk to LIFE about loyal friends, Christmas traditions, and why "some pig" named Wilbur matters.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LIFE</strong>: What part of <em>Charlotte's Web</em> resonates most with you?</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: The idea of feeling all alone and needing someone to scoop you up and say "I’ll be your friend." Everybody's had a moment where they felt like that, and you wished somebody would come and sit with you at lunch or ask you to the dance.</p>
        <p><strong>FANNING</strong>: There are so many messages about being a loyal friend. Wilbur didn't know Charlotte was going to die, but he treated her so great for the time she was alive.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LIFE</strong>: Do you have a friend who came through for you in a time of need, like Charlotte did for Wilbur?</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: My friend Paige Sampson. When we were growing up together 25 years ago, neither of us had that connected group. We sort of found each other and formed our own group of two.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LIFE</strong>: Where did you find each other?</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: In health class. I told her I liked her outfit. She was wearing a peach top with these three-quarter pants and two little suede belts.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LIFE</strong>: What are some of your favourite children’s books?</p>
        <p><strong>FANNING</strong>: I’ve read most of the classics, like <em>Little Women</em> and <em>The Secret Garden</em>. When I watch <em>Little Women</em>, I’m always like, “If I had gotten to be in that movie, who would I have wanted to play?” Probably the little one, Amy.</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: I remember liking the<em> Frog and Toad Together</em> books and <em>Harry the Dirty Dog</em>. My kids are still too young for them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LIFE</strong>: What are you reading to your kids now?</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: <em>Good Night, Maisy. First Book of Sushi</em>, which they love and we read almost every night.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LIFE</strong>: Did being a mom have anything to do with you signing on for <em>Charlotte's Web</em>?</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: At the time, they were just teeny-tiny new babies, so I didn't think, Oh, one day . . . It was more like, "Charlotte is the spider, right?" I was so not mentally alert at that time in my life. So my husband [cameraman Danny Moder] and I watched the [1973] cartoon, and I remembered loving it as a kid.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LIFE</strong>: Have the twins seen you on the screen at all?</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: I think my son saw me on TV once for a split second and said "Mommy!" But when Hazel sees any mom figure in a book, she says "Mommy".</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LIFE</strong>: A touching part of <em>Charlotte's Web</em> is Fern's love for her family's pig, Wilbur. Do either of you have a pet that's special to you?</p>
        <p><strong>FANNING</strong>: I have a dog, Lewellen, who's a Schnoodle – [part] miniature schnauzer, [part] toy poodle. She's 8 months old, and I love her as much as Fern loved Wilbur. And I have a horse, Goldie [which Kurt Russell gave her after they filmed 2005’s Dreamer]. I ride her on the weekends.</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: I had a dog named Satchmo I loved when I was a kid. He was a basset hound and eventually died, as all good pets do. When I became a grown-up and first moved to [New Mexico], I went to the pound and got a dog – a guy named Diego, who I had for 12 years. He was a mutt and looked like an old coyote. He died two summers ago, and it was devastating to me. He was my best pal.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LIFE</strong>: You're both Georgia-born girls who knit. Are either of you knitting anything for Christmas?</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: I'm currently knitting an orange sweater for myself.</p>
        <p><strong>FANNING</strong>: I'm really bad, because I haven't even knitted my sister [Elle, 8] a scarf.</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: You should get on it. Get yourself some big needles. You know what's fun is knitting a poncho.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LIFE</strong>: What’s your idea of a great Christmas gift?</p>
        <p><strong>FANNING</strong>: Dog and horse stuff. All pink. I'm into my pets.</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: My friend Paige and I are reading a book together, Eat, Pray, Love [by Elizabeth Gilbert], and we keep calling each other, saying "What page are you on?" It's about a woman's sojourn through three countries, and it's fantastic. It's what I'm giving all my girlfriends for Christmas.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LIFE</strong>: Any holiday movies that you love to watch?</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: The <em>Charlie Brown</em> specials are fun.</p>
        <p><strong>FANNING</strong>: Rudolph, every Christmas Eve.</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: It used to be more fun before you had TiVo, when you had to have the TV on at 7:30 and be ready to watch.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>LIFE</strong>: What's great about Christmas?</p>
        <p><strong>FANNING</strong>: The present part, but the other parts are so important.</p>
        <p><strong>ROBERTS</strong>: I cook until I collapse. I do a big turkey, lots of sides – potatoes, beans, biscuits. And pies and cake. For me, Christmas is a day to eat, relax, and be with your family and your friends.</p>

          <strong>Teacher’s Pet</strong>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Ginger,' yelled Mum. 'Hurry up. Mitzi's ready. You're making us late. I'm doing your breakfast. It's on the bench.'</p>
        <p>‘Of course, I'm making us late’, thought Ginger as she hurried into the kitchen. ‘What do you expect when I'm sneezing every two minutes? How can I be on time when there's a cat on my towel, a cat in the dirty washing basket and a cat eating toothpaste?’</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She opened her mouth to say this to Mum, then closed it.</p>
        <p>No point.</p>
        <p>Mum was already Mrs Smith, dashing round the kitchen pouring Ginger's cereal and stuffing things in the dishwasher with one hand and reading a wad of school paperwork clutched in the other.</p>
        <p>Ginger put a spoonful of cereal into her mouth and chewed sadly. Then she gagged, sneezed and sprayed the mouthful over the bench.</p>
        <p>She stared at the soggy pieces in horror.</p>
        <p>'Mum . . .' she groaned.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Before she could say anything else, Dad strode in, also with a fistful of paperwork.</p>
        <p>'Look at this,' said Dad. 'The McKenzie parents have written to the school thanking us for that creative writing project I gave Year Six. The one where I asked them to make up new swearwords. They reckon it's the only project their kids have ever finished.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You're a tweetwobbling genius,' muttered Mum, still reading. 'Oh no, look at this, the Funicellos want to know if Lucrezia can bring a goat to Pets Day.'</p>
        <p>Ginger decided to forget what had happened in the bathroom and with breakfast. She had something much more important to talk about before school started.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Mum,' she said. 'Dad.'</p>
        <p>They didn't even look up. They were both studying a sheet of paper and talking about Andy Malkovich's skin rash.</p>
        <p>'Excuse me,' said Ginger loudly. 'Mr and Mrs Smith.'</p>
        <p>They both looked up, startled.</p>
        <p>Ginger didn't give them a chance to get distracted.</p>
        <p>'Mr Napier reckons he's going to get me transferred,' she said. 'To another school.'</p>
        <p>Ginger held her breath while Mum and Dad looked at each other.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then they both put on their Mr and Mrs Smith faces.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Ginger,' said Mum. 'I'm sure it's not that bad. Mr Napier can be a bit strict, but he's a reasonable man. You know how when teachers get overworked they sometimes say things they don't mean.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'He does mean it,' said Ginger. 'You've got to talk to him.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dad gave a Mr Smith sigh.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I'm sure Mr Napier was only joking,' he said. 'This is another of those tricky ones, Ginger. You know we can't interfere.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Why not?' said Ginger.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You'll understand when you're a bit older,' said Mum. 'Teachers can't go around telling assistant principals how to do their jobs. Not unless it's about something really serious.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'It is really serious,' yelled Ginger.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She turned away in frustration. Madonna and Cher were on top of the stove, watching her with disdain. She could see they didn't think that anything in her life was the slightest bit serious.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'We've discussed this before, pet,' said Mum quietly. 'We can't have people at school thinking we're giving our daughter special treatment.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Fat chance, thought Ginger.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Come on, girls,' said Dad. 'Into the car. Nobody's walking, not until the council does something about these stray dogs.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mum grabbed her briefcase from the kitchen bench, stopped and sighed. 'Pet, you haven't eaten your cereal. Why not?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Because,' said Ginger, pointing to the half chewed prawn-flavoured fragments in the puddles of milk, 'It's cat food.'</p>

        <p>'Ginger,' yelled Mum. 'Hurry up. Mitzi's ready. You're making us late. I'm doing your breakfast. It's on the bench.'</p>
        <p>‘Of course, I'm making us late’, thought Ginger as she hurried into the kitchen. ‘What do you expect when I'm sneezing every two minutes? How can I be on time when there's a cat on my towel, a cat in the dirty washing basket and a cat eating toothpaste?’</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She opened her mouth to say this to Mum, then closed it.</p>
        <p>No point.</p>
        <p>Mum was already Mrs Smith, dashing round the kitchen pouring Ginger's cereal and stuffing things in the dishwasher with one hand and reading a wad of school paperwork clutched in the other.</p>
        <p>Ginger put a spoonful of cereal into her mouth and chewed sadly. Then she gagged, sneezed and sprayed the mouthful over the bench.</p>
        <p>She stared at the soggy pieces in horror.</p>
        <p>'Mum . . .' she groaned.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Before she could say anything else, Dad strode in, also with a fistful of paperwork.</p>
        <p>'Look at this,' said Dad. 'The McKenzie parents have written to the school thanking us for that creative writing project I gave Year Six. The one where I asked them to make up new swearwords. They reckon it's the only project their kids have ever finished.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You're a tweetwobbling genius,' muttered Mum, still reading. 'Oh no, look at this, the Funicellos want to know if Lucrezia can bring a goat to Pets Day.'</p>
        <p>Ginger decided to forget what had happened in the bathroom and with breakfast. She had something much more important to talk about before school started.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Mum,' she said. 'Dad.'</p>
        <p>They didn't even look up. They were both studying a sheet of paper and talking about Andy Malkovich's skin rash.</p>
        <p>'Excuse me,' said Ginger loudly. 'Mr and Mrs Smith.'</p>
        <p>They both looked up, startled.</p>
        <p>Ginger didn't give them a chance to get distracted.</p>
        <p>'Mr Napier reckons he's going to get me transferred,' she said. 'To another school.'</p>
        <p>Ginger held her breath while Mum and Dad looked at each other.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then they both put on their Mr and Mrs Smith faces.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Ginger,' said Mum. 'I'm sure it's not that bad. Mr Napier can be a bit strict, but he's a reasonable man. You know how when teachers get overworked they sometimes say things they don't mean.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'He does mean it,' said Ginger. 'You've got to talk to him.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dad gave a Mr Smith sigh.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I'm sure Mr Napier was only joking,' he said. 'This is another of those tricky ones, Ginger. You know we can't interfere.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Why not?' said Ginger.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You'll understand when you're a bit older,' said Mum. 'Teachers can't go around telling assistant principals how to do their jobs. Not unless it's about something really serious.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'It is really serious,' yelled Ginger.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She turned away in frustration. Madonna and Cher were on top of the stove, watching her with disdain. She could see they didn't think that anything in her life was the slightest bit serious.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'We've discussed this before, pet,' said Mum quietly. 'We can't have people at school thinking we're giving our daughter special treatment.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Fat chance, thought Ginger.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Come on, girls,' said Dad. 'Into the car. Nobody's walking, not until the council does something about these stray dogs.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mum grabbed her briefcase from the kitchen bench, stopped and sighed. 'Pet, you haven't eaten your cereal. Why not?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Because,' said Ginger, pointing to the half chewed prawn-flavoured fragments in the puddles of milk, 'It's cat food.'</p>

        <p>'Ginger,' yelled Mum. 'Hurry up. Mitzi's ready. You're making us late. I'm doing your breakfast. It's on the bench.'</p>
        <p>‘Of course, I'm making us late’, thought Ginger as she hurried into the kitchen. ‘What do you expect when I'm sneezing every two minutes? How can I be on time when there's a cat on my towel, a cat in the dirty washing basket and a cat eating toothpaste?’</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She opened her mouth to say this to Mum, then closed it.</p>
        <p>No point.</p>
        <p>Mum was already Mrs Smith, dashing round the kitchen pouring Ginger's cereal and stuffing things in the dishwasher with one hand and reading a wad of school paperwork clutched in the other.</p>
        <p>Ginger put a spoonful of cereal into her mouth and chewed sadly. Then she gagged, sneezed and sprayed the mouthful over the bench.</p>
        <p>She stared at the soggy pieces in horror.</p>
        <p>'Mum . . .' she groaned.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Before she could say anything else, Dad strode in, also with a fistful of paperwork.</p>
        <p>'Look at this,' said Dad. 'The McKenzie parents have written to the school thanking us for that creative writing project I gave Year Six. The one where I asked them to make up new swearwords. They reckon it's the only project their kids have ever finished.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You're a tweetwobbling genius,' muttered Mum, still reading. 'Oh no, look at this, the Funicellos want to know if Lucrezia can bring a goat to Pets Day.'</p>
        <p>Ginger decided to forget what had happened in the bathroom and with breakfast. She had something much more important to talk about before school started.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Mum,' she said. 'Dad.'</p>
        <p>They didn't even look up. They were both studying a sheet of paper and talking about Andy Malkovich's skin rash.</p>
        <p>'Excuse me,' said Ginger loudly. 'Mr and Mrs Smith.'</p>
        <p>They both looked up, startled.</p>
        <p>Ginger didn't give them a chance to get distracted.</p>
        <p>'Mr Napier reckons he's going to get me transferred,' she said. 'To another school.'</p>
        <p>Ginger held her breath while Mum and Dad looked at each other.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then they both put on their Mr and Mrs Smith faces.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Ginger,' said Mum. 'I'm sure it's not that bad. Mr Napier can be a bit strict, but he's a reasonable man. You know how when teachers get overworked they sometimes say things they don't mean.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'He does mean it,' said Ginger. 'You've got to talk to him.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dad gave a Mr Smith sigh.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I'm sure Mr Napier was only joking,' he said. 'This is another of those tricky ones, Ginger. You know we can't interfere.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Why not?' said Ginger.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You'll understand when you're a bit older,' said Mum. 'Teachers can't go around telling assistant principals how to do their jobs. Not unless it's about something really serious.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'It is really serious,' yelled Ginger.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She turned away in frustration. Madonna and Cher were on top of the stove, watching her with disdain. She could see they didn't think that anything in her life was the slightest bit serious.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'We've discussed this before, pet,' said Mum quietly. 'We can't have people at school thinking we're giving our daughter special treatment.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Fat chance, thought Ginger.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Come on, girls,' said Dad. 'Into the car. Nobody's walking, not until the council does something about these stray dogs.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mum grabbed her briefcase from the kitchen bench, stopped and sighed. 'Pet, you haven't eaten your cereal. Why not?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Because,' said Ginger, pointing to the half chewed prawn-flavoured fragments in the puddles of milk, 'It's cat food.'</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Ginger,' yelled Mum. 'Hurry up. Mitzi's ready. You're making us late. I'm doing your breakfast. It's on the bench.'</p>
        <p>‘Of course, I'm making us late’, thought Ginger as she hurried into the kitchen. ‘What do you expect when I'm sneezing every two minutes? How can I be on time when there's a cat on my towel, a cat in the dirty washing basket and a cat eating toothpaste?’</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She opened her mouth to say this to Mum, then closed it.</p>
        <p>No point.</p>
        <p>Mum was already Mrs Smith, dashing round the kitchen pouring Ginger's cereal and stuffing things in the dishwasher with one hand and reading a wad of school paperwork clutched in the other.</p>
        <p>Ginger put a spoonful of cereal into her mouth and chewed sadly. Then she gagged, sneezed and sprayed the mouthful over the bench.</p>
        <p>She stared at the soggy pieces in horror.</p>
        <p>'Mum . . .' she groaned.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Before she could say anything else, Dad strode in, also with a fistful of paperwork.</p>
        <p>'Look at this,' said Dad. 'The McKenzie parents have written to the school thanking us for that creative writing project I gave Year Six. The one where I asked them to make up new swearwords. They reckon it's the only project their kids have ever finished.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You're a tweetwobbling genius,' muttered Mum, still reading. 'Oh no, look at this, the Funicellos want to know if Lucrezia can bring a goat to Pets Day.'</p>
        <p>Ginger decided to forget what had happened in the bathroom and with breakfast. She had something much more important to talk about before school started.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Mum,' she said. 'Dad.'</p>
        <p>They didn't even look up. They were both studying a sheet of paper and talking about Andy Malkovich's skin rash.</p>
        <p>'Excuse me,' said Ginger loudly. 'Mr and Mrs Smith.'</p>
        <p>They both looked up, startled.</p>
        <p>Ginger didn't give them a chance to get distracted.</p>
        <p>'Mr Napier reckons he's going to get me transferred,' she said. 'To another school.'</p>
        <p>Ginger held her breath while Mum and Dad looked at each other.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then they both put on their Mr and Mrs Smith faces.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Ginger,' said Mum. 'I'm sure it's not that bad. Mr Napier can be a bit strict, but he's a reasonable man. You know how when teachers get overworked they sometimes say things they don't mean.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'He does mean it,' said Ginger. 'You've got to talk to him.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dad gave a Mr Smith sigh.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'I'm sure Mr Napier was only joking,' he said. 'This is another of those tricky ones, Ginger. You know we can't interfere.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Why not?' said Ginger.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You'll understand when you're a bit older,' said Mum. 'Teachers can't go around telling assistant principals how to do their jobs. Not unless it's about something really serious.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'It is really serious,' yelled Ginger.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She turned away in frustration. Madonna and Cher were on top of the stove, watching her with disdain. She could see they didn't think that anything in her life was the slightest bit serious.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'We've discussed this before, pet,' said Mum quietly. 'We can't have people at school thinking we're giving our daughter special treatment.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Fat chance, thought Ginger.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Come on, girls,' said Dad. 'Into the car. Nobody's walking, not until the council does something about these stray dogs.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mum grabbed her briefcase from the kitchen bench, stopped and sighed. 'Pet, you haven't eaten your cereal. Why not?'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Because,' said Ginger, pointing to the half chewed prawn-flavoured fragments in the puddles of milk, 'It's cat food.'</p>

          <strong>King Tutankhamen</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Tutankhamen&nbsp;was&nbsp;a&nbsp;pharaoh of Ancient Egypt during the New Kingdom period. He ruled for only nine years, and died when he was still a teenager. He is famous because his tomb is the only pharaoh's tomb ever to be discovered with all its original treasures.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT TUTANKHAMEN’S LIFE?</span>
        </p>
        <p>Tutankhamen&nbsp;was&nbsp;born&nbsp;around 1346 bc and became pharaoh in 1337 bc when his father-in-law, the pharaoh Akhenaton, died. Akhenaton had become very unpopular because he tried to change the traditional Egyptian way of life. He introduced a new religion to Egypt and built a new capital city at Tell el-Amarna. All that we know about Tutankhamen is that he allowed Egypt to return to its traditional religion, and that he moved the capital back to the city of Thebes (present-day Luxor). We suppose that Tutankhamen was just 18 years old when he died in 1328 bc. Although we know very little about the events of his life, the contents of his tomb have given us a fascinating glimpse of the luxurious lifestyle of an Egyptian pharaoh.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">THE TOMBS OF THE PHARAOHS</span>
        </p>
        <p>During&nbsp;the&nbsp;earlier&nbsp;Middle Kingdom period, pharaohs were usually buried beneath an enormous pyramid.<strong> But pyramids were tempting targets for tomb robbers</strong>. To defeat the tomb robbers, the pharaohs of the New Kingdom decided to be buried in unmarked underground tombs. These tombs were dug in a remote valley across the River Nile from Thebes. This burial site is now known as the Valley of the Kings. Unfortunately, this new burial policy did not work, and all the tombs in the valley were robbed in ancient times. Or so people thought until the beginning of the 1920s.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">FINDING THE TOMB OF TUTANKHAMEN</span>
        </p>
        <p>In&nbsp;1922,&nbsp;the&nbsp;British&nbsp;archaeologist Howard Carter made an amazing discovery in the Valley of the Kings. He uncovered the entrance to a tomb that nobody had noticed. When he cleared all the sand from the entrance, he was amazed to find that the inner door to the tomb was still in one piece. He had discovered a tomb that showed no signs of having been robbed. His discovery made headlines around the world. When the inner door was broken and people looked inside for the first time in more than 3,000 years, they saw incredible treasure.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">FABULOUS FINDS</span>
        </p>
        <p>The&nbsp;outer&nbsp;chamber&nbsp;of&nbsp;the tomb was crammed with carved wooden statues and furniture — chairs, tables and beds — all covered with pure gold. There were chests full of jewellery and beautifully decorated pottery. This treasure by itself was a spectacular discovery, but Carter was convinced that there was more. When the outer chamber had been cleared, he broke through the back wall to discover the inner chamber, which contained the mummified body of the pharaoh.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>­</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">THE GREATEST DISCOVERY</span>
        </p>
        <p>The&nbsp;inner&nbsp;chamber&nbsp;was almost filled by a huge, gold-plated wooden chest. Inside the chest they found a beautifully painted wooden mummy case. Inside was another mummy case, and then another. The innermost case was made of solid gold decorated with precious stones. The golden death mask of Tutankhamen has become one of the most famous images of Ancient Egypt.</p>

          <strong>King Tutankhamen</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Tutankhamen&nbsp;was&nbsp;a&nbsp;pharaoh of Ancient Egypt during the New Kingdom period. He ruled for only nine years, and died when he was still a teenager. He is famous because his tomb is the only pharaoh's tomb ever to be discovered with all its original treasures.</p>

          <span class="txt-underline">WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT TUTANKHAMEN’S LIFE?</span>
        </p>
        <p>Tutankhamen&nbsp;was&nbsp;born&nbsp;around 1346 bc and became pharaoh in 1337 bc when his father-in-law, the pharaoh Akhenaton, died. Akhenaton had become very unpopular because he tried to change the traditional Egyptian way of life. He introduced a new religion to Egypt and built a new capital city at Tell el-Amarna. All that we know about Tutankhamen is that he allowed Egypt to return to its traditional religion, and that he moved the capital back to the city of Thebes (present-day Luxor). We suppose that Tutankhamen was just 18 years old when he died in 1328 bc. Although we know very little about the events of his life, the contents of his tomb have given us a fascinating glimpse of the luxurious lifestyle of an Egyptian pharaoh.</p>

          <span class="txt-underline">THE TOMBS OF THE PHARAOHS</span>
        </p>
        <p>During&nbsp;the&nbsp;earlier&nbsp;Middle Kingdom period, pharaohs were usually buried beneath an enormous pyramid. <strong>But pyramids were tempting targets for tomb robbers.</strong> To defeat the tomb robbers, the pharaohs of the New Kingdom decided to be buried in unmarked underground tombs. These tombs were dug in a remote valley across the River Nile from Thebes. This burial site is now known as the Valley of the Kings. Unfortunately, this new burial policy did not work, and all the tombs in the valley were robbed in ancient times. Or so people thought until the beginning of the 1920s.</p>

        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">FINDING THE TOMB OF TUTANKHAMEN</span>
        </p>
        <p>In&nbsp;1922,&nbsp;the&nbsp;British&nbsp;archaeologist Howard Carter made an amazing discovery in the Valley of the Kings. He uncovered the entrance to a tomb that nobody had noticed. When he cleared all the sand from the entrance, he was amazed to find that the inner door to the tomb was still in one piece. He had discovered a tomb that showed no signs of having been robbed. His discovery made headlines around the world. When the inner door was broken and people looked inside for the first time in more than 3,000 years, they saw incredible treasure.</p>

        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">FABULOUS FINDS</span>
        </p>
        <p>The&nbsp;outer&nbsp;chamber&nbsp;of&nbsp;the tomb was crammed with carved wooden statues and furniture — chairs, tables and beds — all covered with pure gold. There were chests full of jewellery and beautifully decorated pottery. This treasure by itself was a spectacular discovery, but Carter was convinced that there was more. When the outer chamber had been cleared, he broke through the back wall to discover the inner chamber, which contained the mummified body of the pharaoh.</p>

          <span class="txt-underline">THE GREATEST DISCOVERY</span>
        </p>
        <p>The&nbsp;inner&nbsp;chamber&nbsp;was almost filled by a huge, gold-plated wooden chest. Inside the chest they found a beautifully painted wooden mummy case. Inside was another mummy case, and then another. The innermost case was made of solid gold decorated with precious stones. The golden death mask of Tutankhamen has become one of the most famous images of Ancient Egypt.</p>

        <p>During&nbsp;the&nbsp;earlier&nbsp;Middle Kingdom period, pharaohs were usually buried beneath an enormous pyramid. <strong>But pyramids were tempting targets for tomb robbers</strong>. To defeat the tomb robbers, the pharaohs of the New Kingdom decided to be buried in unmarked underground tombs. These tombs were dug in a remote valley across the River Nile from Thebes. This burial site is now known as the Valley of the Kings. Unfortunately, this new burial policy did not work, and all the tombs in the valley were robbed in ancient times. Or so people thought until the beginning of the 1920s.</p>

        </p>
        <p>In&nbsp;1922,&nbsp;the&nbsp;British&nbsp;archaeologist Howard Carter made an amazing discovery in the Valley of the Kings. He uncovered the entrance to a tomb that nobody had noticed. When he cleared all the sand from the entrance, he was amazed to find that the inner door to the tomb was still in one piece. He had discovered a tomb that showed no signs of having been robbed. His discovery made headlines around the world. When the inner door was broken and people looked inside for the first time in more than 3,000 years, they saw incredible treasure.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The&nbsp;outer&nbsp;chamber&nbsp;of&nbsp;the tomb was crammed with carved wooden statues and furniture — chairs, tables and beds — all covered with pure gold. There were chests full of jewellery and beautifully decorated pottery. This treasure by itself was a spectacular discovery, but Carter was convinced that there was more. When the outer chamber had been cleared, he broke through the back wall to discover the inner chamber, which contained the mummified body of the pharaoh.</p>

        <p>The&nbsp;inner&nbsp;chamber&nbsp;was almost filled by a huge, gold-plated wooden chest. Inside the chest they found a beautifully painted wooden mummy case. Inside was another mummy case, and then another. The innermost case was made of solid gold decorated with precious stones. The golden death mask of Tutankhamen has become one of the most famous images of Ancient Egypt.</p>

          <strong>King Tutankhamen</strong>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Tutankhamen&nbsp;was&nbsp;a&nbsp;pharaoh of Ancient Egypt during the New Kingdom period. He ruled for only nine years, and died when he was still a teenager. He is famous because his tomb is the only pharaoh's tomb ever to be discovered with all its original treasures.</p>

          <span class="txt-underline">WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT TUTANKHAMEN’S LIFE?</span>
        </p>
        <p>Tutankhamen&nbsp;was&nbsp;born&nbsp;around 1346 bc and became pharaoh in 1337 bc when his father-in-law, the pharaoh Akhenaton, died. Akhenaton had become very unpopular because he tried to change the traditional Egyptian way of life. He introduced a new religion to Egypt and built a new capital city at Tell el-Amarna. All that we know about Tutankhamen is that he allowed Egypt to return to its traditional religion, and that he moved the capital back to the city of Thebes (present-day Luxor). We suppose that Tutankhamen was just 18 years old when he died in 1328 bc. Although we know very little about the events of his life, the contents of his tomb have given us a fascinating glimpse of the luxurious lifestyle of an Egyptian pharaoh.</p>
