          <strong>The Negro Mother</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Langston Hughes</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Children, I come back today<br>
To tell you a story of the long dark way<br>
That I had to climb, that I had to know<br>
In order that the race might live and grow.<br>
Look at my face – dark as the night –<br>
Yet shining like the sun with love's true light.<br>
I am the dark girl who crossed the red sea<br>
Carrying in my body the seed of the free.<br>
I am the woman who worked in the field<br>
Bringing the cotton and the corn to yield.<br>
I am the one who laboured as a slave,<br>
Beaten and mistreated for the work that I gave –<br>
Children sold away from me, I'm husband sold, too.<br>
No safety, no love, no respect was I due.<br>
<br>
Three hundred years in the deepest South:<br>
But God put a song and a prayer in my mouth.<br>
God put a dream like steel in my soul.<br>
Now, through my children, I'm reaching the goal.<br>
Now, through my children, young and free,<br>
I realised the blessing deed to me.<br>
I couldn't read then. I couldn't write.<br>
I had nothing, back there in the night.<br>
Sometimes, the valley was filled with tears,<br>
But I kept trudging on through the lonely years.<br>
Sometimes, the road was hot with the sun,<br>
But I had to keep on till my work was done:<br>
I had to keep on! No stopping for me –<br>
I was the seed of the coming Free.<br>
I nourished the dream that nothing could smother<br>
Deep in my breast – the Negro mother.<br>
I had only hope then, but now through you,<br>
Dark ones of today, my dreams must come true:<br>
All you dark children in the world out there,<br>
Remember my sweat, my pain, my despair.<br>
Remember my years, heavy with sorrow –<br>
And make of those years a torch for tomorrow.<br>
Make of my pass a road to the light<br>
Out of the darkness, the ignorance, the night.<br>
Lift high my banner out of the dust.<br>
Stand like free men supporting my trust.<br>
Believe in the right, let none push you back.<br>
Remember the whip and the slaver's track.<br>
Remember how the strong in struggle and strife<br>
Still bar you the way, and deny you life –<br>
But march ever forward, breaking down bars.<br>
Look ever upward at the sun and the stars.<br>
Oh, my dark children, may my dreams and my prayers<br>
Impel you forever up the great stairs –<br>
For I will be with you till no white brother<br>
Dares keep down the children of the Negro Mother.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Jade’s Story: A Two-way Street</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Melissa Baker (Sydney, 2003)</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In our society today we have become far too complacent and our eyes are shut off to what is happening around us. Perhaps this has something to do with the state of affairs in the world in this present age and the need to protect ourselves, but in the midst of this there are people who need our protection, our love, our acceptance, our friendly face, our smile. So often those who live on the other side of the street (that is those who do not live like the majority of the population) do not experience these things. They do not have protection. They are asked to leave. No one loves them, accepts them, and many do not smile and offer a friendly face in their time of need.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It is not easy to be accepting of others who are different from ourselves. In forty-nine countries around the world, Melissa has met many people in her travels, from business people to tourists, from families to children, from the lonely to the elderly, from the poor to the homeless. Most see life as a one-way street, some sit in the middle of the two, and very few are willing to reach out and help.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This book is based on Melissa's personal story. A story that reaches into the depths of forgiveness, grace, and restoration, saved from a world of drugs, suicide, and living on the streets of Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>The book is divided into three sections:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span class="txt-underline">Section 1:</span> Sleeping under the bridge</p>
        <p>Written in third person, under the name 'Jade Michaels', Melissa takes the reader through two extraordinary years of her life and flashbacks to her childhood memories. Melissa's journey also brings out physical, emotional and sexual abuse, trauma, &amp; demonstrates that life was once on the verge of death.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span class="txt-underline">Section 2:</span> Between bridges</p>
        <p>The story continues on, but illustrates that life is found in death. Trust, faith, love and forgiveness are core to the story and how transformation and restoration took place in Melissa's life.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span class="txt-underline">Section 3:</span> Builder of the bridge</p>
        <p>This section becomes a workbook. Melissa has developed six bridge building tools so that readers can engage with her story, their story (or a friend's story), and learn new insights in their life by engaging with their mind, body and heart. The tools can be used privately, one on one, or in group sessions. The six bridge building tools are: story, questions, music, theatre, drawing, and objects. This section intertwines further with Melissa's story, now in first person, exercises to complete, and ten reflective listening songs (available on CD).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>About the author: Rev Melissa Baker is an adult educator and pastoral carer. She regularly attends and ministers at Ryde Baptist church, Sydney.</p>

          <strong>Jade’s Story: A Two-way Street</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Melissa Baker (Sydney, 2003)</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In our society today we have become far too complacent and our eyes are shut off to what is happening around us. Perhaps this has something to do with the state of affairs in the world in this present age and the need to protect ourselves, but in the midst of this there are people who need our protection, our love, our acceptance, our friendly face, our smile. So often those who live on the other side of the street (that is those who do not live like the majority of the population) do not experience these things. They do not have protection. They are asked to leave. No one loves them, accepts them, and many do not smile and offer a friendly face in their time of need.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It is not easy to be accepting of others who are different from ourselves. In forty-nine countries around the world, Melissa has met many people in her travels, from business people to tourists, from families to children, from the lonely to the elderly, from the poor to the homeless. Most see life as a one-way street, some sit in the middle of the two, and very few are willing to reach out and help.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This book is based on Melissa's personal story. A story that reaches into the depths of forgiveness, grace, and restoration, saved from a world of drugs, suicide, and living on the streets of Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>The book is divided into three sections:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span class="txt-underline">Section 1:</span> Sleeping under the bridge</p>
        <p>Written in third person, under the name 'Jade Michaels', Melissa takes the reader through two extraordinary years of her life and flashbacks to her childhood memories. Melissa's journey also brings out physical, emotional and sexual abuse, trauma, &amp; demonstrates that life was once on the verge of death.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span class="txt-underline">Section 2:</span> Between bridges</p>
        <p>The story continues on, but illustrates that life is found in death. Trust, faith, love and forgiveness are core to the story and how transformation and restoration took place in Melissa's life.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span class="txt-underline">Section 3:</span> Builder of the bridge</p>
        <p>This section becomes a workbook. Melissa has developed six bridge building tools so that readers can engage with her story, their story (or a friend's story), and learn new insights in their life by engaging with their mind, body and heart. The tools can be used privately, one on one, or in group sessions. The six bridge building tools are: story, questions, music, theatre, drawing, and objects. This section intertwines further with Melissa's story, now in first person, exercises to complete, and ten reflective listening songs (available on CD).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>About the author: Rev Melissa Baker is an adult educator and pastoral carer. She regularly attends and ministers at Ryde Baptist church, Sydney.</p>

          <strong>Jade’s Story: A Two-way Street</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Melissa Baker (Sydney, 2003)</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In our society today we have become far too complacent and our eyes are shut off to what is happening around us. Perhaps this has something to do with the state of affairs in the world in this present age and the need to protect ourselves, but in the midst of this there are people who need our protection, our love, our acceptance, our friendly face, our smile. So often those who live on the other side of the street (that is those who do not live like the majority of the population) do not experience these things. They do not have protection. They are asked to leave. No one loves them, accepts them, and many do not smile and offer a friendly face in their time of need.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It is not easy to be accepting of others who are different from ourselves. In forty-nine countries around the world, Melissa has met many people in her travels, from business people to tourists, from families to children, from the lonely to the elderly, from the poor to the homeless. Most see life as a one-way street, some sit in the middle of the two, and very few are willing to reach out and help.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This book is based on Melissa's personal story. A story that reaches into the depths of forgiveness, grace, and restoration, saved from a world of drugs, suicide, and living on the streets of Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>The book is divided into three sections:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span class="txt-underline">Section 1:</span> Sleeping under the bridge</p>
        <p>Written in third person, under the name 'Jade Michaels', Melissa takes the reader through two extraordinary years of her life and flashbacks to her childhood memories. Melissa's journey also brings out physical, emotional and sexual abuse, trauma, &amp; demonstrates that life was once on the verge of death.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span class="txt-underline">Section 2:</span> Between bridges</p>
        <p>The story continues on, but illustrates that life is found in death. Trust, faith, love and forgiveness are core to the story and how transformation and restoration took place in Melissa's life.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span class="txt-underline">Section 3:</span> Builder of the bridge</p>
        <p>This section becomes a workbook. Melissa has developed six bridge building tools so that readers can engage with her story, their story (or a friend's story), and learn new insights in their life by engaging with their mind, body and heart. The tools can be used privately, one on one, or in group sessions. The six bridge building tools are: story, questions, music, theatre, drawing, and objects. This section intertwines further with Melissa's story, now in first person, exercises to complete, and ten reflective listening songs (available on CD).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>About the author: Rev Melissa Baker is an adult educator and pastoral carer. She regularly attends and ministers at Ryde Baptist church, Sydney.</p>

Melissa has developed six bridge building tools so that readers can engage with her story, their story (or a friend's story), and learn new insights in their life by engaging with their mind, body and heart. The tools can be used privately, one on one, or in group sessions. The six bridge building tools are: story, questions, music, theatre, drawing, and objects. This section intertwines further with Melissa's story, now in first person, exercises to complete, and ten reflective listening songs (available on CD).</p>

          <strong>Jade’s Story: A Two-way Street</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Melissa Baker (Sydney, 2003)</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In our society today we have become far too complacent and our eyes are shut off to what is happening around us. Perhaps this has something to do with the state of affairs in the world in this present age and the need to protect ourselves, but in the midst of this there are people who need our protection, our love, our acceptance, our friendly face, our smile. So often those who live on the other side of the street (that is those who do not live like the majority of the population) do not experience these things. They do not have protection. They are asked to leave. No one loves them, accepts them, and many do not smile and offer a friendly face in their time of need.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It is not easy to be accepting of others who are different from ourselves. In forty-nine countries around the world, Melissa has met many people in her travels, from business people to tourists, from families to children, from the lonely to the elderly, from the poor to the homeless. Most see life as a one-way street, some sit in the middle of the two, and very few are willing to reach out and help.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This book is based on Melissa's personal story. A story that reaches into the depths of forgiveness, grace, and restoration, saved from a world of drugs, suicide, and living on the streets of Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>The book is divided into three sections:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span class="txt-underline">Section 1:</span> Sleeping under the bridge</p>
        <p>Written in third person, under the name 'Jade Michaels', Melissa takes the reader through two extraordinary years of her life and flashbacks to her childhood memories. Melissa's journey also brings out physical, emotional and sexual abuse, trauma, &amp; demonstrates that life was once on the verge of death.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span class="txt-underline">Section 2:</span> Between bridges</p>
        <p>The story continues on, but illustrates that life is found in death. Trust, faith, love and forgiveness are core to the story and how transformation and restoration took place in Melissa's life.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span class="txt-underline">Section 3:</span> Builder of the bridge</p>
        <p>This section becomes a workbook. Melissa has developed six bridge building tools so that readers can engage with her story, their story (or a friend's story), and learn new insights in their life by engaging with their mind, body and heart. The tools can be used privately, one on one, or in group sessions. The six bridge building tools are: story, questions, music, theatre, drawing, and objects.
