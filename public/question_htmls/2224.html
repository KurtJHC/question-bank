        </p>
        <p>By evening Perrault secured another dog, an old husky, long and lean and gaunt, with a battle-scarred face and a single eye which flashed a warning of prowess that commanded respect. He was called Sol-leks, which means the Angry One. Like Dave, he asked nothing, gave nothing, expected nothing; and when he marched slowly and deliberately into their midst, even Spitz left him alone. He had one peculiarity which Buck was unlucky enough to discover. He did not like to be approached on his blind side. Of this offence Buck was unwittingly guilty, and the first knowledge he had of his indiscretion was when Sol-leks whirled upon him and slashed his shoulder to the bone for three inches up and down. Forever after Buck avoided his blind side, and to the last of their comradeship had no more trouble. His only apparent ambition, like Dave’s, was to be left alone; though, as Buck was afterward to learn, each of them possessed one other and even more vital ambition.</p>
        <p>That night Buck faced the great problem of sleeping. The tent, illumined by a candle, glowed warmly in the midst of the white plain; and when he, as a matter of course, entered it, both Perrault and François bombarded him with curses and cooking utensils, till he recovered from his consternation and fled ignominiously into the outer cold. A chill wind was blowing that nipped him sharply and bit with especial venom into his wounded shoulder. He lay down on the snow and attempted to sleep, but the frost soon drove him shivering to his feet. Miserable and disconsolate, he wandered about among the many tents, only to find that one place was as cold as another. Here and there savage dogs rushed upon him, but he bristled his neck-hair and snarled (for he was learning fast), and they let him go his way unmolested.</p>
        <p>Finally an idea came to him. He would return and see how his own team-mates were making out. To his astonishment, they had disappeared. Again he wandered about through the great camp, looking for them, and again he returned. Were they in the tent? No, that could not be, else he would not have been driven out. Then where could they possibly be? With drooping tail and shivering body, very forlorn indeed, he aimlessly circled the tent. Suddenly the snow gave way beneath his fore legs and he sank down. Something wriggled under his feet. He sprang back, bristling and snarling, fearful of the unseen and unknown. But a friendly little yelp reassured him, and he went back to investigate. A whiff of warm air ascended to his nostrils, and there, curled up under the snow in a snug ball, lay Billee. He whined placatingly, squirmed and wriggled to show his good will and intentions, and even ventured, as a bribe for peace, to lick Buck’s face with his warm wet tongue.</p>
        <p>Another lesson. So that was the way they did it, eh? Buck confidently selected a spot, and with much fuss and waste effort proceeded to dig a hole for himself. In a trice the heat from his body filled the confined space and he was asleep. The day had been long and arduous, and he slept soundly and comfortably, though he growled and barked and wrestled with bad dreams.</p>
        <p>Nor did he open his eyes till roused by the noises of the waking camp. At first he did not know where he was. It had snowed during the night and he was completely buried. The snow walls pressed him on every side, and a great surge of fear swept through him—the fear of the wild thing for the trap. It was a token that he was harking back through his own life to the lives of his forebears; for he was a civilized dog, an unduly civilized dog, and of his own experience knew no trap and so could not of himself fear it. The muscles of his whole body contracted spasmodically and instinctively, the hair on his neck and shoulders stood on end, and with a ferocious snarl he bounded straight up <span class="txt-underline"><strong>into the blinding day</strong></span>, the snow flying about him in a flashing cloud. Ere he landed on his feet, he saw the white camp spread out before him and knew where he was and remembered all that had passed from the time he went for a stroll with Manuel to the hole he had dug for himself the night before.</p>

          <em>Read the extract below then answer the questions.</em>
        </p>
        <p>By evening Perrault secured another dog, an old husky, long and lean and gaunt, with a battle-scarred face and a single eye which flashed a warning of prowess that commanded respect. He was called Sol-leks, which means the Angry One. Like Dave, he asked nothing, gave nothing, expected nothing; and when he marched slowly and deliberately into their midst, even Spitz left him alone. He had one peculiarity which Buck was unlucky enough to discover. He did not like to be approached on his blind side. Of this offence Buck was unwittingly guilty, and the first knowledge he had of his indiscretion was when Sol-leks whirled upon him and slashed his shoulder to the bone for three inches up and down. Forever after Buck avoided his blind side, and to the last of their comradeship had no more trouble. His only apparent ambition, like Dave’s, was to be left alone; though, as Buck was afterward to learn, each of them possessed one other and even more vital ambition.</p>
        <p>That night Buck faced the great problem of sleeping. The tent, illumined by a candle, glowed warmly in the midst of the white plain; and when he, as a matter of course, entered it, both Perrault and François bombarded him with curses and cooking utensils, till he recovered from his consternation and fled ignominiously into the outer cold. A chill wind was blowing that nipped him sharply and bit with especial venom into his wounded shoulder. He lay down on the snow and attempted to sleep, but the frost soon drove him shivering to his feet. Miserable and disconsolate, he wandered about among the many tents, only to find that one place was as cold as another. Here and there savage dogs rushed upon him, but he bristled his neck-hair and snarled (for he was learning fast), and they let him go his way unmolested.</p>
        <p>Finally an idea came to him. He would return and see how his own team-mates were making out. To his astonishment, they had disappeared. Again he wandered about through the great camp, looking for them, and again he returned. Were they in the tent? No, that could not be, else he would not have been driven out. Then where could they possibly be? With drooping tail and shivering body, very forlorn indeed, he aimlessly circled the tent. Suddenly the snow gave way beneath his fore legs and he sank down. Something wriggled under his feet. He sprang back, bristling and snarling, fearful of the unseen and unknown. But a friendly little yelp reassured him, and he went back to investigate. A whiff of warm air ascended to his nostrils, and there, curled up under the snow in a snug ball, lay Billee. He whined placatingly, squirmed and wriggled to show his good will and intentions, and even ventured, as a bribe for peace, to lick Buck’s face with his warm wet tongue.</p>
        <p>Another lesson. So that was the way they did it, eh? Buck confidently selected a spot, and with much fuss and waste effort proceeded to dig a hole for himself. In a trice the heat from his body filled the confined space and he was asleep. The day had been long and arduous, and he slept soundly and comfortably, though he growled and barked and wrestled with bad dreams.</p>
        <p>Nor did he open his eyes till roused by the noises of the waking camp. At first he did not know where he was. It had snowed during the night and he was completely buried. The snow walls pressed him on every side, and a great surge of fear swept through him—the fear of the wild thing for the trap. It was a token that he was harking back through his own life to the lives of his forebears; for he was a civilized dog, an unduly civilized dog, and of his own experience knew no trap and so could not of himself fear it. The muscles of his whole body contracted spasmodically and instinctively, the hair on his neck and shoulders stood on end, and with a ferocious snarl he bounded straight up <span class="txt-underline"><strong>into the blinding day</strong></span>, the snow flying about him in a flashing cloud. Ere he landed on his feet, he saw the white camp spread out before him and knew where he was and remembered all that had passed from the time he went for a stroll with Manuel to the hole he had dug for himself the night before.</p>

          <em>Read the extract below then answer the questions.</em>
        </p>
        <p>By evening Perrault secured another dog, an old husky, long and lean and gaunt, with a battle-scarred face and a single eye which flashed a warning of prowess that commanded respect. He was called Sol-leks, which means the Angry One. Like Dave, he asked nothing, gave nothing, expected nothing; and when he marched slowly and deliberately into their midst, even Spitz left him alone. He had one peculiarity which Buck was unlucky enough to discover. He did not like to be approached on his blind side. Of this offence Buck was unwittingly guilty, and the first knowledge he had of his indiscretion was when Sol-leks whirled upon him and slashed his shoulder to the bone for three inches up and down. Forever after Buck avoided his blind side, and to the last of their comradeship had no more trouble. His only apparent ambition, like Dave’s, was to be left alone; though, as Buck was afterward to learn, each of them possessed one other and even more vital ambition.</p>
        <p>That night Buck faced the great problem of sleeping. The tent, illumined by a candle, glowed warmly in the midst of the white plain; and when he, as a matter of course, entered it, both Perrault and François bombarded him with curses and cooking utensils, till he recovered from his consternation and fled ignominiously into the outer cold. A chill wind was blowing that nipped him sharply and bit with especial venom into his wounded shoulder. He lay down on the snow and attempted to sleep, but the frost soon drove him shivering to his feet. Miserable and disconsolate, he wandered about among the many tents, only to find that one place was as cold as another. Here and there savage dogs rushed upon him, but he bristled his neck-hair and snarled (for he was learning fast), and they let him go his way unmolested.</p>
        <p>Finally an idea came to him. He would return and see how his own team-mates were making out. To his astonishment, they had disappeared. Again he wandered about through the great camp, looking for them, and again he returned. Were they in the tent? No, that could not be, else he would not have been driven out. Then where could they possibly be? With drooping tail and shivering body, very forlorn indeed, he aimlessly circled the tent. Suddenly the snow gave way beneath his fore legs and he sank down. Something wriggled under his feet. He sprang back, bristling and snarling, fearful of the unseen and unknown. But a friendly little yelp reassured him, and he went back to investigate. A whiff of warm air ascended to his nostrils, and there, curled up under the snow in a snug ball, lay Billee. He whined placatingly, squirmed and wriggled to show his good will and intentions, and even ventured, as a bribe for peace, to lick Buck’s face with his warm wet tongue.</p>
        <p>Another lesson. So that was the way they did it, eh? Buck confidently selected a spot, and with much fuss and waste effort proceeded to dig a hole for himself. In a trice the heat from his body filled the confined space and he was asleep. The day had been long and arduous, and he slept soundly and comfortably, though he growled and barked and wrestled with bad dreams.</p>
        <p>Nor did he open his eyes till roused by the noises of the waking camp. At first he did not know where he was. It had snowed during the night and he was completely buried. The snow walls pressed him on every side, and a great surge of fear swept through him—the fear of the wild thing for the trap. It was a token that he was harking back through his own life to the lives of his forebears; for he was a civilized dog, an unduly civilized dog, and of his own experience knew no trap and so could not of himself fear it. The muscles of his whole body contracted spasmodically and instinctively, the hair on his neck and shoulders stood on end, and with a ferocious snarl he bounded straight up <span class="txt-underline"><strong>into the blinding day</strong></span>, the snow flying about him in a flashing cloud. Ere he landed on his feet, he saw the white camp spread out before him and knew where he was and remembered all that had passed from the time he went for a stroll with Manuel to the hole he had dug for himself the night before.</p>

        <p><em>Read the poem by Henry Lawson below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>Faces In The Street</strong><br><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;They lie, the men who tell us, for reasons of their own,<br>
That want is here a stranger, and that misery’s unknown;<br>
For where the nearest suburb and the city proper meet<br>
My windowsill is level with the faces in the street<br>
Drifting past, drifting past,<br>
To the beat of weary feet<br>
While I sorrow for the owners of the faces in the street.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;And cause I have to sorrow, in a land so young and fair,<br>
To see upon those faces stamped with marks of Want and Care;<br>
I look in vain for traces of the fresh and fair and sweet<br>
In sallow, sunken faces that are drifting through the street<br>
Drifting on, drifting on,<br>
To escape the restless feet;<br>
I can sorrow for the owners of the faces in the street.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In hours before the dawning dims the starlight in the sky<br>
The wan and weary faces first begin to trickle by,<br>
Increasing as the moments hurry on with morning feet,<br>
Till like a pallid river flow the faces in the street<br>
Flowing in, flowing in,<br>
To the beat of hurried feet<br>
Ah! I sorrow for the owners of those faces in the street.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The human river dwindles when ‘tis past the hour of eight,<br>
Its waves go flowing faster in the fear of being late;<br>
But slowly drag the moments, whilst beneath the dust and heat<br>
The city grinds the owners of the faces in the street<br>
Grinding body, grinding soul<br>
Yielding scarce enough to eat<br>
Oh! I sorrow for the owners of the faces in the street.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp;They lie, the men who tell us, for reasons of their own,<br>
That want is here a stranger, and that misery’s unknown;<br>
For where the nearest suburb and the city proper meet<br>
My windowsill is level with the faces in the street<br>
Drifting past, drifting past,<br>
To the beat of weary feet<br>
While I sorrow for the owners of the faces in the street.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;And cause I have to sorrow, in a land so young and fair,<br>
To see upon those faces stamped with marks of Want and Care;<br>
I look in vain for traces of the fresh and fair and sweet<br>
In sallow, sunken faces that are drifting through the street<br>
Drifting on, drifting on,<br>
To escape the restless feet;<br>
I can sorrow for the owners of the faces in the street.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In hours before the dawning dims the starlight in the sky<br>
The wan and weary faces first begin to trickle by,<br>
Increasing as the moments hurry on with morning feet,<br>
Till like a pallid river flow the faces in the street<br>
Flowing in, flowing in,<br>
To the beat of hurried feet<br>
Ah! I sorrow for the owners of those faces in the street.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The human river dwindles when ‘tis past the hour of eight,<br>
Its waves go flowing faster in the fear of being late;<br>
But slowly drag the moments, whilst beneath the dust and heat<br>
The city grinds the owners of the faces in the street<br>
Grinding body, grinding soul<br>
Yielding scarce enough to eat<br>
Oh! I sorrow for the owners of the faces in the street.<br>

Drifting on, drifting on,<br>
To escape the restless feet;<br>
I can sorrow for the owners of the faces in the street.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In hours before the dawning dims the starlight in the sky<br>
The wan and weary faces first begin to trickle by,<br>
Increasing as the moments hurry on with morning feet,<br>
Till like a pallid river flow the faces in the street<br>
Flowing in, flowing in,<br>
To the beat of hurried feet<br>
Ah! I sorrow for the owners of those faces in the street.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The human river dwindles when ‘tis past the hour of eight,<br>
Its waves go flowing faster in the fear of being late;<br>
But slowly drag the moments, whilst beneath the dust and heat<br>
The city grinds the owners of the faces in the street<br>
Grinding body, grinding soul<br>
Yielding scarce enough to eat<br>
Oh! I sorrow for the owners of the faces in the street.<br>

        <p><strong>Read the text below. Six sentences&nbsp;have been removed from this text so that there are six gaps.</strong><br><br><strong>The Invention of the Wheel</strong><br><br>
The invention of the wheel is often associated with modern vehicles or ancient Roman chariots, but the earliest wheels were significantly different. The wheel was invented by the ancient Sumerians, who lived in Mesopotamia, an area now part of modern-day Iraq. <strong>(A)</strong>&nbsp;…………… Extensive studies of their writings have revealed that they were also the inventors of the wheel. Initially, the wheel emerged from the Sumerians’ creation of the potter’s wheel around 3500 B.C. This was a heavy, flat disk made of hardened clay, spun horizontally to shape wet clay into pots and jars.</p>
        <p>The Sumerians’ innovation did not stop with the potter’s wheel. They eventually created what can be considered the first wheel by making man-made logs. These logs were used to roll heavy objects by placing the objects on the logs and rolling them forward. Due to a lack of large trees, the Sumerians fashioned logs from flat planks of wood, chiseled into curved shapes to facilitate rolling. <strong>(B)</strong>&nbsp;…………… However, it was clear that they needed a more efficient solution for moving heavy loads, which led to further innovations.</p>
        <p>Next, the Sumerians invented the “sledge,” a device without rollers, which resembled a large sled with curved runners. <strong>(C)</strong>&nbsp;………… When the terrain became challenging, the sledge often caught on obstacles. To improve this, the Sumerians combined the sledge with their roller concept, placing the sledge on top of rollers to aid movement. While this worked well on flat ground, it struggled on inclines as the runners tended to slip off the rollers, causing the load to tip over.</p>
        <p>To address these issues, the Sumerians refined their design by cutting grooves into the rollers where the runners of the sledge would sit. This grooved roller significantly improved the stability of the load. Yet, transporting the heavy rollers themselves was still cumbersome. The Sumerians then had the idea to reduce the roller to just its ends, connected by a narrower axle. <strong>(D)</strong>&nbsp;…………… They added pegs to keep the sledge in place on the axle, resulting in a more manageable and efficient design.</p>
        <p>The final iteration of the Sumerian wheel included attaching the axle directly to the sledge using wooden bearings. This development created a more robust and reliable cart, which laid the groundwork for the chariots and wheeled vehicles used by subsequent civilizations. <strong>(E)</strong>&nbsp;…………… The Sumerians’ persistence and ingenuity in refining the wheel design revolutionized human society. It made it one of the most critical inventions in history.</p>
        <p>Over time, other civilizations adopted and improved upon the Sumerian wheel. The Egyptians, Assyrians, Greeks, and Romans all contributed to the wheel’s evolution, each adding their unique enhancements. The wheel became essential for various purposes, from transportation to warfare. <strong>(F)</strong>&nbsp;…………… Despite these advancements, the fundamental principles established by the Sumerians remained integral to the wheel’s function and utility.</p>

<br>
Following your dreams isn’t always the answer. We are all beaten over the head that we should always follow our dreams, always pursue our passions, and always turn reality into what we believe will make us happy. Most marketing and advertising is based on this. The majority of the self-help industry pushes this. With the ‘lifestyle design’ and ‘self improvement’ obsession of this generation, it has become a borderline religion. The act of creating and defining one’s own life is viewed as some sort of salvation, while remaining trapped within the confines of traditional society, is seen as some kind of hell. But this isn’t necessarily rock-hard capital-T truth. In fact, it’s largely a cultural belief. The entire modus operandi (manner of operating) of the United States was the idea that any person can achieve what they desire assuming that they work hard enough. Individuality and originality have been successfully marketed to us in the past century to the point of parody. We’re told that such-and-such shaving cream will make us ‘our own man’ and that driving a mass-produced sports car is the best way to express ourselves.<br>

<br>
Dreams never lie. Dreams tell you what you really know about something: what you really feel. They point you towards what you need for growth, integration, expression, and the health of your relationships with people, places, and things. They can help you fine-tune your direction and show you your unfinished business. They’re ‘meaning machines’ and they never lie. Author Tom Robbins once said that dreams don’t come true; they are true. When we talk about our dreams coming true, we’re talking about our ambitions. Dreaming is ultimately about awakening to your real self.<br>

<br>
If you didn’t know, dreaming has been tied to our ability as humans to creatively problem solve, as we can recount the challenges in our minds while we sleep. There is plenty of literature in the field of sleep studies that shows how, when we sleep, we replay our memories during non-REM sleep, but we also incorporate and integrate the new information with the old knowledge frameworks. In other words, we take our memories and compare situations to our past knowledge. This can be invaluable for problem-solving, but it also shows just how creative we can become as a result of dreaming. The more that we prioritise sleep, the better we can problem-solve creatively, relate our current troubles to our past situations, and then proceed forward with confidence. However, creativity and dreaming are also connected because of how dreaming facilitates unrestricted thoughts. When we dream, we think abstractly. Dreaming is tied to creativity not only because it encourages creative problem-solving, but also because it can help us think abstractly with no restrictions of conformed thinking.<br>

<br>
We’ve heard of many instances where premonitions and dreams became reality. Abraham Lincoln, for instance, reportedly dreamt of his own assassination before it occurred. There are accounts of passengers who were supposed to board the ill-fated Titanic but had dreams of the disaster beforehand. As a result, they chose not to take the trip. These are just a couple of examples among thousands of cases worldwide where people have dreamed of accurate visions of the future. This phenomenon is known as precognitive dreaming. A precognitive dream is one that contains knowledge about the future that cannot be deduced from prior information. Despite being classified as paranormal, research indicates that precognitive dreams are actually quite common. But is the ability to experience precognitive dreams truly beyond belief? What if they’re more akin to our instincts? Instincts often accompany physical sensations. Perhaps those who chose not to board the Titanic harboured an inherent fear of the sea, regardless of the ship they sailed on. Perhaps, out of the thousands of dreams I’ve had over the years, my foretelling the death of my dog just happened to coincidentally align, and my mind wove a narrative. I can’t outright claim a belief in precognitive dreams, but after encountering them a few times myself, I can’t help but ponder whether they might be more than mere chance.<br>
