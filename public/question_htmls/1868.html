          <strong>The Red Pony</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by John Steinbeck</em><br><br>
When the triangle sounded in the morning, Jody dressed more quickly than usual. In the kitchen, while he washed his face and combed back his hair, his mother addressed him irritably. “Don’t you go out until you get a good breakfast in you.” He went into the dining-room and sat at the long white table. He took a steaming hotcake, arranged two fried eggs on it, covered it with another hotcake and squashed the whole thing with his fork.</p>
        <p>His father and Billy Buck came in. His father looked stern and disciplinary, but Billy Buck didn’t look at Jody at all. He avoided the shy questioning eyes of the boy and drank his coffee. Carl Tiflin said crossly, “You come with us after breakfast!” Jody had trouble with his food then, for he felt a kind of doom in the air. His mother called, “Carl! Don’t you let it keep him from school.”</p>
        <p>They marched past the cypress, where a singletree hung from a limb to butcher the pigs on, and past the black iron kettle, so it was not a pig killing. The sun shone over the hill and threw long, dark shadows of the trees and buildings. They crossed a stubble-field to shortcut to the barn. Jody’s father unhooked the door and they went in. They had been walking toward the sun on the way down. The barn was black as night in contrast and warm from the hay and from the beasts. Jody’s father moved over toward the one box stall. “Come here!” he ordered. Jody could begin to see things now. He looked into the box stall and then stepped back quickly. A red pony colt was looking at him out of the stall. Its tense ears were forward and a light of disobedience was in its eyes. Its coat was rough and thick as an airedale’s fur and its mane was long and tangled. <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Jody’s throat collapsed in on itself and cut his breath short</strong></span>. “He needs a good <span class="txt-underline"><strong>currying</strong></span>,” his father said, about to leave, “and if I ever hear of you not feeding him or leaving his stall dirty, I’ll sell him off in a minute.”</p>
        <p>Jody couldn’t bear to look at the pony’s eyes anymore. He gazed down at his hands for a moment, and he asked very shyly, “Mine?” No one answered him. He put his hand out toward the pony. Its grey nose came close, sniffing loudly, and then the lips drew back and the strong teeth closed on Jody’s fingers. The pony shook its head up and down and seemed to laugh with amusement. Jody regarded his bruised fingers. “Well,” he said with pride - “Well, I guess he can bite all right.” The two men laughed, somewhat in relief. Carl Tiflin went out of the barn and walked up a side-hill to be by himself, for he was embarrassed, but Billy Buck stayed. It was easier to talk to Billy Buck. Jody asked again -“Mine?” Billy became professional in tone. “Sure! That is, if you look out for him and break him right. I’ll show you how. He’s just a colt. You can’t ride him for some time.” Jody put out his bruised hand again, and this time the red pony let his nose be rubbed. “I ought to have a carrot,” Jody said. “Where’d we get him, Billy?”</p>
        <p>“Bought him at a sheriff’s auction,” Billy explained. “A show went broke in Salinas and had debts. The pony stretched out his nose and shook the forelock from his wild eyes. Jody stroked the nose a little. “There’s no saddle?” Billy Buck laughed. “I’d forgot. Come along.”</p>
        <p>In the harness room he lifted down a little saddle of red morocco leather. “It’s just a show saddle,” Billy Buck said disparagingly. “It <span class="txt-underline"><strong>isn’t practical for the brush</strong></span>, but it was cheap at the sale.” Jody brushed the shining red leather with his fingertips, and after a long time he said, “It’ll look pretty on him though.” He thought of the grandest and prettiest things he knew. “If he hasn’t a name already, I think I’ll call him Gabilan Mountains,” he said.</p>
        <p>Billy Buck knew how he felt. “It’s a pretty long name. Why don’t you just call him Gabilan? That means hawk. That would be a fine name for him.” Jody wanted to go back to the box stall. “Could I lead him to school, do you think—to show the kids?” But Billy shook his head. “He’s not even halter-broke yet. We had a time getting him here. Had to almost drag him. You better be starting for school though.”</p>
        <p>“I’ll bring the kids to see him here this afternoon,” Jody said. Six boys came over the hill half an hour early that afternoon, running hard, their heads down, their forearms working, their breath whistling. And then they stood self-consciously before the pony, and then they looked at Jody with eyes in which there was a new admiration and a new respect. Before today Jody had been a boy, dressed in overalls and a blue shirt—quieter than most, even suspected of being a little cowardly. And now he was different. Out of a thousand centuries they drew the ancient admiration of the footman for the horseman. They knew instinctively that a man on a horse is spiritually as well as physically bigger than a man on foot. They knew that Jody had been miraculously lifted out of equality with them, and had been placed over them.</p>

<span class="txt-underline"><strong>bitten by the teeth of winter</strong></span>.<br>
<br>
<strong><span class="txt-underline">Suddenly</span></strong>driven out by a man,<br>
ten horses surged through the mist.<br>
<br>
Like waves of fire, they flared forward<br>
and to my eyes filled the whole world,<br>
empty till then. Perfect, ablaze,<br>
they were like ten gods with pure white hoofs,<br>
with manes like a dream of salt.<br>
<br>
Their rumps were worlds and oranges.<br>
Their colour was honey, amber, fire.<br>
<br>
Their necks were towers<br>
cut from the stone of pride,<br>
and behind their transparent eyes<br>
energy raged, like a prisoner.<br>
<br>
There, in silence, at midday,<br>
in that dirty, disordered winter,<br>
those intense horses were the blood<br>
the rhythm, the inciting treasure of life.<br>
<br>
I looked. I looked and was reborn:<br>
for there, unknowing, was the fountain,<br>
the dance of gold, heaven<br>
and the fire that lives in beauty.<br>
<br>
I have forgotten that dark Berlin winter.<br>
<br>
I will not forget the light of the horses.</p>

        <p><em>Read the poem below by Pablo Neruda then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>Horses</strong><br><br>
From the window I saw the horses.<br>
<br>
I was in Berlin, in winter. The light<br>
had no light, the sky had no heaven.<br>
<br>
The air was white like wet bread.<br>
<br>
And from my window <span class="txt-underline"><strong>a vacant arena,</strong></span><br>
<span class="txt-underline"><strong>bitten by the teeth of winter</strong></span>.<br>
<br>
<strong><span class="txt-underline">Suddenly</span></strong>driven out by a man,<br>
ten horses surged through the mist.<br>
<br>
Like waves of fire, they flared forward<br>
and to my eyes filled the whole world,<br>
empty till then. Perfect, ablaze,<br>
they were like ten gods with pure white hoofs,<br>
with manes like a dream of salt.<br>
<br>
Their rumps were worlds and oranges.<br>
Their colour was honey, amber, fire.<br>
<br>
Their necks were towers<br>
cut from the stone of pride,<br>
and behind their transparent eyes<br>
energy raged, like a prisoner.<br>
<br>
There, in silence, at midday,<br>
in that dirty, disordered winter,<br>
those intense horses were the blood<br>
the rhythm, the inciting treasure of life.<br>
<br>
I looked. I looked and was reborn:<br>
for there, unknowing, was the fountain,<br>
the dance of gold, heaven<br>
and the fire that lives in beauty.<br>
<br>
I have forgotten that dark Berlin winter.<br>
<br>
I will not forget the light of the horses.</p>

          <strong>The Snow Goose</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Paul Gallico</em>
        </p>
        <p>In 1940, The Saturday Evening Post carried a short story by Paul Gallico (1897-1976). Gallico had begun his career as a sports reporter but, in 1936, had moved to England and started writing fiction. In 1941, the story was published by Alfred A. Knopf as a slim novella of some fifty pages. <strong>15</strong> ………. It was also Gallico's only critical success, although he later wrote the hugely popular "Mrs. 'Arris" series, as well as The Poseidon Adventure. The Snow Goose was, in Gallico's words, "a once in a lifetime happening for a writer".</p>
        <p>The story of The Snow Goose is a variation on the ageless myth of a man whose physical deformity prevents most people from seeing his underlying admirable character. It begins in 1930, and is set on the east coast of England. <strong>16</strong> ………. Rebuffed by society, he retreats to the desolate marshland by the sea, where he lives in an abandoned lighthouse. There he paints the marsh and the wildfowl that inhabit it. He also provides a sanctuary for birds over the winter before they migrate north in the spring.</p>
        <p>One day, three years after Rhayader had come to the lighthouse, a young girl named Fritha, no more than twelve, comes to seek him out. Carrying an injured bird in her arms, she approaches the lighthouse timidly. She is frightened of its strange inhabitant, but she has heard of his reputation for taking care of the marsh's wildlife. Rhayader tends to the bird. He tells Fritha it is a Canadian snow goose, blown off course by a violent storm. Fritha visits the lighthouse often to see the bird, but after it flies north in the spring, her visits stop. <strong>17</strong> ……….</p>
        <p>In mid-October the snow goose returns, and Rhayader is overjoyed. <strong>18</strong> ………. And so the cycle repeats: when the snow goose returns, Fritha resumes her visits; when the snow goose leaves, her visits stop. Nonetheless, though the bird is the catalyst that brings Rhayader and Fritha together, their relationship develops beyond it. They sail in Rhayader's boat, and he teaches her the lore of the marsh. Over time, the snow goose's stays at the lighthouse become longer and longer. By the spring of 1940, it becomes clear that the bird will leave no more. What of Fritha, who is now a young woman?</p>
        <p>In the spring of 1940, Britain is enlisting small, private craft on the South Coast. It is a desperate attempt to evacuate hundreds of thousands of Allied soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk. Here they have been trapped by the German invasion of Belgium and France. Rhayader is determined to add his small boat to the attempt: "For once - for once I can be a man and play my part." He sails across the North Sea and successfully rescues many soldiers, ferrying them to boats in deeper water. <strong>19</strong> ………. Beautifully written in simple, lyrical prose, The Snow Goose is a moving story about love and courage, with an ending that is unforgettable.</p>
        <p>Like many, I first read The Snow Goose as a child, and no doubt its unabashed sentimentality was as appealing to me at that time as strawberry-flavoured lip gloss. On rereading I was amazed to discover that poor Philip, of the hunchback and claw-hand, was only 27. <strong>20</strong> ………. (I'm not quite sure how I figured the "love" bit of the "love story", except perhaps as a wartime Beauty and the Beast.) And yet I had forgotten the brutal realism of the final paragraphs, preferring to remember only Fritha's final realisation of her love for Rhayader.</p>

          <strong>The Snow Goose</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Paul Gallico</em>
        </p>
        <p>In 1940, The Saturday Evening Post carried a short story by Paul Gallico (1897-1976). Gallico had begun his career as a sports reporter but, in 1936, had moved to England and started writing fiction. In 1941, the story was published by Alfred A. Knopf as a slim novella of some fifty pages. <strong>15</strong> ………. It was also Gallico's only critical success, although he later wrote the hugely popular "Mrs. 'Arris" series, as well as The Poseidon Adventure. The Snow Goose was, in Gallico's words, "a once in a lifetime happening for a writer".</p>
        <p>The story of The Snow Goose is a variation on the ageless myth of a man whose physical deformity prevents most people from seeing his underlying admirable character. It begins in 1930, and is set on the east coast of England. <strong>16</strong> ………. Rebuffed by society, he retreats to the desolate marshland by the sea, where he lives in an abandoned lighthouse. There he paints the marsh and the wildfowl that inhabit it. He also provides a sanctuary for birds over the winter before they migrate north in the spring.</p>
        <p>One day, three years after Rhayader had come to the lighthouse, a young girl named Fritha, no more than twelve, comes to seek him out. Carrying an injured bird in her arms, she approaches the lighthouse timidly. She is frightened of its strange inhabitant, but she has heard of his reputation for taking care of the marsh's wildlife. Rhayader tends to the bird. He tells Fritha it is a Canadian snow goose, blown off course by a violent storm. Fritha visits the lighthouse often to see the bird, but after it flies north in the spring, her visits stop. <strong>17</strong> ……….</p>
        <p>In mid-October the snow goose returns, and Rhayader is overjoyed. <strong>18</strong> ………. And so the cycle repeats: when the snow goose returns, Fritha resumes her visits; when the snow goose leaves, her visits stop. Nonetheless, though the bird is the catalyst that brings Rhayader and Fritha together, their relationship develops beyond it. They sail in Rhayader's boat, and he teaches her the lore of the marsh. Over time, the snow goose's stays at the lighthouse become longer and longer. By the spring of 1940, it becomes clear that the bird will leave no more. What of Fritha, who is now a young woman?</p>
        <p>In the spring of 1940, Britain is enlisting small, private craft on the South Coast. It is a desperate attempt to evacuate hundreds of thousands of Allied soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk. Here they have been trapped by the German invasion of Belgium and France. Rhayader is determined to add his small boat to the attempt: "For once - for once I can be a man and play my part." He sails across the North Sea and successfully rescues many soldiers, ferrying them to boats in deeper water. <strong>19</strong> ………. Beautifully written in simple, lyrical prose, The Snow Goose is a moving story about love and courage, with an ending that is unforgettable.</p>

          <strong>The Snow Goose</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Paul Gallico</em>
        </p>
        <p>In 1940, The Saturday Evening Post carried a short story by Paul Gallico (1897-1976). Gallico had begun his career as a sports reporter but, in 1936, had moved to England and started writing fiction. In 1941, the story was published by Alfred A. Knopf as a slim novella of some fifty pages. <strong>15</strong> ………. It was also Gallico's only critical success, although he later wrote the hugely popular "Mrs. 'Arris" series, as well as The Poseidon Adventure. The Snow Goose was, in Gallico's words, "a once in a lifetime happening for a writer".</p>
        <p>The story of The Snow Goose is a variation on the ageless myth of a man whose physical deformity prevents most people from seeing his underlying admirable character. It begins in 1930, and is set on the east coast of England. <strong>16</strong> ………. Rebuffed by society, he retreats to the desolate marshland by the sea, where he lives in an abandoned lighthouse. There he paints the marsh and the wildfowl that inhabit it. He also provides a sanctuary for birds over the winter before they migrate north in the spring.</p>
        <p>One day, three years after Rhayader had come to the lighthouse, a young girl named Fritha, no more than twelve, comes to seek him out. Carrying an injured bird in her arms, she approaches the lighthouse timidly. She is frightened of its strange inhabitant, but she has heard of his reputation for taking care of the marsh's wildlife. Rhayader tends to the bird. He tells Fritha it is a Canadian snow goose, blown off course by a violent storm. Fritha visits the lighthouse often to see the bird, but after it flies north in the spring, her visits stop. <strong>17</strong> ……….</p>
        <p>In mid-October the snow goose returns, and Rhayader is overjoyed. <strong>18</strong> ………. And so the cycle repeats: when the snow goose returns, Fritha resumes her visits; when the snow goose leaves, her visits stop. Nonetheless, though the bird is the catalyst that brings Rhayader and Fritha together, their relationship develops beyond it. They sail in Rhayader's boat, and he teaches her the lore of the marsh. Over time, the snow goose's stays at the lighthouse become longer and longer. By the spring of 1940, it becomes clear that the bird will leave no more. What of Fritha, who is now a young woman?</p>
        <p>In the spring of 1940, Britain is enlisting small, private craft on the South Coast. It is a desperate attempt to evacuate hundreds of thousands of Allied soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk. Here they have been trapped by the German invasion of Belgium and France. Rhayader is determined to add his small boat to the attempt: "For once - for once I can be a man and play my part." He sails across the North Sea and successfully rescues many soldiers, ferrying them to boats in deeper water. <strong>19</strong> ………. Beautifully written in simple, lyrical prose, The Snow Goose is a moving story about love and courage, with an ending that is unforgettable.</p>
        <p>Like many, I first read The Snow Goose as a child, and no doubt its unabashed sentimentality was as appealing to me at that time as strawberry-flavoured lip gloss. On rereading I was amazed to discover that poor Philip, of the hunchback and claw-hand, was only 27. <strong>20</strong> ………. (I'm not quite sure how I figured the "love" bit of the "love story", except perhaps as a wartime Beauty and the Beast.) And yet I had forgotten the brutal realism of the final paragraphs, preferring to remember only Fritha's final realisation of her love for Rhayader.</p>

          <strong>The Snow Goose</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Paul Gallico</em>
        </p>
        <p>In 1940, The Saturday Evening Post carried a short story by Paul Gallico (1897-1976). Gallico had begun his career as a sports reporter but, in 1936, had moved to England and started writing fiction. In 1941, the story was published by Alfred A. Knopf as a slim novella of some fifty pages. <strong>15</strong> ………. It was also Gallico's only critical success, although he later wrote the hugely popular "Mrs. 'Arris" series, as well as The Poseidon Adventure. The Snow Goose was, in Gallico's words, "a once in a lifetime happening for a writer".</p>
        <p>The story of The Snow Goose is a variation on the ageless myth of a man whose physical deformity prevents most people from seeing his underlying admirable character. It begins in 1930, and is set on the east coast of England. <strong>16</strong> ………. Rebuffed by society, he retreats to the desolate marshland by the sea, where he lives in an abandoned lighthouse. There he paints the marsh and the wildfowl that inhabit it. He also provides a sanctuary for birds over the winter before they migrate north in the spring.</p>
        <p>One day, three years after Rhayader had come to the lighthouse, a young girl named Fritha, no more than twelve, comes to seek him out. Carrying an injured bird in her arms, she approaches the lighthouse timidly. She is frightened of its strange inhabitant, but she has heard of his reputation for taking care of the marsh's wildlife. Rhayader tends to the bird. He tells Fritha it is a Canadian snow goose, blown off course by a violent storm. Fritha visits the lighthouse often to see the bird, but after it flies north in the spring, her visits stop. <strong>17</strong> ……….</p>
        <p>In mid-October the snow goose returns, and Rhayader is overjoyed. <strong>18</strong> ………. And so the cycle repeats: when the snow goose returns, Fritha resumes her visits; when the snow goose leaves, her visits stop. Nonetheless, though the bird is the catalyst that brings Rhayader and Fritha together, their relationship develops beyond it. They sail in Rhayader's boat, and he teaches her the lore of the marsh. Over time, the snow goose's stays at the lighthouse become longer and longer. By the spring of 1940, it becomes clear that the bird will leave no more. What of Fritha, who is now a young woman?</p>
        <p>In the spring of 1940, Britain is enlisting small, private craft on the South Coast. It is a desperate attempt to evacuate hundreds of thousands of Allied soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk. Here they have been trapped by the German invasion of Belgium and France. Rhayader is determined to add his small boat to the attempt: "For once - for once I can be a man and play my part." He sails across the North Sea and successfully rescues many soldiers, ferrying them to boats in deeper water. <strong>19</strong> ………. Beautifully written in simple, lyrical prose, The Snow Goose is a moving story about love and courage, with an ending that is unforgettable.</p>
        <p>Like many, I first read The Snow Goose as a child, and no doubt its unabashed sentimentality was as appealing to me at that time as strawberry-flavoured lip gloss. On rereading I was amazed to discover that poor Philip, of the hunchback and claw-hand, was only 27. <strong>20</strong> ………. (I'm not quite sure how I figured the "love" bit of the "love story", except perhaps as a wartime Beauty and the Beast.) And yet I had forgotten the brutal realism of the final paragraphs, preferring to remember only Fritha's final realisation of her love for Rhayader.</p>

          <strong>The Snow Goose</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Paul Gallico</em>
        </p>
        <p>In 1940, The Saturday Evening Post carried a short story by Paul Gallico (1897-1976). Gallico had begun his career as a sports reporter but, in 1936, had moved to England and started writing fiction. In 1941, the story was published by Alfred A. Knopf as a slim novella of some fifty pages. <strong>15</strong> ………. It was also Gallico's only critical success, although he later wrote the hugely popular "Mrs. 'Arris" series, as well as The Poseidon Adventure. The Snow Goose was, in Gallico's words, "a once in a lifetime happening for a writer".</p>
        <p>The story of The Snow Goose is a variation on the ageless myth of a man whose physical deformity prevents most people from seeing his underlying admirable character. It begins in 1930, and is set on the east coast of England. <strong>16</strong> ………. Rebuffed by society, he retreats to the desolate marshland by the sea, where he lives in an abandoned lighthouse. There he paints the marsh and the wildfowl that inhabit it. He also provides a sanctuary for birds over the winter before they migrate north in the spring.</p>
        <p>One day, three years after Rhayader had come to the lighthouse, a young girl named Fritha, no more than twelve, comes to seek him out. Carrying an injured bird in her arms, she approaches the lighthouse timidly. She is frightened of its strange inhabitant, but she has heard of his reputation for taking care of the marsh's wildlife. Rhayader tends to the bird. He tells Fritha it is a Canadian snow goose, blown off course by a violent storm. Fritha visits the lighthouse often to see the bird, but after it flies north in the spring, her visits stop. <strong>17</strong> ……….</p>
        <p>In mid-October the snow goose returns, and Rhayader is overjoyed. <strong>18</strong> ………. And so the cycle repeats: when the snow goose returns, Fritha resumes her visits; when the snow goose leaves, her visits stop. Nonetheless, though the bird is the catalyst that brings Rhayader and Fritha together, their relationship develops beyond it. They sail in Rhayader's boat, and he teaches her the lore of the marsh. Over time, the snow goose's stays at the lighthouse become longer and longer. By the spring of 1940, it becomes clear that the bird will leave no more. What of Fritha, who is now a young woman?</p>
        <p>In the spring of 1940, Britain is enlisting small, private craft on the South Coast.

          <strong>The Snow Goose</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Paul Gallico</em>
        </p>
        <p>In 1940, The Saturday Evening Post carried a short story by Paul Gallico (1897-1976). Gallico had begun his career as a sports reporter but, in 1936, had moved to England and started writing fiction. In 1941, the story was published by Alfred A. Knopf as a slim novella of some fifty pages. <strong>15</strong> ………. It was also Gallico's only critical success, although he later wrote the hugely popular "Mrs. 'Arris" series, as well as The Poseidon Adventure. The Snow Goose was, in Gallico's words, "a once in a lifetime happening for a writer".</p>
        <p>The story of The Snow Goose is a variation on the ageless myth of a man whose physical deformity prevents most people from seeing his underlying admirable character. It begins in 1930, and is set on the east coast of England. <strong>16</strong> ………. Rebuffed by society, he retreats to the desolate marshland by the sea, where he lives in an abandoned lighthouse. There he paints the marsh and the wildfowl that inhabit it. He also provides a sanctuary for birds over the winter before they migrate north in the spring.</p>
        <p>One day, three years after Rhayader had come to the lighthouse, a young girl named Fritha, no more than twelve, comes to seek him out. Carrying an injured bird in her arms, she approaches the lighthouse timidly. She is frightened of its strange inhabitant, but she has heard of his reputation for taking care of the marsh's wildlife. Rhayader tends to the bird. He tells Fritha it is a Canadian snow goose, blown off course by a violent storm. Fritha visits the lighthouse often to see the bird, but after it flies north in the spring, her visits stop. <strong>17</strong> ……….</p>
        <p>In mid-October the snow goose returns, and Rhayader is overjoyed. <strong>18</strong> ………. And so the cycle repeats: when the snow goose returns, Fritha resumes her visits; when the snow goose leaves, her visits stop. Nonetheless, though the bird is the catalyst that brings Rhayader and Fritha together, their relationship develops beyond it. They sail in Rhayader's boat, and he teaches her the lore of the marsh. Over time, the snow goose's stays at the lighthouse become longer and longer. By the spring of 1940, it becomes clear that the bird will leave no more. What of Fritha, who is now a young woman?</p>
        <p>In the spring of 1940, Britain is enlisting small, private craft on the South Coast. It is a desperate attempt to evacuate hundreds of thousands of Allied soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk. Here they have been trapped by the German invasion of Belgium and France. Rhayader is determined to add his small boat to the attempt: "For once - for once I can be a man and play my part." He sails across the North Sea and successfully rescues many soldiers, ferrying them to boats in deeper water. <strong>19</strong> ………. Beautifully written in simple, lyrical prose, The Snow Goose is a moving story about love and courage, with an ending that is unforgettable.</p>
        <p>Like many, I first read The Snow Goose as a child, and no doubt its unabashed sentimentality was as appealing to me at that time as strawberry-flavoured lip gloss. On rereading I was amazed to discover that poor Philip, of the hunchback and claw-hand, was only 27. <strong>20</strong> ………. (I'm not quite sure how I figured the "love" bit of the "love story", except perhaps as a wartime Beauty and the Beast.) And yet I had forgotten the brutal realism of the final paragraphs, preferring to remember only Fritha's final realisation of her love for Rhayader.</p>

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
When looking at music, we can assign a category based on various musical elements. For example, genres can be defined by the use of specific instruments. If the piece was being played in a certain style using orchestral instruments, then we could classify it as classical music. Similarly, if the instruments were highly distorted guitars, we would classify as rock or heavy metal.<br>
<br>
Some genres are based on instruments and timing. Blues music uses a series of patterns and is played by a traditional live band using guitars and a drum kit. Likewise, drum and bass use a very fast bpm and are primarily electronic.<br>
<br>
The most recognised genres is pop music, which is simply because of the mass media proliferation. Pop music can take cues from any other genre. Over the years, lots of different styles have become pop music. Everything from R&amp;B, soul, funk, rock and folk has been popularised and played on mainstream radio stations. While hip-hop and rap music have taken over the charts recently, pop music is still the ‘most heard’ of all music genres.<br>
<br>
What’s incredibly interesting about music is that both geography and culture play a huge role in the popularity of music. Your own home-town probably has its own music scene where one type of music is more prevalent. There are literally thousands of different genres of music. Music in the modern age is incredibly diverse and every genre borrows something from another, then evolves.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Rhythm and blues, commonly known as R&amp;B, is a musical genre developed by African Americans in the 1940s that’s been continuously refined through the present day. R&amp;B was derived from gospel, jazz, folk and traditional blues music and was the father of rock ‘n’ roll. R&amp;B notably diverged from rock music in later decades.<br>
<br>
Contemporary R&amp;B is often driven by keyboards, synthesisers, strong bass lines, and looped drumbeats. In this sense, it has more in common with hip hop than rock music. Contemporary R&amp;B songs regularly top charts, making R&amp;B one of the most commercially successful genres in the modern music industry.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C&nbsp;</strong>^}<br>
Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky is widely considered the most popular Russian composer in history. He manifested a clear interest in music from childhood, and his earliest musical impressions came from an orchestrina in the family home. At age four, he made his first recorded attempt at composition, a song written with his younger sister Alexandra. His work includes the 'The Sleeping Beauty' and 'The Nutcracker'. His music has always had great appeal for the general public in virtue of its tuneful, open-hearted melodies, impressive harmonies, and colourful, picturesque orchestration, all of which evoke a profound emotional response.<br>
<br>
Composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's work was first publicly performed in 1865. In 1868, his First Symphony was well-received. In 1874, he established himself with Piano Concerto No.1 in B-flat Minor. Tchaikovsky resigned from the Moscow Conservatory in 1878 and spent the rest of his career composing yet more prolifically. Tchaikovsky is most celebrated for his ballets, specifically Swan Lake, The Sleeping Beauty and The Nutcracker. He died in St. Petersburg on November 6, 1893.<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Who are the greatest singing voices of all time? Whether it's a soaring soprano or distinctive baritone, a great voice is the cornerstone of great music. When paired with stunning compositions and expert instrumentation, an iconic voice helps create iconic songs. Below is a look at the all-time great voices in music, ranging from R&amp;B icons to opera stars, pop chanteuses and everyone in between.<br>
<br>
First of our top 31 is Barbra Streisand. Barbra is a truly prolific talent who's earned the coveted EGOT — an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony — Barbra Streisand's distinctive voice has been a fixture of American music since the 1960s. Throughout the years, she's recorded 50 full-length albums, and notched hits with songs like "Woman in Love" and "Why Did I Choose You".&nbsp;<br>

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
When looking at music, we can assign a category based on various musical elements. For example, genres can be defined by the use of specific instruments. If the piece was being played in a certain style using orchestral instruments, then we could classify it as classical music. Similarly, if the instruments were highly distorted guitars, we would classify as rock or heavy metal.<br>
<br>
Some genres are based on instruments and timing. Blues music uses a series of patterns and is played by a traditional live band using guitars and a drum kit. Likewise, drum and bass use a very fast bpm and are primarily electronic.<br>
<br>
The most recognised genres is pop music, which is simply because of the mass media proliferation. Pop music can take cues from any other genre. Over the years, lots of different styles have become pop music. Everything from R&amp;B, soul, funk, rock and folk has been popularised and played on mainstream radio stations. While hip-hop and rap music have taken over the charts recently, pop music is still the ‘most heard’ of all music genres.<br>
<br>
What’s incredibly interesting about music is that both geography and culture play a huge role in the popularity of music. Your own home-town probably has its own music scene where one type of music is more prevalent. There are literally thousands of different genres of music. Music in the modern age is incredibly diverse and every genre borrows something from another, then evolves.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Rhythm and blues, commonly known as R&amp;B, is a musical genre developed by African Americans in the 1940s that’s been continuously refined through the present day. R&amp;B was derived from gospel, jazz, folk and traditional blues music and was the father of rock ‘n’ roll. R&amp;B notably diverged from rock music in later decades.<br>
<br>
Contemporary R&amp;B is often driven by keyboards, synthesisers, strong bass lines, and looped drumbeats. In this sense, it has more in common with hip hop than rock music. Contemporary R&amp;B songs regularly top charts, making R&amp;B one of the most commercially successful genres in the modern music industry.<br>

Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky is widely considered the most popular Russian composer in history. He manifested a clear interest in music from childhood, and his earliest musical impressions came from an orchestrina in the family home. At age four, he made his first recorded attempt at composition, a song written with his younger sister Alexandra. His work includes the 'The Sleeping Beauty' and 'The Nutcracker'. His music has always had great appeal for the general public in virtue of its tuneful, open-hearted melodies, impressive harmonies, and colourful, picturesque orchestration, all of which evoke a profound emotional response.<br>
<br>
Composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's work was first publicly performed in 1865. In 1868, his First Symphony was well-received. In 1874, he established himself with Piano Concerto No.1 in B-flat Minor. Tchaikovsky resigned from the Moscow Conservatory in 1878 and spent the rest of his career composing yet more prolifically. Tchaikovsky is most celebrated for his ballets, specifically Swan Lake, The Sleeping Beauty and The Nutcracker. He died in St. Petersburg on November 6, 1893.<br>

Contemporary R&amp;B songs regularly top charts, making R&amp;B one of the most commercially successful genres in the modern music industry.<br>

Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky is widely considered the most popular Russian composer in history. He manifested a clear interest in music from childhood, and his earliest musical impressions came from an orchestrina in the family home. At age four, he made his first recorded attempt at composition, a song written with his younger sister Alexandra. His work includes the 'The Sleeping Beauty' and 'The Nutcracker'. His music has always had great appeal for the general public in virtue of its tuneful, open-hearted melodies, impressive harmonies, and colourful, picturesque orchestration, all of which evoke a profound emotional response.<br>
<br>
Composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's work was first publicly performed in 1865. In 1868, his First Symphony was well-received. In 1874, he established himself with Piano Concerto No.1 in B-flat Minor. Tchaikovsky resigned from the Moscow Conservatory in 1878 and spent the rest of his career composing yet more prolifically. Tchaikovsky is most celebrated for his ballets, specifically Swan Lake, The Sleeping Beauty and The Nutcracker. He died in St. Petersburg on November 6, 1893.<br>

When looking at music, we can assign a category based on various musical elements. For example, genres can be defined by the use of specific instruments. If the piece was being played in a certain style using orchestral instruments, then we could classify it as classical music. Similarly, if the instruments were highly distorted guitars, we would classify as rock or heavy metal.<br>
<br>
Some genres are based on instruments and timing. Blues music uses a series of patterns and is played by a traditional live band using guitars and a drum kit. Likewise, drum and bass use a very fast bpm and are primarily electronic.<br>
<br>
The most recognised genres is pop music, which is simply because of the mass media proliferation. Pop music can take cues from any other genre. Over the years, lots of different styles have become pop music. Everything from R&amp;B, soul, funk, rock and folk has been popularised and played on mainstream radio stations. While hip-hop and rap music have taken over the charts recently, pop music is still the ‘most heard’ of all music genres.<br>
<br>
What’s incredibly interesting about music is that both geography and culture play a huge role in the popularity of music. Your own home-town probably has its own music scene where one type of music is more prevalent. There are literally thousands of different genres of music. Music in the modern age is incredibly diverse and every genre borrows something from another, then evolves.<br>

Rhythm and blues, commonly known as R&amp;B, is a musical genre developed by African Americans in the 1940s that’s been continuously refined through the present day. R&amp;B was derived from gospel, jazz, folk and traditional blues music and was the father of rock ‘n’ roll. R&amp;B notably diverged from rock music in later decades.<br>
