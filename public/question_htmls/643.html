        <p>Toby’s walks always took place as the light was fading. By then the day had softened out, blurring the edges, allowing him to slouch along, hands in pockets, admiring a hazy view of the sea. It was a long trek from the University to Blackpill but he enjoyed the thinking time and when he was outside, he felt less alone.

        <p>He was that most awkward breed of student: ‘the fresher’ and along with the label went all the agony of living in a flat full of chirpy strangers, traipsing around ‘The Freshers’ Fair’ desperately hoping to fit in somewhere and trying to find the appropriate lecture halls. Then there was having to feed himself and wash his clothes, keep his room tidy, including an ensuite bathroom. He had never realised the level of mess created by a single human being.

        <p>His only coping strategy was this long walk.

        <p>Marina stood with her hands on her hips, in challenge mode.

The situation was impossible; she didn’t know how this person was able to see her. Her masking spell protected her as long as she remained within the confines of the park.

<br>
Ahh, <em>Friends.</em> The US sitcom that took over the world.<br>
<br>
Millennials may look back fondly to the heady days of the ultimate 20-something Manhattan lifestyle enjoyed by our favourite flatmates - Monica, Ross, Chandler, Joey, Rachel and Phoebe. But nearly a quarter of a century - yikes! - since it began, a new generation of fans are discovering the hit show for the first time on Netflix.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
And some of them are clearly finding it a bit uncomfortable.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Another found herself not enjoying the show as much second time around.<br>

<br>
<br>
Freelance writer James Baldock, who wrote about the Friends issue in, told BBC News the backlash against Friends "was inevitable".<br>
"People my age tend to think of Friends as 'current', but it's as steeped in nostalgia as, say, Miami Vice was 10 or 15 years ago."&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Writer Rebecca Reid told BBC Radio 5 live she "couldn't believe how badly it has aged".<br>
<br>
"The homophobia is staggering - the punchline of every joke about Ross is that his ex-wife is a lesbian, as if that's some failing of his and that it's hilarious that she's a lesbian."<br>
<br>
"The sexism's pretty rampant as well... [and] it's the whitest show in the whole world."<br>
<br>
She did acknowledge, however, that "she did sort of love it".<br>
<br>
"It's really dangerous to start looking at stuff that was written a long time ago through the lens of what we do now."&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Others were less concerned.<br>

<br>
Ahh, <em>Friends.</em> The US sitcom that took over the world.<br>
<br>
Millennials may look back fondly to the heady days of the ultimate 20-something Manhattan lifestyle enjoyed by our favourite flatmates - Monica, Ross, Chandler, Joey, Rachel and Phoebe. But nearly a quarter of a century - yikes! - since it began, a new generation of fans are discovering the hit show for the first time on Netflix.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
And some of them are clearly finding it a bit uncomfortable.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Another found herself not enjoying the show as much second time around.<br>

<br>
Freelance writer James Baldock, who wrote about the Friends issue in, told BBC News the backlash against Friends "was inevitable".<br>
"People my age tend to think of Friends as 'current', but it's as steeped in nostalgia as, say, Miami Vice was 10 or 15 years ago."&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Writer Rebecca Reid told BBC Radio 5 live she "couldn't believe how badly it has aged".<br>
<br>
"The homophobia is staggering - the punchline of every joke about Ross is that his ex-wife is a lesbian, as if that's some failing of his and that it's hilarious that she's a lesbian."<br>
<br>
"The sexism's pretty rampant as well... [and] it's the whitest show in the whole world."<br>
<br>
She did acknowledge, however, that "she did sort of love it".<br>
<br>
"It's really dangerous to start looking at stuff that was written a long time ago through the lens of what we do now."&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Others were less concerned.<br>
