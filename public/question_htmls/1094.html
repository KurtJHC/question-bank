        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>The Other Side of Perfect&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br>
by Mariko Turk&nbsp;<br>
<br>
“When can I dance?” My voice came out quiet in the small, sterile recovery room. The doctor kept messing with his charts, so I didn’t know if he’d heard me. I was about to ask again, but I got distracted by the steel rods rooted into my bones and extending out, attached to a frame outside my leg. Ever since I woke up from surgery, I couldn’t stop staring at it. After ten years at the Kira Dobrow Ballet School, I’d seen my share of bodily horrors: weeping toe blisters, a ruptured Achilles tendon, but nothing like this. It was called an external fixator and it wasn’t messing around.</p>
        <p>Colleen was staring at it too – her fingers tapping out the melody of the Kitri variation from&nbsp;Don Quixote&nbsp;on the metal post of my hospital bed. I caught her eye and we had one of our silent conversations.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>It’s not that bad right?<br>
Totally not that bad.&nbsp;</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>I let out a breath and glanced behind Colleen to my parents. Dad’s eyes were steadily on the floor so he wouldn’t accidentally look at the external fixator and need to sit with his head between his legs again. Mum gave me a smile I knew she meant to be reassuring but was 100% not.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“When can I dance?” I repeated loudly. The doctor startled, put down the charts and sat on the stool next to my bed.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Let’s take it&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline"><strong>one step at a time</strong></span>,” he said, looking at my leg and chuckling. “Pun not intended.” When no one reacted, he cleared his throat. “You’ll be bed to chair for a couple of weeks until we get you out of that external fixator and into a cast. A few months after that, you can start learning to walk again.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If he wasn’t going to answer my question, I’d figure it out myself. I did some mental calculations. The American Ballet Theatre summer intensive in New York was in July. Four months from now. If I was walking in a couple of months, I could dance in four. “That means I can still do the ballet intensive in July,” I said. “I can still go.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My parents shifted and the doctor sighed. “Alina,” he said carefully. “If it was a clean break, your bones could have healed naturally. You might have been able to dance on pointe in four months. But it wasn’t a clean break.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He stopped talking, like that explained everything. When I kept staring at him, he sighed again. “We needed to put in sixteen screws and two plates to keep your bones together. That hardware is meant to stay in there forever, it means your leg won’t be as strong or flexible as…”</p>
        <p>“So when? If I let it heal and do physical therapy and everything I’m supposed to do, when will it be back to normal?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Never,” the doctor said simply. “When something breaks like that, you can’t put it back together so easily. And when you do, it won’t be the same.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I felt like the doctor wasn’t being fully honest with me, but there was no point saying it, “I’ll be able to dance in four months,” I said coolly. “I’m going to New York.” I looked at my parents, so they’d know the plan hadn’t changed. Dad looked queasy and uncertain. Mum looked like she was holding back tears.&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline"><strong>Only Colleen was unfazed</strong></span>.</p>

        <p>I felt like the doctor wasn’t being fully honest with me, but there was no point saying it, “I’ll be able to dance in four months,” I said coolly. “I’m going to New York.” I looked at my parents, so they’d know the plan hadn’t changed. Dad looked queasy and uncertain. Mum looked like she was holding back tears.&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline"><strong>Only Colleen was unfazed</strong></span>.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>The Other Side of Perfect&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br><em>by Mariko Turk&nbsp;</em><br><br>
“When can I dance?” My voice came out quiet in the small, sterile recovery room. The doctor kept messing with his charts, so I didn’t know if he’d heard me. I was about to ask again, but I got distracted by the steel rods rooted into my bones and extending out, attached to a frame outside my leg. Ever since I woke up from surgery, I couldn’t stop staring at it. After ten years at the Kira Dobrow Ballet School, I’d seen my share of bodily horrors: weeping toe blisters, a ruptured Achilles tendon, but nothing like this. It was called an external fixator and it wasn’t messing around.</p>
        <p>Colleen was staring at it too – her fingers tapping out the melody of the Kitri variation from&nbsp;Don Quixote&nbsp;on the metal post of my hospital bed. I caught her eye and we had one of our silent conversations.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>It’s not that bad right?<br>
Totally not that bad.&nbsp;</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>I let out a breath and glanced behind Colleen to my parents. Dad’s eyes were steadily on the floor so he wouldn’t accidentally look at the external fixator and need to sit with his head between his legs again. Mum gave me a smile I knew she meant to be reassuring but was 100% not.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“When can I dance?” I repeated loudly. The doctor startled, put down the charts and sat on the stool next to my bed.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Let’s take it<strong>&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">one step at a time</span></strong>,” he said, looking at my leg and chuckling. “Pun not intended.” When no one reacted, he cleared his throat. “You’ll be bed to chair for a couple of weeks until we get you out of that external fixator and into a cast. A few months after that, you can start learning to walk again.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If he wasn’t going to answer my question, I’d figure it out myself. I did some mental calculations. The American Ballet Theatre summer intensive in New York was in July. Four months from now. If I was walking in a couple of months, I could dance in four. “That means I can still do the ballet intensive in July,” I said. “I can still go.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My parents shifted and the doctor sighed. “Alina,” he said carefully. “If it was a clean break, your bones could have healed naturally. You might have been able to dance on pointe in four months. But it wasn’t a clean break.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He stopped talking, like that explained everything. When I kept staring at him, he sighed again. “We needed to put in sixteen screws and two plates to keep your bones together. That hardware is meant to stay in there forever, it means your leg won’t be as strong or flexible as…”</p>
        <p>“So when? If I let it heal and do physical therapy and everything I’m supposed to do, when will it be back to normal?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Never,” the doctor said simply. “When something breaks like that, you can’t put it back together so easily. And when you do, it won’t be the same.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I felt like the doctor wasn’t being fully honest with me, but there was no point saying it, “I’ll be able to dance in four months,” I said coolly. “I’m going to New York.” I looked at my parents, so they’d know the plan hadn’t changed.

        <p><em>Read the poem below by Shel Silverstein then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Peanut-Butter Sandwich&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
I'll sing you a poem of a silly young king<br>
Who played with the world at the end of a string,<br>
But he only loved one single thing—<br>
And that was just a peanut-butter sandwich.<br>
His sceptre and his royal gowns,<br>
His regal throne and golden crowns<br>
Were brown and sticky from the mounds<br>
And drippings from each peanut-butter sandwich.</p>
        <p>His subjects all were silly fools<br>
For he had passed a royal rule<br>
That all that they could learn in school<br>
Was how to make a peanut-butter sandwich.<br>
He would not eat his sovereign steak,<br>
He scorned his soup and kingly cake,<br>
And told his courtly cook to bake<br>
An extra-sticky peanut-butter sandwich.</p>
        <p>And then one day he took a bite<br>
And started chewing with delight,<br>
But found his mouth was stuck quite tight<br>
From that last bite of peanut-butter sandwich.<br>
His brother pulled, his sister pried,<br>
The wizard pushed, his mother cried,</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>The dentist came, and the royal doc.<br>
The royal plumber banged and knocked,<br>
But still those jaws stayed tightly locked.<br>
Oh darn that sticky peanut-butter sandwich!<br>
The carpenter, he tried with pliers,<br>
The telephone man tried with wires,<br>
The firemen, they tried with fire,<br>
But couldn't melt that peanut-butter sandwich.</p>
        <p>With ropes and pulleys, drills and coil,<br>
With steam and lubricating oil—<br>
For twenty years of tears and toil—<br>
They fought that awful peanut-butter sandwich.<br>
Then all his royal subjects came.<br>
They hooked his jaws with grapplin' chains<br>
And pulled both ways with might and main<br>
Against that stubborn peanut-butter sandwich.</p>
        <p>Each man and woman, girl and boy<br>
Put down their ploughs and pots and toys<br>
And pulled until kerack! Oh, joy—<br>
They broke right through that peanut-butter sandwich<br>
A puff of dust, a screech, a squeak—<br>
The king's jaw opened with a creak.<br>
And then in voice so faint and weak—<br>
The first words that they heard him speak</p>
        <p>Were, 'How about a peanut-butter sandwich?'</p>

        <p><em>Read the poem below by Shel Silverstein then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Peanut-Butter Sandwich&nbsp;</strong><br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I'll sing you a poem of a silly young king<br>
Who played with the world at the end of a string,<br>
But he only loved one single thing—<br>
And that was just a peanut-butter sandwich.<br>
His sceptre and his royal gowns,<br>
His regal throne and golden crowns<br>
Were brown and sticky from the mounds<br>
And drippings from each peanut-butter sandwich.</p>
        <p>His subjects all were silly fools<br>
For he had passed a royal rule<br>
That all that they could learn in school<br>
Was how to make a peanut-butter sandwich.<br>
He would not eat his sovereign steak,<br>
He scorned his soup and kingly cake,<br>
And told his courtly cook to bake<br>
An extra-sticky peanut-butter sandwich.</p>
        <p>And then one day he took a bite<br>
And started chewing with delight,<br>
But found his mouth was stuck quite tight<br>
From that last bite of peanut-butter sandwich.<br>
His brother pulled, his sister pried,<br>
The wizard pushed, his mother cried,</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>The dentist came, and the royal doc.<br>
The royal plumber banged and knocked,<br>
But still those jaws stayed tightly locked.<br>
Oh darn that sticky peanut-butter sandwich!<br>
The carpenter, he tried with pliers,<br>
The telephone man tried with wires,<br>
The firemen, they tried with fire,<br>
But couldn't melt that peanut-butter sandwich.</p>
        <p>With ropes and pulleys, drills and coil,<br>
With steam and lubricating oil—<br>
For twenty years of tears and toil—<br>
They fought that awful peanut-butter sandwich.<br>
Then all his royal subjects came.<br>
They hooked his jaws with grapplin' chains<br>
And pulled both ways with might and main<br>
Against that stubborn peanut-butter sandwich.</p>
        <p>Each man and woman, girl and boy<br>
Put down their ploughs and pots and toys<br>
And pulled until kerack! Oh, joy—<br>
They broke right through that peanut-butter sandwich<br>
A puff of dust, a screech, a squeak—<br>
The king's jaw opened with a creak.<br>
And then in voice so faint and weak—<br>
The first words that they heard him speak</p>
        <p>Were, 'How about a peanut-butter sandwich?'</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>How is Honeycomb Made?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Bees are capable of producing a wax - also called beeswax - with their eight pairs of wax glands, positioned under their abdomen. <strong>12 ……….</strong> Bees will chew the wax or do it for a neighbour/friend worker bee until the wax becomes soft. After the beeswax becomes a more clay-like material, bees will then bond large quantities of wax into the cells of a honeycomb. The colony of bees crowding together creates the temperature necessary to control the texture of the wax inside of the beehive.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Worker bees will forage for food and gather nectar from different plants. The pollen they carry mixes with a specialised enzyme, which is then transferred from their tongues to other bees’ tongues. <strong>13 ……….</strong> The glands of the worker bees convert the sugar contents of honey into wax.</p>
        <p>When a bee attempts to build a comb, that individual worker bee may return to the hive upon visiting a sugar water feeder and execute what has been termed as the “waggle dance” to the surrounding hive of bees. <strong>14 ……….</strong> The waggle dance allows the worker bee to signal the specific direction and distance of the sugar water feeder so that other bees can also locate the food source.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The process takes a lot of work, however, to produce the honeycomb wax. <strong>15 ……….</strong> There is no wasted space with the hexagonal shapes put together over and over again! The hexagonal pattern and structure save the bees time and energy. <strong>16 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>A finished honeycomb can support up to 30 times a bees’ own weight, storing honey in its upper sections, pollen in the rows below that, followed by worker brood cells, drone brood cells and Queen cells at the bottom of the structure.<strong> 17 ………. </strong>These insects may be small but between pollination and honey production, they make a huge impact.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>How is Honeycomb Made?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Bees are capable of producing a wax - also called beeswax - with their eight pairs of wax glands, positioned under their abdomen. <strong>12 ……….</strong> Bees will chew the wax or do it for a neighbour/friend worker bee until the wax becomes soft. After the beeswax becomes a more clay-like material, bees will then bond large quantities of wax into the cells of a honeycomb. The colony of bees crowding together creates the temperature necessary to control the texture of the wax inside of the beehive.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Worker bees will forage for food and gather nectar from different plants. The pollen they carry mixes with a specialised enzyme, which is then transferred from their tongues to other bees’ tongues. <strong>13 ……….</strong> The glands of the worker bees convert the sugar contents of honey into wax.</p>
        <p>When a bee attempts to build a comb, that individual worker bee may return to the hive upon visiting a sugar water feeder and execute what has been termed as the “waggle dance” to the surrounding hive of bees. <strong>14 ……….</strong> The waggle dance allows the worker bee to signal the specific direction and distance of the sugar water feeder so that other bees can also locate the food source.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The process takes a lot of work, however, to produce the honeycomb wax. <strong>15 ……….</strong> There is no wasted space with the hexagonal shapes put together over and over again! The hexagonal pattern and structure save the bees time and energy. <strong>16 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>A finished honeycomb can support up to 30 times a bees’ own weight, storing honey in its upper sections, pollen in the rows below that, followed by worker brood cells, drone brood cells and Queen cells at the bottom of the structure.<strong> 17 ………. </strong>These insects may be small but between pollination and honey production, they make a huge impact.</p>

Bees are capable of producing a wax - also called beeswax - with their eight pairs of wax glands, positioned under their abdomen. <strong>12 ……….</strong> Bees will chew the wax or do it for a neighbour/friend worker bee until the wax becomes soft. After the beeswax becomes a more clay-like material, bees will then bond large quantities of wax into the cells of a honeycomb. The colony of bees crowding together creates the temperature necessary to control the texture of the wax inside of the beehive.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Worker bees will forage for food and gather nectar from different plants. The pollen they carry mixes with a specialised enzyme, which is then transferred from their tongues to other bees’ tongues. <strong>13 ……….</strong> The glands of the worker bees convert the sugar contents of honey into wax.</p>
        <p>When a bee attempts to build a comb, that individual worker bee may return to the hive upon visiting a sugar water feeder and execute what has been termed as the “waggle dance” to the surrounding hive of bees. <strong>14 ……….</strong> The waggle dance allows the worker bee to signal the specific direction and distance of the sugar water feeder so that other bees can also locate the food source.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The process takes a lot of work, however, to produce the honeycomb wax. <strong>15 ……….</strong> There is no wasted space with the hexagonal shapes put together over and over again! The hexagonal pattern and structure save the bees time and energy. <strong>16 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>A finished honeycomb can support up to 30 times a bees’ own weight, storing honey in its upper sections, pollen in the rows below that, followed by worker brood cells, drone brood cells and Queen cells at the bottom of the structure.<strong> 17 ………. </strong>These insects may be small but between pollination and honey production, they make a huge impact.</p>

The King's Gallows.<br>
<em>The King's Gallows.</em><br>
<br>
The King's Gallows was a glorious ship. The sides were etched with gold outlining and the flag waved a bloodied crown.<br>
<br>
This ship represented fear of the kingdoms afar. Alas, it was no pirate ship, but an enemy of society. It lived through storms of cold, hurricanes of treachery and maelstroms of burning ash.<br>
<br>
The King's Gallows was not only a symbol of rebellion, but of revolution! It sparked revolts that could scare giants. It destroyed the foundation of society. It created light where there was only dark.<br>
<br>
But this ship, oh this ship. It lived through countless battles with kings of all the lands. It fought against pirates and empires alike. It became battered and bruised to the point where a slight breeze could rip the sails. But this ship, oh this ship. It would keep crossing the seven seas without failure. It would prevail through the toughest of nights and the grittiest of days.<br>
<br>
This ship. This ship was&nbsp;<em>The King’s Gallows</em><br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
She was a beautiful vessel, built to last, but not for war. At thirteen feet stern to bow, she could barely be considered anything but a rowboat. Her hull, while aged, was still clean, with few marks showing where she has run ashore.<br>
<br>
She wasn't built for war. She saw solely the calm waters of peace, brought up shore during times of turbulence. She saw not the cares of a nation, but the cares of a family. She symbolised the lifeblood of those on the coast but saw only the blood of fish.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
The old one stood on the observation deck watching the activities in the bay below. Techs and bots swarmed in the familiar and comforting chaos that is a ship preparing for departure. Once more he would tread the decks of the ship that had brought him to this part of the Arm and first shocked, then changed the Commonwealth. They all might just survive this war after all. The legendary planet called Terra had been found and it changed everything. The ship didn't look much different than a standard heavy shuttle, looked almost more grown than manufactured, certainly not something that changed history. She almost seemed a bit menacing crouched there on her landing struts. It was the matte black colour that did that. The cargo hold ramp under the nose rose and shut now that loading was complete.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong> ^}<br>
Teardrops splattered along the damp sands as they yelled their goodbyes to an old friend, their words barely intelligible over the roaring, crackling flame. They wished their beloved ship well in the next life, apologising for how it had been treated in this one. Much to their surprise, their kind words did not fall upon deaf ears as the Merry herself, expressed profound gratitude and slight regret. She wished that she could have carried them even a mile more, to experience just one last adventure.<br>
<br>
Though he didn't know how to show it, the captain grieved most of all, remembering all the moments that they had shared. He pulled his straw hat down, hoping to veil his lapsing composure as he saw the Going Merry in his mind just as it had been the day, they received it. The modest wooden vessel that sat happily upon the waves, its plain brown exterior further accentuated by a fanciful white trim. Her smiling face, a figurehead of a sheep, at the forefront. The captain's seat.<br>

<em>The King's Gallows.</em><br>
<br>
The King's Gallows was a glorious ship. The sides were etched with gold outlining and the flag waved a bloodied crown.<br>
<br>
This ship represented fear of the kingdoms afar. Alas, it was no pirate ship, but an enemy of society. It lived through storms of cold, hurricanes of treachery and maelstroms of burning ash.<br>
<br>
The King's Gallows was not only a symbol of rebellion, but of revolution! It sparked revolts that could scare giants. It destroyed the foundation of society. It created light where there was only dark.<br>
<br>
But this ship, oh this ship. It lived through countless battles with kings of all the lands. It fought against pirates and empires alike. It became battered and bruised to the point where a slight breeze could rip the sails. But this ship, oh this ship. It would keep crossing the seven seas without failure. It would prevail through the toughest of nights and the grittiest of days.<br>
<br>
This ship. This ship was&nbsp;The King’s Gallows<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
She was a beautiful vessel, built to last, but not for war. At thirteen feet stern to bow, she could barely be considered anything but a rowboat. Her hull, while aged, was still clean, with few marks showing where she has run ashore.<br>
<br>
She wasn't built for war. She saw solely the calm waters of peace, brought up shore during times of turbulence. She saw not the cares of a nation, but the cares of a family. She symbolised the lifeblood of those on the coast but saw only the blood of fish.<br>

The old one stood on the observation deck watching the activities in the bay below. Techs and bots swarmed in the familiar and comforting chaos that is a ship preparing for departure. Once more he would tread the decks of the ship that had brought him to this part of the Arm and first shocked, then changed the Commonwealth. They all might just survive this war after all. The legendary planet called Terra had been found and it changed everything. The ship didn't look much different than a standard heavy shuttle, looked almost more grown than manufactured, certainly not something that changed history. She almost seemed a bit menacing crouched there on her landing struts. It was the matte black colour that did that. The cargo hold ramp under the nose rose and shut now that loading was complete.<br>

Teardrops splattered along the damp sands as they yelled their goodbyes to an old friend, their words barely intelligible over the roaring, crackling flame.
