          <strong>YOU ARE ENTERING CAMP GREEN LAKE&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Louis Sachar, ‘Holes’&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There is no lake at Camp Green Lake. There once was a very large lake here, the largest lake in Texas. That was over a hundred years ago. Now it is just a dry, flat wasteland. There used to be a town of Green Lake as well. The town shrivelled and dried up along with the lake, and the people who lived there. During the summer the daytime temperature hovers around ninety-five degrees in the shade— if you can find any shade. There's not much shade in a big dry lake. The only trees are two old oaks on the eastern edge of the "lake." A hammock is stretched between the two trees, and a log cabin stands behind that. The campers are forbidden to lie in the hammock. It belongs to the Warden. The Warden owns the shade.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Out on the lake, rattlesnakes and scorpions find shade under rocks and in the holes dug by the campers. Here's a good rule to remember about rattlesnakes and scorpions: If you don't bother them, they won't bother you. <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Usually</strong></span>. Being bitten by a scorpion or even a rattlesnake is not the worst thing that can happen to you. You won't die. <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Usually</strong></span>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Sometimes a camper will try to be bitten by a scorpion, or even a small rattlesnake. Then he will get to spend a day or two recovering in his tent, instead of having to dig a hole out on the lake but you don't want to be bitten by a yellow-spotted lizard. That's the worst thing that can happen to you. You will die a slow and painful death. Always. If you get bitten by a yellow-spotted lizard, you might as well go into the shade of the oak trees and lie in the hammock. There is nothing anyone can do to you anymore.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The reader is probably asking: Why would anyone go to Camp Green Lake? Most campers weren't given a choice. Camp Green Lake is a camp for bad boys. If you take a bad boy and make him dig a hole every day in the hot sun, it will turn him into a good boy. That was what some people thought.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Stanley Yelnats was given a choice. The judge said, "You may go to jail, or you may go to Camp Green Lake." Stanley was from a poor family. <span class="txt-underline"><strong>He had never been to camp before</strong></span>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Stanley Yelnats was the only passenger on the bus, not counting the driver or the guard. The guard sat next to the driver with his seat turned around facing Stanley. A rifle lay across his lap. Stanley was sitting about ten rows back, handcuffed to his armrest. His backpack lay on the seat next to him. It contained his toothbrush, toothpaste, and a box of stationery his mother had given him. He'd promised to write to her at least once a week. He looked out the window, although there wasn't much to see— mostly fields of hay and cotton. He was on a long bus ride to nowhere. The bus wasn't air-conditioned, and the hot, heavy air was almost as stifling as the handcuffs.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Stanley and his parents had tried to pretend that he was just going away to camp for a while, just like rich kids do. When Stanley was younger he used to play with stuffed animals, and pretend the animals were at camp. Camp Fun and Games he called it.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Sometimes, he'd have them play soccer with a marble. Other times they'd run an obstacle course, or go bungee jumping off a table, tied to broken rubber bands. Now, Stanley tried to pretend he was going to Camp Fun and Games. Maybe he'd make some friends, he thought. At least he'd get to swim in the lake. He didn't have any friends at home. He was overweight and the kids at his middle school often teased him about his size. Even his teachers sometimes made cruel comments without realising it. On his last day of school, his math teacher, Mrs Bell, taught ratios. As an example, she chose the heaviest kid in the class and the lightest kid in the class, and had them weigh themselves. Stanley weighed three times as much as the other boy. Mrs Bell wrote the ratio on the board, 3:1, unaware of how much embarrassment she had caused both of them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Stanley was arrested later that day. He looked at the guard who sat slumped in his seat and wondered if he had fallen asleep. The guard was wearing sunglasses, so Stanley couldn't see his eyes. Stanley was not a bad kid. He was innocent of the crime for which he was convicted. He'd just been in the wrong place at the wrong time. It was all because of his no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather! He smiled. It was a family joke. Whenever anything went wrong, they always blamed Stanley's no-good-dirty-rottenpig-stealing-great-great-grandfather. Supposedly, he had a great-great-grandfather who had stolen a pig from a one-legged Gypsy, and she put a curse on him and all his descendants. Stanley and his parents didn't believe in curses, of course, but whenever anything went wrong, it felt good to be able to blame someone. Things went wrong a lot. They always seemed to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>

<br>
About crocodiles&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>The crocodilian family consists of 23 kinds of crocodile, alligator, caimans and gharials. They are all reptiles. Crocodiles are large, dangerous reptiles found in tropical climates where the temperatures are very warm all year round. They have longer, narrower snouts than alligators, and the 4th tooth of the lower jaw is outside when the mouth is closed. There are two kinds of crocodile, the estuarine (or saltwater) and the freshwater.</p>
        <p>Their long, flattened tail moves from side to side and propels them through the water, with their legs by their sides. <strong>15 ……….</strong> On land, crocodiles can run very quickly, lifting their bodies up off the ground. The eyes and nostrils are on the top part of the head so that they can lie in the water almost completely hidden from view.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Crocodile Farming and Ranching&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>All crocodilians are protected animals. Many species (kinds) of crocodilian have been saved from extinction by crocodile farming and ranching, in which farmers make their living from crocodile products and from tourism. <strong>16 ……….</strong> Ranching means that farmers have a licence to take a small number of eggs or crocodiles from the wild. This gives more encouragement to people to preserve the wetlands habitat, and therefore the crocodiles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All farming and ranching of crocodiles must meet the strict regulations set by CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna).<strong> 17 ………</strong></p>
        <p>Crocodiles are farmed in Thailand, Indonesia, Australia, and the Philippines, among other countries. Products are made from crocodile skin. <strong>18 ……….</strong> It takes the skins of about four crocodiles to make one bag, as only particular parts of the skin are used. The skin of crocodiles from south-east Asia and Australia are particularly favoured for quality leather goods.</p>
        <p><strong>19 ………. </strong>Thailand supplies the major international fashion companies with crocodile leather to make expensive bags and shoes. The meat is sold for food.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Female crocodiles lay about 50 eggs in a nest. On a crocodile farm, the eggs are removed and placed in an incubator to hatch. The eggs are kept at the correct temperature in the incubator. <strong>20 ………. </strong>The young crocodiles are kept in enclosures until they are about 1.5 metres long.</p>

<br>
About crocodiles&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>The crocodilian family consists of 23 kinds of crocodile, alligator, caimans and gharials. They are all reptiles. Crocodiles are large, dangerous reptiles found in tropical climates where the temperatures are very warm all year round. They have longer, narrower snouts than alligators, and the 4th tooth of the lower jaw is outside when the mouth is closed. There are two kinds of crocodile, the estuarine (or saltwater) and the freshwater.</p>
        <p>Their long, flattened tail moves from side to side and propels them through the water, with their legs by their sides. <strong>15 ……….</strong> On land, crocodiles can run very quickly, lifting their bodies up off the ground. The eyes and nostrils are on the top part of the head so that they can lie in the water almost completely hidden from view.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Crocodile Farming and Ranching&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>All crocodilians are protected animals. Many species (kinds) of crocodilian have been saved from extinction by crocodile farming and ranching, in which farmers make their living from crocodile products and from tourism. <strong>16 ……….</strong> Ranching means that farmers have a licence to take a small number of eggs or crocodiles from the wild. This gives more encouragement to people to preserve the wetlands habitat, and therefore the crocodiles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All farming and ranching of crocodiles must meet the strict regulations set by CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna).<strong> 17 ………</strong></p>
        <p>Crocodiles are farmed in Thailand, Indonesia, Australia, and the Philippines, among other countries. Products are made from crocodile skin. <strong>18 ……….</strong> It takes the skins of about four crocodiles to make one bag, as only particular parts of the skin are used. The skin of crocodiles from south-east Asia and Australia are particularly favoured for quality leather goods.</p>
        <p><strong>19 ………. </strong>Thailand supplies the major international fashion companies with crocodile leather to make expensive bags and shoes. The meat is sold for food.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Female crocodiles lay about 50 eggs in a nest. On a crocodile farm, the eggs are removed and placed in an incubator to hatch. The eggs are kept at the correct temperature in the incubator. <strong>20 ………. </strong>The young crocodiles are kept in enclosures until they are about 1.5 metres long.</p>

About crocodiles&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>The crocodilian family consists of 23 kinds of crocodile, alligator, caimans and gharials. They are all reptiles. Crocodiles are large, dangerous reptiles found in tropical climates where the temperatures are very warm all year round. They have longer, narrower snouts than alligators, and the 4th tooth of the lower jaw is outside when the mouth is closed. There are two kinds of crocodile, the estuarine (or saltwater) and the freshwater.</p>
        <p>Their long, flattened tail moves from side to side and propels them through the water, with their legs by their sides. <strong>15 ……….</strong> On land, crocodiles can run very quickly, lifting their bodies up off the ground. The eyes and nostrils are on the top part of the head so that they can lie in the water almost completely hidden from view.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Crocodile Farming and Ranching&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>All crocodilians are protected animals. Many species (kinds) of crocodilian have been saved from extinction by crocodile farming and ranching, in which farmers make their living from crocodile products and from tourism. <strong>16 ……….</strong> Ranching means that farmers have a licence to take a small number of eggs or crocodiles from the wild. This gives more encouragement to people to preserve the wetlands habitat, and therefore the crocodiles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All farming and ranching of crocodiles must meet the strict regulations set by CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna).<strong> 17 ………</strong></p>
        <p>Crocodiles are farmed in Thailand, Indonesia, Australia, and the Philippines, among other countries. Products are made from crocodile skin. <strong>18 ……….</strong> It takes the skins of about four crocodiles to make one bag, as only particular parts of the skin are used. The skin of crocodiles from south-east Asia and Australia are particularly favoured for quality leather goods.</p>
        <p><strong>19 ………. </strong>Thailand supplies the major international fashion companies with crocodile leather to make expensive bags and shoes. The meat is sold for food.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Female crocodiles lay about 50 eggs in a nest. On a crocodile farm, the eggs are removed and placed in an incubator to hatch. The eggs are kept at the correct temperature in the incubator. <strong>20 ………. </strong>The young crocodiles are kept in enclosures until they are about 1.5 metres long.</p>

<br>
About crocodiles&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>The crocodilian family consists of 23 kinds of crocodile, alligator, caimans and gharials. They are all reptiles. Crocodiles are large, dangerous reptiles found in tropical climates where the temperatures are very warm all year round. They have longer, narrower snouts than alligators, and the 4th tooth of the lower jaw is outside when the mouth is closed. There are two kinds of crocodile, the estuarine (or saltwater) and the freshwater.</p>
        <p>Their long, flattened tail moves from side to side and propels them through the water, with their legs by their sides. <strong>15 ……….</strong> On land, crocodiles can run very quickly, lifting their bodies up off the ground. The eyes and nostrils are on the top part of the head so that they can lie in the water almost completely hidden from view.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Crocodile Farming and Ranching&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>All crocodilians are protected animals. Many species (kinds) of crocodilian have been saved from extinction by crocodile farming and ranching, in which farmers make their living from crocodile products and from tourism. <strong>16 ……….</strong> Ranching means that farmers have a licence to take a small number of eggs or crocodiles from the wild. This gives more encouragement to people to preserve the wetlands habitat, and therefore the crocodiles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All farming and ranching of crocodiles must meet the strict regulations set by CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna).<strong> 17 ………</strong></p>
        <p>Crocodiles are farmed in Thailand, Indonesia, Australia, and the Philippines, among other countries. Products are made from crocodile skin. <strong>18 ……….</strong> It takes the skins of about four crocodiles to make one bag, as only particular parts of the skin are used. The skin of crocodiles from south-east Asia and Australia are particularly favoured for quality leather goods.</p>
        <p><strong>19 ………. </strong>Thailand supplies the major international fashion companies with crocodile leather to make expensive bags and shoes. The meat is sold for food.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Female crocodiles lay about 50 eggs in a nest. On a crocodile farm, the eggs are removed and placed in an incubator to hatch. The eggs are kept at the correct temperature in the incubator. <strong>20 ………. </strong>The young crocodiles are kept in enclosures until they are about 1.5 metres long.</p>

            </p>
            <p>People turn to the garden for a variety of reasons; filling open areas in the yard, improving the curbside appeal, fulfilling a personal desire to create, and even partaking for the many health benefits it provides are all great reasons to garden. But what many people are unaware of is how amazing these activities are for the environment. Gardening impacts everything from the air we breathe to the minimising of carbon footprints we leave behind. If you have an area to plant in, even if it’s simply containers on a terrace, take advantage of this space and become part of a healthy environmental impact. Plants produce oxygen through the process of photosynthesis. They take in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through their leaves and use it to help expel oxygen and water. They also remove any chemicals and bacterias that may be floating around in the air, providing an overall healthier environment to be within.</p>

              <strong>Extract B </strong>
            </p>
            <p>The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World listed by Hellenic culture. They were described as a remarkable feat of engineering with an ascending series of tiered gardens containing a wide variety of trees, shrubs, and vines, resembling a large green mountain constructed of mud bricks. It was said to have been built in the ancient city of Babylon, near present-day Hillah, Babil province, in Iraq.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>According to one legend, the Hanging Gardens were built alongside a grand palace known as The Marvel of Mankind, by the Neo-Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar II (who ruled between 605 and 562 BC), for his Median wife Queen Amytis, because she missed the green hills and valleys of her homeland. This was attested to by the Babylonian priest Berossus, writing in about 290 BC, a description that was later quoted by Josephus. One theory suggests that they existed in Babylon, but were completely destroyed sometime around the first century AD.</p>

            <p>It was the lock of the door which had been closed ten years and she put her hand in her pocket, drew out the key and found it fitted the keyhole. She put the key in and turned it. It took two hands to do it, but it did turn. And then she took a long breath and looked behind her up the long walk to see if anyone was coming. She held back the swinging curtain of ivy and pushed back the door which opened slowly—slowly. Then she slipped through it, and shut it behind her, and stood with her back against it, looking about her and breathing quite fast with excitement, and wonder, and delight.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>She was standing inside the secret garden!</strong> It was the sweetest, most mysteriouslooking place anyone could imagine. The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of climbing roses which were so thick that they were matted together. Mary Lennox knew they were roses because she had seen a great many roses in India. There were numbers of standard roses which had so spread their branches that they were like little trees. Their thin gray or brown branches and sprays looked like a sort of hazy mantle spreading over everything, walls, and trees, and even brown grass. It was this hazy tangle from tree to tree which made it all look so mysterious. Mary had thought indeed it was different from any other place she had ever seen in her life.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>“How still it is!” she whispered. “How still!” Then she waited a moment and listened at the stillness. The robin, who had flown to his treetop, was still as all the rest. He did not even flutter his wings; he sat without stirring, and looked at Mary. “No wonder it is still,” she whispered again. “I am the first person who has spoken in here for ten years.”</p>

            <p>I love gardens. Although I currently live in an apartment building, I grew up in a house - in Costa Rica - that was surrounded by a large garden. The garden had mango trees, blackberry shrubs, rows of corn stalks, a lemon tree, and all kinds of flowers. Today I was thinking about that garden and it occurred to me that gardening is a great metaphor for living one’s life. After all, nature is a great teacher and there are many life lessons that can be learned by spending time out in the natural world.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>These are the lessons I believe you can learn from gardening. Have a Vision for Your Garden. You Need to Prioritize. You Need Good Soil. You Reap What You Sow. Assess Your Garden’s Conditions. Build a Fence Around Your Garden. A Garden Needs Constant Tending. Have Patience and Trust the Process. Learn to Deal with Things Outside of Your Control. Reap Your Harvest.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>So, what do you want your garden to look like? What seeds will you plant? What steps will you take to tend your garden? Live your best life by being a good life gardener.</p>

            <p>People turn to the garden for a variety of reasons; filling open areas in the yard, improving the curbside appeal, fulfilling a personal desire to create, and even partaking for the many health benefits it provides are all great reasons to garden. But what many people are unaware of is how amazing these activities are for the environment. Gardening impacts everything from the air we breathe to the minimising of carbon footprints we leave behind. If you have an area to plant in, even if it’s simply containers on a terrace, take advantage of this space and become part of a healthy environmental impact. Plants produce oxygen through the process of photosynthesis. They take in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through their leaves and use it to help expel oxygen and water. They also remove any chemicals and bacterias that may be floating around in the air, providing an overall healthier environment to be within.</p>

            <p>The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World listed by Hellenic culture. They were described as a remarkable feat of engineering with an ascending series of tiered gardens containing a wide variety of trees, shrubs, and vines, resembling a large green mountain constructed of mud bricks. It was said to have been built in the ancient city of Babylon, near present-day Hillah, Babil province, in Iraq.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>According to one legend, the Hanging Gardens were built alongside a grand palace known as The Marvel of Mankind, by the Neo-Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar II (who ruled between 605 and 562 BC), for his Median wife Queen Amytis, because she missed the green hills and valleys of her homeland. This was attested to by the Babylonian priest Berossus, writing in about 290 BC, a description that was later quoted by Josephus. One theory suggests that they existed in Babylon, but were completely destroyed sometime around the first century AD.</p>

            <p>I love gardens. Although I currently live in an apartment building, I grew up in a house - in Costa Rica - that was surrounded by a large garden. The garden had mango trees, blackberry shrubs, rows of corn stalks, a lemon tree, and all kinds of flowers. Today I was thinking about that garden and it occurred to me that gardening is a great metaphor for living one’s life. After all, nature is a great teacher and there are many life lessons that can be learned by spending time out in the natural world.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>These are the lessons I believe you can learn from gardening. Have a Vision for Your Garden. You Need to Prioritize. You Need Good Soil. You Reap What You Sow. Assess Your Garden’s Conditions. Build a Fence Around Your Garden. A Garden Needs Constant Tending. Have Patience and Trust the Process. Learn to Deal with Things Outside of Your Control. Reap Your Harvest.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>So, what do you want your garden to look like? What seeds will you plant? What steps will you take to tend your garden? Live your best life by being a good life gardener.</p>

            <p>People turn to the garden for a variety of reasons; filling open areas in the yard, improving the curbside appeal, fulfilling a personal desire to create, and even partaking for the many health benefits it provides are all great reasons to garden. But what many people are unaware of is how amazing these activities are for the environment. Gardening impacts everything from the air we breathe to the minimising of carbon footprints we leave behind. If you have an area to plant in, even if it’s simply containers on a terrace, take advantage of this space and become part of a healthy environmental impact. Plants produce oxygen through the process of photosynthesis. They take in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through their leaves and use it to help expel oxygen and water. They also remove any chemicals and bacterias that may be floating around in the air, providing an overall healthier environment to be within.</p>

            <p>The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World listed by Hellenic culture. They were described as a remarkable feat of engineering with an ascending series of tiered gardens containing a wide variety of trees, shrubs, and vines, resembling a large green mountain constructed of mud bricks. It was said to have been built in the ancient city of Babylon, near present-day Hillah, Babil province, in Iraq.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>According to one legend, the Hanging Gardens were built alongside a grand palace known as The Marvel of Mankind, by the Neo-Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar II (who ruled between 605 and 562 BC), for his Median wife Queen Amytis, because she missed the green hills and valleys of her homeland. This was attested to by the Babylonian priest Berossus, writing in about 290 BC, a description that was later quoted by Josephus. One theory suggests that they existed in Babylon, but were completely destroyed sometime around the first century AD.</p>

            <p>It was the lock of the door which had been closed ten years and she put her hand in her pocket, drew out the key and found it fitted the keyhole. She put the key in and turned it. It took two hands to do it, but it did turn. And then she took a long breath and looked behind her up the long walk to see if anyone was coming. She held back the swinging curtain of ivy and pushed back the door which opened slowly—slowly. Then she slipped through it, and shut it behind her, and stood with her back against it, looking about her and breathing quite fast with excitement, and wonder, and delight.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>She was standing inside the secret garden!</strong> It was the sweetest, most mysteriouslooking place anyone could imagine. The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of climbing roses which were so thick that they were matted together. Mary Lennox knew they were roses because she had seen a great many roses in India. There were numbers of standard roses which had so spread their branches that they were like little trees. Their thin gray or brown branches and sprays looked like a sort of hazy mantle spreading over everything, walls, and trees, and even brown grass. It was this hazy tangle from tree to tree which made it all look so mysterious. Mary had thought indeed it was different from any other place she had ever seen in her life.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>“How still it is!” she whispered. “How still!” Then she waited a moment and listened at the stillness. The robin, who had flown to his treetop, was still as all the rest. He did not even flutter his wings; he sat without stirring, and looked at Mary. “No wonder it is still,” she whispered again. “I am the first person who has spoken in here for ten years.”</p>

            <p>I love gardens. Although I currently live in an apartment building, I grew up in a house - in Costa Rica - that was surrounded by a large garden. The garden had mango trees, blackberry shrubs, rows of corn stalks, a lemon tree, and all kinds of flowers. Today I was thinking about that garden and it occurred to me that gardening is a great metaphor for living one’s life. After all, nature is a great teacher and there are many life lessons that can be learned by spending time out in the natural world.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>These are the lessons I believe you can learn from gardening. Have a Vision for Your Garden. You Need to Prioritize. You Need Good Soil. You Reap What You Sow. Assess Your Garden’s Conditions. Build a Fence Around Your Garden. A Garden Needs Constant Tending. Have Patience and Trust the Process. Learn to Deal with Things Outside of Your Control. Reap Your Harvest.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>So, what do you want your garden to look like? What seeds will you plant? What steps will you take to tend your garden? Live your best life by being a good life gardener.</p>

            <p>People turn to the garden for a variety of reasons; filling open areas in the yard, improving the curbside appeal, fulfilling a personal desire to create, and even partaking for the many health benefits it provides are all great reasons to garden. But what many people are unaware of is how amazing these activities are for the environment. Gardening impacts everything from the air we breathe to the minimising of carbon footprints we leave behind. If you have an area to plant in, even if it’s simply containers on a terrace, take advantage of this space and become part of a healthy environmental impact. Plants produce oxygen through the process of photosynthesis. They take in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through their leaves and use it to help expel oxygen and water. They also remove any chemicals and bacterias that may be floating around in the air, providing an overall healthier environment to be within.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World listed by Hellenic culture. They were described as a remarkable feat of engineering with an ascending series of tiered gardens containing a wide variety of trees, shrubs, and vines, resembling a large green mountain constructed of mud bricks. It was said to have been built in the ancient city of Babylon, near present-day Hillah, Babil province, in Iraq.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>According to one legend, the Hanging Gardens were built alongside a grand palace known as The Marvel of Mankind, by the Neo-Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar II (who ruled between 605 and 562 BC), for his Median wife Queen Amytis, because she missed the green hills and valleys of her homeland. This was attested to by the Babylonian priest Berossus, writing in about 290 BC, a description that was later quoted by Josephus. One theory suggests that they existed in Babylon, but were completely destroyed sometime around the first century AD.</p>

            <p>It was the lock of the door which had been closed ten years and she put her hand in her pocket, drew out the key and found it fitted the keyhole. She put the key in and turned it. It took two hands to do it, but it did turn. And then she took a long breath and looked behind her up the long walk to see if anyone was coming. She held back the swinging curtain of ivy and pushed back the door which opened slowly—slowly. Then she slipped through it, and shut it behind her, and stood with her back against it, looking about her and breathing quite fast with excitement, and wonder, and delight.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>She was standing inside the secret garden!</strong> It was the sweetest, most mysteriouslooking place anyone could imagine. The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of climbing roses which were so thick that they were matted together. Mary Lennox knew they were roses because she had seen a great many roses in India. There were numbers of standard roses which had so spread their branches that they were like little trees. Their thin gray or brown branches and sprays looked like a sort of hazy mantle spreading over everything, walls, and trees, and even brown grass. It was this hazy tangle from tree to tree which made it all look so mysterious. Mary had thought indeed it was different from any other place she had ever seen in her life.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>“How still it is!” she whispered. “How still!” Then she waited a moment and listened at the stillness. The robin, who had flown to his treetop, was still as all the rest. He did not even flutter his wings; he sat without stirring, and looked at Mary. “No wonder it is still,” she whispered again. “I am the first person who has spoken in here for ten years.”</p>

            <p>People turn to the garden for a variety of reasons; filling open areas in the yard, improving the curbside appeal, fulfilling a personal desire to create, and even partaking for the many health benefits it provides are all great reasons to garden. But what many people are unaware of is how amazing these activities are for the environment. Gardening impacts everything from the air we breathe to the minimising of carbon footprints we leave behind. If you have an area to plant in, even if it’s simply containers on a terrace, take advantage of this space and become part of a healthy environmental impact. Plants produce oxygen through the process of photosynthesis. They take in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through their leaves and use it to help expel oxygen and water. They also remove any chemicals and bacterias that may be floating around in the air, providing an overall healthier environment to be within.</p>

              <strong>Extract B </strong>
            </p>
            <p>The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World listed by Hellenic culture. They were described as a remarkable feat of engineering with an ascending series of tiered gardens containing a wide variety of trees, shrubs, and vines, resembling a large green mountain constructed of mud bricks. It was said to have been built in the ancient city of Babylon, near present-day Hillah, Babil province, in Iraq.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>According to one legend, the Hanging Gardens were built alongside a grand palace known as The Marvel of Mankind, by the Neo-Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar II (who ruled between 605 and 562 BC), for his Median wife Queen Amytis, because she missed the green hills and valleys of her homeland. This was attested to by the Babylonian priest Berossus, writing in about 290 BC, a description that was later quoted by Josephus. One theory suggests that they existed in Babylon, but were completely destroyed sometime around the first century AD.</p>

            <p>It was the lock of the door which had been closed ten years and she put her hand in her pocket, drew out the key and found it fitted the keyhole. She put the key in and turned it. It took two hands to do it, but it did turn. And then she took a long breath and looked behind her up the long walk to see if anyone was coming. She held back the swinging curtain of ivy and pushed back the door which opened slowly—slowly. Then she slipped through it, and shut it behind her, and stood with her back against it, looking about her and breathing quite fast with excitement, and wonder, and delight.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>She was standing inside the secret garden!</strong> It was the sweetest, most mysteriouslooking place anyone could imagine. The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of climbing roses which were so thick that they were matted together. Mary Lennox knew they were roses because she had seen a great many roses in India. There were numbers of standard roses which had so spread their branches that they were like little trees. Their thin gray or brown branches and sprays looked like a sort of hazy mantle spreading over everything, walls, and trees, and even brown grass. It was this hazy tangle from tree to tree which made it all look so mysterious. Mary had thought indeed it was different from any other place she had ever seen in her life.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>“How still it is!” she whispered. “How still!” Then she waited a moment and listened at the stillness. The robin, who had flown to his treetop, was still as all the rest. He did not even flutter his wings; he sat without stirring, and looked at Mary. “No wonder it is still,” she whispered again. “I am the first person who has spoken in here for ten years.”</p>

            <p>I love gardens. Although I currently live in an apartment building, I grew up in a house - in Costa Rica - that was surrounded by a large garden. The garden had mango trees, blackberry shrubs, rows of corn stalks, a lemon tree, and all kinds of flowers. Today I was thinking about that garden and it occurred to me that gardening is a great metaphor for living one’s life. After all, nature is a great teacher and there are many life lessons that can be learned by spending time out in the natural world.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>These are the lessons I believe you can learn from gardening. Have a Vision for Your Garden. You Need to Prioritize. You Need Good Soil. You Reap What You Sow. Assess Your Garden’s Conditions. Build a Fence Around Your Garden. A Garden Needs Constant Tending. Have Patience and Trust the Process. Learn to Deal with Things Outside of Your Control. Reap Your Harvest.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>So, what do you want your garden to look like? What seeds will you plant? What steps will you take to tend your garden? Live your best life by being a good life gardener.</p>

            </p>
            <p>People turn to the garden for a variety of reasons; filling open areas in the yard, improving the curbside appeal, fulfilling a personal desire to create, and even partaking for the many health benefits it provides are all great reasons to garden. But what many people are unaware of is how amazing these activities are for the environment. Gardening impacts everything from the air we breathe to the minimising of carbon footprints we leave behind. If you have an area to plant in, even if it’s simply containers on a terrace, take advantage of this space and become part of a healthy environmental impact. Plants produce oxygen through the process of photosynthesis. They take in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through their leaves and use it to help expel oxygen and water. They also remove any chemicals and bacterias that may be floating around in the air, providing an overall healthier environment to be within.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World listed by Hellenic culture. They were described as a remarkable feat of engineering with an ascending series of tiered gardens containing a wide variety of trees, shrubs, and vines, resembling a large green mountain constructed of mud bricks. It was said to have been built in the ancient city of Babylon, near present-day Hillah, Babil province, in Iraq.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>According to one legend, the Hanging Gardens were built alongside a grand palace known as The Marvel of Mankind, by the Neo-Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar II (who ruled between 605 and 562 BC), for his Median wife Queen Amytis, because she missed the green hills and valleys of her homeland. This was attested to by the Babylonian priest Berossus, writing in about 290 BC, a description that was later quoted by Josephus. One theory suggests that they existed in Babylon, but were completely destroyed sometime around the first century AD.</p>

            <p>It was the lock of the door which had been closed ten years and she put her hand in her pocket, drew out the key and found it fitted the keyhole. She put the key in and turned it. It took two hands to do it, but it did turn. And then she took a long breath and looked behind her up the long walk to see if anyone was coming. She held back the swinging curtain of ivy and pushed back the door which opened slowly—slowly. Then she slipped through it, and shut it behind her, and stood with her back against it, looking about her and breathing quite fast with excitement, and wonder, and delight.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>She was standing inside the secret garden!</strong> It was the sweetest, most mysteriouslooking place anyone could imagine. The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of climbing roses which were so thick that they were matted together. Mary Lennox knew they were roses because she had seen a great many roses in India. There were numbers of standard roses which had so spread their branches that they were like little trees. Their thin gray or brown branches and sprays looked like a sort of hazy mantle spreading over everything, walls, and trees, and even brown grass. It was this hazy tangle from tree to tree which made it all look so mysterious. Mary had thought indeed it was different from any other place she had ever seen in her life.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>“How still it is!” she whispered. “How still!” Then she waited a moment and listened at the stillness. The robin, who had flown to his treetop, was still as all the rest. He did not even flutter his wings; he sat without stirring, and looked at Mary. “No wonder it is still,” she whispered again. “I am the first person who has spoken in here for ten years.”</p>

            </p>
            <p>I love gardens. Although I currently live in an apartment building, I grew up in a house - in Costa Rica - that was surrounded by a large garden. The garden had mango trees, blackberry shrubs, rows of corn stalks, a lemon tree, and all kinds of flowers. Today I was thinking about that garden and it occurred to me that gardening is a great metaphor for living one’s life. After all, nature is a great teacher and there are many life lessons that can be learned by spending time out in the natural world.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>These are the lessons I believe you can learn from gardening. Have a Vision for Your Garden. You Need to Prioritize. You Need Good Soil. You Reap What You Sow. Assess Your Garden’s Conditions. Build a Fence Around Your Garden. A Garden Needs Constant Tending. Have Patience and Trust the Process. Learn to Deal with Things Outside of Your Control. Reap Your Harvest.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>So, what do you want your garden to look like? What seeds will you plant? What steps will you take to tend your garden? Live your best life by being a good life gardener.</p>

          <strong>YOU ARE ENTERING CAMP GREEN LAKE&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Louis Sachar, ‘Holes’&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There is no lake at Camp Green Lake. There once was a very large lake here, the largest lake in Texas. That was over a hundred years ago. Now it is just a dry, flat wasteland. There used to be a town of Green Lake as well. The town shrivelled and dried up along with the lake, and the people who lived there. During the summer the daytime temperature hovers around ninety-five degrees in the shade— if you can find any shade. There's not much shade in a big dry lake. The only trees are two old oaks on the eastern edge of the "lake." A hammock is stretched between the two trees, and a log cabin stands behind that. The campers are forbidden to lie in the hammock. It belongs to the Warden. The Warden owns the shade.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Out on the lake, rattlesnakes and scorpions find shade under rocks and in the holes dug by the campers. Here's a good rule to remember about rattlesnakes and scorpions: If you don't bother them, they won't bother you. <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Usually</strong></span>. Being bitten by a scorpion or even a rattlesnake is not the worst thing that can happen to you. You won't die. <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Usually</strong></span>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Sometimes a camper will try to be bitten by a scorpion, or even a small rattlesnake. Then he will get to spend a day or two recovering in his tent, instead of having to dig a hole out on the lake but you don't want to be bitten by a yellow-spotted lizard. That's the worst thing that can happen to you. You will die a slow and painful death. Always. If you get bitten by a yellow-spotted lizard, you might as well go into the shade of the oak trees and lie in the hammock. There is nothing anyone can do to you anymore.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The reader is probably asking: Why would anyone go to Camp Green Lake? Most campers weren't given a choice. Camp Green Lake is a camp for bad boys. If you take a bad boy and make him dig a hole every day in the hot sun, it will turn him into a good boy. That was what some people thought.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Stanley Yelnats was given a choice. The judge said, "You may go to jail, or you may go to Camp Green Lake." Stanley was from a poor family. <span class="txt-underline"><strong>He had never been to camp before</strong></span>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Stanley Yelnats was the only passenger on the bus, not counting the driver or the guard. The guard sat next to the driver with his seat turned around facing Stanley. A rifle lay across his lap. Stanley was sitting about ten rows back, handcuffed to his armrest. His backpack lay on the seat next to him. It contained his toothbrush, toothpaste, and a box of stationery his mother had given him. He'd promised to write to her at least once a week. He looked out the window, although there wasn't much to see— mostly fields of hay and cotton. He was on a long bus ride to nowhere. The bus wasn't air-conditioned, and the hot, heavy air was almost as stifling as the handcuffs.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Stanley and his parents had tried to pretend that he was just going away to camp for a while, just like rich kids do. When Stanley was younger he used to play with stuffed animals, and pretend the animals were at camp. Camp Fun and Games he called it.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Sometimes, he'd have them play soccer with a marble. Other times they'd run an obstacle course, or go bungee jumping off a table, tied to broken rubber bands. Now, Stanley tried to pretend he was going to Camp Fun and Games. Maybe he'd make some friends, he thought. At least he'd get to swim in the lake. He didn't have any friends at home. He was overweight and the kids at his middle school often teased him about his size. Even his teachers sometimes made cruel comments without realising it. On his last day of school, his math teacher, Mrs Bell, taught ratios. As an example, she chose the heaviest kid in the class and the lightest kid in the class, and had them weigh themselves. Stanley weighed three times as much as the other boy. Mrs Bell wrote the ratio on the board, 3:1, unaware of how much embarrassment she had caused both of them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Stanley was arrested later that day. He looked at the guard who sat slumped in his seat and wondered if he had fallen asleep. The guard was wearing sunglasses, so Stanley couldn't see his eyes. Stanley was not a bad kid. He was innocent of the crime for which he was convicted. He'd just been in the wrong place at the wrong time. It was all because of his no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather! He smiled. It was a family joke. Whenever anything went wrong, they always blamed Stanley's no-good-dirty-rottenpig-stealing-great-great-grandfather. Supposedly, he had a great-great-grandfather who had stolen a pig from a one-legged Gypsy, and she put a curse on him and all his descendants. Stanley and his parents didn't believe in curses, of course, but whenever anything went wrong, it felt good to be able to blame someone. Things went wrong a lot. They always seemed to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>

        <p>There is no lake at Camp Green Lake. There once was a very large lake here, the largest lake in Texas. That was over a hundred years ago. Now it is just a dry, flat wasteland. There used to be a town of Green Lake as well. The town shrivelled and dried up along with the lake, and the people who lived there. During the summer the daytime temperature hovers around ninety-five degrees in the shade— if you can find any shade. There's not much shade in a big dry lake. The only trees are two old oaks on the eastern edge of the "lake." A hammock is stretched between the two trees, and a log cabin stands behind that. The campers are forbidden to lie in the hammock. It belongs to the Warden. The Warden owns the shade.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Out on the lake, rattlesnakes and scorpions find shade under rocks and in the holes dug by the campers. Here's a good rule to remember about rattlesnakes and scorpions: If you don't bother them, they won't bother you. <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Usually</strong></span>. Being bitten by a scorpion or even a rattlesnake is not the worst thing that can happen to you. You won't die. <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Usually</strong></span>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Sometimes a camper will try to be bitten by a scorpion, or even a small rattlesnake. Then he will get to spend a day or two recovering in his tent, instead of having to dig a hole out on the lake but you don't want to be bitten by a yellow-spotted lizard. That's the worst thing that can happen to you. You will die a slow and painful death. Always. If you get bitten by a yellow-spotted lizard, you might as well go into the shade of the oak trees and lie in the hammock. There is nothing anyone can do to you anymore.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The reader is probably asking: Why would anyone go to Camp Green Lake? Most campers weren't given a choice. Camp Green Lake is a camp for bad boys. If you take a bad boy and make him dig a hole every day in the hot sun, it will turn him into a good boy. That was what some people thought.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Stanley Yelnats was given a choice. The judge said, "You may go to jail, or you may go to Camp Green Lake." Stanley was from a poor family. <span class="txt-underline"><strong>He had never been to camp before</strong></span>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Stanley Yelnats was the only passenger on the bus, not counting the driver or the guard. The guard sat next to the driver with his seat turned around facing Stanley. A rifle lay across his lap. Stanley was sitting about ten rows back, handcuffed to his armrest. His backpack lay on the seat next to him. It contained his toothbrush, toothpaste, and a box of stationery his mother had given him. He'd promised to write to her at least once a week. He looked out the window, although there wasn't much to see— mostly fields of hay and cotton. He was on a long bus ride to nowhere. The bus wasn't air-conditioned, and the hot, heavy air was almost as stifling as the handcuffs.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Stanley and his parents had tried to pretend that he was just going away to camp for a while, just like rich kids do. When Stanley was younger he used to play with stuffed animals, and pretend the animals were at camp. Camp Fun and Games he called it.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Sometimes, he'd have them play soccer with a marble. Other times they'd run an obstacle course, or go bungee jumping off a table, tied to broken rubber bands. Now, Stanley tried to pretend he was going to Camp Fun and Games. Maybe he'd make some friends, he thought. At least he'd get to swim in the lake. He didn't have any friends at home. He was overweight and the kids at his middle school often teased him about his size. Even his teachers sometimes made cruel comments without realising it. On his last day of school, his math teacher, Mrs Bell, taught ratios. As an example, she chose the heaviest kid in the class and the lightest kid in the class, and had them weigh themselves. Stanley weighed three times as much as the other boy. Mrs Bell wrote the ratio on the board, 3:1, unaware of how much embarrassment she had caused both of them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Stanley was arrested later that day. He looked at the guard who sat slumped in his seat and wondered if he had fallen asleep. The guard was wearing sunglasses, so Stanley couldn't see his eyes. Stanley was not a bad kid. He was innocent of the crime for which he was convicted. He'd just been in the wrong place at the wrong time. It was all because of his no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather! He smiled. It was a family joke. Whenever anything went wrong, they always blamed Stanley's no-good-dirty-rottenpig-stealing-great-great-grandfather. Supposedly, he had a great-great-grandfather who had stolen a pig from a one-legged Gypsy, and she put a curse on him and all his descendants. Stanley and his parents didn't believe in curses, of course, but whenever anything went wrong, it felt good to be able to blame someone. Things went wrong a lot. They always seemed to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>

        <p>There is no lake at Camp Green Lake. There once was a very large lake here, the largest lake in Texas. That was over a hundred years ago. Now it is just a dry, flat wasteland. There used to be a town of Green Lake as well. The town shrivelled and dried up along with the lake, and the people who lived there. During the summer the daytime temperature hovers around ninety-five degrees in the shade— if you can find any shade. There's not much shade in a big dry lake. The only trees are two old oaks on the eastern edge of the "lake." A hammock is stretched between the two trees, and a log cabin stands behind that. The campers are forbidden to lie in the hammock. It belongs to the Warden. The Warden owns the shade.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Out on the lake, rattlesnakes and scorpions find shade under rocks and in the holes dug by the campers. Here's a good rule to remember about rattlesnakes and scorpions: If you don't bother them, they won't bother you. <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Usually</strong></span>. Being bitten by a scorpion or even a rattlesnake is not the worst thing that can happen to you. You won't die. <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Usually</strong></span>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Sometimes a camper will try to be bitten by a scorpion, or even a small rattlesnake. Then he will get to spend a day or two recovering in his tent, instead of having to dig a hole out on the lake but you don't want to be bitten by a yellow-spotted lizard. That's the worst thing that can happen to you. You will die a slow and painful death. Always. If you get bitten by a yellow-spotted lizard, you might as well go into the shade of the oak trees and lie in the hammock. There is nothing anyone can do to you anymore.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The reader is probably asking: Why would anyone go to Camp Green Lake? Most campers weren't given a choice. Camp Green Lake is a camp for bad boys. If you take a bad boy and make him dig a hole every day in the hot sun, it will turn him into a good boy. That was what some people thought.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Stanley Yelnats was given a choice. The judge said, "You may go to jail, or you may go to Camp Green Lake." Stanley was from a poor family. <span class="txt-underline"><strong>He had never been to camp before</strong></span>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Stanley Yelnats was the only passenger on the bus, not counting the driver or the guard. The guard sat next to the driver with his seat turned around facing Stanley. A rifle lay across his lap. Stanley was sitting about ten rows back, handcuffed to his armrest. His backpack lay on the seat next to him. It contained his toothbrush, toothpaste, and a box of stationery his mother had given him. He'd promised to write to her at least once a week. He looked out the window, although there wasn't much to see— mostly fields of hay and cotton. He was on a long bus ride to nowhere. The bus wasn't air-conditioned, and the hot, heavy air was almost as stifling as the handcuffs.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Stanley and his parents had tried to pretend that he was just going away to camp for a while, just like rich kids do. When Stanley was younger he used to play with stuffed animals, and pretend the animals were at camp. Camp Fun and Games he called it.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Sometimes, he'd have them play soccer with a marble. Other times they'd run an obstacle course, or go bungee jumping off a table, tied to broken rubber bands. Now, Stanley tried to pretend he was going to Camp Fun and Games. Maybe he'd make some friends, he thought. At least he'd get to swim in the lake. He didn't have any friends at home. He was overweight and the kids at his middle school often teased him about his size. Even his teachers sometimes made cruel comments without realising it. On his last day of school, his math teacher, Mrs Bell, taught ratios. As an example, she chose the heaviest kid in the class and the lightest kid in the class, and had them weigh themselves. Stanley weighed three times as much as the other boy. Mrs Bell wrote the ratio on the board, 3:1, unaware of how much embarrassment she had caused both of them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Stanley was arrested later that day. He looked at the guard who sat slumped in his seat and wondered if he had fallen asleep. The guard was wearing sunglasses, so Stanley couldn't see his eyes. Stanley was not a bad kid. He was innocent of the crime for which he was convicted. He'd just been in the wrong place at the wrong time. It was all because of his no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather! He smiled. It was a family joke. Whenever anything went wrong, they always blamed Stanley's no-good-dirty-rottenpig-stealing-great-great-grandfather. Supposedly, he had a great-great-grandfather who had stolen a pig from a one-legged Gypsy, and she put a curse on him and all his descendants. Stanley and his parents didn't believe in curses, of course, but whenever anything went wrong, it felt good to be able to blame someone. Things went wrong a lot. They always seemed to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>

The only trees are two old oaks on the eastern edge of the "lake." A hammock is stretched between the two trees, and a log cabin stands behind that. The campers are forbidden to lie in the hammock. It belongs to the Warden. The Warden owns the shade.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Out on the lake, rattlesnakes and scorpions find shade under rocks and in the holes dug by the campers. Here's a good rule to remember about rattlesnakes and scorpions: If you don't bother them, they won't bother you. <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Usually</strong></span>. Being bitten by a scorpion or even a rattlesnake is not the worst thing that can happen to you. You won't die. <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Usually</strong></span>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Sometimes a camper will try to be bitten by a scorpion, or even a small rattlesnake. Then he will get to spend a day or two recovering in his tent, instead of having to dig a hole out on the lake but you don't want to be bitten by a yellow-spotted lizard. That's the worst thing that can happen to you. You will die a slow and painful death. Always. If you get bitten by a yellow-spotted lizard, you might as well go into the shade of the oak trees and lie in the hammock. There is nothing anyone can do to you anymore.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The reader is probably asking: Why would anyone go to Camp Green Lake? Most campers weren't given a choice. Camp Green Lake is a camp for bad boys. If you take a bad boy and make him dig a hole every day in the hot sun, it will turn him into a good boy. That was what some people thought.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Stanley Yelnats was given a choice. The judge said, "You may go to jail, or you may go to Camp Green Lake." Stanley was from a poor family. <span class="txt-underline"><strong>He had never been to camp before</strong></span>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Stanley Yelnats was the only passenger on the bus, not counting the driver or the guard. The guard sat next to the driver with his seat turned around facing Stanley. A rifle lay across his lap. Stanley was sitting about ten rows back, handcuffed to his armrest. His backpack lay on the seat next to him. It contained his toothbrush, toothpaste, and a box of stationery his mother had given him. He'd promised to write to her at least once a week. He looked out the window, although there wasn't much to see— mostly fields of hay and cotton. He was on a long bus ride to nowhere. The bus wasn't air-conditioned, and the hot, heavy air was almost as stifling as the handcuffs.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Stanley and his parents had tried to pretend that he was just going away to camp for a while, just like rich kids do. When Stanley was younger he used to play with stuffed animals, and pretend the animals were at camp. Camp Fun and Games he called it.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Sometimes, he'd have them play soccer with a marble. Other times they'd run an obstacle course, or go bungee jumping off a table, tied to broken rubber bands. Now, Stanley tried to pretend he was going to Camp Fun and Games. Maybe he'd make some friends, he thought. At least he'd get to swim in the lake. He didn't have any friends at home. He was overweight and the kids at his middle school often teased him about his size. Even his teachers sometimes made cruel comments without realising it. On his last day of school, his math teacher, Mrs Bell, taught ratios. As an example, she chose the heaviest kid in the class and the lightest kid in the class, and had them weigh themselves. Stanley weighed three times as much as the other boy. Mrs Bell wrote the ratio on the board, 3:1, unaware of how much embarrassment she had caused both of them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Stanley was arrested later that day. He looked at the guard who sat slumped in his seat and wondered if he had fallen asleep. The guard was wearing sunglasses, so Stanley couldn't see his eyes. Stanley was not a bad kid. He was innocent of the crime for which he was convicted. He'd just been in the wrong place at the wrong time. It was all because of his no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather! He smiled. It was a family joke. Whenever anything went wrong, they always blamed Stanley's no-good-dirty-rottenpig-stealing-great-great-grandfather. Supposedly, he had a great-great-grandfather who had stolen a pig from a one-legged Gypsy, and she put a curse on him and all his descendants. Stanley and his parents didn't believe in curses, of course, but whenever anything went wrong, it felt good to be able to blame someone. Things went wrong a lot. They always seemed to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>
