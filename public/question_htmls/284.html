          <strong>The End of the Storm</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp;Thi Liên watched from the window as the rain poured down. In the distance beyond the dark clouds, she could see Sam Mountain at the edge of her village. Thi Liên had always thought Sam was a silly name. The shape of the mountain resembled a gigantic king crab, so people called it Sam, which means “king crab” in Vietnamese.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;“The floodwaters have risen so high that I might as well be living by the sea with the king crabs,” Thi Liên mumbled.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;Heavy rains were a part of life in Vietnam. Each year seasonal winds brought seemingly endless downpours. The rainy season, called the monsoon, usually lasted from May through September. Though the rains were <span class="txt-underline">torrential</span>, they weren’t always destructive. The rain washing down from the hillsides carried silt that was rich in nutrients. The floodwaters made the land along the Mekong River fertile for growing rice.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;Suddenly a gust of wind and rain swept through the doorway as Thi Liên’s father returned from their neighbor’s home. He was drenched and shivering. “News from upriver is not encouraging,” he said, trying not to upset them. “This season’s rains have overflowed the river’s banks. Surging floodwaters are claiming almost everything in their path. Families have had to move to safer locations, and there are reports that some houses have been swept away.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;Thi Liên stared out the window. She tried to focus on the bountiful rice harvest that the floodwaters would bring, but fear rose within her like the rising river.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;Grandfather came over and put his hand on her shoulder. “The floodwaters have visited our village before, but they have never knocked on our door,” he said softly.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;Thi Liên thought about what her grandfather said. Yet he could not deny that this year’s rains were unusually heavy. Days had gone by without even a ray of sunlight.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;Father paced back and forth, shooting nervous glances in Grandfather’s direction. Grandfather remained standing near the window, watching the rain as it continued to fall.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;Later, while several neighbors waded through the flooded streets, her parents made a decision. “It’s time to evacuate,” Father announced. “We can go to the community center. It’s on higher ground, so we should be safe there.”</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;“No!” Grandfather said firmly. “It’s wrong to drag your family out of their home in fear.”</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;“We’re leaving with thoughts of safety, not fear,” Father replied forcefully.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;Thi Liên shuddered. She had never heard her father raise his voice to his own father. Though Father was an adult, arguing with Grandfather was considered disrespectful.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;Father and Grandfather faced each other, neither speaking another word. Their long, uneasy silence seemed as if it would last forever. Suddenly a loud clap of thunder sounded, breaking the silence. Father walked boldly to the door and opened it. Thi Liên, her mother, and her grandfather followed obediently.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;They waded knee-deep through the drowning streets. Holding on to one another, they struggled against the currents. Thi Liên kicked off her sandals, hoping she would have better footing in her bare feet. She had no choice but to watch as her sandals were quickly swept away.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;Finally they reached the crowded community center. It was filled with other families looking for refuge from the rising water. Exhausted from the struggle, Thi Liên lay down on a mat and tried to sleep, but all she could think about was Grandfather’s expression as Father opened the door. Thi Liên turned to face the wall. The rain pounding on the metal roof muffled her sobs.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;Early the next morning Thi Liên was awakened by a gentle touch on her shoulder. Turning, she saw her grandfather. He brushed her long dark hair away from her face. “I’ve been a foolish man,” he said softly. “Because of my pride, I have refused to speak to your father when I should be thankful.”</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp;Thi Liên could not think of any reason that they should be thankful. Their home was probably full of water by now. They were living in cramped conditions with many other families. And the rain was still falling!</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp;“I don’t understand,” she said slowly.</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp;“Here we have shelter from the rain and more than enough food,” Grandfather explained. “Others are living in rescue camps or sleeping in <span class="txt-underline">makeshift</span> shelters quickly built from whatever they can find to protect them from the weather. Some people’s homes have been completely washed away. We don’t know whether our home is still standing, but it doesn’t matter. All that matters is that we are safe and together.”</p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;Thi Liên studied her grandfather’s expression. In his eyes she could see his profound sense of gratitude.</p>
        <p>21&nbsp; &nbsp;“Will you ever speak to Father again?” she asked.</p>
        <p>22&nbsp; &nbsp;“Of course I will,” he assured her. “In fact, I think I’ll go over right now and tell him how foolish I’ve been.”</p>
        <p>23&nbsp; &nbsp;Thi Liên watched as Grandfather walked to the table where Father was seated. After exchanging a few words, Grandfather sat down across from his son.</p>
        <p>24&nbsp; &nbsp;Off in the distance, a ray of sunlight broke through the clouds.</p>

          <strong>The End of the Storm</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp;Thi Liên watched from the window as the rain poured down. In the distance beyond the dark clouds, she could see Sam Mountain at the edge of her village. Thi Liên had always thought Sam was a silly name. The shape of the mountain resembled a gigantic king crab, so people called it Sam, which means “king crab” in Vietnamese.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;“The floodwaters have risen so high that I might as well be living by the sea with the king crabs,” Thi Liên mumbled.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;Heavy rains were a part of life in Vietnam. Each year seasonal winds brought seemingly endless downpours. The rainy season, called the monsoon, usually lasted from May through September. Though the rains were <span class="txt-underline">torrential</span>, they weren’t always destructive. The rain washing down from the hillsides carried silt that was rich in nutrients. The floodwaters made the land along the Mekong River fertile for growing rice.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;Suddenly a gust of wind and rain swept through the doorway as Thi Liên’s father returned from their neighbor’s home. He was drenched and shivering. “News from upriver is not encouraging,” he said, trying not to upset them. “This season’s rains have overflowed the river’s banks. Surging floodwaters are claiming almost everything in their path. Families have had to move to safer locations, and there are reports that some houses have been swept away.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;Thi Liên stared out the window. She tried to focus on the bountiful rice harvest that the floodwaters would bring, but fear rose within her like the rising river.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;Grandfather came over and put his hand on her shoulder. “The floodwaters have visited our village before, but they have never knocked on our door,” he said softly.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;Thi Liên thought about what her grandfather said. Yet he could not deny that this year’s rains were unusually heavy. Days had gone by without even a ray of sunlight.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;Father paced back and forth, shooting nervous glances in Grandfather’s direction. Grandfather remained standing near the window, watching the rain as it continued to fall.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;Later, while several neighbors waded through the flooded streets, her parents made a decision. “It’s time to evacuate,” Father announced. “We can go to the community center. It’s on higher ground, so we should be safe there.”</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;“No!” Grandfather said firmly. “It’s wrong to drag your family out of their home in fear.”</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;“We’re leaving with thoughts of safety, not fear,” Father replied forcefully.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;Thi Liên shuddered. She had never heard her father raise his voice to his own father. Though Father was an adult, arguing with Grandfather was considered disrespectful.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;Father and Grandfather faced each other, neither speaking another word. Their long, uneasy silence seemed as if it would last forever. Suddenly a loud clap of thunder sounded, breaking the silence. Father walked boldly to the door and opened it. Thi Liên, her mother, and her grandfather followed obediently.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;They waded knee-deep through the drowning streets. Holding on to one another, they struggled against the currents. Thi Liên kicked off her sandals, hoping she would have better footing in her bare feet. She had no choice but to watch as her sandals were quickly swept away.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;Finally they reached the crowded community center. It was filled with other families looking for refuge from the rising water. Exhausted from the struggle, Thi Liên lay down on a mat and tried to sleep, but all she could think about was Grandfather’s expression as Father opened the door. Thi Liên turned to face the wall. The rain pounding on the metal roof muffled her sobs.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;Early the next morning Thi Liên was awakened by a gentle touch on her shoulder. Turning, she saw her grandfather. He brushed her long dark hair away from her face. “I’ve been a foolish man,” he said softly. “Because of my pride, I have refused to speak to your father when I should be thankful.”</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp;Thi Liên could not think of any reason that they should be thankful. Their home was probably full of water by now. They were living in cramped conditions with many other families. And the rain was still falling!</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp;“I don’t understand,” she said slowly.</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp;“Here we have shelter from the rain and more than enough food,” Grandfather explained. “Others are living in rescue camps or sleeping in <span class="txt-underline">makeshift</span> shelters quickly built from whatever they can find to protect them from the weather. Some people’s homes have been completely washed away. We don’t know whether our home is still standing, but it doesn’t matter. All that matters is that we are safe and together.”</p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;Thi Liên studied her grandfather’s expression. In his eyes she could see his profound sense of gratitude.</p>
        <p>21&nbsp; &nbsp;“Will you ever speak to Father again?” she asked.</p>
        <p>22&nbsp; &nbsp;“Of course I will,” he assured her. “In fact, I think I’ll go over right now and tell him how foolish I’ve been.”</p>
        <p>23&nbsp; &nbsp;Thi Liên watched as Grandfather walked to the table where Father was seated. After exchanging a few words, Grandfather sat down across from his son.</p>
        <p>24&nbsp; &nbsp;Off in the distance, a ray of sunlight broke through the clouds.</p>

          <strong>The End of the Storm</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp;Thi Liên watched from the window as the rain poured down. In the distance beyond the dark clouds, she could see Sam Mountain at the edge of her village. Thi Liên had always thought Sam was a silly name. The shape of the mountain resembled a gigantic king crab, so people called it Sam, which means “king crab” in Vietnamese.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;“The floodwaters have risen so high that I might as well be living by the sea with the king crabs,” Thi Liên mumbled.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;Heavy rains were a part of life in Vietnam. Each year seasonal winds brought seemingly endless downpours. The rainy season, called the monsoon, usually lasted from May through September. Though the rains were <span class="txt-underline">torrential</span>, they weren’t always destructive. The rain washing down from the hillsides carried silt that was rich in nutrients. The floodwaters made the land along the Mekong River fertile for growing rice.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;Suddenly a gust of wind and rain swept through the doorway as Thi Liên’s father returned from their neighbor’s home. He was drenched and shivering. “News from upriver is not encouraging,” he said, trying not to upset them. “This season’s rains have overflowed the river’s banks. Surging floodwaters are claiming almost everything in their path. Families have had to move to safer locations, and there are reports that some houses have been swept away.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;Thi Liên stared out the window. She tried to focus on the bountiful rice harvest that the floodwaters would bring, but fear rose within her like the rising river.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;Grandfather came over and put his hand on her shoulder. “The floodwaters have visited our village before, but they have never knocked on our door,” he said softly.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;Thi Liên thought about what her grandfather said. Yet he could not deny that this year’s rains were unusually heavy. Days had gone by without even a ray of sunlight.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;Father paced back and forth, shooting nervous glances in Grandfather’s direction. Grandfather remained standing near the window, watching the rain as it continued to fall.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;Later, while several neighbors waded through the flooded streets, her parents made a decision. “It’s time to evacuate,” Father announced. “We can go to the community center. It’s on higher ground, so we should be safe there.”</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;“No!” Grandfather said firmly. “It’s wrong to drag your family out of their home in fear.”</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;“We’re leaving with thoughts of safety, not fear,” Father replied forcefully.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;Thi Liên shuddered. She had never heard her father raise his voice to his own father. Though Father was an adult, arguing with Grandfather was considered disrespectful.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;Father and Grandfather faced each other, neither speaking another word. Their long, uneasy silence seemed as if it would last forever. Suddenly a loud clap of thunder sounded, breaking the silence. Father walked boldly to the door and opened it. Thi Liên, her mother, and her grandfather followed obediently.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;They waded knee-deep through the drowning streets. Holding on to one another, they struggled against the currents. Thi Liên kicked off her sandals, hoping she would have better footing in her bare feet. She had no choice but to watch as her sandals were quickly swept away.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;Finally they reached the crowded community center. It was filled with other families looking for refuge from the rising water. Exhausted from the struggle, Thi Liên lay down on a mat and tried to sleep, but all she could think about was Grandfather’s expression as Father opened the door. Thi Liên turned to face the wall. The rain pounding on the metal roof muffled her sobs.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;Early the next morning Thi Liên was awakened by a gentle touch on her shoulder. Turning, she saw her grandfather. He brushed her long dark hair away from her face. “I’ve been a foolish man,” he said softly. “Because of my pride, I have refused to speak to your father when I should be thankful.”</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp;Thi Liên could not think of any reason that they should be thankful. Their home was probably full of water by now. They were living in cramped conditions with many other families. And the rain was still falling!</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp;“I don’t understand,” she said slowly.</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp;“Here we have shelter from the rain and more than enough food,” Grandfather explained. “Others are living in rescue camps or sleeping in <span class="txt-underline">makeshift</span> shelters quickly built from whatever they can find to protect them from the weather. Some people’s homes have been completely washed away. We don’t know whether our home is still standing, but it doesn’t matter. All that matters is that we are safe and together.”</p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;Thi Liên studied her grandfather’s expression. In his eyes she could see his profound sense of gratitude.</p>
        <p>21&nbsp; &nbsp;“Will you ever speak to Father again?” she asked.</p>
        <p>22&nbsp; &nbsp;“Of course I will,” he assured her. “In fact, I think I’ll go over right now and tell him how foolish I’ve been.”</p>
        <p>23&nbsp; &nbsp;Thi Liên watched as Grandfather walked to the table where Father was seated. After exchanging a few words, Grandfather sat down across from his son.</p>
        <p>24&nbsp; &nbsp;Off in the distance, a ray of sunlight broke through the clouds.</p>

          <strong>The End of the Storm</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp;Thi Liên watched from the window as the rain poured down. In the distance beyond the dark clouds, she could see Sam Mountain at the edge of her village. Thi Liên had always thought Sam was a silly name. The shape of the mountain resembled a gigantic king crab, so people called it Sam, which means “king crab” in Vietnamese.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;“The floodwaters have risen so high that I might as well be living by the sea with the king crabs,” Thi Liên mumbled.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;Heavy rains were a part of life in Vietnam. Each year seasonal winds brought seemingly endless downpours. The rainy season, called the monsoon, usually lasted from May through September. Though the rains were <span class="txt-underline">torrential</span>, they weren’t always destructive. The rain washing down from the hillsides carried silt that was rich in nutrients. The floodwaters made the land along the Mekong River fertile for growing rice.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;Suddenly a gust of wind and rain swept through the doorway as Thi Liên’s father returned from their neighbor’s home. He was drenched and shivering. “News from upriver is not encouraging,” he said, trying not to upset them. “This season’s rains have overflowed the river’s banks. Surging floodwaters are claiming almost everything in their path. Families have had to move to safer locations, and there are reports that some houses have been swept away.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;Thi Liên stared out the window. She tried to focus on the bountiful rice harvest that the floodwaters would bring, but fear rose within her like the rising river.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;Grandfather came over and put his hand on her shoulder. “The floodwaters have visited our village before, but they have never knocked on our door,” he said softly.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;Thi Liên thought about what her grandfather said. Yet he could not deny that this year’s rains were unusually heavy. Days had gone by without even a ray of sunlight.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;Father paced back and forth, shooting nervous glances in Grandfather’s direction. Grandfather remained standing near the window, watching the rain as it continued to fall.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;Later, while several neighbors waded through the flooded streets, her parents made a decision. “It’s time to evacuate,” Father announced. “We can go to the community center. It’s on higher ground, so we should be safe there.”</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;“No!” Grandfather said firmly. “It’s wrong to drag your family out of their home in fear.”</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;“We’re leaving with thoughts of safety, not fear,” Father replied forcefully.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;Thi Liên shuddered. She had never heard her father raise his voice to his own father. Though Father was an adult, arguing with Grandfather was considered disrespectful.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;Father and Grandfather faced each other, neither speaking another word. Their long, uneasy silence seemed as if it would last forever. Suddenly a loud clap of thunder sounded, breaking the silence. Father walked boldly to the door and opened it. Thi Liên, her mother, and her grandfather followed obediently.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;They waded knee-deep through the drowning streets. Holding on to one another, they struggled against the currents. Thi Liên kicked off her sandals, hoping she would have better footing in her bare feet. She had no choice but to watch as her sandals were quickly swept away.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;Finally they reached the crowded community center. It was filled with other families looking for refuge from the rising water. Exhausted from the struggle, Thi Liên lay down on a mat and tried to sleep, but all she could think about was Grandfather’s expression as Father opened the door. Thi Liên turned to face the wall. The rain pounding on the metal roof muffled her sobs.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;Early the next morning Thi Liên was awakened by a gentle touch on her shoulder. Turning, she saw her grandfather. He brushed her long dark hair away from her face. “I’ve been a foolish man,” he said softly. “Because of my pride, I have refused to speak to your father when I should be thankful.”</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp;Thi Liên could not think of any reason that they should be thankful. Their home was probably full of water by now. They were living in cramped conditions with many other families. And the rain was still falling!</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp;“I don’t understand,” she said slowly.</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp;“Here we have shelter from the rain and more than enough food,” Grandfather explained. “Others are living in rescue camps or sleeping in <span class="txt-underline">makeshift</span> shelters quickly built from whatever they can find to protect them from the weather. Some people’s homes have been completely washed away. We don’t know whether our home is still standing, but it doesn’t matter. All that matters is that we are safe and together.”</p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;Thi Liên studied her grandfather’s expression. In his eyes she could see his profound sense of gratitude.</p>
        <p>21&nbsp; &nbsp;“Will you ever speak to Father again?” she asked.</p>
        <p>22&nbsp; &nbsp;“Of course I will,” he assured her. “In fact, I think I’ll go over right now and tell him how foolish I’ve been.”</p>
        <p>23&nbsp; &nbsp;Thi Liên watched as Grandfather walked to the table where Father was seated. After exchanging a few words, Grandfather sat down across from his son.</p>
        <p>24&nbsp; &nbsp;Off in the distance, a ray of sunlight broke through the clouds.</p>

          <strong>The End of the Storm</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp;Thi Liên watched from the window as the rain poured down. In the distance beyond the dark clouds, she could see Sam Mountain at the edge of her village. Thi Liên had always thought Sam was a silly name. The shape of the mountain resembled a gigantic king crab, so people called it Sam, which means “king crab” in Vietnamese.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;“The floodwaters have risen so high that I might as well be living by the sea with the king crabs,” Thi Liên mumbled.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;Heavy rains were a part of life in Vietnam. Each year seasonal winds brought seemingly endless downpours. The rainy season, called the monsoon, usually lasted from May through September. Though the rains were <span class="txt-underline">torrential</span>, they weren’t always destructive. The rain washing down from the hillsides carried silt that was rich in nutrients. The floodwaters made the land along the Mekong River fertile for growing rice.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;Suddenly a gust of wind and rain swept through the doorway as Thi Liên’s father returned from their neighbor’s home. He was drenched and shivering. “News from upriver is not encouraging,” he said, trying not to upset them. “This season’s rains have overflowed the river’s banks. Surging floodwaters are claiming almost everything in their path. Families have had to move to safer locations, and there are reports that some houses have been swept away.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;Thi Liên stared out the window. She tried to focus on the bountiful rice harvest that the floodwaters would bring, but fear rose within her like the rising river.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;Grandfather came over and put his hand on her shoulder. “The floodwaters have visited our village before, but they have never knocked on our door,” he said softly.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;Thi Liên thought about what her grandfather said. Yet he could not deny that this year’s rains were unusually heavy. Days had gone by without even a ray of sunlight.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;Father paced back and forth, shooting nervous glances in Grandfather’s direction. Grandfather remained standing near the window, watching the rain as it continued to fall.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;Later, while several neighbors waded through the flooded streets, her parents made a decision. “It’s time to evacuate,” Father announced. “We can go to the community center. It’s on higher ground, so we should be safe there.”</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;“No!” Grandfather said firmly. “It’s wrong to drag your family out of their home in fear.”</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;“We’re leaving with thoughts of safety, not fear,” Father replied forcefully.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;Thi Liên shuddered. She had never heard her father raise his voice to his own father. Though Father was an adult, arguing with Grandfather was considered disrespectful.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;Father and Grandfather faced each other, neither speaking another word. Their long, uneasy silence seemed as if it would last forever. Suddenly a loud clap of thunder sounded, breaking the silence. Father walked boldly to the door and opened it. Thi Liên, her mother, and her grandfather followed obediently.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;They waded knee-deep through the drowning streets. Holding on to one another, they struggled against the currents. Thi Liên kicked off her sandals, hoping she would have better footing in her bare feet. She had no choice but to watch as her sandals were quickly swept away.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
                  <img width="100%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766021471/oointwnahhsrvyrv01wf.png" alt="T2_05_CT_EN_01">


        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;Finally they reached the crowded community center. It was filled with other families looking for refuge from the rising water. Exhausted from the struggle, Thi Liên lay down on a mat and tried to sleep, but all she could think about was Grandfather’s expression as Father opened the door. Thi Liên turned to face the wall. The rain pounding on the metal roof muffled her sobs.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;Early the next morning Thi Liên was awakened by a gentle touch on her shoulder. Turning, she saw her grandfather. He brushed her long dark hair away from her face. “I’ve been a foolish man,” he said softly. “Because of my pride, I have refused to speak to your father when I should be thankful.”</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp;Thi Liên could not think of any reason that they should be thankful. Their home was probably full of water by now. They were living in cramped conditions with many other families. And the rain was still falling!</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp;“I don’t understand,” she said slowly.</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp;“Here we have shelter from the rain and more than enough food,” Grandfather explained. “Others are living in rescue camps or sleeping in <span class="txt-underline">makeshift</span> shelters quickly built from whatever they can find to protect them from the weather. Some people’s homes have been completely washed away. We don’t know whether our home is still standing, but it doesn’t matter. All that matters is that we are safe and together.”</p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;Thi Liên studied her grandfather’s expression. In his eyes she could see his profound sense of gratitude.</p>
        <p>21&nbsp; &nbsp;“Will you ever speak to Father again?” she asked.</p>
        <p>22&nbsp; &nbsp;“Of course I will,” he assured her. “In fact, I think I’ll go over right now and tell him how foolish I’ve been.”</p>
        <p>23&nbsp; &nbsp;Thi Liên watched as Grandfather walked to the table where Father was seated. After exchanging a few words, Grandfather sat down across from his son.</p>
        <p>24&nbsp; &nbsp;Off in the distance, a ray of sunlight broke through the clouds.</p>

          <strong>International Currency</strong>
        </p>
        <p>If you travel internationally, you most likely will need to exchange your own&nbsp;currency&nbsp;for that of the country you are visiting. The amount of money you’ll get for a given amount of your country’s currency is based on internationally determined&nbsp;exchange rates. Exchange rates can be either fixed or floating. Fixed exchange rates use a standard, such as gold or another precious metal, and each unit of currency corresponds to a fixed quantity of that standard that should (theoretically) exist. For example, in 1968 the U.S. Treasury determined that it would buy and sell one ounce of gold at a cost of $35. Other countries would establish their own cost for the equivalent ounce. A floating exchange rate means that each currency isn’t necessarily backed by a resource.&nbsp;Current international exchange rates are determined by a managed floating exchange rate. A managed floating exchange rate means that each currency’s value is affected by the economic actions of its government or central bank.</p>
        <p>The managed floating exchange rate hasn’t always been used. The&nbsp;gold standard&nbsp;controlled international exchange rates until the 1910s. Another very similar system called the&nbsp;gold-exchange standard&nbsp;became prominent in the 1930s. This system allowed countries to back their currency not in gold but with other currencies on the gold standard, such as U.S. dollars and British pounds. The&nbsp;International Monetary Fund&nbsp;(IMF) was responsible for stabilizing the currency exchange rates until the 1970s, when the U.S. ended its use of fixed exchange rates.</p>
        <p>The dwindling amount of gold resources forced the U.S. to give up any gold-controlled standard, and the international monetary system began to be based on the dollar and other paper currencies. Governments can stabilize their exchange rates by importing a smaller amount of goods and exporting a larger amount. Similarly, they can devalue other currencies to boost the status of their own by selling them to other countries. The gold-standard exchange and the IMF added stability to the world market, but it didn’t come without its own problems. Linking a currency to a finite material would make the markets inflexible and could potentially lead to one country’s being able to economically isolate itself from trade. With a managed floating exchange rate, countries are encouraged to trade.</p>

          <strong>Les Miserable</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <em>By Victor Hugo</em>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; When Fantine saw that she was making her living, she felt joyful for a moment. To live honestly by her own labour, what mercy from heaven! The taste for work had really returned to her. She bought a looking-glass, took pleasure in surveying in it her youth, her beautiful hair, her fine teeth; she forgot many things; she thought only of Cosette and of the possible future, and was almost happy. She hired a little room and furnished on credit on the strength of her future work—a lingering trace of her <strong>improvident</strong> ways. As she was not able to say that she was married she took good care, as we have seen, not to mention her little girl.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At first, as the reader has seen, she paid the Thénardiers promptly. As she only knew how to sign her name, she was obliged to write through a public letter-writer.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She wrote often, and this was noticed. It began to be said in an undertone, in the women’s workroom, that Fantine “wrote letters” and that “she had ways about her.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There is no one for spying on people’s actions like those who are not concerned in them. Why does that gentleman never come except at nightfall? Why does Mr. So-and-So never hang his key on its nail on Tuesday? Why does he always take the narrow streets? Why does Madame always descend from her hackney-coach before reaching her house? Why does she send out to purchase six sheets of note paper, when she has a “whole stationer’s shop full of it?” etc. There exist beings who, for the sake of obtaining the key to these enigmas, which are, moreover, of no consequence whatever to them, spend more money, waste more time, take more trouble, than would be required for ten good actions, and that gratuitously, for their own pleasure, without receiving any other payment for their curiosity than curiosity. They will follow up such and such a man or woman for whole days; they will do sentry duty for hours at a time on the corners of the streets, under alley-way doors at night, in cold and rain; they will bribe errand-porters, they will make the drivers of hackney-coaches and lackeys tipsy, buy a waiting-maid, suborn a porter. Why? For no reason. A pure passion for seeing, knowing, and penetrating into things. A pure itch for talking. And often these secrets once known, these mysteries made public, these enigmas illuminated by the light of day, bring on catastrophes, duels, failures, the ruin of families, and broken lives, to the great joy of those who have “found out everything,” without any interest in the matter, and by pure instinct. A sad thing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Certain persons are malicious solely through a necessity for talking. Their conversation, the chat of the drawing-room, gossip of the anteroom, is like those chimneys which consume wood rapidly; they need a great amount of combustibles; and their combustibles are furnished by their neighbours.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;So Fantine was watched.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, many a one was jealous of her golden hair and of her white teeth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was remarked that in the workroom she often turned aside, in the midst of the rest, to wipe away a tear. These were the moments when she was thinking of her child; perhaps, also, of the man whom she had loved.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Breaking the gloomy bonds of the past is a mournful task.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was observed that she wrote twice a month at least, and that she paid the carriage on the letter. They managed to obtain the address:<em>&nbsp;Monsieur, Monsieur Thénardier, inn-keeper at Montfermeil</em>. The public writer, a good old man who could not fill his stomach with red wine without emptying his pocket of secrets, was made to talk in the wine-shop. In short, it was discovered that Fantine had a child. “She must be a pretty sort of a woman.” An old gossip was found, who made the trip to Montfermeil, talked to the Thénardiers, and said on her return: “For my five and thirty francs I have freed my mind. I have seen the child.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The gossip who did this thing was a gorgon named Madame Victurnien, the guardian and door-keeper of every one’s virtue. Madame Victurnien was fifty-six, and re-enforced the mask of ugliness with the mask of age. A quavering voice, a whimsical mind. This old dame had once been young—astonishing fact! In her youth, in ‘93, she had married a monk who had fled from his cloister in a red cap, and passed from the Bernardines to the Jacobins. She was dry, rough, peevish, sharp, captious, almost venomous; all this in memory of her monk, whose widow she was, and who had ruled over her masterfully and bent her to his will. She was a nettle in which the rustle of the cassock was visible. At the Restoration she had turned bigot, and that with so much energy that the priests had forgiven her her monk. She had a small property, which she <strong>bequeathed</strong> with much ostentation to a religious community. She was in high favor at the episcopal palace of Arras. So this Madame Victurnien went to Montfermeil, and returned with the remark, “I have seen the child.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;All this took time. Fantine had been at the factory for more than a year, when, one morning, the superintendent of the workroom handed her fifty francs from the mayor, told her that she was no longer employed in the shop, and requested her, in the mayor’s name, to leave the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This was the very month when the Thénardiers, after having demanded twelve francs instead of six, had just exacted fifteen francs instead of twelve.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Fantine was overwhelmed. She could not leave the neighborhood; she was in debt for her rent and furniture. Fifty francs was not sufficient to cancel this debt. She stammered a few supplicating words. The superintendent ordered her to leave the shop on the instant. Besides, Fantine was only a moderately good workwoman. Overcome with shame, even more than with despair, she quitted the shop, and returned to her room. So her fault was now known to every one.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She no longer felt strong enough to say a word. She was advised to see the mayor; she did not dare. The mayor had given her fifty francs because he was good, and had dismissed her because he was just. She bowed before the decision.</p>

          <strong>How Radioactive Isotopes are Used in Medicine</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <em>Written by Kara Rogers</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
                  <img width="68%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766019859/wsat4akrncbm7xxo2p6o.png" alt="V_7SA10_RC_33">


        </p>
        <p><span class="txt-underline">Radioactive isotopes</span>, or radioisotopes, are species of chemical elements that are produced through the natural decay of atoms. Exposure to radiation generally is considered harmful to the human body, but radioisotopes are highly valuable in medicine, particularly in the diagnosis and treatment of disease.</p>
        <p><span class="txt-underline">Nuclear medicine</span>&nbsp;uses radioactive isotopes in a variety of ways. One of the more common uses is as a tracer in which a radioisotope, such as technetium-99m, is taken orally or is injected or is inhaled into the body. The radioisotope then circulates through the body or is taken up only by certain tissues. Its distribution can be tracked according to the radiation it gives off. The emitted radiation can be captured by various imaging techniques, such as&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">single photon emission computed tomography</span>&nbsp;(SPECT) or&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">positron emission tomography</span>&nbsp;(PET), depending on the radioisotope used. Through such imaging, physicians are able to examine blood flow to specific organs and assess organ function or bone growth. Radioisotopes typically have short half-lives and typically decay before their emitted radioactivity can cause damage to the patient’s body.</p>
        <p>Therapeutic applications of radioisotopes typically are intended to destroy the targeted cells. This approach forms the basis of&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">radiotherapy</span>, which is commonly used to treat&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">cancer</span>&nbsp;and other conditions involving abnormal tissue growth, such as&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">hyperthyroidism</span>. In radiation therapy for cancer, the patient’s tumour is bombarded with&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">ionizing radiation</span>, typically in the form of beams of subatomic particles, such as protons, neutrons, or alpha or beta particles, which directly disrupt the atomic or molecular structure of the targeted tissue. Ionizing radiation introduces breaks in the double-stranded&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">DNA</span>&nbsp;molecule, causing the cancer cells to die and thereby preventing their replication. While radiotherapy is associated with unpleasant side effects, it generally is effective in slowing cancer progression or, in some cases, even prompting the regression of malignant disease.</p>
        <p>The use of radioisotopes in the fields of nuclear medicine and radiotherapy has advanced significantly since the discovery of artificial radioisotopes in the first decades of the 1900s. Artificial radioisotopes are produced from stable elements that are bombarded with neutrons. Following that discovery, researchers began to investigate potential medical applications of artificial radioisotopes, work that laid the foundation for nuclear medicine. Today diagnostic and therapeutic procedures using radioactive isotopes are routine.</p>
