        <p>“It’s the eighty-ninth kitten,” said Sandy. “Isn’t she a beauty?” She held up their latest acquisition – a fluffy white cat with the slightest tinge of pink or apricot in its fur.</p>
        <p>“Hardly a kitten,” said Miss Berry, looking at the spread and length of the marvelous cat, “but certainly beautiful.”</p>
        <p>Miss Berry had once lived alone. For many years she had lived alone in the house her parents had left her and never thought anything of it. Until she retired. Before that she had clicked the picket gate every morning at half past eight and walked to the post office where she had torn out stamps and listened to people and knitted jumpers, mostly blue, in her lunch hour. At weekends and after tea in the summer she had worked in her huge garden, the largest in the neighbourhood and next to the park. Every year she dug up her flower garden and started again. Sometimes she bought seeds and bulbs for colour, sometimes for smell. White flowers were best for perfume but blue flowers she loved. She planted forget-me-nots, hyacinths – always blue ones – irises and little blue daisies. She always wore blue – powder blue and mid-blue, royal blue and navy blue, ice blue and electric blue. Her house had pretty blue shutters and white frothy curtains that blew out in the slightest breeze for her windows were always open, summer and winter, when she was at home.</p>
        <p>Sandy lived two corners away. She left at half past eight too and usually she tried to catch up with Miss Berry. She called her “The Blue Lady” to herself. One day she tried saying, “Hello,” and the next day she fell into step beside her.</p>
        <p>“We’re studying frogs,” she said. “But I wish it was something nicer. Miss Silverton says everything is nice but I’ve always liked furry things best. Linda likes frogs. She sits next to me. But she might just be saying that. She says she hates the feel of fur, but you couldn’t, could you?”<br>
<br>
Miss Berry didn’t say anything but she smiled so Sandy went on. “Miss Silverton says I should talk plenty when I’m out of school and I might use up all I have to say,” she said. “But it doesn’t seem to work.”</p>
        <p>Miss Berry smiled again and walked briskly to the post office. Sandy had trouble keeping up with her. She walked faster than anyone she knew.</p>
        <p>The first few days Miss Berry didn’t even turn around when she got to the post office. But after a week or so she turned and called, “Goodbye.” One day she even waved. She likes me, thought Sandy.</p>

        <p>Miss Berry had once lived alone. For many years she had lived alone in the house her parents had left her and never thought anything of it. Until she retired. Before that she had clicked the picket gate every morning at half past eight and walked to the post office where she had torn out stamps and listened to people and knitted jumpers, mostly blue, in her lunch hour. At weekends and after tea in the summer she had worked in her huge garden, the largest in the neighbourhood and next to the park. Every year she dug up her flower garden and started again. Sometimes she bought seeds and bulbs for colour, sometimes for smell. White flowers were best for perfume but blue flowers she loved. She planted forget-me-nots, hyacinths – always blue ones – irises and little blue daisies. She always wore blue – powder blue and mid-blue, royal blue and navy blue, ice blue and electric blue.

          <strong>The Ape That Looked Forward</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Adults love to ask children idiotic questions so that we can chuckle when they give us idiotic answers. One particularly idiotic question we like to ask children is this: “What do you want to be when you grow up?” Small children look appropriately puzzled, worried perhaps, that our question implies that they are at some risk of growing down. If they answer at all, they generally come up with things like, “a firetruck,” or “a fairy.” We chuckle because the odds that the child will ever become either of those things is impossible, especially since these are not the sort of things that most children will want to be once they are old enough to ask idiotic questions themselves. But notice that while these are the wrong answers to our questions, they are the right answers to another question, namely, “What do you want to be <em>right now</em>?” Small children cannot understand what they want to be <em>later </em>because they don’t really understand what <em>later </em>means. So, like shrewd politicians, they ignore the question they are asked and answer the question they can. Adults do much better, of course. When a thirty-ish Manhattanite is asked where she thinks she might retire, she mentioned Miami, Phoenix or some other hotbed of social rest. She may love her gritty urban existence right now, but she can imagine that in a few decades she will value bingo and prompt medical attention more than art museums and squeegee men. Unlike the child who can only think about how things are, the adult is able to think about how things will be. At some point between our high chairs and rocking chairs, we learn about the concept of <em>later</em>.</p>

        <p>Adults love to ask children idiotic questions so that we can chuckle when they give us idiotic answers. One particularly idiotic question we like to ask children is this: “What do you want to be when you grow up?” Small children look appropriately puzzled, worried perhaps, that our question implies that they are at some risk of growing down. If they answer at all, they generally come up with things like, “a firetruck,” or “a fairy.” We chuckle because the odds that the child will ever become either of those things is impossible, especially since these are not the sort of things that most children will want to be once they are old enough to ask idiotic questions themselves. But notice that while these are the wrong answers to our questions, they are the right answers to another question, namely, “What do you want to be <em>right now</em>?” Small children cannot understand what they want to be <em>later </em>because they don’t really understand what <em>later </em>means. So, like shrewd politicians, they ignore the question they are asked and answer the question they can. Adults do much better, of course. When a thirty-ish Manhattanite is asked where she thinks she might retire, she mentioned Miami, Phoenix or some other hotbed of social rest. She may love her gritty urban existence right now, but she can imagine that in a few decades she will value bingo and prompt medical attention more than art museums and squeegee men. Unlike the child who can only think about how things are, the adult is able to think about how things will be. At some point between our high chairs and rocking chairs, we learn about the concept of <em>later</em>.</p>
