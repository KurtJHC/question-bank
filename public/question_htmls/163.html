          <strong>Read the following passage and answer question 25 -31.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Did the&nbsp;Vikings&nbsp;discover America? It’s a question that requires some unpacking.&nbsp;To begin with, there’s the problem of the Eurocentric perspective of the word&nbsp;<em>discover</em>, which looks at the encounter with the New World from the vantage point of guys on ships and ignores the fact that indigenous people had long been calling it home. In that sense, America was probably discovered by hunters from&nbsp;Asia, who historians believe made their way to&nbsp;Alaska&nbsp;either on foot from&nbsp;Siberia&nbsp;via a land bridge across the&nbsp;Bering Strait&nbsp;during the last ice age or came by boat and continued southward along the coastline. In either case, these people arrived 13,000–35,000 years ago—so long ago that their descendants are considered the continent’s indigenous peoples,&nbsp;Native Americans.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Rephrasing the question, we can ask instead whether the Vikings were the first non-Native Americans to encounter&nbsp;America. The answer to that question, however, hinges on what we mean by America. If we are referring to America broadly—meaning&nbsp;North&nbsp;and&nbsp;South America—there is a possibility that&nbsp;Polynesians&nbsp;got there first. Genetic analysis of the&nbsp;sweet potato, which is native to America, has led scientists to conclude that Polynesian explorers had an early encounter with South America and took the sweet potato with them to&nbsp;Southeast Asia&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Pacific Islands. Scholars are convinced that this exchange took place before the time of&nbsp;Christopher Columbus, but they do not know whether it preceded the visits to North America by the Vikings.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Asking whether the Vikings were the first Europeans to encounter America sets the stage for the Vikings-versus-Columbus debate, but first the legendary voyage of&nbsp;St. Brendan&nbsp;has to be reckoned with. According to the epic “Voyage of St. Brendan the Abbot” (recorded in Latin prose sometime between the mid-8th and early 10th century as&nbsp;<em>Navigatio Sancti Brendani Abbatis</em>), in the 6th century Brendan, a peripatetic Irish monk, and some of his brethren <strong>sojourned </strong>west across the Atlantic Ocean&nbsp;in a bowl-shaped boat known as a curragh (coracle). It has been argued that Brendan reached North America, and a modern experiment proved that it is possible to make a transatlantic crossing in a curragh, but there is no archaeological evidence of an early Irish visit to North America.</p>
        <p>So it still comes down to Columbus and the Vikings. History tells us that in 1492, while leading a Spanish-sponsored three-ship flotilla in search of a shorter route to Asia, Italian navigator Christopher Columbus happened upon America in the form of Guanahani (probably&nbsp;San Salvador Island, though maybe another&nbsp;Bahamian island&nbsp;or the&nbsp;Turks and Caicos Islands). Another Italian navigator,&nbsp;John Cabot, sailing for England, made his way to&nbsp;Canada about this time, but not until 1497, after Columbus. As a result, Columbus was nearly universally declared the “discoverer” of America.</p>
        <p>Standing in opposition to that claim, however, were the accounts of Viking journeys to a place called&nbsp;Vinland&nbsp;that appeared in a pair of medieval Norse&nbsp;sagas&nbsp;(heroic prose poems). According to the&nbsp;<em>Grænlendinga saga</em>&nbsp;(“Saga of the Greenlanders”), Bjarni Herjólfsson became the first European to sight mainland North America when his&nbsp;Greenland-bound ship was blown westward off course about 985. Further, about 1000,&nbsp;Leif Eriksson, son of&nbsp;Erik the Red, is reported to have led an expedition in search of the land sighted by Bjarni and to have found an icy barren land he called &nbsp;Helluland (“Land of Flat Rocks”) before eventually traveling south and finding Vinland (“Land of Wine”). Later, following a pair of expeditions undertaken by Leif’s brothers,&nbsp;Thorfinn Karlsefni, an Icelandic trader, led another expedition to Vinland, where it stayed for three years. In&nbsp;<em>Eiríks saga rauða</em>&nbsp;(“Erik the Red’s Saga”), Leif is the accidental discoverer of Vinland, and Thorfinn and his wife, Gudrid, are credited with all subsequent explorations.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>These narratives of exploration of a place that sounded like&nbsp;Maine,&nbsp;Rhode Island, or Atlantic Canada were thought to be just stories, like “Voyage of St. Brendan the Abbot,” until 1960, when Helge Ingstad, a Danish explorer, and his wife, archaeologist Anne Stine Ingstad, were led by a local man to a site on the northern tip of&nbsp;Newfoundland island. There, at&nbsp;L’Anse aux Meadows, they discovered the remains of a Viking encampment that they were able to date to the year 1000. These dramatic archaeological discoveries proved not only that the Vikings had indeed explored America some 500 years before Columbus’s arrival but also that they had travelled farther south to areas where grapes grew, to Vinland. The Vikings had indeed visited North America, and if they did not “discover” America in the strict sense of the word, they certainly got there before Columbus did.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Did the&nbsp;Vikings&nbsp;discover America? It’s a question that requires some unpacking.&nbsp;To begin with, there’s the problem of the Eurocentric perspective of the word&nbsp;<em>discover</em>, which looks at the encounter with the New World from the vantage point of guys on ships and ignores the fact that indigenous people had long been calling it home. In that sense, America was probably discovered by hunters from&nbsp;Asia, who historians believe made their way to&nbsp;Alaska&nbsp;either on foot from&nbsp;Siberia&nbsp;via a land bridge across the&nbsp;Bering Strait&nbsp;during the last ice age or came by boat and continued southward along the coastline. In either case, these people arrived 13,000–35,000 years ago—so long ago that their descendants are considered the continent’s indigenous peoples,&nbsp;Native Americans.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Rephrasing the question, we can ask instead whether the Vikings were the first non-Native Americans to encounter&nbsp;America. The answer to that question, however, hinges on what we mean by America. If we are referring to America broadly—meaning&nbsp;North&nbsp;and&nbsp;South America—there is a possibility that&nbsp;Polynesians&nbsp;got there first. Genetic analysis of the&nbsp;sweet potato, which is native to America, has led scientists to conclude that Polynesian explorers had an early encounter with South America and took the sweet potato with them to&nbsp;Southeast Asia&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Pacific Islands. Scholars are convinced that this exchange took place before the time of&nbsp;Christopher Columbus, but they do not know whether it preceded the visits to North America by the Vikings.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Asking whether the Vikings were the first Europeans to encounter America sets the stage for the Vikings-versus-Columbus debate, but first the legendary voyage of&nbsp;St. Brendan&nbsp;has to be reckoned with. According to the epic “Voyage of St. Brendan the Abbot” (recorded in Latin prose sometime between the mid-8th and early 10th century as&nbsp;<em>Navigatio Sancti Brendani Abbatis</em>), in the 6th century Brendan, a peripatetic Irish monk, and some of his brethren <strong>sojourned </strong>west across the Atlantic Ocean&nbsp;in a bowl-shaped boat known as a curragh (coracle).

          <strong>Read the following passage and answer question 25 -31.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Did the&nbsp;Vikings&nbsp;discover America? It’s a question that requires some unpacking.&nbsp;To begin with, there’s the problem of the Eurocentric perspective of the word&nbsp;<em>discover</em>, which looks at the encounter with the New World from the vantage point of guys on ships and ignores the fact that indigenous people had long been calling it home. In that sense, America was probably discovered by hunters from&nbsp;Asia, who historians believe made their way to&nbsp;Alaska&nbsp;either on foot from&nbsp;Siberia&nbsp;via a land bridge across the&nbsp;Bering Strait&nbsp;during the last ice age or came by boat and continued southward along the coastline. In either case, these people arrived 13,000–35,000 years ago—so long ago that their descendants are considered the continent’s indigenous peoples,&nbsp;Native Americans.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Rephrasing the question, we can ask instead whether the Vikings were the first non-Native Americans to encounter&nbsp;America. The answer to that question, however, hinges on what we mean by America. If we are referring to America broadly—meaning&nbsp;North&nbsp;and&nbsp;South America—there is a possibility that&nbsp;Polynesians&nbsp;got there first. Genetic analysis of the&nbsp;sweet potato, which is native to America, has led scientists to conclude that Polynesian explorers had an early encounter with South America and took the sweet potato with them to&nbsp;Southeast Asia&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Pacific Islands. Scholars are convinced that this exchange took place before the time of&nbsp;Christopher Columbus, but they do not know whether it preceded the visits to North America by the Vikings.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Asking whether the Vikings were the first Europeans to encounter America sets the stage for the Vikings-versus-Columbus debate, but first the legendary voyage of&nbsp;St. Brendan&nbsp;has to be reckoned with. According to the epic “Voyage of St. Brendan the Abbot” (recorded in Latin prose sometime between the mid-8th and early 10th century as&nbsp;<em>Navigatio Sancti Brendani Abbatis</em>), in the 6th century Brendan, a peripatetic Irish monk, and some of his brethren <strong>sojourned </strong>west across the Atlantic Ocean&nbsp;in a bowl-shaped boat known as a curragh (coracle). It has been argued that Brendan reached North America, and a modern experiment proved that it is possible to make a transatlantic crossing in a curragh, but there is no archaeological evidence of an early Irish visit to North America.</p>
        <p>So it still comes down to Columbus and the Vikings. History tells us that in 1492, while leading a Spanish-sponsored three-ship flotilla in search of a shorter route to Asia, Italian navigator Christopher Columbus happened upon America in the form of Guanahani (probably&nbsp;San Salvador Island, though maybe another&nbsp;Bahamian island&nbsp;or the&nbsp;Turks and Caicos Islands). Another Italian navigator,&nbsp;John Cabot, sailing for England, made his way to&nbsp;Canada about this time, but not until 1497, after Columbus. As a result, Columbus was nearly universally declared the “discoverer” of America.</p>
        <p>Standing in opposition to that claim, however, were the accounts of Viking journeys to a place called&nbsp;Vinland&nbsp;that appeared in a pair of medieval Norse&nbsp;sagas&nbsp;(heroic prose poems). According to the&nbsp;<em>Grænlendinga saga</em>&nbsp;(“Saga of the Greenlanders”), Bjarni Herjólfsson became the first European to sight mainland North America when his&nbsp;Greenland-bound ship was blown westward off course about 985. Further, about 1000,&nbsp;Leif Eriksson, son of&nbsp;Erik the Red, is reported to have led an expedition in search of the land sighted by Bjarni and to have found an icy barren land he called &nbsp;Helluland (“Land of Flat Rocks”) before eventually traveling south and finding Vinland (“Land of Wine”). Later, following a pair of expeditions undertaken by Leif’s brothers,&nbsp;Thorfinn Karlsefni, an Icelandic trader, led another expedition to Vinland, where it stayed for three years. In&nbsp;<em>Eiríks saga rauða</em>&nbsp;(“Erik the Red’s Saga”), Leif is the accidental discoverer of Vinland, and Thorfinn and his wife, Gudrid, are credited with all subsequent explorations.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>These narratives of exploration of a place that sounded like&nbsp;Maine,&nbsp;Rhode Island, or Atlantic Canada were thought to be just stories, like “Voyage of St. Brendan the Abbot,” until 1960, when Helge Ingstad, a Danish explorer, and his wife, archaeologist Anne Stine Ingstad, were led by a local man to a site on the northern tip of&nbsp;Newfoundland island. There, at&nbsp;L’Anse aux Meadows, they discovered the remains of a Viking encampment that they were able to date to the year 1000. These dramatic archaeological discoveries proved not only that the Vikings had indeed explored America some 500 years before Columbus’s arrival but also that they had travelled farther south to areas where grapes grew, to Vinland. The Vikings had indeed visited North America, and if they did not “discover” America in the strict sense of the word, they certainly got there before Columbus did.</p>

          <strong>Reading the following passage and answer questions 32 – 37.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Not just any radio show could be placed in the Time Capsule. What picture of contemporary 1960 mankind would the men of the future derive from a soap opera? A news analysis? Or top comedy show? Certainly not a flattering one, and so, reasoned the brass in charge of the project, not a true one.</p>
        <p>No, the only answer was to produce a special documentary program, painting on a broad canvas the glories that were the common man's birthright in an enlightened democracy. As July 4th was only a month away, the idea was a natural. The program would be carried simultaneously on four networks, then placed in the Time Capsule so that historians of the future would have something solid on which to base their conclusions.</p>
        <p>A famous poet-radio writer was hired to write the script. Hollywood's greatest young male star donated his services (with much attendant publicity) as narrator. A self-acknowledged genius who directed radio shows for a living condescended to lend his talents to the production. Numerous other actors, musicians, technicians and assistants were hired ... none well-known, but all quite competent.</p>
        <p>July 4th, the big day, arrived. The cast went into rehearsal early in the morning. By the second complete run-through, just before the break for lunch, the show was hanging together nicely. After four hours of polishing in the afternoon, it was ready to go on the air. Everyone's nerves were raw, but the show sounded great.</p>
        <p>Naturally, when a room full of creative people have been rubbing against one another for a full day, a lot of emotions are generated. The listening audience never knew about it, but it took the actors, directors, musicians and technicians several days to get the session out of their systems. During rehearsals, the young Hollywood star developed a consuming lust for one of the minor actresses. One of the minor actors developed a consuming lust for the young Hollywood star. Everyone immediately hated the director, and he, lofty and all-wise, <strong>contemptuously </strong>hated them in return. By eight o'clock that night, show time, the splendid documentary on the splendid American people was not the only thing that was at peak pitch.</p>
        <p>It was the only thing, however, that the radio audience heard. It was magnificent. Future students hearing the tape could not but conclude that here was the Golden Age. Man, at least American man, circa 1960, noble, humble and sincere, was carrying in his bosom the seeds of greatness. Difficulties still existed, of course, but they were not <strong>insurmountable</strong>. A few deluded people seemed to be working against the common good, but the program left no doubt that this would be cleaned up in short order. The millenium was at hand!</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mr. Alfred Thipps was a small, nervous man, whose flaxen hair was beginning to abandon the unequal struggle with destiny. One might say that his only really marked feature was a large bruise over the left eyebrow, which gave him a faintly dissipated air <strong>incongruous </strong>with the rest of his appearance. Almost in the same breath with his first greeting, he made a self-conscious apology for it, murmuring something about having run against the dining-room door in the dark. He was touched almost to tears by Lord Peter’s thoughtfulness and condescension in calling.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I’m sure it’s most kind of your lordship,” he repeated for the dozenth time, rapidly blinking his weak little eyelids. “I appreciate it very deeply, very deeply, indeed, and so would Mother, only she’s so deaf, I don’t like to trouble you with making her understand. It’s been very hard all day,” he added, “with the policemen in the house and all this commotion. It’s what Mother and me have never been used to, always living very retired, and it’s most distressing to a man of regular habits, my lord, and reely, I’m almost thankful Mother doesn’t understand, for I’m sure it would worry her terribly if she was to know about it. She was upset at first, but she’s made up some idea of her own about it now, and I’m sure it’s all for the best.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The old lady who sat knitting by the fire nodded grimly in response to a look from her son.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I always said as you ought to complain about that bath, Alfred,” she said suddenly, in the high, piping voice peculiar to the deaf, “and it’s to be ’oped the landlord’ll see about it now; not but what I think you might have managed without having the police in, but there! You always were one to make a fuss about a little thing, from chicken-pox up.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“There now,” said Mr. Thipps apologetically, “you see how it is. Not but what it’s just as well she’s settled on that, because she understands we’ve locked up the bathroom and don’t try to go in there. But it’s been a terrible shock to me, sir—my lord, I should say, but there! My nerves are all to pieces. Such a thing has never ’appened—happened to me in all my born days. Such a state I was in this morning—I didn’t know if I was on my head or my heels—I reely didn’t, and my heart not being too strong, I hardly knew how to get out of that horrid room and telephone for the police. It’s affected me, sir, it’s affected me, it reely has—I couldn’t touch a bit of breakfast, nor lunch neither, and what with telephoning and putting off clients and interviewing people all morning, I’ve hardly known what to do with myself.”</p>

One might say that his only really marked feature was a large bruise over the left eyebrow, which gave him a faintly dissipated air <strong>incongruous </strong>with the rest of his appearance. Almost in the same breath with his first greeting, he made a self-conscious apology for it, murmuring something about having run against the dining-room door in the dark. He was touched almost to tears by Lord Peter’s thoughtfulness and condescension in calling.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I’m sure it’s most kind of your lordship,” he repeated for the dozenth time, rapidly blinking his weak little eyelids. “I appreciate it very deeply, very deeply, indeed, and so would Mother, only she’s so deaf, I don’t like to trouble you with making her understand. It’s been very hard all day,” he added, “with the policemen in the house and all this commotion. It’s what Mother and me have never been used to, always living very retired, and it’s most distressing to a man of regular habits, my lord, and reely, I’m almost thankful Mother doesn’t understand, for I’m sure it would worry her terribly if she was to know about it. She was upset at first, but she’s made up some idea of her own about it now, and I’m sure it’s all for the best.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The old lady who sat knitting by the fire nodded grimly in response to a look from her son.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I always said as you ought to complain about that bath, Alfred,” she said suddenly, in the high, piping voice peculiar to the deaf, “and it’s to be ’oped the landlord’ll see about it now; not but what I think you might have managed without having the police in, but there! You always were one to make a fuss about a little thing, from chicken-pox up.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“There now,” said Mr. Thipps apologetically, “you see how it is. Not but what it’s just as well she’s settled on that, because she understands we’ve locked up the bathroom and don’t try to go in there. But it’s been a terrible shock to me, sir—my lord, I should say, but there! My nerves are all to pieces. Such a thing has never ’appened—happened to me in all my born days. Such a state I was in this morning—I didn’t know if I was on my head or my heels—I reely didn’t, and my heart not being too strong, I hardly knew how to get out of that horrid room and telephone for the police. It’s affected me, sir, it’s affected me, it reely has—I couldn’t touch a bit of breakfast, nor lunch neither, and what with telephoning and putting off clients and interviewing people all morning, I’ve hardly known what to do with myself.”</p>

Such a state I was in this morning—I didn’t know if I was on my head or my heels—I reely didn’t, and my heart not being too strong, I hardly knew how to get out of that horrid room and telephone for the police. It’s affected me, sir, it’s affected me, it reely has—I couldn’t touch a bit of breakfast, nor lunch neither, and what with telephoning and putting off clients and interviewing people all morning, I’ve hardly known what to do with myself.”</p>

          <strong>Read the following passage and answer questions 43 – 48.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mr. Alfred Thipps was a small, nervous man, whose flaxen hair was beginning to abandon the unequal struggle with destiny. One might say that his only really marked feature was a large bruise over the left eyebrow, which gave him a faintly dissipated air <strong>incongruous </strong>with the rest of his appearance. Almost in the same breath with his first greeting, he made a self-conscious apology for it, murmuring something about having run against the dining-room door in the dark. He was touched almost to tears by Lord Peter’s thoughtfulness and condescension in calling.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I’m sure it’s most kind of your lordship,” he repeated for the dozenth time, rapidly blinking his weak little eyelids. “I appreciate it very deeply, very deeply, indeed, and so would Mother, only she’s so deaf, I don’t like to trouble you with making her understand. It’s been very hard all day,” he added, “with the policemen in the house and all this commotion. It’s what Mother and me have never been used to, always living very retired, and it’s most distressing to a man of regular habits, my lord, and reely, I’m almost thankful Mother doesn’t understand, for I’m sure it would worry her terribly if she was to know about it. She was upset at first, but she’s made up some idea of her own about it now, and I’m sure it’s all for the best.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The old lady who sat knitting by the fire nodded grimly in response to a look from her son.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I always said as you ought to complain about that bath, Alfred,” she said suddenly, in the high, piping voice peculiar to the deaf, “and it’s to be ’oped the landlord’ll see about it now; not but what I think you might have managed without having the police in, but there! You always were one to make a fuss about a little thing, from chicken-pox up.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“There now,” said Mr. Thipps apologetically, “you see how it is. Not but what it’s just as well she’s settled on that, because she understands we’ve locked up the bathroom and don’t try to go in there. But it’s been a terrible shock to me, sir—my lord, I should say, but there! My nerves are all to pieces. Such a thing has never ’appened—happened to me in all my born days. Such a state I was in this morning—I didn’t know if I was on my head or my heels—I reely didn’t, and my heart not being too strong, I hardly knew how to get out of that horrid room and telephone for the police.

          <strong>Read the following passage and answer questions 43 – 48.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mr. Alfred Thipps was a small, nervous man, whose flaxen hair was beginning to abandon the unequal struggle with destiny. One might say that his only really marked feature was a large bruise over the left eyebrow, which gave him a faintly dissipated air <strong>incongruous </strong>with the rest of his appearance. Almost in the same breath with his first greeting, he made a self-conscious apology for it, murmuring something about having run against the dining-room door in the dark. He was touched almost to tears by Lord Peter’s thoughtfulness and condescension in calling.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I’m sure it’s most kind of your lordship,” he repeated for the dozenth time, rapidly blinking his weak little eyelids. “I appreciate it very deeply, very deeply, indeed, and so would Mother, only she’s so deaf, I don’t like to trouble you with making her understand. It’s been very hard all day,” he added, “with the policemen in the house and all this commotion. It’s what Mother and me have never been used to, always living very retired, and it’s most distressing to a man of regular habits, my lord, and reely, I’m almost thankful Mother doesn’t understand, for I’m sure it would worry her terribly if she was to know about it. She was upset at first, but she’s made up some idea of her own about it now, and I’m sure it’s all for the best.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The old lady who sat knitting by the fire nodded grimly in response to a look from her son.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I always said as you ought to complain about that bath, Alfred,” she said suddenly, in the high, piping voice peculiar to the deaf, “and it’s to be ’oped the landlord’ll see about it now; not but what I think you might have managed without having the police in, but there! You always were one to make a fuss about a little thing, from chicken-pox up.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“There now,” said Mr. Thipps apologetically, “you see how it is. Not but what it’s just as well she’s settled on that, because she understands we’ve locked up the bathroom and don’t try to go in there. But it’s been a terrible shock to me, sir—my lord, I should say, but there! My nerves are all to pieces. Such a thing has never ’appened—happened to me in all my born days. Such a state I was in this morning—I didn’t know if I was on my head or my heels—I reely didn’t, and my heart not being too strong, I hardly knew how to get out of that horrid room and telephone for the police. It’s affected me, sir, it’s affected me, it reely has—I couldn’t touch a bit of breakfast, nor lunch neither, and what with telephoning and putting off clients and interviewing people all morning, I’ve hardly known what to do with myself.”</p>

          <strong>Pluto</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <em>by James Trefil</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Pluto is in many ways the strangest of the planets. It is small and has a large moon (called Charon). Its orbit is eccentric, which may cause it to have seasons in the sense that when it is close to the sun, the liquid methane on its surface boils to form a kind of atmospheric haze. When the planet moves farther away from the sun, it starts to snow solid methane.</p>
        <p>Pluto is not dark. Despite its great distance from the sun, the surface of Pluto is probably as bright as a moonlit night on Earth. The reason is all that methane, which is as white as newly fallen snow.</p>
        <p>The discovery of Pluto was more accident than design. The American astronomer Percival Lowell had predicted the existence of a ninth planet (he called it Planet X) based on what he took to be irregularities in the orbit of Neptune. Today astronomers argue that these “irregularities” weren’t real, but the result of instrumental error. Nevertheless, Lowell produced predictions about where Planet X ought to be (although, to be honest, the predictions changed occasionally when he redid the calculations). In any case, in 1930 Clyde Tombaugh, doing a systemic sky survey that would have found the planet no matter where it was, discovered the planet we now call Pluto. By coincidence, its position was pretty close to where Lowell’s last prediction said it should be. Was it just luck? We’ll never know.</p>

          <strong>Read the following passage and answer questions 1-5.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Will you come with us, Susan?" cried several little girls to a schoolmate. "We are going to the woods; do come, too."</p>
        <p>"I should like to go with you very much," replied Susan, with a sigh; "but I can not finish the task grandmother set me to do."</p>
        <p>"How tiresome it must be to stay at home to work on a holiday!" said one of the girls, with a toss of her head. "Susan's grandmother is too strict."</p>
        <p>Susan heard this remark, and, as she bent her head over her task, she wiped away a tear, and thought of the pleasant afternoon the girls would spend gathering wild flowers in the woods.</p>
        <p>Soon she said to herself, "What harm can there be in moving the mark grandmother put in the stocking? The woods must be very beautiful today, and how I should like to be in them!"</p>
        <p>"Grandmother," said she, a few minutes afterwards, "I am ready, now." "What, so soon, Susan?" Her grandmother took the work, and looked at it very closely.</p>
        <p>"True, Susan," said she, laying great stress on each word; "true, I count twenty turns from the mark; and, as you have never deceived me, you may go and amuse yourself as you like the rest of the day."</p>
        <p>Susan's cheeks were scarlet, and she did not say, "Thank you." As she left the cottage, she walked slowly away, not singing as usual.</p>
        <p>"Why, here is Susan!" the girls cried, when she joined their company; "but what is the matter? Why have you left your dear, old grandmother?" they tauntingly added.</p>
        <p>"There is nothing the matter." As Susan repeated these words, she felt that she was trying to deceive herself. She had acted a lie. At the same time she remembered her grandmother's words, "You have never deceived me."</p>
        <p>"Yes, I have deceived her," said she to herself. "If she knew all, she would never trust me again."</p>
        <p>When the little party had reached an open space in the woods, her companions ran about enjoying themselves; but Susan sat on the grass, wishing she were at home confessing her fault.</p>
        <p>After a while Rose cried out, "Let us make a crown of violets, and put it on the head of the best girl here."</p>
        <p>"It will be easy enough to make the crown, but not so easy to decide who is to wear it," said Julia.</p>
        <p>"Why, Susan is to wear it, of course," said Rose: "is she not said to be the best girl in school and the most obedient at home?"</p>
        <p>"Yes, yes; the crown shall be for Susan," cried the other girls, and they began to make the crown. It was soon finished.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;"Now, Susan," said Rose, "put it on in a very dignified way, for you are to be our queen."</p>
        <p>As these words were spoken, the crown was placed on her head. In a moment she snatched it off, and threw it on the ground, saying, "No crown for me; I do not deserve it."</p>
        <p>The girls looked at her with surprise. "I have deceived my grandmother," said she, while tears flowed down her cheeks. "I altered the mark she put in the stocking, that I might join you in the woods."</p>
        <p>"Do you call that wicked?" asked one of the girls. "I am quite sure it is; and I have been miserable all the time I have been here."</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Schizophrenia—any of several severe mental disorders having such symptoms as hallucinations, disorganized thinking, withdrawal from reality, or bizarre behavior—is produced by premature deterioration of the brain. This deterioration is usually a product of genetic predisposition combined with stress, but it can be accelerated by external diseases or parasites. Schizophrenia affects only 1% of the population, although many people are predisposed to it but are never exposed to enough stress to exhibit any symptoms. How could cats possibly play a role in something so complicated?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Well, as it turns out, one of those potentially accelerating parasites can be found in our feline friends. <em>Toxoplasma gondii, T. gondii </em>for short, is a parasite that lives in raw meat and some garden soils. Cats become infected with it through consuming outdoor prey and then can pass it along to humans through their feces and litter boxes. So, does owning a cat make you susceptible to schizophrenia?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That’s just the thing—scientists still aren’t sure. Though some studies have been done, none has been conclusive. The current consensus is that there is a definite correlation between cats and schizophrenia, but it is unlikely that the animals are a causal factor in the development of the disorder. Basically, cats probably don’t actually cause someone to develop schizophrenia. The <em>T.</em> <em>gondii</em> found in some cats can cause cysts that accelerate premature brain deterioration, but such deterioration can happen only in individuals who are predisposed to schizophrenia.</p>

          <strong>Read the following passage and answer questions 36-40.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jacob hated finishing things almost as much as he loved starting them. As a result, he had gotten into a million hobbies and activities, but he never stuck with any of them long enough to get any good.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He begged his mother for months for a guitar so that he could play Black Eyed Peas songs to Angie, a girl he liked, but after he finally got one for Christmas, he found out that guitars don’t play themselves. He took a few lessons, but strumming the strings hurt his fingers and he didn’t like holding the pick, so now the five-hundred dollar guitar lives under his bed.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After reading an ad in the back of one of his comic books, Jacob decided that he wanted a Wonder Sweeper 5000 metal detector, so that he could find buried pirate treasure. So he mowed lawns all summer and didn’t spend his money on ice-cream like his younger brother, Alex. He saved it all in a shoe box in his closet. Then he shoveled driveways all winter, and he didn’t spend his money on candy and chips like his classmates. By the time spring came he had saved $200, and he purchased the Wonder-Sweeper 5000 metal detector. He beeped it around the park for a while, be he soon found out that no pirates had ever set sail in his neighborhood, and if they had they didn’t leave any treasure. Even though he found a key ring, forty-seven cents, and all the bottle caps he could throw, he buried the metal detector in his closest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Given Jacob’s history with hobbies, it was no surprise that Jacob’s father was reluctant to buy him a magician’s kit for his birthday. “Geez, Jacob… You sure you wouldn’t rather I got you more guitar lessons?” He suggested.&nbsp; Jacob was insistent. “Dad, you’ve got to get me the magician’s kit. This time I’ll stick with it for real. I promise! Come on, Dad,” Jacob begged.&nbsp; Jacob’s father sighed and then replied, “Oh, I don’t know, Jacob. Things are awfully tight right now.” But Jacob’s father was reminded of his own youth long ago, when he quit football and started karate practice before hardly getting his equipment dirty. So when Jacob’s birthday came around, Jacob was both surprised and pleased to find the magician’s kit that he had desired so badly with a big bright bow on it.&nbsp;</p>
