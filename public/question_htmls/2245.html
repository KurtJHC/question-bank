        <p><strong>Zlata’s Diary</strong><br><br>
[Zlata’s Diary is a real true- life diary. Zlata Filipovic, an 11 year-old girl kept a diary from 1991 to 1993, writing as if to an imaginary friend, ‘Minny’, describing her life in Sarajevo, the midst of the war in Bosnia.]<br>

Sunday 13 October 1991 [on holiday]<br>
<br>
Dear Mimmy</p>
        <p>It was wonderful in Crnotina. I like our house (it’s really unusual) and the surrounding countryside more and more every time we go. We picked apples, pears, walnuts, we took pictures of a clever little squirrel that stole the walnuts, in the evening we had a barbeque – my speciality is cevapcici [grilled meat balls]. Grandma made apple strudel. I collected different leaves for the herbarium and played with Ati. Autumn has already replaced Summer. Slowly but surely it is painting and colouring nature with its brush. The leaves are turning yellow, red, and they are falling. The days are getting shorter and it’s colder. Autumn is really nice too. Somehow, I don’t notice and don’t feel the beauty of nature when I’m in town the way I do when I’m in Crnotina. In Crnotina it smells good, it caresses me, it calls me into it’s embrace. I had a really nice rest enjoying and feeling the beauty of nature.&nbsp;<br>

Dear Mimmy</p>
        <p>Our windows are broken. All of them, except the one’s in my room.&nbsp; That’s the result of the revolting shell that fell again on Zoka’s jewellery shop across the way from us. I was alone at the time. Mummy and Daddy were down in the yard getting lunch ready and I had gone upstairs to set the table. Suddenly I heard a terrible bang and glass breaking. I was terrified and ran towards the hall.&nbsp; That same moment Mummy and Daddy were at the door. Out of breath, worried, sweating and pale they hugged me, and we ran to the cellar, because the shells usually come one after the other. When I realised what had happened, I began to cry and shake. Everybody tried to calm me down, but I was very upset. I barely managed to pull myself together.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Monday 29 June 1992</p>
        <p>Dear Mimmyy</p>
        <p>BOREDOM!!! SHOOTING!!! SHELLING!!! PEOPLE BEING KILLED!!! DESPAIR!!!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; HUNGER!!!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MISERY!!!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; FEAR!!!</p>
        <p>That’s my life. The life of an innocent eleven-year-old schoolgirl!!! A schoolgirl without a school. Without the fun and excitement of school. A child without games, without friends, without the sun, without birds, without nature, without fruit, without chocolate or sweets, with just a little powdered milk. In short, a child without a childhood. A wartime child. I now realise that I am really living through a war, I am witnessing an ugly disgusting war. I and thousands of other children in this city that is being destroyed, that is crying, weeping, seeking help but getting none. God, will this ever stop, will I ever be a schoolgirl again, will I ever see my childhood again/. I once heard that childhood is the most wonderful time of your life. And it is. I loved it., and now an ugly war is taking it all away from me. Why? I feel sad. I feel like crying. I am crying.<br>

        <p><strong>Zlata’s Diary</strong>&nbsp;(contd)<br><br>
Sunday 5 April 1992<br>
<br>
Dear Mimmy</p>
        <p>I am trying to concentrate so I can do my homework, but I simply can’t. Something s going on in town. You can hear gunfire from the hills. Columns of people are spreading out from Dobrinja. They’re trying to stop something, but they themselves don’t know what. You can simply feel that something is coming, something very bad. On TV I see people in front of the B-H parliament building. The radio keeps playing the same song: ‘Sarajevo my Love’. That’s all very nice, but my stomach is still in knots and I can’t concentrate on my homework anymore. Mimmy, I’m afraid of WAR!!!</p>
        <p>Zlata<br>
<br>
Monday 15 March 1993<br>
<br>
Dear Mimmy</p>
        <p>I’m sick again. My throat hurts, I’m sneezing and coughing. And Spring is around the corner. The second Spring of the war. I know from the calendar, but I can’t see it. I can’t see it because I can’t feel it. All I can see are the poor people still lugging water, and even the poorer casualties – young people without arms and legs. They’re the ones who have had the fortune or perhaps the misfortune to survive.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There are no trees to blossom and no birds, because the war has destroyed them as well. There is no sound of birds twittering in springtime. There aren’t even any pigeons – the symbol of Sarajevo. No noisy children, no games. Even the children no longer seem like children. They’ve had their childhood taken away from them, and without that they can’t be children. It’s as if Sarajevo is dying, disappearing. Life is disappearing. So how can I feel Spring, when Spring is something that awakens life and here there is no life, here everything seems to have died.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I am sad again, Mimmy. But you have to know that I am getting sadder and sadder. I’m sad whenever I think, and I have to think.</p>
        <p>Your Zlata</p>

        <p><strong>Zlata’s Diary</strong>&nbsp;(contd)<br><br>
Sunday 5 April 1992<br>
<br>
Dear Mimmy</p>
        <p>I am trying to concentrate so I can do my homework, but I simply can’t. Something s going on in town. You can hear gunfire from the hills. Columns of people are spreading out from Dobrinja. They’re trying to stop something, but they themselves don’t know what. You can simply feel that something is coming, something very bad. On TV I see people in front of the B-H parliament building. The radio keeps playing the same song: ‘Sarajevo my Love’. That’s all very nice, but my stomach is still in knots and I can’t concentrate on my homework anymore. Mimmy, I’m afraid of WAR!!!</p>
        <p>Zlata<br>
<br>
Monday 15 March 1993<br>
<br>
Dear Mimmy</p>
        <p>I’m sick again. My throat hurts, I’m sneezing and coughing. And Spring is around the corner. The second Spring of the war. I know from the calendar, but I can’t see it. I can’t see it because I can’t feel it. All I can see are the poor people still lugging water, and even the poorer casualties – young people without arms and legs. They’re the ones who have had the fortune or perhaps the misfortune to survive.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There are no trees to blossom and no birds, because the war has destroyed them as well. There is no sound of birds twittering in springtime. There aren’t even any pigeons – the symbol of Sarajevo. No noisy children, no games. Even the children no longer seem like children. They’ve had their childhood taken away from them, and without that they can’t be children. It’s as if Sarajevo is dying, disappearing. Life is disappearing. So how can I feel Spring, when Spring is something that awakens life and here there is no life, here everything seems to have died.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I am sad again, Mimmy. But you have to know that I am getting sadder and sadder. I’m sad whenever I think, and I have to think.</p>
        <p>Your Zlata</p>

        <p><strong>Zlata’s Diary</strong>&nbsp;(contd)<br><br>
Sunday 5 April 1992<br>
<br>
Dear Mimmy</p>
        <p>I am trying to concentrate so I can do my homework, but I simply can’t. Something s going on in town. You can hear gunfire from the hills. Columns of people are spreading out from Dobrinja. They’re trying to stop something, but they themselves don’t know what. You can simply feel that something is coming, something very bad. On TV I see people in front of the B-H parliament building. The radio keeps playing the same song: ‘Sarajevo my Love’. That’s all very nice, but my stomach is still in knots and I can’t concentrate on my homework anymore. Mimmy, I’m afraid of WAR!!!</p>
        <p>Zlata<br>
<br>
Monday 15 March 1993<br>
<br>
Dear Mimmy</p>
        <p>I’m sick again. My throat hurts, I’m sneezing and coughing. And Spring is around the corner. The second Spring of the war. I know from the calendar, but I can’t see it. I can’t see it because I can’t feel it. All I can see are the poor people still lugging water, and even the poorer casualties – young people without arms and legs. They’re the ones who have had the fortune or perhaps the misfortune to survive.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There are no trees to blossom and no birds, because the war has destroyed them as well. There is no sound of birds twittering in springtime. There aren’t even any pigeons – the symbol of Sarajevo. No noisy children, no games. Even the children no longer seem like children. They’ve had their childhood taken away from them, and without that they can’t be children. It’s as if Sarajevo is dying, disappearing. Life is disappearing. So how can I feel Spring, when Spring is something that awakens life and here there is no life, here everything seems to have died.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I am sad again, Mimmy. But you have to know that I am getting sadder and sadder. I’m sad whenever I think, and I have to think.</p>
        <p>Your Zlata</p>
