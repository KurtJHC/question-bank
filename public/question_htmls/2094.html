I’m sure most of you would have heard of Minecraft. It is the highest selling video game ever! It was released a decade ago and is still amongst the most popular games out there, especially for children. Minecraft was created in 2011 by the Swedish company, Mojang. It has millions of players around the world with spin off games, merchandise and an annual convention takes place, for especially dedicated Minecraft fans. Minecraft is unlike most other video games as it does not have an aim or storyline, the player is free to build what they like. The only limitation is that the player’s character has a health bar which needs to be monitored in order for survival. The Minecraft world is made up of various 3D blocks such as grass, tree and water blocks. Players can break and pick up the blocks then position them to build their various structures which can be likened to ‘mining’.&nbsp;<br>

Minecraft is appealing because it is a cross-platform game, which means that players are able to play the game on their computer, console, phone, tablet and also Amazon Fire TV. There are price differences when it comes to purchasing Minecraft and that depends on which platform you wish to play the game on. The base game is practically the same in most versions with some elements not matching exactly, depending on the system. In the past couple of years, Minecraft has invented a multiplayer mode which is also crossplatform. This is great for being able to play with friends and family as it provides more options on how and where to play the game.&nbsp;<br>

In 2017, the first official Minecraft novel was released,&nbsp;Minecraft: The Island.&nbsp;The novel is written by bestselling author, Max Brooks. Brooks has written other successful novels such as&nbsp;The Zombie Survival Guide&nbsp;(2003) and&nbsp;World War Z&nbsp;(2006).&nbsp;Minecraft:&nbsp;The Island&nbsp;is an exciting story about a hero who is stranded on the Minecraft Island. The solo castaway character must find food and build structures as well as keep away from some scary zombies that come out at night! There are also many interesting places to explore on the island like forests and hidden underground tunnels. There are now eight other Minecraft novels. Each novel is written by a different, accomplished author, so the reader will have a unique reading experience with every novel.<br>

If you’re a massive Minecraft fan, then you’ve probably heard about the Minecraft movie that has been delayed several times over a number of years. It was supposed to be released in 2018, then it was said to be March 2022. Now, the studio producing the film, Warner Bros, has delayed it again. There is no new release date as yet. Other Warner Bros films have also been delayed including The Matrix 4, The Flash and Shazam! These films all have a new release date but Minecraft and another film, Black Adam, do not. The Minecraft movie sounds like it has an entertaining plot based around a teenage girl and her friends trying to save their Overworld from the Ender Dragon. Let’s hope for all the Minecraft fans out there that it comes into fruition after all this time patiently waiting.<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
If you’re a massive Minecraft fan, then you’ve probably heard about the Minecraft movie that has been delayed several times over a number of years. It was supposed to be released in 2018, then it was said to be March 2022. Now, the studio producing the film, Warner Bros, has delayed it again. There is no new release date as yet. Other Warner Bros films have also been delayed including The Matrix 4, The Flash and Shazam! These films all have a new release date but Minecraft and another film, Black Adam, do not. The Minecraft movie sounds like it has an entertaining plot based around a teenage girl and her friends trying to save their Overworld from the Ender Dragon. Let’s hope for all the Minecraft fans out there that it comes into fruition after all this time patiently waiting.<br>

I’m sure most of you would have heard of Minecraft. It is the highest selling video game ever! It was released a decade ago and is still amongst the most popular games out there, especially for children. Minecraft was created in 2011 by the Swedish company, Mojang. It has millions of players around the world with spin off games, merchandise and an annual convention takes place, for especially dedicated Minecraft fans. Minecraft is unlike most other video games as it does not have an aim or storyline, the player is free to build what they like. The only limitation is that the player’s character has a health bar which needs to be monitored in order for survival. The Minecraft world is made up of various 3D blocks such as grass, tree and water blocks. Players can break and pick up the blocks then position them to build their various structures which can be likened to ‘mining’.&nbsp;<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Minecraft is appealing because it is a cross-platform game, which means that players are able to play the game on their computer, console, phone, tablet and also Amazon Fire TV. There are price differences when it comes to purchasing Minecraft and that depends on which platform you wish to play the game on. The base game is practically the same in most versions with some elements not matching exactly, depending on the system. In the past couple of years, Minecraft has invented a multiplayer mode which is also crossplatform. This is great for being able to play with friends and family as it provides more options on how and where to play the game.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
In 2017, the first official Minecraft novel was released,&nbsp;Minecraft: The Island.&nbsp;The novel is written by bestselling author, Max Brooks. Brooks has written other successful novels such as&nbsp;The Zombie Survival Guide&nbsp;(2003) and&nbsp;World War Z&nbsp;(2006).&nbsp;Minecraft:&nbsp;The Island&nbsp;is an exciting story about a hero who is stranded on the Minecraft Island. The solo castaway character must find food and build structures as well as keep away from some scary zombies that come out at night! There are also many interesting places to explore on the island like forests and hidden underground tunnels. There are now eight other Minecraft novels. Each novel is written by a different, accomplished author, so the reader will have a unique reading experience with every novel.<br>

It is said to be one of the most efficient natural camouflages on Earth. There are many types of stick insects. There is a giant stick insect, which is native to Australia and it has thorn spikes which help it blend in more. There is another giant stick insect called Phobaeticus kirbyi which lives in Borneo. It is over 53 centimetres when it has its legs stretched out all the way, making it one of longest insects in the world. Luckily, all stick insects cannot hurt people as they are not venomous or aggressive nor are their mouths capable of biting anything other than plants.</div>
