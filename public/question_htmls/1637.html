A tablet PC is a portable computing device with a touch-screen display, and is internet enabled. That means you really need internet access to get the most out of a tablet. Generally smaller than a notebook computer but larger than a smartphone, tablet PCs are designed to be thin and light, and have downloadable apps. Instead of using a keyboard, tablets are operated by touching the screen. Some tablets have a facility where you can attach a physical keyboard if that’s what you prefer. However, you will have to purchase a keyboard separately as they are not supplied with tablets. Tablets are known for their speed. They turn on really quickly and provide almost instant access to the internet and apps. Tablets are excellent for anyone who needs to work within a Microsoft-based office environment. If you need to run Windows programs, then tablets are an ideal compromise between a tablet and a laptop.<br>

Everyone’s heard of the Apple brand, and an iPad is the name for Apple’s line of handheld computers. Apple has its own Operating System called iOS and all iPads run on this system. Tablet, however, is a common name for a variety of devices which almost always&nbsp;function using a touch screen, though different manufacturers provide different specs. iPad is Apple’s version of a tablet. Most tablets use Google’s Android operating system, while the iPad runs on Apple’s iOS. An iPad cannot interact with multiple apps at the same time, whilst tablets are versatile – you can use one app whilst other apps are running in the background. Even though iPads have more features than Android tablets, it doesn’t mean they are the obvious choice as that depends on which features you really need. iPads have a large number of apps whilst the number of compatible apps is quite small for Android tablets.<br>
<br>
{^ <strong>Extract C</strong> ^}<br>
iPads are generally easier to use and run smoother than tablets, although much of the time the difference is barely noticeable. In terms of overall user experience, Apple’s iOS is clearly ahead of Google’s Android OS system for the average user. Apple’s operating system is extremely easy to use, powerful and has an intuitive interface. iPad enables close integration between devices. You can cut and paste between your iPad and Macbook if both are running the latest Operating System. Android tablets are way behind in this area. As a company, Apple only officially supports and allows apps to be installed through its own store. It checks and approves every app before it is released for sale through the Apple store. This eliminates the chance of malware and bugs getting into their devices, so it provides an extra layer of security.<br>

Most Android tablets make it pretty easy for you to add more storage if you need to. Many of these devices come with a microSD card slot so you can really add a lot of memory if need be. The iPad, on the other hand, doesn’t give you any way to expand its storage. What you get when you buy it is what you are stuck with, so bear that in mind when making your purchase. This means if you run out of space on your iPad then you are going to have to delete something in order to make space. It’s easy to buy iPads which have larger storage capacity, but it will cost you. And even those devices still won’t let you add more later should you need it. The iPad is still light years behind any Windows or Android tablet. Of course, you can move icons around, change your wallpaper, and even specify certain apps to use in certain situations, but that’s nothing when compared to Android and Windows. You can choose whatever type of app you want to use for any task with these devices and you can customise all types of fonts, screen images and much more. Basically, if it can be tweaked, then you can do it on Android and Windows. The same can’t be said for the iPad.<br>
