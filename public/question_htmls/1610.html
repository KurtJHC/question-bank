      <div class="col-6">{^<strong>&nbsp;Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Communication with humans often incorporates specific calls or patterns of behaviour that cats have been taught or have found effective. British novelist, Kingsley Amis was convinced that his cat, Sarah Snow, was trying to speak English. Her attempts to communicate led him to write in a poem, “I was impressed to hear her say ‘Hello,’ Not like a person, true; / It might not sound quite right to you, / More of a simple squeak or squawk - / Still, that’s what happens when cats talk.” Sachiko, a seal-point Siamese belonging to the author of this book, had a call sounding like, “oweer,” which everyone said was clearly an attempt to call his name, “Howard.” She used it in different tones to mean either, “Hello, you’re home – I’m upstairs,” “Hello, I’ve just come in,” or, “Where are you? I want you!” – but she never used this sound with anyone else.&nbsp;<br>

If her kittens are endangered, a mother will defend them fiercely, ignoring any risk to herself. During the heavy bombing of World War II, a cat in Portsmouth, England, found an ingenious way to rescue her kittens. The only way out of their home was through an open bedroom window but it was too high to jump from with kittens or to drop them to safety. Furthermore, there was no tree or drain pipe to climb down. There was, however, a telephone cable attached to the wall near the window. One at a time, she took her two kittens gently in her mouth, jumped from the ledge to the cable, and carried them along it, down a telegraph pole and into the garden shed. Whether or not she sensed the impending danger of the forthcoming air raid, or had a more specific premonition, she probably saved their lives, for soon after they reached the shed, the blast from a bomb showered their home with debris and broken glass.<br>

Feral city cats have to be opportunists. They may catch a mouse or rat but mostly they survive by scavenging and on handouts from people who are kind enough to feed them. There are feral cats in the excavated ruins of Ancient Rome and Athens, and in the trafficfree piazzas of Venice, but these city cats mainly frequent any railed-off area – say, around an institutional building, such as a hospital or a public utility, where the high fences may offer them protection from marauding dogs and other enemies. Colonies of city cats can grow to considerable numbers. English cat expert, Roger Tabor studied one such group in a London square. They were fed regularly by a number of volunteers so that Tabor could determine which cats ate most of the food and which were prepared to share their food with others.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Many keepers who commit the ultimate dereliction of duty in the eyes of their cat – going away and leaving someone else in charge – are met with complete indifference on their return, the offended cat simply refusing to speak to the miscreant who went off and abandoned the creature. If you have ever left a cat behind while you went on a trip, you have probably experienced how cats express their displeasure at being deserted. Some manage to maintain a sulky disdain for days before they admit that they are really very pleased to see you again.<br>

Many keepers who commit the ultimate dereliction of duty in the eyes of their cat – going away and leaving someone else in charge – are met with complete indifference on their return, the offended cat simply refusing to speak to the miscreant who went off and abandoned the creature. If you have ever left a cat behind while you went on a trip, you have probably experienced how cats express their displeasure at being deserted. Some manage to maintain a sulky disdain for days before they admit that they are really very pleased to see you again.<br>

      <div class="col-6">{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Communication with humans often incorporates specific calls or patterns of behaviour that cats have been taught or have found effective. British novelist, Kingsley Amis was convinced that his cat, Sarah Snow, was trying to speak English. Her attempts to communicate led him to write in a poem, “I was impressed to hear her say ‘Hello,’ Not like a person, true; / It might not sound quite right to you, / More of a simple squeak or squawk - / Still, that’s what happens when cats talk.” Sachiko, a seal-point Siamese belonging to the author of this book, had a call sounding like, “oweer,” which everyone said was clearly an attempt to call his name, “Howard.” She used it in different tones to mean either, “Hello, you’re home – I’m upstairs,” “Hello, I’ve just come in,” or, “Where are you? I want you!” – but she never used this sound with anyone else.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
If her kittens are endangered, a mother will defend them fiercely, ignoring any risk to herself. During the heavy bombing of World War II, a cat in Portsmouth, England, found an ingenious way to rescue her kittens. The only way out of their home was through an open bedroom window but it was too high to jump from with kittens or to drop them to safety. Furthermore, there was no tree or drain pipe to climb down. There was, however, a telephone cable attached to the wall near the window. One at a time, she took her two kittens gently in her mouth, jumped from the ledge to the cable, and carried them along it, down a telegraph pole and into the garden shed. Whether or not she sensed the impending danger of the forthcoming air raid, or had a more specific premonition, she probably saved their lives, for soon after they reached the shed, the blast from a bomb showered their home with debris and broken glass.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Feral city cats have to be opportunists. They may catch a mouse or rat but mostly they survive by scavenging and on handouts from people who are kind enough to feed them. There are feral cats in the excavated ruins of Ancient Rome and Athens, and in the trafficfree piazzas of Venice, but these city cats mainly frequent any railed-off area – say, around an institutional building, such as a hospital or a public utility, where the high fences may offer them protection from marauding dogs and other enemies. Colonies of city cats can grow to considerable numbers. English cat expert, Roger Tabor studied one such group in a London square. They were fed regularly by a number of volunteers so that Tabor could determine which cats ate most of the food and which were prepared to share their food with others.<br>
