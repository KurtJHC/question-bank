        </p>
        <p>Crowded in a lifeboat, Ruth Becker stared in disbelief as the luxury liner Titanic slipped into the icy Atlantic Ocean. “We could see the port lights go under one by one until there was an awful explosion. And then the ship seemed to break right down the middle and, after a bit, go down. We heard terrible screams and cries from the people who were going down.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Throngs</strong> of people swarmed a ship terminal in Southampton, England, on April 10, 1912. Ruth Becker, 12, was among them, along with her brother, Richard, 1, her sister, Marion, 4, and their mother. They were journeying from India, where Ruth’s father was a missionary, home to the United States. The children’s father planned to join his family later.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Beckers edged through the crowd to board the R.M.S. Titanic, the largest ocean liner afloat. At noon it would depart for New York City on its <strong>maiden</strong> voyage.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            <span class="txt-underline">A FLOATING PALACE</span>
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>“We were just dazzled when we got on this big lovely boat,” wrote Ruth one year later. The ship was 11 stories high and the length of three football fields. Once settled in second-class cabin number eight, deck F, Ruth explored the elegant ship. It seemed like a floating palace.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Titanic&nbsp;steamed out of port and headed across the Atlantic. The weather was clear, the water calm. Passengers settled into a comfortable routine. Between meals, people played cards, read, strolled the decks, and talked. Ruth often took Richard for a spin in a stroller.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On Sunday, April 14, the weather turned cold. All day, radio operators received warnings from other ships about iceberg sightings. At 11:40 p.m. lookouts spotted an iceberg through the faint haze. It was 500 yards dead ahead. An officer ordered the ship to be turned and the engines reversed. Too late. The Titanic&nbsp;shuddered as its starboard, or right side, bumped into the iceberg, opening the hull below the waterline. Water gushed in. The Titanic&nbsp;was doomed!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>NOT ENOUGH LIFEBOATS</strong>
          </span>

        <p>Radio operators telegraphed nearby ships for help. Stewards knocked on cabin doors, alerting sleeping travelers to trouble. “My mother had just gone to bed when she was awakened by the engines stopping,” described Ruth. Their steward told Mrs. Becker to get on deck. “We had to climb five flights of stairs to a room full of women,” Ruth recalled. “They were all weeping – in all states of dress and undress. Everyone was frightened – no one knew what would happen to them. But I was never scared. I was only excited. I never for one minute thought we would die.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Officers were lowering lifeboats. There were enough boats to save only 1,178 of the 2,228 passengers and crew aboard. Women and children were loaded first. The only hope for the others was help from another ship.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On deck, the crew fired distress rockets. Mrs. Becker sent Ruth back to their cabin for blankets. Ruth returned to find officers loading women and children in a nearby lifeboat. “One officer grabbed my sister, another carried my brother into the lifeboat and yelled, ‘All full!’ My mother screamed. They let mother on, but they left me behind.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“My mother yelled at me to take the next lifeboat, and before I knew it, an officer picked me up and dumped me into a boat.” Seconds later, the officers lowered Ruth’s lifeboat, #13. As it neared the sea, spewing water pushed Ruth’s boat beneath the next one, #15, being lowered. People shouted, but #15 kept coming. An instant before the lifeboats collided, a man cut #13’s lines. It swung clear just in time.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Officers frantically loaded the remaining lifeboats. Passengers prayed. The band played sombre hymns. The lights went out as the ship split apart. People screamed and jumped overboard. First the bow went down quietly – then the stern sank.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“There fell upon the ear the most terrible noise that human beings ever listened to – the cries of hundreds of people struggling in the icy cold water, crying for help with a cry we knew could not be answered,” Ruth recalled.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Near Ruth in the lifeboat a German woman sobbed. Her infant had been placed in another lifeboat. The baby was wrapped heavily in blankets. The woman feared that, mistaken for baggage, the blankets and baby would be thrown overboard.</p>

        <p>“We rowed for quite a while. Suddenly, in the early morning, we saw a faint green light. It proved to be the lights of the rescue ship Carpathia, which was sending off rockets. We rowed as fast as we could to it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I was so frozen the Carpathia&nbsp;had to send a swing rope down and hoist me up. A steward gave me brandy and hot coffee. But I could not drink anything, I was so worried about my mother.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Ruth watched for incoming lifeboats. She searched rooms. Hours later Ruth found her mother, as well as Richard and Marion. All were safe. “The little German lady found her baby too. I never saw anybody so happy in my life!”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“The women were hunting for their husbands, and when they could not find them,” described Ruth, “they knew they had gone down with the Titanic. It was an awful sight.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Titanic’s 705 surviving passengers and crew sat or stood wrapped in blankets aboard the Carpathia. No one else from the Titanic&nbsp;was ever found alive. More than 1,500 had perished.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Crowded in a lifeboat, Ruth Becker stared in disbelief as the luxury liner Titanic slipped into the icy Atlantic Ocean. “We could see the port lights go under one by one until there was an awful explosion. And then the ship seemed to break right down the middle and, after a bit, go down. We heard terrible screams and cries from the people who were going down.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Throngs</strong> of people swarmed a ship terminal in Southampton, England, on April 10, 1912. Ruth Becker, 12, was among them, along with her brother, Richard, 1, her sister, Marion, 4, and their mother. They were journeying from India, where Ruth’s father was a missionary, home to the United States. The children’s father planned to join his family later.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Beckers edged through the crowd to board the R.M.S. Titanic, the largest ocean liner afloat. At noon it would depart for New York City on its <strong>maiden</strong> voyage.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            <span class="txt-underline">A FLOATING PALACE</span>
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>“We were just dazzled when we got on this big lovely boat,” wrote Ruth one year later. The ship was 11 stories high and the length of three football fields. Once settled in second-class cabin number eight, deck F, Ruth explored the elegant ship. It seemed like a floating palace.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Titanic&nbsp;steamed out of port and headed across the Atlantic. The weather was clear, the water calm. Passengers settled into a comfortable routine. Between meals, people played cards, read, strolled the decks, and talked. Ruth often took Richard for a spin in a stroller.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On Sunday, April 14, the weather turned cold. All day, radio operators received warnings from other ships about iceberg sightings. At 11:40 p.m. lookouts spotted an iceberg through the faint haze. It was 500 yards dead ahead. An officer ordered the ship to be turned and the engines reversed. Too late. The Titanic&nbsp;shuddered as its starboard, or right side, bumped into the iceberg, opening the hull below the waterline. Water gushed in. The Titanic&nbsp;was doomed!</p>

        <p>Crowded in a lifeboat, Ruth Becker stared in disbelief as the luxury liner Titanic slipped into the icy Atlantic Ocean. “We could see the port lights go under one by one until there was an awful explosion. And then the ship seemed to break right down the middle and, after a bit, go down. We heard terrible screams and cries from the people who were going down.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Throngs</strong> of people swarmed a ship terminal in Southampton, England, on April 10, 1912. Ruth Becker, 12, was among them, along with her brother, Richard, 1, her sister, Marion, 4, and their mother. They were journeying from India, where Ruth’s father was a missionary, home to the United States. The children’s father planned to join his family later.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Beckers edged through the crowd to board the R.M.S. Titanic, the largest ocean liner afloat. At noon it would depart for New York City on its <strong>maiden</strong> voyage.</p>

        </p>
        <p>“We were just dazzled when we got on this big lovely boat,” wrote Ruth one year later. The ship was 11 stories high and the length of three football fields. Once settled in second-class cabin number eight, deck F, Ruth explored the elegant ship. It seemed like a floating palace.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Titanic&nbsp;steamed out of port and headed across the Atlantic. The weather was clear, the water calm. Passengers settled into a comfortable routine. Between meals, people played cards, read, strolled the decks, and talked. Ruth often took Richard for a spin in a stroller.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On Sunday, April 14, the weather turned cold. All day, radio operators received warnings from other ships about iceberg sightings. At 11:40 p.m. lookouts spotted an iceberg through the faint haze. It was 500 yards dead ahead. An officer ordered the ship to be turned and the engines reversed. Too late. The Titanic&nbsp;shuddered as its starboard, or right side, bumped into the iceberg, opening the hull below the waterline. Water gushed in. The Titanic&nbsp;was doomed!</p>

            <strong>NOT ENOUGH LIFEBOATS</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>Radio operators telegraphed nearby ships for help. Stewards knocked on cabin doors, alerting sleeping travelers to trouble. “My mother had just gone to bed when she was awakened by the engines stopping,” described Ruth. Their steward told Mrs. Becker to get on deck. “We had to climb five flights of stairs to a room full of women,” Ruth recalled. “They were all weeping – in all states of dress and undress. Everyone was frightened – no one knew what would happen to them. But I was never scared. I was only excited. I never for one minute thought we would die.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Officers were lowering lifeboats. There were enough boats to save only 1,178 of the 2,228 passengers and crew aboard. Women and children were loaded first. The only hope for the others was help from another ship.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On deck, the crew fired distress rockets. Mrs. Becker sent Ruth back to their cabin for blankets. Ruth returned to find officers loading women and children in a nearby lifeboat. “One officer grabbed my sister, another carried my brother into the lifeboat and yelled, ‘All full!’ My mother screamed. They let mother on, but they left me behind.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“My mother yelled at me to take the next lifeboat, and before I knew it, an officer picked me up and dumped me into a boat.” Seconds later, the officers lowered Ruth’s lifeboat, #13. As it neared the sea, spewing water pushed Ruth’s boat beneath the next one, #15, being lowered. People shouted, but #15 kept coming. An instant before the lifeboats collided, a man cut #13’s lines. It swung clear just in time.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Officers frantically loaded the remaining lifeboats. Passengers prayed. The band played sombre hymns. The lights went out as the ship split apart. People screamed and jumped overboard. First the bow went down quietly – then the stern sank.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“There fell upon the ear the most terrible noise that human beings ever listened to – the cries of hundreds of people struggling in the icy cold water, crying for help with a cry we knew could not be answered,” Ruth recalled.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Near Ruth in the lifeboat a German woman sobbed. Her infant had been placed in another lifeboat. The baby was wrapped heavily in blankets. The woman feared that, mistaken for baggage, the blankets and baby would be thrown overboard.</p>

        <p>Ruth watched for incoming lifeboats. She searched rooms. Hours later Ruth found her mother, as well as Richard and Marion. All were safe. “The little German lady found her baby too. I never saw anybody so happy in my life!”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“The women were hunting for their husbands, and when they could not find them,” described Ruth, “they knew they had gone down with the Titanic. It was an awful sight.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Titanic’s 705 surviving passengers and crew sat or stood wrapped in blankets aboard the Carpathia. No one else from the Titanic&nbsp;was ever found alive. More than 1,500 had perished.</p>

        <p>Crowded in a lifeboat, Ruth Becker stared in disbelief as the luxury liner Titanic slipped into the icy Atlantic Ocean. “We could see the port lights go under one by one until there was an awful explosion. And then the ship seemed to break right down the middle and, after a bit, go down. We heard terrible screams and cries from the people who were going down.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Throngs</strong> of people swarmed a ship terminal in Southampton, England, on April 10, 1912. Ruth Becker, 12, was among them, along with her brother, Richard, 1, her sister, Marion, 4, and their mother. They were journeying from India, where Ruth’s father was a missionary, home to the United States. The children’s father planned to join his family later.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Beckers edged through the crowd to board the R.M.S. Titanic, the largest ocean liner afloat. At noon it would depart for New York City on its <strong>maiden</strong> voyage.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            <span class="txt-underline">A FLOATING PALACE</span>
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>“We were just dazzled when we got on this big lovely boat,” wrote Ruth one year later. The ship was 11 stories high and the length of three football fields. Once settled in second-class cabin number eight, deck F, Ruth explored the elegant ship. It seemed like a floating palace.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Titanic&nbsp;steamed out of port and headed across the Atlantic. The weather was clear, the water calm. Passengers settled into a comfortable routine. Between meals, people played cards, read, strolled the decks, and talked. Ruth often took Richard for a spin in a stroller.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On Sunday, April 14, the weather turned cold. All day, radio operators received warnings from other ships about iceberg sightings. At 11:40 p.m. lookouts spotted an iceberg through the faint haze. It was 500 yards dead ahead. An officer ordered the ship to be turned and the engines reversed. Too late. The Titanic&nbsp;shuddered as its starboard, or right side, bumped into the iceberg, opening the hull below the waterline. Water gushed in. The Titanic&nbsp;was doomed!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>NOT ENOUGH LIFEBOATS</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>Radio operators telegraphed nearby ships for help. Stewards knocked on cabin doors, alerting sleeping travelers to trouble. “My mother had just gone to bed when she was awakened by the engines stopping,” described Ruth. Their steward told Mrs. Becker to get on deck. “We had to climb five flights of stairs to a room full of women,” Ruth recalled. “They were all weeping – in all states of dress and undress. Everyone was frightened – no one knew what would happen to them. But I was never scared. I was only excited. I never for one minute thought we would die.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Officers were lowering lifeboats. There were enough boats to save only 1,178 of the 2,228 passengers and crew aboard. Women and children were loaded first. The only hope for the others was help from another ship.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On deck, the crew fired distress rockets. Mrs. Becker sent Ruth back to their cabin for blankets. Ruth returned to find officers loading women and children in a nearby lifeboat. “One officer grabbed my sister, another carried my brother into the lifeboat and yelled, ‘All full!’ My mother screamed. They let mother on, but they left me behind.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“My mother yelled at me to take the next lifeboat, and before I knew it, an officer picked me up and dumped me into a boat.” Seconds later, the officers lowered Ruth’s lifeboat, #13. As it neared the sea, spewing water pushed Ruth’s boat beneath the next one, #15, being lowered. People shouted, but #15 kept coming. An instant before the lifeboats collided, a man cut #13’s lines. It swung clear just in time.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Officers frantically loaded the remaining lifeboats. Passengers prayed. The band played sombre hymns. The lights went out as the ship split apart. People screamed and jumped overboard. First the bow went down quietly – then the stern sank.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“There fell upon the ear the most terrible noise that human beings ever listened to – the cries of hundreds of people struggling in the icy cold water, crying for help with a cry we knew could not be answered,” Ruth recalled.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Near Ruth in the lifeboat a German woman sobbed. Her infant had been placed in another lifeboat. The baby was wrapped heavily in blankets. The woman feared that, mistaken for baggage, the blankets and baby would be thrown overboard.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>RUTH FINDS HER MOTHER</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>“We rowed for quite a while. Suddenly, in the early morning, we saw a faint green light. It proved to be the lights of the rescue ship Carpathia, which was sending off rockets. We rowed as fast as we could to it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I was so frozen the Carpathia&nbsp;had to send a swing rope down and hoist me up. A steward gave me brandy and hot coffee. But I could not drink anything, I was so worried about my mother.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Ruth watched for incoming lifeboats. She searched rooms. Hours later Ruth found her mother, as well as Richard and Marion. All were safe. “The little German lady found her baby too. I never saw anybody so happy in my life!”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“The women were hunting for their husbands, and when they could not find them,” described Ruth, “they knew they had gone down with the Titanic. It was an awful sight.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Titanic’s 705 surviving passengers and crew sat or stood wrapped in blankets aboard the Carpathia. No one else from the Titanic&nbsp;was ever found alive. More than 1,500 had perished.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Crowded in a lifeboat, Ruth Becker stared in disbelief as the luxury liner Titanic slipped into the icy Atlantic Ocean. “We could see the port lights go under one by one until there was an awful explosion. And then the ship seemed to break right down the middle and, after a bit, go down. We heard terrible screams and cries from the people who were going down.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Throngs</strong> of people swarmed a ship terminal in Southampton, England, on April 10, 1912. Ruth Becker, 12, was among them, along with her brother, Richard, 1, her sister, Marion, 4, and their mother. They were journeying from India, where Ruth’s father was a missionary, home to the United States. The children’s father planned to join his family later.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Beckers edged through the crowd to board the R.M.S. Titanic, the largest ocean liner afloat. At noon it would depart for New York City on its <strong>maiden</strong> voyage.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            <span class="txt-underline">A FLOATING PALACE</span>
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>“We were just dazzled when we got on this big lovely boat,” wrote Ruth one year later. The ship was 11 stories high and the length of three football fields. Once settled in second-class cabin number eight, deck F, Ruth explored the elegant ship. It seemed like a floating palace.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Titanic&nbsp;steamed out of port and headed across the Atlantic. The weather was clear, the water calm. Passengers settled into a comfortable routine. Between meals, people played cards, read, strolled the decks, and talked. Ruth often took Richard for a spin in a stroller.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On Sunday, April 14, the weather turned cold. All day, radio operators received warnings from other ships about iceberg sightings. At 11:40 p.m. lookouts spotted an iceberg through the faint haze. It was 500 yards dead ahead. An officer ordered the ship to be turned and the engines reversed. Too late. The Titanic&nbsp;shuddered as its starboard, or right side, bumped into the iceberg, opening the hull below the waterline. Water gushed in. The Titanic&nbsp;was doomed!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>NOT ENOUGH LIFEBOATS</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>Radio operators telegraphed nearby ships for help. Stewards knocked on cabin doors, alerting sleeping travelers to trouble. “My mother had just gone to bed when she was awakened by the engines stopping,” described Ruth. Their steward told Mrs. Becker to get on deck. “We had to climb five flights of stairs to a room full of women,” Ruth recalled. “They were all weeping – in all states of dress and undress. Everyone was frightened – no one knew what would happen to them. But I was never scared. I was only excited. I never for one minute thought we would die.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Officers were lowering lifeboats. There were enough boats to save only 1,178 of the 2,228 passengers and crew aboard. Women and children were loaded first. The only hope for the others was help from another ship.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On deck, the crew fired distress rockets. Mrs. Becker sent Ruth back to their cabin for blankets. Ruth returned to find officers loading women and children in a nearby lifeboat. “One officer grabbed my sister, another carried my brother into the lifeboat and yelled, ‘All full!’ My mother screamed. They let mother on, but they left me behind.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“My mother yelled at me to take the next lifeboat, and before I knew it, an officer picked me up and dumped me into a boat.” Seconds later, the officers lowered Ruth’s lifeboat, #13. As it neared the sea, spewing water pushed Ruth’s boat beneath the next one, #15, being lowered. People shouted, but #15 kept coming. An instant before the lifeboats collided, a man cut #13’s lines. It swung clear just in time.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Officers frantically loaded the remaining lifeboats. Passengers prayed. The band played sombre hymns. The lights went out as the ship split apart. People screamed and jumped overboard. First the bow went down quietly – then the stern sank.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“There fell upon the ear the most terrible noise that human beings ever listened to – the cries of hundreds of people struggling in the icy cold water, crying for help with a cry we knew could not be answered,” Ruth recalled.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Near Ruth in the lifeboat a German woman sobbed. Her infant had been placed in another lifeboat. The baby was wrapped heavily in blankets. The woman feared that, mistaken for baggage, the blankets and baby would be thrown overboard.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>RUTH FINDS HER MOTHER</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>“We rowed for quite a while. Suddenly, in the early morning, we saw a faint green light. It proved to be the lights of the rescue ship Carpathia, which was sending off rockets. We rowed as fast as we could to it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I was so frozen the Carpathia&nbsp;had to send a swing rope down and hoist me up. A steward gave me brandy and hot coffee. But I could not drink anything, I was so worried about my mother.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Ruth watched for incoming lifeboats. She searched rooms. Hours later Ruth found her mother, as well as Richard and Marion. All were safe. “The little German lady found her baby too. I never saw anybody so happy in my life!”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“The women were hunting for their husbands, and when they could not find them,” described Ruth, “they knew they had gone down with the Titanic. It was an awful sight.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Titanic’s 705 surviving passengers and crew sat or stood wrapped in blankets aboard the Carpathia. No one else from the Titanic&nbsp;was ever found alive. More than 1,500 had perished.</p>

          <strong>Joan of Arts: Aussie Bites</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Clark Margaret</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Joan was good at drawing. She loved drawing everything - animals, flowers, houses, toys. In fact, she could draw any thing that took her fancy. But best of all she liked to draw cartoons.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You have lots of talent,' said Joan's teacher Mr Fritz. He looked at Joan's cartoon of himself with his bald head, his little round glasses and his big, wide grin.</p>
        <p>Joan smiled. She wanted people to like her cartoons. She didn't want to hurt people's feelings because she knew exactly what that felt like. You see, Joan was plump. Not really fat, but well rounded. Unfortunately, that made some of her classmates tease her. The boys called her Fatso and Hippo. Some of the girls, especially in the popular group, called her Miss Piggy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Beth-Anne, Jessica, Ella and Millie were very popular. They laughed a lot. They teased the boys. They were good at sport. Everyone liked them because they were very confident. The sports teacher always chose them to be the team leaders.</p>
        <p>The drama teacher always chose them for the best roles in the school plays. Joan was never chosen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She was shy and preferred to stay in the background.</p>
        <p>There was another problem. Joan wasn't pretty like Beth-Anne who had long blonde hair and big blue eyes. Or Jessica who had dark wavy hair and mysterious hazel eyes. Or Ella who had short black shiny hair and almond-shaped brown eyes. Or Millie with a chestnut ponytail and sparkling green eyes. Joan had a round face with small, deep-set brown eyes hidden behind round, owlish glasses. Her nose was too small, and her mousy brown hair always stuck out in tufts, no matter how much she tried to tame it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Joan liked to sit up the back of the classroom by herself so that she could draw away to her heart's content when she'd finished the work that Mr Fritz had set them. And because she was good at her school work, she finished it quickly, so she had plenty of time to draw.</p>
        <p>Then, one day, things changed.</p>
        <p>For the worse ...</p>

        <p>Joan was good at drawing. She loved drawing everything - animals, flowers, houses, toys. In fact, she could draw any thing that took her fancy. But best of all she liked to draw cartoons.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You have lots of talent,' said Joan's teacher Mr Fritz. He looked at Joan's cartoon of himself with his bald head, his little round glasses and his big, wide grin.</p>
        <p>Joan smiled. She wanted people to like her cartoons. She didn't want to hurt people's feelings because she knew exactly what that felt like. You see, Joan was plump. Not really fat, but well rounded. Unfortunately, that made some of her classmates tease her. The boys called her Fatso and Hippo. Some of the girls, especially in the popular group, called her Miss Piggy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Beth-Anne, Jessica, Ella and Millie were very popular. They laughed a lot. They teased the boys. They were good at sport. Everyone liked them because they were very confident. The sports teacher always chose them to be the team leaders.</p>
        <p>The drama teacher always chose them for the best roles in the school plays. Joan was never chosen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She was shy and preferred to stay in the background.</p>
        <p>There was another problem. Joan wasn't pretty like Beth-Anne who had long blonde hair and big blue eyes. Or Jessica who had dark wavy hair and mysterious hazel eyes. Or Ella who had short black shiny hair and almond-shaped brown eyes. Or Millie with a chestnut ponytail and sparkling green eyes. Joan had a round face with small, deep-set brown eyes hidden behind round, owlish glasses. Her nose was too small, and her mousy brown hair always stuck out in tufts, no matter how much she tried to tame it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Joan liked to sit up the back of the classroom by herself so that she could draw away to her heart's content when she'd finished the work that Mr Fritz had set them. And because she was good at her school work, she finished it quickly, so she had plenty of time to draw.</p>
        <p>Then, one day, things changed.</p>

          <strong>Joan of Arts: Aussie Bites</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Clark Margaret</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Joan was good at drawing. She loved drawing everything - animals, flowers, houses, toys. In fact, she could draw any thing that took her fancy. But best of all she liked to draw cartoons.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You have lots of talent,' said Joan's teacher Mr Fritz. He looked at Joan's cartoon of himself with his bald head, his little round glasses and his big, wide grin.</p>
        <p>Joan smiled. She wanted people to like her cartoons. She didn't want to hurt people's feelings because she knew exactly what that felt like. You see, Joan was plump. Not really fat, but well rounded. Unfortunately, that made some of her classmates tease her. The boys called her Fatso and Hippo. Some of the girls, especially in the popular group, called her Miss Piggy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Beth-Anne, Jessica, Ella and Millie were very popular. They laughed a lot. They teased the boys. They were good at sport. Everyone liked them because they were very confident. The sports teacher always chose them to be the team leaders.</p>
        <p>The drama teacher always chose them for the best roles in the school plays. Joan was never chosen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She was shy and preferred to stay in the background.</p>
        <p>There was another problem. Joan wasn't pretty like Beth-Anne who had long blonde hair and big blue eyes. Or Jessica who had dark wavy hair and mysterious hazel eyes. Or Ella who had short black shiny hair and almond-shaped brown eyes. Or Millie with a chestnut ponytail and sparkling green eyes. Joan had a round face with small, deep-set brown eyes hidden behind round, owlish glasses. Her nose was too small, and her mousy brown hair always stuck out in tufts, no matter how much she tried to tame it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Joan liked to sit up the back of the classroom by herself so that she could draw away to her heart's content when she'd finished the work that Mr Fritz had set them. And because she was good at her school work, she finished it quickly, so she had plenty of time to draw.</p>
        <p>Then, one day, things changed.</p>
        <p>For the worse ...</p>

          <strong>Joan of Arts: Aussie Bites</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Clark Margaret</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Joan was good at drawing. She loved drawing everything - animals, flowers, houses, toys. In fact, she could draw any thing that took her fancy. But best of all she liked to draw cartoons.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'You have lots of talent,' said Joan's teacher Mr Fritz. He looked at Joan's cartoon of himself with his bald head, his little round glasses and his big, wide grin.</p>
        <p>Joan smiled. She wanted people to like her cartoons. She didn't want to hurt people's feelings because she knew exactly what that felt like. You see, Joan was plump. Not really fat, but well rounded. Unfortunately, that made some of her classmates tease her. The boys called her Fatso and Hippo. Some of the girls, especially in the popular group, called her Miss Piggy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Beth-Anne, Jessica, Ella and Millie were very popular. They laughed a lot. They teased the boys. They were good at sport. Everyone liked them because they were very confident. The sports teacher always chose them to be the team leaders.</p>
        <p>The drama teacher always chose them for the best roles in the school plays. Joan was never chosen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She was shy and preferred to stay in the background.</p>
        <p>There was another problem. Joan wasn't pretty like Beth-Anne who had long blonde hair and big blue eyes. Or Jessica who had dark wavy hair and mysterious hazel eyes. Or Ella who had short black shiny hair and almond-shaped brown eyes. Or Millie with a chestnut ponytail and sparkling green eyes. Joan had a round face with small, deep-set brown eyes hidden behind round, owlish glasses. Her nose was too small, and her mousy brown hair always stuck out in tufts, no matter how much she tried to tame it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Joan liked to sit up the back of the classroom by herself so that she could draw away to her heart's content when she'd finished the work that Mr Fritz had set them. And because she was good at her school work, she finished it quickly, so she had plenty of time to draw.</p>
        <p>Then, one day, things changed.</p>
        <p>For the worse ...</p>

          <strong>Jackson Pollack</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>“I want to express my feelings, not illustrate them.” - Jackson Pollack</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>IN the late 1940’s and early 1950’s, the American painter Jackson Pollack was the leading proponent of action painting. He is now considered to be the most influential and important painter of the mid-twentieth century. He broke all past traditions and carved the way for a completely new direction in painting.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Pollock was the first to use drip-painting techniques to create abstract works, often on large, mural sized canvases. He swirled, flung, dripped and pushed paint around his canvases with sticks, knives or whatever he could find. At one stage he rode a bicycle over one of his paintings. At the time, critics labelled him ‘Jack the Dripper’; unaware of the huge influence he was to have on the art world.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>JACKSON POLLOCK: And we have mechanical means of representing objects in nature, such as the camera and the photograph. The modern artist is expressing an inner world, expressing the energy, the motion and other inner forces. The modern artist is working with space and time and expressing his feelings rather than illustrating.</p>
        <p>Jackson Pollock, the Abstract Expressionist painter, changed the face of art in America. A new exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in New York focuses on his work and his influence.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>JEFFREY BROWN: Hans Namuth photographed Pollock in his studio and filmed him in action outside for better light.</p>
        <p>JACKSON POLLOCK: I don't work from drawings or coloured sketches. My painting is direct. I usually paint on the floor. I enjoy working on a large canvas. I feel more at home, more at ease in a large area. Having the canvas on the floor, I feel nearer, more a part of the painting. This way I can walk around it, work from all four sides, and be in the painting.</p>
        <p>KIRK VARNEDOE: You cannot imagine the impact these photographs, as distinct from the paintings, had on artists worldwide when they were first published in the fifties; to see a man making up art like this. To see him standing into his canvas, to see him throwing down paint was so radical that the pictures had a huge impact on the popular image of Pollock.</p>
        <p>JEFFREY BROWN: Like the paintings, with their large scale and bursting energy, the image of Pollock the artist was recognised as distinctly American. In 1949, <em>Life Magazine made him a celebrity – a cultural icon of the post-war years</em>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He died in a car accident in 1956, never having made any substantial profits from his work.</p>

          <strong>Jackson Pollack</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>“I want to express my feelings, not illustrate them.” - Jackson Pollack</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>IN the late 1940’s and early 1950’s, the American painter Jackson Pollack was the leading proponent of action painting. He is now considered to be the most influential and important painter of the mid-twentieth century. He broke all past traditions and carved the way for a completely new direction in painting.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Pollock was the first to use drip-painting techniques to create abstract works, often on large, mural sized canvases. He swirled, flung, dripped and pushed paint around his canvases with sticks, knives or whatever he could find. At one stage he rode a bicycle over one of his paintings. At the time, critics labelled him ‘Jack the Dripper’; unaware of the huge influence he was to have on the art world.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>JACKSON POLLOCK: And we have mechanical means of representing objects in nature, such as the camera and the photograph. The modern artist is expressing an inner world, expressing the energy, the motion and other inner forces. The modern artist is working with space and time and expressing his feelings rather than illustrating.</p>
        <p>Jackson Pollock, the Abstract Expressionist painter, changed the face of art in America. A new exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in New York focuses on his work and his influence.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>JEFFREY BROWN: Hans Namuth photographed Pollock in his studio and filmed him in action outside for better light.</p>
        <p>JACKSON POLLOCK: I don't work from drawings or coloured sketches. My painting is direct. I usually paint on the floor. I enjoy working on a large canvas. I feel more at home, more at ease in a large area. Having the canvas on the floor, I feel nearer, more a part of the painting. This way I can walk around it, work from all four sides, and be in the painting.</p>
        <p>KIRK VARNEDOE: You cannot imagine the impact these photographs, as distinct from the paintings, had on artists worldwide when they were first published in the fifties; to see a man making up art like this. To see him standing into his canvas, to see him throwing down paint was so radical that the pictures had a huge impact on the popular image of Pollock.</p>
        <p>JEFFREY BROWN: Like the paintings, with their large scale and bursting energy, the image of Pollock the artist was recognised as distinctly American. In 1949, <em>Life Magazine made him a celebrity – a cultural icon of the post-war years</em>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He died in a car accident in 1956, never having made any substantial profits from his work.</p>

          <strong>The Tidy Drawer&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>By Mo McAuley&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>One Saturday morning Abby's Mum came upstairs to see Abby in her bedroom. Or tried to. There was so much mess on the floor she could only poke her head around the door. Abby sat in the middle of it all reading a book.</p>
        <p>"What a tip," Mum said. "You need to have a clear up in here."</p>
        <p>"Why?" Abby asked.</p>
        <p>"Why?" Mum repeated. "Because things get broken or lost when they're all willy-nilly like this. Come on, have a tidy up now."</p>
        <p>But I'm very busy," Abby argued, "and it's boring on my own. Can't you help me?"</p>
        <p>"No I can't, I'm busy too. But I'll give you extra pocket money if you do a good job."</p>
        <p>When Mum came back later all the toys and clothes and books had disappeared.</p>
        <p>"I'm impressed," said Mum. "But I'll inspect it properly later."</p>
        <p>"It was easy," said Abby. "Can I have my extra pocket money now?"</p>
        <p>"All right. Get it out of my change purse. It's in the kitchen tidy drawer."</p>
        <p>In the kitchen Abby went over to the dresser and pulled open the tidy drawer. She hunted for the purse.</p>
        <p>"Any luck?" Mum asked.</p>
        <p>Abby shook her head.</p>
        <p>"It must be lurking at the bottom," Mum said. "Let's have a proper look."</p>
        <p>She pulled the drawer out and carried it over to the table. Abby kneeled up on a chair to look inside. There were lots of boring things like staplers and string but there were lots of interesting things as well.</p>
        <p>"What's this?" Abby asked, holding up a plastic bottle full of red liquid. Mum laughed.</p>
        <p>"Fake blood, from a Halloween party years ago. Your Dad and I took you to that, dressed up as a baby vampire. You were really scary."</p>
        <p>"I don't remember that."</p>
        <p>Abby carried on looking through the drawer. She found some vampire teeth, white face paint, plastic witchy nails and hair gel. Mum pulled out a glittery hair band. It had springs with wobbly balls on the top that flashed disco colours. She put it on her head while she carried on looking through the drawer. Abby found some sparkly hair elastics to match the hair band. She made her Mum put lots of little bunches all over her head so she looked really silly.</p>
        <p>"I remember this," Abby said as she pulled out a plastic bag.</p>
        <p>"This is from my pirate party." Inside there was a black, false moustache and some big gold earrings.</p>

        <p>"I'm impressed," said Mum. "But I'll inspect it properly later."</p>
        <p>"It was easy," said Abby. "Can I have my extra pocket money now?"</p>
        <p>"All right. Get it out of my change purse. It's in the kitchen tidy drawer."</p>
        <p>In the kitchen Abby went over to the dresser and pulled open the tidy drawer. She hunted for the purse.</p>
        <p>"Any luck?" Mum asked.</p>
        <p>Abby shook her head.</p>
        <p>"It must be lurking at the bottom," Mum said. "Let's have a proper look."</p>
        <p>She pulled the drawer out and carried it over to the table. Abby kneeled up on a chair to look inside. There were lots of boring things like staplers and string but there were lots of interesting things as well.</p>
        <p>"What's this?" Abby asked, holding up a plastic bottle full of red liquid. Mum laughed.</p>
        <p>"Fake blood, from a Halloween party years ago. Your Dad and I took you to that, dressed up as a baby vampire. You were really scary."</p>
        <p>"I don't remember that."</p>
        <p>Abby carried on looking through the drawer. She found some vampire teeth, white face paint, plastic witchy nails and hair gel. Mum pulled out a glittery hair band. It had springs with wobbly balls on the top that flashed disco colours. She put it on her head while she carried on looking through the drawer. Abby found some sparkly hair elastics to match the hair band. She made her Mum put lots of little bunches all over her head so she looked really silly.</p>

          <strong>The Tidy Drawer&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>By Mo McAuley&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>One Saturday morning Abby's Mum came upstairs to see Abby in her bedroom. Or tried to. There was so much mess on the floor she could only poke her head around the door. Abby sat in the middle of it all reading a book.</p>
        <p>"What a tip," Mum said. "You need to have a clear up in here."</p>
        <p>"Why?" Abby asked.</p>
        <p>"Why?" Mum repeated. "Because things get broken or lost when they're all willy-nilly like this. Come on, have a tidy up now."</p>
        <p>But I'm very busy," Abby argued, "and it's boring on my own. Can't you help me?"</p>
        <p>"No I can't, I'm busy too. But I'll give you extra pocket money if you do a good job."</p>
        <p>When Mum came back later all the toys and clothes and books had disappeared.</p>
        <p>"I'm impressed," said Mum. "But I'll inspect it properly later."</p>
        <p>"It was easy," said Abby. "Can I have my extra pocket money now?"</p>
        <p>"All right. Get it out of my change purse. It's in the kitchen tidy drawer."</p>
        <p>In the kitchen Abby went over to the dresser and pulled open the tidy drawer. She hunted for the purse.</p>
        <p>"Any luck?" Mum asked.</p>
        <p>Abby shook her head.</p>
        <p>"It must be lurking at the bottom," Mum said. "Let's have a proper look."</p>
        <p>She pulled the drawer out and carried it over to the table. Abby kneeled up on a chair to look inside. There were lots of boring things like staplers and string but there were lots of interesting things as well.</p>
        <p>"What's this?" Abby asked, holding up a plastic bottle full of red liquid. Mum laughed.</p>
        <p>"Fake blood, from a Halloween party years ago. Your Dad and I took you to that, dressed up as a baby vampire. You were really scary."</p>
        <p>"I don't remember that."</p>
        <p>Abby carried on looking through the drawer. She found some vampire teeth, white face paint, plastic witchy nails and hair gel. Mum pulled out a glittery hair band. It had springs with wobbly balls on the top that flashed disco colours. She put it on her head while she carried on looking through the drawer. Abby found some sparkly hair elastics to match the hair band. She made her Mum put lots of little bunches all over her head so she looked really silly.</p>
        <p>"I remember this," Abby said as she pulled out a plastic bag.</p>
        <p>"This is from my pirate party." Inside there was a black, false moustache and some big gold earrings.</p>

          <strong>The Tidy Drawer&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>By Mo McAuley&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>One Saturday morning Abby's Mum came upstairs to see Abby in her bedroom. Or tried to. There was so much mess on the floor she could only poke her head around the door. Abby sat in the middle of it all reading a book.</p>
        <p>"What a tip," Mum said. "You need to have a clear up in here."</p>
        <p>"Why?" Abby asked.</p>
        <p>"Why?" Mum repeated. "Because things get broken or lost when they're all willy-nilly like this. Come on, have a tidy up now."</p>
        <p>But I'm very busy," Abby argued, "and it's boring on my own. Can't you help me?"</p>
        <p>"No I can't, I'm busy too. But I'll give you extra pocket money if you do a good job."</p>
        <p>When Mum came back later all the toys and clothes and books had disappeared.</p>
        <p>"I'm impressed," said Mum. "But I'll inspect it properly later."</p>
        <p>"It was easy," said Abby. "Can I have my extra pocket money now?"</p>
        <p>"All right. Get it out of my change purse. It's in the kitchen tidy drawer."</p>
        <p>In the kitchen Abby went over to the dresser and pulled open the tidy drawer. She hunted for the purse.</p>
        <p>"Any luck?" Mum asked.</p>
        <p>Abby shook her head.</p>
        <p>"It must be lurking at the bottom," Mum said. "Let's have a proper look."</p>
        <p>She pulled the drawer out and carried it over to the table. Abby kneeled up on a chair to look inside. There were lots of boring things like staplers and string but there were lots of interesting things as well.</p>
        <p>"What's this?" Abby asked, holding up a plastic bottle full of red liquid. Mum laughed.</p>
        <p>"Fake blood, from a Halloween party years ago. Your Dad and I took you to that, dressed up as a baby vampire. You were really scary."</p>
        <p>"I don't remember that."</p>
        <p>Abby carried on looking through the drawer. She found some vampire teeth, white face paint, plastic witchy nails and hair gel. Mum pulled out a glittery hair band. It had springs with wobbly balls on the top that flashed disco colours. She put it on her head while she carried on looking through the drawer. Abby found some sparkly hair elastics to match the hair band. She made her Mum put lots of little bunches all over her head so she looked really silly.</p>
        <p>"I remember this," Abby said as she pulled out a plastic bag.</p>
        <p>"This is from my pirate party." Inside there was a black, false moustache and some big gold earrings.</p>
