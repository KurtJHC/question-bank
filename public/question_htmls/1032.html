Australia is no stranger to bushfires. However, the 2019-2020 season proved to be unprecedented in many ways. The first major bushfires began before spring, in June and then new out-of-control fires sprung up in September 2019. It worsened significantly in November 2019 with increasing temperatures and a prolonged drought. In mid-January 2020, a wave of heavy rain finally brought relief, nowhere near sufficient to extinguish the fires, but it provided a respite for firefighters. Hotter temperatures, drought and high winds escalated the crisis again in February. All of the fires were extinguished or contained by March 4, 2020 – nine months after they started. The bushfires burned more than 46 million acres. At least 3,500 homes and thousands in New South Wales were burned. Sydney University ecologist, Chris Dickman estimates more than a billion animals – including 800,000 in NSW – perished from the bushfires. His estimate, based on his research, found that in every hectare (2.5 acres) approximately “there are 17.5 mammals, 20.7 birds and 129.5 reptiles.” This is multiplied by the number of acres destroyed to get the total estimate.<br>

Catastrophic fires in the Amazon rainforest made global headlines, but since then NASA has noted there are many more fires in parts of Africa than in Brazil. I’ve studied the ecological impacts of fires in East Africa for more than a decade, along with colleagues from around the world. So, are these fires an Amazon-style disaster? Fire is an essential part of the savannah. The first thing to know is that the impact of a wildfire depends more on where and what it is burning, than on how big it is, or indeed how many fires there are. The vast majority of the African fires currently burning seem to be in grasslands, in exactly&nbsp;the places we expect to see fires at this time of year. These fires are usually lit by cattle farmers as part of their traditional management of the savannahs where their animals graze. Some fires are started to stimulate new growth of nutritious grass for their animals, others are used to control the numbers of parasitic ticks or manage the growth of thorny scrub. Without fires, many savannahs (and the animals they support) wouldn’t exist, and lighting them is a key management activity in many of the iconic protected areas of Africa.<br>

In the first part of the science fiction novel, Fahrenheit 451, the character Guy Montag, a thirty-year-old fireman in the twenty-fourth century (remember that the novel was written in the early 1950s) is introduced. In this dystopian (dreadful and oppressive) setting, houses have been fireproofed, thus making the job of firemen, as they are commonly known, obsolete. However, firemen have been given a new occupation; they are burners of books and the official censors of the state. As a fireman, Guy Montag is responsible for destroying not only the books he finds, but also the homes in which he finds them. Books are not to be read; they are to be destroyed without question. For Montag, "It was a pleasure to burn." Therefore, Montag, along with the other firemen, burn the books to show conformity. Without ideas, everyone conforms, and as a result, everyone should be happy.<br>

When we got back to our home, we packed up everything and moved swiftly to the town’s wharf and parked the car by the water’s edge with a low rock wall. To protect ourselves from hot embers flying through the air, we wrapped ourselves in woollen blankets. Our final escape option was to jump in the water, shielding ourselves behind the rock wall. We waited on the water’s edge all night. The smoke was dense. The next morning, a Mordor - like darkness settled over us. Hours later, it was replaced by red light, the firestorm hitting the outskirts of town. Across the water, we saw 30-meter flames jump from one section of bushland to others. A crowd of us, both locals and tourists, watched in a numbed silence as houses exploded. Many of those who had lost homes and animals were middle-aged sea changers who, just a day before, were enjoying their near-retirement. Now they were watching their hopes disappear. Once Mallacoota’s firestorm had passed, we looked around the town. Many houses were completely flattened but strangely some stayed intact. Our lovely little weatherboard home had also burnt to the ground. Over the coming days, we became accustomed to a war-zone-like atmosphere. Volunteer fire fighting trucks continued to race around town suppressing spot fires. But there was an easy going selflessness between people marooned in Mallacoota. Despite their personal tragedies, local workers and shop owners focused on the needs of others.<br>
