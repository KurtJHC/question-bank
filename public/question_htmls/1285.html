          <strong>Why the Sea is Salty&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Have you ever wondered what you’d do if you were stranded on a deserted island in the ocean? You’d first want to find food, fire, shelter, and water. Water? That’s right, even though you may be surrounded by water, those of you who have been to the beach know that you don’t want to drink sea water. <strong>1 .......... </strong>It is because sea water is salty.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But why is sea water salty and not drinkable? Ocean water is salty because it contains large amounts of dissolved minerals.<strong> 2 .......... </strong>Depending on which part of the world you are splashing around in, about 3.5% of the oceans’ waters are made up of salts. Water near the equator tends to be saltier, while northern waters tend to be fresher, meaning they contain fewer salts. The oceans’ floor contains huge amounts of minerals that are eroded and stirred up by the oceans’ natural motion. As the movement of the water and waves erodes the ocean floor, minerals are dissolved into the water and the amount of salt increases. <strong>3 ..........&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Oceans also get some of their saltiness from runoff water that pours into oceans from streams, rivers and lakes. If you’re wondering how that is possible, since these bodies of water contain fresh water, you may be surprised to learn that all lakes, rivers and streams contain some dissolved salts. The concentration of salts dissolved in these bodies of water, however, is much less than that of the oceans.<strong> 4 .......... </strong>Salts cannot build up in most lakes, because they have outlets, such as rivers and streams. These outlets allow water to flow toward the oceans, carrying away minerals and salts.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Dead Sea, on the other hand, is an example of a body of water with no outlet. The minerals that flow into the Dead Sea cannot escape, because there is no outlet to wash them away into the ocean. Since the minerals cannot escape, the Dead Sea contains some of the most saline (that means salty!) water on Earth.<strong> 5 .......... </strong>This is nearly ten times more than the&nbsp;salt concentration in the oceans. The saline water of the Dead Sea is deadly to most living creatures, so you won’t find any fish or sea creatures living there. Only a few types of bacteria and algae can survive the harsh Dead Sea waters. That’s why they call it the Dead Sea!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>While you certainly wouldn’t want to drink the water, a dip in the Dead Sea is a unique experience. Due to its high salt concentration, the density of the water is much greater than fresh water. This makes a swimmer’s body much more buoyant. A dip in the Dead Sea is a bit like dropping a cork into a bowl of water. The dense water makes it easy to float without even trying. In fact, the water makes swimmers so buoyant that it’s hard to dive or swim under the surface.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>How much salt does water have to contain before it tastes salty like the ocean? Do your own experiment at home to find out! First, make a guess as to how much salt you’ll need to add to a regular glass of water before it will taste salty. Once you’ve made a guess, pour a regular glass of water and take a drink. Take a few if you’re thirsty! <strong>6 ...........</strong> Now start adding salt. Start with a few shakes of the salt shaker. Stir the water and then give it a taste. Can you taste the salt? If not, continue to add salt slowly, testing after each additional dose. When the water tastes salty to you, you can stop. How much salt did you add? Was it more or less than you thought it would take?</p>

          <strong>Why the Sea is Salty&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Have you ever wondered what you’d do if you were stranded on a deserted island in the ocean? You’d first want to find food, fire, shelter, and water. Water? That’s right, even though you may be surrounded by water, those of you who have been to the beach know that you don’t want to drink sea water. <strong>1 .......... </strong>It is because sea water is salty.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But why is sea water salty and not drinkable? Ocean water is salty because it contains large amounts of dissolved minerals.<strong> 2 .......... </strong>Depending on which part of the world you are splashing around in, about 3.5% of the oceans’ waters are made up of salts. Water near the equator tends to be saltier, while northern waters tend to be fresher, meaning they contain fewer salts. The oceans’ floor contains huge amounts of minerals that are eroded and stirred up by the oceans’ natural motion. As the movement of the water and waves erodes the ocean floor, minerals are dissolved into the water and the amount of salt increases. <strong>3 ..........&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Oceans also get some of their saltiness from runoff water that pours into oceans from streams, rivers and lakes. If you’re wondering how that is possible, since these bodies of water contain fresh water, you may be surprised to learn that all lakes, rivers and streams contain some dissolved salts. The concentration of salts dissolved in these bodies of water, however, is much less than that of the oceans.<strong> 4 .......... </strong>Salts cannot build up in most lakes, because they have outlets, such as rivers and streams. These outlets allow water to flow toward the oceans, carrying away minerals and salts.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Dead Sea, on the other hand, is an example of a body of water with no outlet. The minerals that flow into the Dead Sea cannot escape, because there is no outlet to wash them away into the ocean. Since the minerals cannot escape, the Dead Sea contains some of the most saline (that means salty!) water on Earth.<strong> 5 .......... </strong>This is nearly ten times more than the&nbsp;salt concentration in the oceans. The saline water of the Dead Sea is deadly to most living creatures, so you won’t find any fish or sea creatures living there. Only a few types of bacteria and algae can survive the harsh Dead Sea waters. That’s why they call it the Dead Sea!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>While you certainly wouldn’t want to drink the water, a dip in the Dead Sea is a unique experience. Due to its high salt concentration, the density of the water is much greater than fresh water. This makes a swimmer’s body much more buoyant. A dip in the Dead Sea is a bit like dropping a cork into a bowl of water. The dense water makes it easy to float without even trying. In fact, the water makes swimmers so buoyant that it’s hard to dive or swim under the surface.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>How much salt does water have to contain before it tastes salty like the ocean? Do your own experiment at home to find out! First, make a guess as to how much salt you’ll need to add to a regular glass of water before it will taste salty. Once you’ve made a guess, pour a regular glass of water and take a drink. Take a few if you’re thirsty! <strong>6 ...........</strong> Now start adding salt. Start with a few shakes of the salt shaker. Stir the water and then give it a taste. Can you taste the salt? If not, continue to add salt slowly, testing after each additional dose. When the water tastes salty to you, you can stop. How much salt did you add? Was it more or less than you thought it would take?</p>

          <strong>Why the Sea is Salty&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Have you ever wondered what you’d do if you were stranded on a deserted island in the ocean? You’d first want to find food, fire, shelter, and water. Water? That’s right, even though you may be surrounded by water, those of you who have been to the beach know that you don’t want to drink sea water. <strong>1 .......... </strong>It is because sea water is salty.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But why is sea water salty and not drinkable? Ocean water is salty because it contains large amounts of dissolved minerals.<strong> 2 .......... </strong>Depending on which part of the world you are splashing around in, about 3.5% of the oceans’ waters are made up of salts. Water near the equator tends to be saltier, while northern waters tend to be fresher, meaning they contain fewer salts. The oceans’ floor contains huge amounts of minerals that are eroded and stirred up by the oceans’ natural motion. As the movement of the water and waves erodes the ocean floor, minerals are dissolved into the water and the amount of salt increases. <strong>3 ..........&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Oceans also get some of their saltiness from runoff water that pours into oceans from streams, rivers and lakes. If you’re wondering how that is possible, since these bodies of water contain fresh water, you may be surprised to learn that all lakes, rivers and streams contain some dissolved salts. The concentration of salts dissolved in these bodies of water, however, is much less than that of the oceans.<strong> 4 .......... </strong>Salts cannot build up in most lakes, because they have outlets, such as rivers and streams. These outlets allow water to flow toward the oceans, carrying away minerals and salts.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Dead Sea, on the other hand, is an example of a body of water with no outlet. The minerals that flow into the Dead Sea cannot escape, because there is no outlet to wash them away into the ocean. Since the minerals cannot escape, the Dead Sea contains some of the most saline (that means salty!) water on Earth.<strong> 5 .......... </strong>This is nearly ten times more than the&nbsp;salt concentration in the oceans. The saline water of the Dead Sea is deadly to most living creatures, so you won’t find any fish or sea creatures living there. Only a few types of bacteria and algae can survive the harsh Dead Sea waters. That’s why they call it the Dead Sea!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>While you certainly wouldn’t want to drink the water, a dip in the Dead Sea is a unique experience. Due to its high salt concentration, the density of the water is much greater than fresh water. This makes a swimmer’s body much more buoyant. A dip in the Dead Sea is a bit like dropping a cork into a bowl of water. The dense water makes it easy to float without even trying. In fact, the water makes swimmers so buoyant that it’s hard to dive or swim under the surface.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>How much salt does water have to contain before it tastes salty like the ocean? Do your own experiment at home to find out! First, make a guess as to how much salt you’ll need to add to a regular glass of water before it will taste salty. Once you’ve made a guess, pour a regular glass of water and take a drink. Take a few if you’re thirsty! <strong>6 ...........</strong> Now start adding salt. Start with a few shakes of the salt shaker. Stir the water and then give it a taste. Can you taste the salt? If not, continue to add salt slowly, testing after each additional dose. When the water tastes salty to you, you can stop. How much salt did you add? Was it more or less than you thought it would take?</p>

          <strong>Why the Sea is Salty&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Have you ever wondered what you’d do if you were stranded on a deserted island in the ocean? You’d first want to find food, fire, shelter, and water. Water? That’s right, even though you may be surrounded by water, those of you who have been to the beach know that you don’t want to drink sea water. <strong>1 .......... </strong>It is because sea water is salty.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But why is sea water salty and not drinkable? Ocean water is salty because it contains large amounts of dissolved minerals.<strong> 2 .......... </strong>Depending on which part of the world you are splashing around in, about 3.5% of the oceans’ waters are made up of salts. Water near the equator tends to be saltier, while northern waters tend to be fresher, meaning they contain fewer salts. The oceans’ floor contains huge amounts of minerals that are eroded and stirred up by the oceans’ natural motion. As the movement of the water and waves erodes the ocean floor, minerals are dissolved into the water and the amount of salt increases. <strong>3 ..........&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Oceans also get some of their saltiness from runoff water that pours into oceans from streams, rivers and lakes. If you’re wondering how that is possible, since these bodies of water contain fresh water, you may be surprised to learn that all lakes, rivers and streams contain some dissolved salts. The concentration of salts dissolved in these bodies of water, however, is much less than that of the oceans.<strong> 4 .......... </strong>Salts cannot build up in most lakes, because they have outlets, such as rivers and streams. These outlets allow water to flow toward the oceans, carrying away minerals and salts.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Dead Sea, on the other hand, is an example of a body of water with no outlet. The minerals that flow into the Dead Sea cannot escape, because there is no outlet to wash them away into the ocean. Since the minerals cannot escape, the Dead Sea contains some of the most saline (that means salty!) water on Earth.<strong> 5 .......... </strong>This is nearly ten times more than the&nbsp;salt concentration in the oceans. The saline water of the Dead Sea is deadly to most living creatures, so you won’t find any fish or sea creatures living there. Only a few types of bacteria and algae can survive the harsh Dead Sea waters. That’s why they call it the Dead Sea!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>While you certainly wouldn’t want to drink the water, a dip in the Dead Sea is a unique experience. Due to its high salt concentration, the density of the water is much greater than fresh water. This makes a swimmer’s body much more buoyant. A dip in the Dead Sea is a bit like dropping a cork into a bowl of water. The dense water makes it easy to float without even trying. In fact, the water makes swimmers so buoyant that it’s hard to dive or swim under the surface.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>How much salt does water have to contain before it tastes salty like the ocean? Do your own experiment at home to find out! First, make a guess as to how much salt you’ll need to add to a regular glass of water before it will taste salty. Once you’ve made a guess, pour a regular glass of water and take a drink. Take a few if you’re thirsty! <strong>6 ...........</strong> Now start adding salt. Start with a few shakes of the salt shaker. Stir the water and then give it a taste. Can you taste the salt? If not, continue to add salt slowly, testing after each additional dose. When the water tastes salty to you, you can stop. How much salt did you add? Was it more or less than you thought it would take?</p>

          <strong>Why the Sea is Salty&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Have you ever wondered what you’d do if you were stranded on a deserted island in the ocean? You’d first want to find food, fire, shelter, and water. Water? That’s right, even though you may be surrounded by water, those of you who have been to the beach know that you don’t want to drink sea water. <strong>1 .......... </strong>It is because sea water is salty.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But why is sea water salty and not drinkable? Ocean water is salty because it contains large amounts of dissolved minerals.<strong> 2 .......... </strong>Depending on which part of the world you are splashing around in, about 3.5% of the oceans’ waters are made up of salts. Water near the equator tends to be saltier, while northern waters tend to be fresher, meaning they contain fewer salts. The oceans’ floor contains huge amounts of minerals that are eroded and stirred up by the oceans’ natural motion. As the movement of the water and waves erodes the ocean floor, minerals are dissolved into the water and the amount of salt increases. <strong>3 ..........&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Oceans also get some of their saltiness from runoff water that pours into oceans from streams, rivers and lakes. If you’re wondering how that is possible, since these bodies of water contain fresh water, you may be surprised to learn that all lakes, rivers and streams contain some dissolved salts. The concentration of salts dissolved in these bodies of water, however, is much less than that of the oceans.<strong> 4 .......... </strong>Salts cannot build up in most lakes, because they have outlets, such as rivers and streams. These outlets allow water to flow toward the oceans, carrying away minerals and salts.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Dead Sea, on the other hand, is an example of a body of water with no outlet. The minerals that flow into the Dead Sea cannot escape, because there is no outlet to wash them away into the ocean. Since the minerals cannot escape, the Dead Sea contains some of the most saline (that means salty!) water on Earth.<strong> 5 .......... </strong>This is nearly ten times more than the&nbsp;salt concentration in the oceans. The saline water of the Dead Sea is deadly to most living creatures, so you won’t find any fish or sea creatures living there. Only a few types of bacteria and algae can survive the harsh Dead Sea waters. That’s why they call it the Dead Sea!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>While you certainly wouldn’t want to drink the water, a dip in the Dead Sea is a unique experience. Due to its high salt concentration, the density of the water is much greater than fresh water. This makes a swimmer’s body much more buoyant. A dip in the Dead Sea is a bit like dropping a cork into a bowl of water. The dense water makes it easy to float without even trying. In fact, the water makes swimmers so buoyant that it’s hard to dive or swim under the surface.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>How much salt does water have to contain before it tastes salty like the ocean? Do your own experiment at home to find out! First, make a guess as to how much salt you’ll need to add to a regular glass of water before it will taste salty. Once you’ve made a guess, pour a regular glass of water and take a drink. Take a few if you’re thirsty! <strong>6 ...........</strong> Now start adding salt. Start with a few shakes of the salt shaker. Stir the water and then give it a taste. Can you taste the salt? If not, continue to add salt slowly, testing after each additional dose. When the water tastes salty to you, you can stop. How much salt did you add? Was it more or less than you thought it would take?</p>

          <strong>Why the Sea is Salty&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Have you ever wondered what you’d do if you were stranded on a deserted island in the ocean? You’d first want to find food, fire, shelter, and water. Water? That’s right, even though you may be surrounded by water, those of you who have been to the beach know that you don’t want to drink sea water. <strong>1 .......... </strong>It is because sea water is salty.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But why is sea water salty and not drinkable? Ocean water is salty because it contains large amounts of dissolved minerals.<strong> 2 .......... </strong>Depending on which part of the world you are splashing around in, about 3.5% of the oceans’ waters are made up of salts. Water near the equator tends to be saltier, while northern waters tend to be fresher, meaning they contain fewer salts. The oceans’ floor contains huge amounts of minerals that are eroded and stirred up by the oceans’ natural motion. As the movement of the water and waves erodes the ocean floor, minerals are dissolved into the water and the amount of salt increases. <strong>3 ..........&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Oceans also get some of their saltiness from runoff water that pours into oceans from streams, rivers and lakes. If you’re wondering how that is possible, since these bodies of water contain fresh water, you may be surprised to learn that all lakes, rivers and streams contain some dissolved salts. The concentration of salts dissolved in these bodies of water, however, is much less than that of the oceans.<strong> 4 .......... </strong>Salts cannot build up in most lakes, because they have outlets, such as rivers and streams. These outlets allow water to flow toward the oceans, carrying away minerals and salts.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Dead Sea, on the other hand, is an example of a body of water with no outlet. The minerals that flow into the Dead Sea cannot escape, because there is no outlet to wash them away into the ocean. Since the minerals cannot escape, the Dead Sea contains some of the most saline (that means salty!) water on Earth.<strong> 5 .......... </strong>This is nearly ten times more than the&nbsp;salt concentration in the oceans. The saline water of the Dead Sea is deadly to most living creatures, so you won’t find any fish or sea creatures living there. Only a few types of bacteria and algae can survive the harsh Dead Sea waters. That’s why they call it the Dead Sea!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>While you certainly wouldn’t want to drink the water, a dip in the Dead Sea is a unique experience. Due to its high salt concentration, the density of the water is much greater than fresh water. This makes a swimmer’s body much more buoyant. A dip in the Dead Sea is a bit like dropping a cork into a bowl of water. The dense water makes it easy to float without even trying. In fact, the water makes swimmers so buoyant that it’s hard to dive or swim under the surface.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>How much salt does water have to contain before it tastes salty like the ocean? Do your own experiment at home to find out! First, make a guess as to how much salt you’ll need to add to a regular glass of water before it will taste salty. Once you’ve made a guess, pour a regular glass of water and take a drink. Take a few if you’re thirsty! <strong>6 ...........</strong> Now start adding salt. Start with a few shakes of the salt shaker. Stir the water and then give it a taste. Can you taste the salt? If not, continue to add salt slowly, testing after each additional dose. When the water tastes salty to you, you can stop. How much salt did you add? Was it more or less than you thought it would take?</p>

          <strong>The Call of the Wild</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by Jack London</em>
        </p>
        <p>Buck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley. Judge Miller’s place, it was called. It stood back from the road, half hidden among the trees, through which glimpses could be caught of the wide cool verandah that ran around its four sides. The house was approached by gravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns and under the interlacing trees of tall poplars. At the rear things were on even a more spacious scale than at the front. There were great stables, where a dozen grooms and boys held forth, rows of vine-covered servants’ cottages an endless and orderly array of outhouses, long grape plantations, green pastures, orchards, and berry patches. Then there was the pumping plant for the artesian well and the big cement tank, where Judge Miller’s boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot afternoon.</p>
        <p>And over this great domain Buck ruled. Here he was born, and here he had lived the four years of his life. It was true, there were other dogs. There could not but be other dogs on so vast a place, but they did not count. They came and went, resided in the many kennels, or lived obscurely in the recesses of the house after the fashion of Toots, the Japanese pug, or Ysabel, the Mexican hairless, — strange creatures that rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground. On the other hand, there were the fox terriers, a score of them at least, who yelped fearful threats at Toots and Ysabel looking out of the windows at them and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with brooms and mops.</p>
        <p>But Buck was neither house-dog nor kennel-dog. The whole realm was his. He plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the Judge’s sons; he escorted Mollie and Alice, the Judge’s daughters, on long twilight or early morning rambles; on wintry nights he lay at the Judge’s feet before the roaring library fire; he carried the Judge’s grandsons on his back, or rolled them in the grass, and guarded their footsteps through wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable yard, and even beyond, where the paddocks were, and the berry patches. Among the terriers he stalked imperiously, and Toots and Ysabel he utterly ignored, for he was king, — king over all creeping, crawling, flying things of Judge Miller’s place, humans included.</p>
        <p>His father, Elmo, a huge St. Bernard, had been the Judge’s inseparable companion, and Buck attempted to follow in the way of his father. He was not so large, — he weighed only one hundred and forty pounds, — for his mother, Shep, had been a Scotch shepherd dog. Nevertheless, one hundred and forty pounds, to which was added the dignity that comes of good living and universal respect, enabled him to carry himself in right royal fashion. During the four years since his puppyhood he had lived the life of an aristocrat; he had a fine pride in himself, was even a trifle egotistical, as country gentlemen sometimes become because of their insular situation. But he had saved himself by not becoming a&nbsp;mere pampered house-dog. Hunting and kindred outdoor delights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles; and to him, the love of water had been a tonic and a health preserver.</p>

They came and went, resided in the many kennels, or lived obscurely in the recesses of the house after the fashion of Toots, the Japanese pug, or Ysabel, the Mexican hairless, — strange creatures that rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground. On the other hand, there were the fox terriers, a score of them at least, who yelped fearful threats at Toots and Ysabel looking out of the windows at them and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with brooms and mops.</p>
        <p>But Buck was neither house-dog nor kennel-dog. The whole realm was his. He plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the Judge’s sons; he escorted Mollie and Alice, the Judge’s daughters, on long twilight or early morning rambles; on wintry nights he lay at the Judge’s feet before the roaring library fire; he carried the Judge’s grandsons on his back, or rolled them in the grass, and guarded their footsteps through wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable yard, and even beyond, where the paddocks were, and the berry patches. Among the terriers he stalked imperiously, and Toots and Ysabel he utterly ignored, for he was king, — king over all creeping, crawling, flying things of Judge Miller’s place, humans included.</p>
        <p>His father, Elmo, a huge St. Bernard, had been the Judge’s inseparable companion, and Buck attempted to follow in the way of his father. He was not so large, — he weighed only one hundred and forty pounds, — for his mother, Shep, had been a Scotch shepherd dog. Nevertheless, one hundred and forty pounds, to which was added the dignity that comes of good living and universal respect, enabled him to carry himself in right royal fashion. During the four years since his puppyhood he had lived the life of an aristocrat; he had a fine pride in himself, was even a trifle egotistical, as country gentlemen sometimes become because of their insular situation. But he had saved himself by not becoming a&nbsp;mere pampered house-dog. Hunting and kindred outdoor delights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles; and to him, the love of water had been a tonic and a health preserver.</p>

          <strong>The Call of the Wild</strong>

        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by Jack London</em>
        </p>
        <p>Buck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley. Judge Miller’s place, it was called. It stood back from the road, half hidden among the trees, through which glimpses could be caught of the wide cool verandah that ran around its four sides. The house was approached by gravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns and under the interlacing trees of tall poplars. At the rear things were on even a more spacious scale than at the front. There were great stables, where a dozen grooms and boys held forth, rows of vine-covered servants’ cottages an endless and orderly array of outhouses, long grape plantations, green pastures, orchards, and berry patches. Then there was the pumping plant for the artesian well and the big cement tank, where Judge Miller’s boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot afternoon.</p>
        <p>And over this great domain Buck ruled. Here he was born, and here he had lived the four years of his life. It was true, there were other dogs. There could not but be other dogs on so vast a place, but they did not count. They came and went, resided in the many kennels, or lived obscurely in the recesses of the house after the fashion of Toots, the Japanese pug, or Ysabel, the Mexican hairless, — strange creatures that rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground. On the other hand, there were the fox terriers, a score of them at least, who yelped fearful threats at Toots and Ysabel looking out of the windows at them and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with brooms and mops.</p>
        <p>But Buck was neither house-dog nor kennel-dog. The whole realm was his. He plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the Judge’s sons; he escorted Mollie and Alice, the Judge’s daughters, on long twilight or early morning rambles; on wintry nights he lay at the Judge’s feet before the roaring library fire; he carried the Judge’s grandsons on his back, or rolled them in the grass, and guarded their footsteps through wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable yard, and even beyond, where the paddocks were, and the berry patches. Among the terriers he stalked imperiously, and Toots and Ysabel he utterly ignored, for he was king, — king over all creeping, crawling, flying things of Judge Miller’s place, humans included.</p>
        <p>His father, Elmo, a huge St. Bernard, had been the Judge’s inseparable companion, and Buck attempted to follow in the way of his father. He was not so large, — he weighed only one hundred and forty pounds, — for his mother, Shep, had been a Scotch shepherd dog. Nevertheless, one hundred and forty pounds, to which was added the dignity that comes of good living and universal respect, enabled him to carry himself in right royal fashion. During the four years since his puppyhood he had lived the life of an aristocrat; he had a fine pride in himself, was even a trifle egotistical, as country gentlemen sometimes become because of their insular situation. But he had saved himself by not becoming a&nbsp;mere pampered house-dog. Hunting and kindred outdoor delights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles; and to him, the love of water had been a tonic and a health preserver.</p>

          <strong>The Call of the Wild</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by Jack London</em>
        </p>
        <p>Buck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley. Judge Miller’s place, it was called. It stood back from the road, half hidden among the trees, through which glimpses could be caught of the wide cool verandah that ran around its four sides. The house was approached by gravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns and under the interlacing trees of tall poplars. At the rear things were on even a more spacious scale than at the front. There were great stables, where a dozen grooms and boys held forth, rows of vine-covered servants’ cottages an endless and orderly array of outhouses, long grape plantations, green pastures, orchards, and berry patches. Then there was the pumping plant for the artesian well and the big cement tank, where Judge Miller’s boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot afternoon.</p>
        <p>And over this great domain Buck ruled. Here he was born, and here he had lived the four years of his life. It was true, there were other dogs. There could not but be other dogs on so vast a place, but they did not count. They came and went, resided in the many kennels, or lived obscurely in the recesses of the house after the fashion of Toots, the Japanese pug, or Ysabel, the Mexican hairless, — strange creatures that rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground. On the other hand, there were the fox terriers, a score of them at least, who yelped fearful threats at Toots and Ysabel looking out of the windows at them and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with brooms and mops.</p>
        <p>But Buck was neither house-dog nor kennel-dog. The whole realm was his. He plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the Judge’s sons; he escorted Mollie and Alice, the Judge’s daughters, on long twilight or early morning rambles; on wintry nights he lay at the Judge’s feet before the roaring library fire; he carried the Judge’s grandsons on his back, or rolled them in the grass, and guarded their footsteps through wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable yard, and even beyond, where the paddocks were, and the berry patches. Among the terriers he stalked imperiously, and Toots and Ysabel he utterly ignored, for he was king, — king over all creeping, crawling, flying things of Judge Miller’s place, humans included.</p>
        <p>His father, Elmo, a huge St. Bernard, had been the Judge’s inseparable companion, and Buck attempted to follow in the way of his father. He was not so large, — he weighed only one hundred and forty pounds, — for his mother, Shep, had been a Scotch shepherd dog. Nevertheless, one hundred and forty pounds, to which was added the dignity that comes of good living and universal respect, enabled him to carry himself in right royal fashion. During the four years since his puppyhood he had lived the life of an aristocrat; he had a fine pride in himself, was even a trifle egotistical, as country gentlemen sometimes become because of their insular situation. But he had saved himself by not becoming a&nbsp;mere pampered house-dog. Hunting and kindred outdoor delights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles; and to him, the love of water had been a tonic and a health preserver.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Buck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley. Judge Miller’s place, it was called. It stood back from the road, half hidden among the trees, through which glimpses could be caught of the wide cool verandah that ran around its four sides. The house was approached by gravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns and under the interlacing trees of tall poplars. At the rear things were on even a more spacious scale than at the front. There were great stables, where a dozen grooms and boys held forth, rows of vine-covered servants’ cottages an endless and orderly array of outhouses, long grape plantations, green pastures, orchards, and berry patches. Then there was the pumping plant for the artesian well and the big cement tank, where Judge Miller’s boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot afternoon.</p>
        <p>And over this great domain Buck ruled. Here he was born, and here he had lived the four years of his life. It was true, there were other dogs. There could not but be other dogs on so vast a place, but they did not count. They came and went, resided in the many kennels, or lived obscurely in the recesses of the house after the fashion of Toots, the Japanese pug, or Ysabel, the Mexican hairless, — strange creatures that rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground. On the other hand, there were the fox terriers, a score of them at least, who yelped fearful threats at Toots and Ysabel looking out of the windows at them and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with brooms and mops.</p>
        <p>But Buck was neither house-dog nor kennel-dog. The whole realm was his. He plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the Judge’s sons; he escorted Mollie and Alice, the Judge’s daughters, on long twilight or early morning rambles; on wintry nights he lay at the Judge’s feet before the roaring library fire; he carried the Judge’s grandsons on his back, or rolled them in the grass, and guarded their footsteps through wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable yard, and even beyond, where the paddocks were, and the berry patches. Among the terriers he stalked imperiously, and Toots and Ysabel he utterly ignored, for he was king, — king over all creeping, crawling, flying things of Judge Miller’s place, humans included.</p>
        <p>His father, Elmo, a huge St. Bernard, had been the Judge’s inseparable companion, and Buck attempted to follow in the way of his father. He was not so large, — he weighed only one hundred and forty pounds, — for his mother, Shep, had been a Scotch shepherd dog. Nevertheless, one hundred and forty pounds, to which was added the dignity that comes of good living and universal respect, enabled him to carry himself in right royal fashion. During the four years since his puppyhood he had lived the life of an aristocrat; he had a fine pride in himself, was even a trifle egotistical, as country gentlemen sometimes become because of their insular situation. But he had saved himself by not becoming a&nbsp;mere pampered house-dog. Hunting and kindred outdoor delights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles; and to him, the love of water had been a tonic and a health preserver.</p>

Then there was the pumping plant for the artesian well and the big cement tank, where Judge Miller’s boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot afternoon.</p>

On the other hand, there were the fox terriers, a score of them at least, who yelped fearful threats at Toots and Ysabel looking out of the windows at them and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with brooms and mops.</p>

        <p><em>Read the poem below by Bettina Van Vaerenbergh then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>SNOW DAY</strong><br><br>
Snow is falling, as quiet as a mouse;<br>
On people and on dogs and on our house.<br>
A fluffy blanket now covers&nbsp;the&nbsp;street -&nbsp;<br>
The cars are white, and that is neat.</p>
        <p>Quickly I dress and run a comb through my hair.<br>
No time to lose, there’s&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline"><strong>magic</strong></span>&nbsp;in the air.&nbsp;<br>
School’s off, so I’ve got all day -<br>
To go on adventures, to roam and to play.</p>
        <p>Mama is in the kitchen, baking pancakes -<br>
But I’m not hungry, I want to catch snowflakes.<br>
And just when I have so much to do;<br>
She’s got scrambled eggs and bacon too.</p>
        <p><span class="txt-underline"><strong>With a sigh I sit down</strong></span>, and empty my plate.<br>
To venture outside I can hardly wait.<br>
The garden looks pristine, and oh so inviting;<br>
My very own wonderland, how exciting!</p>
        <p>Mama has a pair of furry snow boots for me;<br>
To make my footsteps extra crunchy.<br>
The moment has come, I step through the door -<br>
I’m going where no man has gone before.</p>
        <p>I’m an astronaut, my space rocket has just landed.<br>
It ran out of fuel and now I’m stranded.<br>
How will I survive in this alien, white place?<br>
There’re so many dangers I bravely must face.</p>
        <p>The temperatures here are far below zero -<br>
If I make it out alive, I’ll be a superhero!<br>
All my courage I gather, and set out to explore;<br>
Until I’m so cold I can’t go on anymore.</p>
        <p>It’s slowly getting dark, and the wind is howling.<br>
My nose has frostbite, my stomach is growling.<br>
Then mama calls, on Earth it’s time for dinner -<br>
And I hurry back to&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline"><strong>base camp</strong></span>, feeling like a winner.</p>

        <p><em>Read the poem below by Bettina Van Vaerenbergh then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>SNOW DAY</strong><br><br>
Snow is falling, as quiet as a mouse;<br>
On people and on dogs and on our house.<br>
A fluffy blanket now covers&nbsp;the&nbsp;street -&nbsp;<br>
The cars are white, and that is neat.</p>
        <p>Quickly I dress and run a comb through my hair.<br>
No time to lose, there’s&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline"><strong>magic</strong></span>&nbsp;in the air.&nbsp;<br>
School’s off, so I’ve got all day -<br>
To go on adventures, to roam and to play.</p>
        <p>Mama is in the kitchen, baking pancakes -<br>
But I’m not hungry, I want to catch snowflakes.<br>
And just when I have so much to do;<br>
She’s got scrambled eggs and bacon too.</p>
        <p><span class="txt-underline"><strong>With a sigh I sit down</strong></span>, and empty my plate.<br>
To venture outside I can hardly wait.<br>
The garden looks pristine, and oh so inviting;<br>
My very own wonderland, how exciting!</p>
        <p>Mama has a pair of furry snow boots for me;<br>
To make my footsteps extra crunchy.<br>
The moment has come, I step through the door -<br>
I’m going where no man has gone before.</p>
        <p>I’m an astronaut, my space rocket has just landed.<br>
It ran out of fuel and now I’m stranded.<br>
How will I survive in this alien, white place?<br>
There’re so many dangers I bravely must face.</p>
        <p>The temperatures here are far below zero -<br>
If I make it out alive, I’ll be a superhero!<br>
All my courage I gather, and set out to explore;<br>
Until I’m so cold I can’t go on anymore.</p>
        <p>It’s slowly getting dark, and the wind is howling.<br>
My nose has frostbite, my stomach is growling.<br>
Then mama calls, on Earth it’s time for dinner -<br>
And I hurry back to&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline"><strong>base camp</strong></span>, feeling like a winner.</p>
