          <strong>Lucy and the Chickens</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Lucy’s family had lots of animals. They had cows, horses, and pigs. They also had a dog, a cat, and a bird. Lucy’s favorite animals were the chickens. She enjoyed collecting eggs from the henhouse. But she wasn’t allowed to gather the eggs by herself.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“The hook that keeps the henhouse door closed is too high,” Dad explained. “You’re not tall enough yet to reach the hook and then fasten it again. If you don’t shut the door tightly, the chickens could get out. They might become supper for a coyote or some other wild animal.” Lucy’s eyes widened. She promised never to open the henhouse door by herself.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning Dad went to town to get a part to fix the tractor. Mom was talking on the phone to Grandma. All by herself Lucy swept the front porch. She put water in the dog’s bowl. By noon the bright sun was shining overhead. Lucy felt thirsty after doing her chores outside.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lucy went inside the house. She heard her mother still talking to Grandma. Lucy got a cool drink of water. Then she went back outside and admired the flower garden. “I’d better water the flowers,” Lucy said to herself. “They’re probably thirsty.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After watering the flowers, Lucy glanced toward the henhouse. “I should give the chickens some water. They’re probably thirsty, too.”</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lucy filled a big bucket with water. She could barely lift it. She tried dragging the bucket, but the water sloshed out. So she went to get her wagon. Hauling the water in the wagon was easier than carrying it by hand.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At last Lucy stood at the henhouse door. The hook was high. Even when she stretched on her tiptoes, she couldn’t reach it. She looked around and saw a stick on the ground. Using the stick, she&nbsp;pushed and poked at the hook. Soon the hook was free. Slowly the door swung open. Twenty chickens stared at her.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lucy considered what her father had said. She remembered her father’s warning that a coyote might harm the chickens. However, she did not want the chickens to be thirsty, either.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Look what I brought you,” she said. She went to get the<br>
bucket of water. Carefully she lifted the heavy bucket and set it on the ground. When she turned back around, the chickens were rushing through the open door.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“No!” Lucy cried, waving her arms. “Get back in there! Shoo!”</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But it was too late. Lucy started chasing the chickens around the yard. They rant his way and that. They scurried here and there. They flew and flapped. They fluttered and hopped. The more Lucy chased them, the more they scattered. They went behind trees and haystacks. They went under the tractor and wagon. The chickens didn't seem to understand that Lucy was trying to save them.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;By the time Dad got home, Lucy had given up. She was sitting in front of the henhouse crying in despair. Dad noticed the open&nbsp;door. He saw the bucket full of water. It didn’t take him long to guess what was wrong.</p>
        <p>13 “Let’s get those chickens back in the henhouse,” he said firmly. He went to get some chicken feed in a bucket. “Here, chick, chick, chick,” he called. He spread the feed on the ground near the henhouse. Soon all the chickens came to eat the feed. One by one, Lucy and Dad caught the chickens. When all the chickens were back in the henhouse, Dad hooked the door. Now the chickens were safe from coyotes.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lucy and Dad walked back to the house. “Your intention was good, and I know that you meant well,” Dad said. “Giving the chickens some water was a fine thought. But it would have been better not to open the door by yourself.” He stopped and looked at Lucy. “It’s a lot easier to keep chickens in than to catch them once they get out. Do you know what I mean?”</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lucy nodded. She knew exactly what he meant. She also knew that this was a lesson she would never forget.</p>

She looked around and saw a stick on the ground. Using the stick, she&nbsp;pushed and poked at the hook. Soon the hook was free. Slowly the door swung open. Twenty chickens stared at her.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lucy considered what her father had said. She remembered her father’s warning that a coyote might harm the chickens. However, she did not want the chickens to be thirsty, either.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Look what I brought you,” she said. She went to get the<br>
bucket of water. Carefully she lifted the heavy bucket and set it on the ground. When she turned back around, the chickens were rushing through the open door.</p>

        </p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“No!” Lucy cried, waving her arms. “Get back in there! Shoo!”</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But it was too late. Lucy started chasing the chickens around the yard. They rant his way and that. They scurried here and there. They flew and flapped. They fluttered and hopped. The more Lucy chased them, the more they scattered. They went behind trees and haystacks. They went under the tractor and wagon. The chickens didn't seem to understand that Lucy was trying to save them.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;By the time Dad got home, Lucy had given up. She was sitting in front of the henhouse crying in despair. Dad noticed the open&nbsp;door. He saw the bucket full of water. It didn’t take him long to guess what was wrong.</p>
        <p>13 “Let’s get those chickens back in the henhouse,” he said firmly. He went to get some chicken feed in a bucket. “Here, chick, chick, chick,” he called. He spread the feed on the ground near the henhouse. Soon all the chickens came to eat the feed. One by one, Lucy and Dad caught the chickens. When all the chickens were back in the henhouse, Dad hooked the door. Now the chickens were safe from coyotes.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lucy and Dad walked back to the house. “Your intention was good, and I know that you meant well,” Dad said. “Giving the chickens some water was a fine thought. But it would have been better not to open the door by yourself.” He stopped and looked at Lucy. “It’s a lot easier to keep chickens in than to catch them once they get out. Do you know what I mean?”</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lucy nodded. She knew exactly what he meant. She also knew that this was a lesson she would never forget.</p>

          <strong>Lucy and the Chickens</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Lucy’s family had lots of animals. They had cows, horses, and pigs. They also had a dog, a cat, and a bird. Lucy’s favorite animals were the chickens. She enjoyed collecting eggs from the henhouse. But she wasn’t allowed to gather the eggs by herself.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“The hook that keeps the henhouse door closed is too high,” Dad explained. “You’re not tall enough yet to reach the hook and then fasten it again. If you don’t shut the door tightly, the chickens could get out. They might become supper for a coyote or some other wild animal.” Lucy’s eyes widened. She promised never to open the henhouse door by herself.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning Dad went to town to get a part to fix the tractor. Mom was talking on the phone to Grandma. All by herself Lucy swept the front porch. She put water in the dog’s bowl. By noon the bright sun was shining overhead. Lucy felt thirsty after doing her chores outside.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lucy went inside the house. She heard her mother still talking to Grandma. Lucy got a cool drink of water. Then she went back outside and admired the flower garden. “I’d better water the flowers,” Lucy said to herself. “They’re probably thirsty.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After watering the flowers, Lucy glanced toward the henhouse. “I should give the chickens some water. They’re probably thirsty, too.”</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lucy filled a big bucket with water. She could barely lift it. She tried dragging the bucket, but the water sloshed out. So she went to get her wagon. Hauling the water in the wagon was easier than carrying it by hand.</p>

        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;By the time Dad got home, Lucy had given up. She was sitting in front of the henhouse crying in despair. Dad noticed the open&nbsp;door. He saw the bucket full of water. It didn’t take him long to guess what was wrong.</p>
        <p>13 “Let’s get those chickens back in the henhouse,” he said firmly. He went to get some chicken feed in a bucket. “Here, chick, chick, chick,” he called. He spread the feed on the ground near the henhouse. Soon all the chickens came to eat the feed. One by one, Lucy and Dad caught the chickens. When all the chickens were back in the henhouse, Dad hooked the door. Now the chickens were safe from coyotes.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lucy and Dad walked back to the house. “Your intention was good, and I know that you meant well,” Dad said. “Giving the chickens some water was a fine thought. But it would have been better not to open the door by yourself.” He stopped and looked at Lucy. “It’s a lot easier to keep chickens in than to catch them once they get out. Do you know what I mean?”</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lucy nodded. She knew exactly what he meant. She also knew that this was a lesson she would never forget.</p>

        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Dan Shaw lives in Maine. He has slowly been losing his eyesight for years. He now has a guide animal to help him. The guide animal leads him through stores and onto buses. Shaw’s guide animal is called Cuddles. Most guide animals are dogs, but Cuddles is not. Cuddles is actually a miniature horse. She is as small as an average-size dog. She is fully grown and just 22 inches tall. These horses are barely big enough for a small child to ride. Cuddles gives Shaw the help he needs and also gives him love and comfort.</p>

        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At first Shaw had planned to get a guide dog. After he found out about the tiny guide horses, however, he decided he would like&nbsp;to have one of them instead. Cuddles soon came to live with him. Shaw is sure that people stare at them as he and Cuddles walk down the street, but he doesn’t care. Cuddles is an important part of his life.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Cuddles leads Shaw wherever he wants to go. She wears tiny sneakers on her hooves. The sneakers keep her from slipping on slick floors in buildings. They also protect her hooves from sharp things.</p>

        </p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Shaw first heard about guide horses on a television show. He found out about two horse lovers named Don and Janet Burleson. They train tiny horses to lead blind people.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. and Mrs. Burleson got the idea for guide horses during a trip to New York City. While riding in a carriage pulled by large horses, they saw how calm the horses were in the noisy city traffic. The horses stayed quiet and calm even when everything around them was noisy and <span class="txt-underline">chaotic</span>. The horses also knew where to go without much direction from the driver. The horses seemed to be natural guide animals.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Burlesons thought about their tiny pet horse Twinkie. She was friendly, smart, and gentle. They wondered whether Twinkie could be trained to help a blind person, just like a guide dog is trained. When the Burlesons returned home, they began to train their tiny pet horse. Twinkie learned very well, so they decided to train other little horses.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Burlesons start training these special horses when they are six months old. The training takes about a year. Each horse has a lot to learn in that time. It learns to lead a blind person safely. It learns to ride in a car and on a bus. It learns to climb stairs and ride in elevators. These are not places where a horse usually goes. It takes time and practice for the horse to get used to being inside buildings.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Burlesons started the Guide Horse Foundation. This group matches a person in need of a guide animal with one of these little guide horses. Although guide dogs are wonderful, guide horses can be even better in some ways. One of the advantages is that horses live longer than dogs. Horses live from 30 to 50 years. Dogs live only about 12 to 15 years. A horse can also see more of what is around it than a dog can because a horse’s eyes are on the side of its head. Some people cannot be around a dog. Its fur causes them to sneeze and their eyes to itch. Other people might simply like little horses better than dogs. The Burlesons know the best way to match a person and an animal is to have a loving animal that meets the needs of a person, whatever that animal may be.</p>

        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Dan Shaw lives in Maine. He has slowly been losing his eyesight for years. He now has a guide animal to help him. The guide animal leads him through stores and onto buses. Shaw’s guide animal is called Cuddles. Most guide animals are dogs, but Cuddles is not. Cuddles is actually a miniature horse. She is as small as an average-size dog. She is fully grown and just 22 inches tall. These horses are barely big enough for a small child to ride. Cuddles gives Shaw the help he needs and also gives him love and comfort.</p>

        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At first Shaw had planned to get a guide dog. After he found out about the tiny guide horses, however, he decided he would like&nbsp;to have one of them instead. Cuddles soon came to live with him. Shaw is sure that people stare at them as he and Cuddles walk down the street, but he doesn’t care. Cuddles is an important part of his life.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Cuddles leads Shaw wherever he wants to go. She wears tiny sneakers on her hooves. The sneakers keep her from slipping on slick floors in buildings. They also protect her hooves from sharp things.</p>

        </p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Shaw first heard about guide horses on a television show. He found out about two horse lovers named Don and Janet Burleson. They train tiny horses to lead blind people.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. and Mrs. Burleson got the idea for guide horses during a trip to New York City. While riding in a carriage pulled by large horses, they saw how calm the horses were in the noisy city traffic. The horses stayed quiet and calm even when everything around them was noisy and <span class="txt-underline">chaotic</span>. The horses also knew where to go without much direction from the driver. The horses seemed to be natural guide animals.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Burlesons thought about their tiny pet horse Twinkie. She was friendly, smart, and gentle. They wondered whether Twinkie could be trained to help a blind person, just like a guide dog is trained. When the Burlesons returned home, they began to train their tiny pet horse. Twinkie learned very well, so they decided to train other little horses.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Burlesons start training these special horses when they are six months old. The training takes about a year. Each horse has a lot to learn in that time. It learns to lead a blind person safely. It learns to ride in a car and on a bus. It learns to climb stairs and ride in elevators. These are not places where a horse usually goes. It takes time and practice for the horse to get used to being inside buildings.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Burlesons started the Guide Horse Foundation. This group matches a person in need of a guide animal with one of these little guide horses. Although guide dogs are wonderful, guide horses can be even better in some ways. One of the advantages is that horses live longer than dogs. Horses live from 30 to 50 years. Dogs live only about 12 to 15 years. A horse can also see more of what is around it than a dog can because a horse’s eyes are on the side of its head. Some people cannot be around a dog. Its fur causes them to sneeze and their eyes to itch. Other people might simply like little horses better than dogs. The Burlesons know the best way to match a person and an animal is to have a loving animal that meets the needs of a person, whatever that animal may be.</p>

        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Dan Shaw lives in Maine. He has slowly been losing his eyesight for years. He now has a guide animal to help him. The guide animal leads him through stores and onto buses. Shaw’s guide animal is called Cuddles. Most guide animals are dogs, but Cuddles is not. Cuddles is actually a miniature horse. She is as small as an average-size dog. She is fully grown and just 22 inches tall. These horses are barely big enough for a small child to ride. Cuddles gives Shaw the help he needs and also gives him love and comfort.</p>

        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At first Shaw had planned to get a guide dog. After he found out about the tiny guide horses, however, he decided he would like&nbsp;to have one of them instead. Cuddles soon came to live with him. Shaw is sure that people stare at them as he and Cuddles walk down the street, but he doesn’t care. Cuddles is an important part of his life.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Cuddles leads Shaw wherever he wants to go. She wears tiny sneakers on her hooves. The sneakers keep her from slipping on slick floors in buildings. They also protect her hooves from sharp things.</p>

        </p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Shaw first heard about guide horses on a television show. He found out about two horse lovers named Don and Janet Burleson. They train tiny horses to lead blind people.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. and Mrs. Burleson got the idea for guide horses during a trip to New York City. While riding in a carriage pulled by large horses, they saw how calm the horses were in the noisy city traffic. The horses stayed quiet and calm even when everything around them was noisy and <span class="txt-underline">chaotic</span>. The horses also knew where to go without much direction from the driver. The horses seemed to be natural guide animals.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Burlesons thought about their tiny pet horse Twinkie. She was friendly, smart, and gentle. They wondered whether Twinkie could be trained to help a blind person, just like a guide dog is trained. When the Burlesons returned home, they began to train their tiny pet horse. Twinkie learned very well, so they decided to train other little horses.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Burlesons start training these special horses when they are six months old. The training takes about a year. Each horse has a lot to learn in that time. It learns to lead a blind person safely. It learns to ride in a car and on a bus. It learns to climb stairs and ride in elevators. These are not places where a horse usually goes. It takes time and practice for the horse to get used to being inside buildings.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Burlesons started the Guide Horse Foundation. This group matches a person in need of a guide animal with one of these little guide horses. Although guide dogs are wonderful, guide horses can be even better in some ways. One of the advantages is that horses live longer than dogs. Horses live from 30 to 50 years. Dogs live only about 12 to 15 years. A horse can also see more of what is around it than a dog can because a horse’s eyes are on the side of its head. Some people cannot be around a dog. Its fur causes them to sneeze and their eyes to itch. Other people might simply like little horses better than dogs. The Burlesons know the best way to match a person and an animal is to have a loving animal that meets the needs of a person, whatever that animal may be.</p>

        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At first Shaw had planned to get a guide dog. After he found out about the tiny guide horses, however, he decided he would like&nbsp;to have one of them instead. Cuddles soon came to live with him. Shaw is sure that people stare at them as he and Cuddles walk down the street, but he doesn’t care. Cuddles is an important part of his life.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Cuddles leads Shaw wherever he wants to go. She wears tiny sneakers on her hooves. The sneakers keep her from slipping on slick floors in buildings. They also protect her hooves from sharp things.</p>

        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Shaw first heard about guide horses on a television show. He found out about two horse lovers named Don and Janet Burleson. They train tiny horses to lead blind people.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. and Mrs. Burleson got the idea for guide horses during a trip to New York City. While riding in a carriage pulled by large horses, they saw how calm the horses were in the noisy city traffic. The horses stayed quiet and calm even when everything around them was noisy and <span class="txt-underline">chaotic</span>. The horses also knew where to go without much direction from the driver. The horses seemed to be natural guide animals.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Burlesons thought about their tiny pet horse Twinkie. She was friendly, smart, and gentle. They wondered whether Twinkie could be trained to help a blind person, just like a guide dog is trained. When the Burlesons returned home, they began to train their tiny pet horse. Twinkie learned very well, so they decided to train other little horses.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Burlesons start training these special horses when they are six months old. The training takes about a year. Each horse has a lot to learn in that time. It learns to lead a blind person safely. It learns to ride in a car and on a bus. It learns to climb stairs and ride in elevators. These are not places where a horse usually goes. It takes time and practice for the horse to get used to being inside buildings.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Burlesons started the Guide Horse Foundation. This group matches a person in need of a guide animal with one of these little guide horses. Although guide dogs are wonderful, guide horses can be even better in some ways. One of the advantages is that horses live longer than dogs. Horses live from 30 to 50 years. Dogs live only about 12 to 15 years. A horse can also see more of what is around it than a dog can because a horse’s eyes are on the side of its head. Some people cannot be around a dog. Its fur causes them to sneeze and their eyes to itch. Other people might simply like little horses better than dogs. The Burlesons know the best way to match a person and an animal is to have a loving animal that meets the needs of a person, whatever that animal may be.</p>

Shaw’s guide animal is called Cuddles. Most guide animals are dogs, but Cuddles is not. Cuddles is actually a miniature horse. She is as small as an average-size dog. She is fully grown and just 22 inches tall. These horses are barely big enough for a small child to ride. Cuddles gives Shaw the help he needs and also gives him love and comfort.</p>

        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Dan Shaw lives in Maine. He has slowly been losing his eyesight for years. He now has a guide animal to help him. The guide animal leads him through stores and onto buses. Shaw’s guide animal is called Cuddles. Most guide animals are dogs, but Cuddles is not. Cuddles is actually a miniature horse. She is as small as an average-size dog. She is fully grown and just 22 inches tall. These horses are barely big enough for a small child to ride. Cuddles gives Shaw the help he needs and also gives him love and comfort.</p>

        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At first Shaw had planned to get a guide dog. After he found out about the tiny guide horses, however, he decided he would like&nbsp;to have one of them instead. Cuddles soon came to live with him. Shaw is sure that people stare at them as he and Cuddles walk down the street, but he doesn’t care. Cuddles is an important part of his life.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Cuddles leads Shaw wherever he wants to go. She wears tiny sneakers on her hooves. The sneakers keep her from slipping on slick floors in buildings. They also protect her hooves from sharp things.</p>

        </p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Shaw first heard about guide horses on a television show. He found out about two horse lovers named Don and Janet Burleson. They train tiny horses to lead blind people.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. and Mrs. Burleson got the idea for guide horses during a trip to New York City. While riding in a carriage pulled by large horses, they saw how calm the horses were in the noisy city traffic. The horses stayed quiet and calm even when everything around them was noisy and <span class="txt-underline">chaotic</span>. The horses also knew where to go without much direction from the driver. The horses seemed to be natural guide animals.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Burlesons thought about their tiny pet horse Twinkie. She was friendly, smart, and gentle. They wondered whether Twinkie could be trained to help a blind person, just like a guide dog is trained. When the Burlesons returned home, they began to train their tiny pet horse. Twinkie learned very well, so they decided to train other little horses.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Burlesons start training these special horses when they are six months old. The training takes about a year. Each horse has a lot to learn in that time. It learns to lead a blind person safely. It learns to ride in a car and on a bus. It learns to climb stairs and ride in elevators. These are not places where a horse usually goes. It takes time and practice for the horse to get used to being inside buildings.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Burlesons started the Guide Horse Foundation. This group matches a person in need of a guide animal with one of these little guide horses. Although guide dogs are wonderful, guide horses can be even better in some ways. One of the advantages is that horses live longer than dogs. Horses live from 30 to 50 years. Dogs live only about 12 to 15 years. A horse can also see more of what is around it than a dog can because a horse’s eyes are on the side of its head. Some people cannot be around a dog. Its fur causes them to sneeze and their eyes to itch. Other people might simply like little horses better than dogs. The Burlesons know the best way to match a person and an animal is to have a loving animal that meets the needs of a person, whatever that animal may be.</p>

          <strong>A Secret Place</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Spring was warming into summer when Carmen decided to make a special meeting place. She would not have to build it independently. Building it by herself wouldn't be much fun. Her friends La Shonda and Robin would help her. The three of them had formed a group called Friends Forever. They all lived on the same street and did everything together. They wanted a secret place to have their group meetings.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The girls were at La Shonda’s house trying to come up with ideas. “I’ve got just what we need to make a house for our secret meetings,” La Shonda said. She pointed to a huge empty cardboard box in her garage.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Carmen thought about the idea. “Remember when we made that cardboard house for your kitten?” she asked Robin. “It got soggy when it rained, and we had to pick up the wet pieces from all over the yard.”</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“I forgot about that,” Robin said. “That was a big mess! What about getting an old sheet and hanging it over the clothesline at Carmen’s house? Then we could nail the corners down to make a tent.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The girls thought Robin’s idea was great. They were about to get to work when Carmen thought about her dog Rex. She reminded her friends about the time when her mother had almost given Rex away. Rex had pulled her mother’s clean towels off the clothesline and chewed on them in the mud.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Now what should we do?” La Shonda asked sadly. “What else can we use for our meeting place?” Robin and Carmen shrugged their shoulders. The girls sat in silence, trying to think of another idea.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Let’s go to my house and see what we can find,” suggested Robin.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The girls began walking through the large field that was<br>
between La Shonda’s house and Robin’s house. The neighborhood children often used the field for baseball games. There was a patch of sunflowers at the back of the field. Many times the children had lost the baseball in the area covered with the sunflowers. The game would have to be stopped so everyone could look for the ball.</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="100%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766034497/tszzxy1ij3ixu5kpwjed.png" alt="T2_03_CT_EN_24">


        </p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As the girls walked, Robin told her friends about her mother’s childhood playhouse. “Mom told me that when she was little, she had tea parties with her friends. They crawled under the bushes beside her house. No one could see them under there,” Robin explained.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Hey! I have a great idea!” La Shonda exclaimed. “We can have our group meetings in the sunflowers. We always have trouble finding the baseball in there. Why can’t we make a place in the sunflowers for our secret meetings? No one will be able to find us there.”</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“I think it’s a wonderful idea!” agreed Carmen.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Me, too!” Robin cheered.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Finally Carmen, Robin, and La Shonda were able to have their first Friends Forever meeting. Sitting on an old blanket, they looked around and talked about the leafy walls of their secret place. Suddenly Carmen signaled for her friends to be still. La Shonda and Robin sat <span class="txt-underline">motionless </span>and listened carefully. They could hear a bird singing in a nearby tree. Its sweet song gave Carmen another idea.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Let’s make bird feeders. When the sunflowers make their seeds, we’ll put the seeds in our bird feeders,” she said. “But let’s save some seeds. We’ll want to make sure plenty of seeds are planted here for next year’s secret place!”</p>

          <strong>A Secret Place</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Spring was warming into summer when Carmen decided to make a special meeting place. She would not have to build it independently. Building it by herself wouldn't be much fun. Her friends La Shonda and Robin would help her. The three of them had formed a group called Friends Forever. They all lived on the same street and did everything together. They wanted a secret place to have their group meetings.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The girls were at La Shonda’s house trying to come up with ideas. “I’ve got just what we need to make a house for our secret meetings,” La Shonda said. She pointed to a huge empty cardboard box in her garage.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Carmen thought about the idea. “Remember when we made that cardboard house for your kitten?” she asked Robin. “It got soggy when it rained, and we had to pick up the wet pieces from all over the yard.”</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“I forgot about that,” Robin said. “That was a big mess! What about getting an old sheet and hanging it over the clothesline at Carmen’s house? Then we could nail the corners down to make a tent.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The girls thought Robin’s idea was great. They were about to get to work when Carmen thought about her dog Rex. She reminded her friends about the time when her mother had almost given Rex away. Rex had pulled her mother’s clean towels off the clothesline and chewed on them in the mud.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Now what should we do?” La Shonda asked sadly. “What else can we use for our meeting place?” Robin and Carmen shrugged their shoulders. The girls sat in silence, trying to think of another idea.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Let’s go to my house and see what we can find,” suggested Robin.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The girls began walking through the large field that was<br>
between La Shonda’s house and Robin’s house. The neighborhood children often used the field for baseball games. There was a patch of sunflowers at the back of the field. Many times the children had lost the baseball in the area covered with the sunflowers. The game would have to be stopped so everyone could look for the ball.</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="100%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766029443/os6fv8ghywv3djaccnvc.png" alt="T2_03_CT_EN_24">


        </p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As the girls walked, Robin told her friends about her mother’s childhood playhouse. “Mom told me that when she was little, she had tea parties with her friends. They crawled under the bushes beside her house. No one could see them under there,” Robin explained.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Hey! I have a great idea!” La Shonda exclaimed. “We can have our group meetings in the sunflowers. We always have trouble finding the baseball in there. Why can’t we make a place in the sunflowers for our secret meetings? No one will be able to find us there.”</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“I think it’s a wonderful idea!” agreed Carmen.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Me, too!” Robin cheered.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Finally Carmen, Robin, and La Shonda were able to have their first Friends Forever meeting. Sitting on an old blanket, they looked around and talked about the leafy walls of their secret place. Suddenly Carmen signaled for her friends to be still. La Shonda and Robin sat <span class="txt-underline">motionless </span>and listened carefully. They could hear a bird singing in a nearby tree. Its sweet song gave Carmen another idea.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Let’s make bird feeders. When the sunflowers make their seeds, we’ll put the seeds in our bird feeders,” she said. “But let’s save some seeds. We’ll want to make sure plenty of seeds are planted here for next year’s secret place!”</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Many farmers raise hens to lay eggs. Some breeds of hens lay white eggs. Others lay brown eggs. A few breeds lay green or blue eggs. A hen usually lays no more than one egg a day.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After the hen has laid all her eggs, she sits on them gently, turning the eggs over now and then, keeping them warm all over. Warming the eggs is called incubation.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The mother hen incubates her eggs for about 3 weeks. During this time, a chick is growing inside each egg.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When the incubated eggs are about 3 weeks old, the brooding mother hears a cheeping sound. The eggshell of one of the eggs begins to crack. A chick using its egg tooth, a sharp part of its beak, is breaking out of its shell. The other eggs begin to hatch, too.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At first the chicks are wet and sticky. They are very tired. Soon they dry and have fluffy yellow feathers called down. They become stronger. They can see and hear and begin to move about. The chicks make a cheeping sound to let their mother know where they are. The mother hen clucks and drops food in front of them. Chicks can eat the same food as their mothers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In a few weeks the chicks are bigger, but their mother still protects them. The chicks have grown feathers. In a few months these young chickens will look like their mother or father.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Many farmers raise hens to lay eggs. Some breeds of hens lay white eggs. Others lay brown eggs. A few breeds lay green or blue eggs. A hen usually lays no more than one egg a day.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After the hen has laid all her eggs, she sits on them gently, turning the eggs over now and then, keeping them warm all over. Warming the eggs is called incubation.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The mother hen incubates her eggs for about 3 weeks. During this time, a chick is growing inside each egg.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When the incubated eggs are about 3 weeks old, the brooding mother hears a cheeping sound. The eggshell of one of the eggs begins to crack. A chick using its egg tooth, a sharp part of its beak, is breaking out of its shell. The other eggs begin to hatch, too.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At first the chicks are wet and sticky. They are very tired. Soon they dry and have fluffy yellow feathers called down. They become stronger. They can see and hear and begin to move about. The chicks make a cheeping sound to let their mother know where they are. The mother hen clucks and drops food in front of them. Chicks can eat the same food as their mothers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In a few weeks the chicks are bigger, but their mother still protects them. The chicks have grown feathers. In a few months these young chickens will look like their mother or father.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; It is easier to float in the ocean than it is to float in a swimming pool. Do you know why?</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Ocean water is full of salt—and salt water can hold up more weight than fresh water. See for yourself! (Ask an adult to help you.)</p>

        <p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Salt water is heavier than fresh water, so it will stay on the bottom. The fresh water will remain on top.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The potato is heavier than the fresh water, but it is lighter than the salt water. That is why the potato will sink only halfway down.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; It is easier to float in the ocean than it is to float in a swimming pool. Do you know why?</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Ocean water is full of salt—and salt water can hold up more weight than fresh water. See for yourself! (Ask an adult to help you.)</p>

          <strong>What Will Happen:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>The potato will sink—but only halfway!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Why?</strong>
        </p>
        <p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Salt water is heavier than fresh water, so it will stay on the bottom. The fresh water will remain on top.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The potato is heavier than the fresh water, but it is lighter than the salt water. That is why the potato will sink only halfway down.</p>
