        <p>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each June the National Basketball Association<sup>TM</sup> (NBA) conducts a draft of players who wish to play professional basketball. Recently, NBA teams have begun looking into the ranks of high school players for talented athletes. As a result, more and more of the best high school basketball players are choosing to forgo college altogether to play professionally in the NBA.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past it was rare for players to join NBA teams right out of high school. However, the success of Kevin Garnett, who joined the Minnesota Timberwolves<sup>TM</sup> in 1995, has persuaded more teens to consider becoming professionals straight out of high school. In the 2001 NBA draft, high school athletes made up four of the first 10 players chosen by NBA teams. In fact the first choice in that draft was 19-year-old Kwame Brown. Chosen by the Washington Wizards<sup>TM</sup> , Brown was the first high school player selected as a first pick of the NBA draft.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For these talented athletes, the opportunity to skip college for the NBA is hard to resist. Professional basketball stars make millions of dollars and are lavished with attention. They experience a lifestyle most people can only dream about. Plus, many talented high school athletes relish the opportunity to play against the best basketball players in the world.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are benefits for the NBA teams as well. The young stars bring an increased level of excitement and energy to the teams and create interest among the media and the fans. At a time when young people have more entertainment options than ever, stars that teenage fans can identify with are needed. In addition, coaches believe the young stars will develop faster by practicing and playing against NBA talent rather than college players.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So far the evidence seems to prove these coaches correct. It’s true that not all of the players who came straight out of high school have become stars, but as a group they have fared no worse than players taken out of college. In fact, in the 2002–2003 season, four of the top 10 rated players in the league skipped college to go straight to the pros.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some critics, including the league’s commissioner, would like to see the NBA impose an age requirement on players. However, high school athletes and their parents correctly point out that plenty of high school seniors who do not play basketball also skip college to enter the work force. They also note that teens often turn professional in sports such as golf and tennis at even younger ages.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the success these young stars are having, don’t expect NBA teams to turn them away until they have to.</p>

        <p>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Editor:</p>
        <p>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a teacher and a coach, I feel sad when any high school student gives up the chance to go to college. The lure of professional sports with its big money, flashy lifestyle and adoring fans would be hard for anyone to turn down, much less a youngster who hasn’t even graduated. Offering these temptations to high school students is almost criminal.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not too long ago students hoping to go to college participated in sports as a way of earning a scholarship—their opportunity at a college degree. Now, however, sports have become the focus and many athletes attend college only for the purpose of <span class="txt-underline">showcasing</span> their athletic talent and getting an offer to play professionally. That’s too bad since the chances of playing professional sports are extremely small. Even for the talented few who do enter the professional ranks, injuries often result in “careers” that are very brief.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately many college athletic programs fail to acknowledge this reality. Athletes often spend four years playing football or basketball for a college without managing to earn a degree. Many of these athletes realize too late that their athletic ability will carry them only so far. Injuries end the careers of some, but more often than not, the professional teams aren’t interested in them. Although some of these athletes do manage to earn college degrees, many others are left holding a shattered dream, wishing it was a diploma.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now these same problems are moving down to the high school level. Some talented athletes are choosing to skip college altogether to play professionally in the National Basketball Association<sup>TM</sup> (NBA). Although a few, such as Kevin Garnett, have gone on to be stars, these players are the exception—not the rule. I now worry that, just like many collegiate athletes, some high school players will begin neglecting their studies while pinning their hopes on a professional sports career. Some athletes with the ability to play at the college level may lose out on that chance because they focused on athletics rather than their schoolwork.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The NBA should stop the practice of drafting high school players and encourage them to develop both their academic and athletic skills. This would send a message to student athletes that their grade point average is just as important as their average points per game.</p>
