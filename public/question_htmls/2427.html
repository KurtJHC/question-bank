        <p><em>1</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;“Michael Bevons,” the teacher called. “Michael Bevons.”</p>
        <p><em>2</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;It was clear to everyone in the room that the teacher was calling my name. I was, after all, the new kid. I was expected to parade to the front of the room so all the students could stare at this person named Michael Bevons.</p>
        <p><em>3</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;Such was my fate. This change was set in motion two months ago when my mother broached the subject of moving from burning-hot Texas to tolerably hot Southern California. Even though this was the first I’d heard of it, I didn’t really have any objections. I was sure that I would make a lot of friends in California. Everyone knows that people there are more open-minded than anywhere else. In the small Texas town where we lived, people didn’t understand why I love skateboarding and punk music. My mother was excited about her new job. Plus, she would be living near my aunt. Although I didn’t exactly share in the joy of being near my younger cousins, I figured the new scene would suit me just fine.</p>
        <p><em>4</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;But after we arrived, my conception of California changed completely. No one in my neighborhood seemed to share my interests. I happened to move to a place in California where everything is about being in or on the water. I had lived in West Texas my whole life, and I had never even been to a beach. I quickly discovered that sand is no good for skateboarding. And as far as music, I think cricket symphonies are the only thing my new neighbors listen to. When I wasn’t practicing guitar, the neighborhood was nearly silent. I rode my skateboard alone on the sidewalk and played only solos on my guitar.</p>
        <p><em>5</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;I felt right at home today while riding the bus to school—I had been alone in West Texas, and I was alone here. The bus crawled along as kids murmured questions like “What’s his deal?” about the new person on board. My hair, a carefully spiked Mohawk, appeared to be the focus of every conversation.</p>
        <p><em>6</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;I didn’t get it. I had thought that in California, people would know that being different was cool. Nope. I was still just that weirdo that people hoped would not sit next to them. But I wasn’t about to go home and change my hairstyle. Then I’d lose what dignity I had left. So I walked into the classroom anyway.</p>
        <p><em>7</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;“Would you like to come get your book, Michael?” the teacher asked.</p>
        <p><em>8</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;“Actually, no,” I thought. But I knew I didn’t have a choice.</p>
        <p><em>9</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;In the few moments before I was to make my move, I had already calculated the number of steps it would take to reach her desk—nine. I hoped to blaze the path with the quickness of a sprinter. As I took each step, I cringed, thinking at any point that the whispering would start again.</p>
        <p><em>10&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>“We’re starting a new chapter today, so you came on a good day, Michael,” the teacher said cheerfully. She was holding out the book with both hands and smiled as I took it from her.</p>
        <p><em>11&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>“One more thing,” she said. “Robert will show you around today.”</p>
        <p><em>12&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>“All right,” I muttered before starting back to my seat.</p>
        <p><em>13&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>“He’s the class clown,” the teacher said, “so don’t let him annoy you too much.” She seemed to be addressing Robert rather than me.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em>14&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>As I scanned the room, one student hopped on his chair and started acting like a monkey, miming the peeling of a banana and grunting. “He’s the class monkey today,” a student near him said.</p>
        <p><em>15&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>Robert was the perfect shield. While he was distracting the other students, I quickly retreated to my desk.</p>
        <p><em>16&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>The rest of the class time went by fairly quickly. Fortunately, everyone appeared engaged with the teacher’s lesson, so no one was looking my way. When the bell rang, I let most of the students exit before I did. Robert came to my side and asked what was next on my schedule.</p>
        <p><em>17&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>“Science—Room 120B,” I said.</p>
        <p><em>18&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>“You’re going to love that,” Robert said.</p>
        <p><em>19&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>“Really?” I asked.</p>
        <p><em>20&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>“No, not at all. I was kidding,” he quickly replied, smiling. “I’m in there, too, and it’s a true test of my clowning skills to make that class interesting.”</p>
        <p><em>21&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>So we walked together to Room 120B. Robert told me to take a desk near his. After science was math. I was on my own, since Robert went to band class then.</p>
        <p><em>22&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>Robert peeked at my schedule before he left and saw that we both had lunch at the same time. He told me to wait for him outside my math class. I did. I waited and waited, but Robert didn’t show up. I told myself I should have known better and started toward the lunchroom alone.</p>
        <p><em>23&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>Then I heard someone call, “Hey, Michael. Wait up.” Robert was lugging a tuba case.</p>
        <p><em>24&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>That was when I began to think that this move might just work out O.K. “Dude, you play the tuba? That could be so punk!” I said. “Let me tell you what I’ve got in mind.”</p>

        </p>
        <p><em>1</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;“Michael Bevons,” the teacher called. “Michael Bevons.”</p>
        <p><em>2</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;It was clear to everyone in the room that the teacher was calling my name. I was, after all, the new kid. I was expected to parade to the front of the room so all the students could stare at this person named Michael Bevons.</p>
        <p><em>3</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;Such was my fate. This change was set in motion two months ago when my mother broached the subject of moving from burning-hot Texas to tolerably hot Southern California. Even though this was the first I’d heard of it, I didn’t really have any objections. I was sure that I would make a lot of friends in California. Everyone knows that people there are more open-minded than anywhere else. In the small Texas town where we lived, people didn’t understand why I love skateboarding and punk music. My mother was excited about her new job. Plus, she would be living near my aunt. Although I didn’t exactly share in the joy of being near my younger cousins, I figured the new scene would suit me just fine.</p>
        <p><em>4</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;But after we arrived, my conception of California changed completely. No one in my neighborhood seemed to share my interests. I happened to move to a place in California where everything is about being in or on the water. I had lived in West Texas my whole life, and I had never even been to a beach. I quickly discovered that sand is no good for skateboarding. And as far as music, I think cricket symphonies are the only thing my new neighbors listen to. When I wasn’t practicing guitar, the neighborhood was nearly silent. I rode my skateboard alone on the sidewalk and played only solos on my guitar.</p>
        <p><em>5</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;I felt right at home today while riding the bus to school—I had been alone in West Texas, and I was alone here. The bus crawled along as kids murmured questions like “What’s his deal?” about the new person on board. My hair, a carefully spiked Mohawk, appeared to be the focus of every conversation.</p>
        <p><em>6</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;I didn’t get it. I had thought that in California, people would know that being different was cool. Nope. I was still just that weirdo that people hoped would not sit next to them. But I wasn’t about to go home and change my hairstyle. Then I’d lose what dignity I had left. So I walked into the classroom anyway.</p>
        <p><em>7</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;“Would you like to come get your book, Michael?” the teacher asked.</p>
        <p><em>8</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;“Actually, no,” I thought. But I knew I didn’t have a choice.</p>
        <p><em>9</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;In the few moments before I was to make my move, I had already calculated the number of steps it would take to reach her desk—nine. I hoped to blaze the path with the quickness of a sprinter. As I took each step, I cringed, thinking at any point that the whispering would start again.</p>
        <p><em>10&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>“We’re starting a new chapter today, so you came on a good day, Michael,” the teacher said cheerfully. She was holding out the book with both hands and smiled as I took it from her.</p>
        <p><em>11&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>“One more thing,” she said. “Robert will show you around today.”</p>
        <p><em>12&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>“All right,” I muttered before starting back to my seat.</p>
        <p><em>13&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>“He’s the class clown,” the teacher said, “so don’t let him annoy you too much.” She seemed to be addressing Robert rather than me.</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
                  <img width="77%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766030416/cr7nkmyalqb1acmlq6fy.png" alt="stt19_RC_11">


        </p>
        <p><em>14&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>As I scanned the room, one student hopped on his chair and started acting like a monkey, miming the peeling of a banana and grunting. “He’s the class monkey today,” a student near him said.</p>
        <p><em>15&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>Robert was the perfect shield. While he was distracting the other students, I quickly retreated to my desk.</p>
        <p><em>16&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>The rest of the class time went by fairly quickly. Fortunately, everyone appeared engaged with the teacher’s lesson, so no one was looking my way. When the bell rang, I let most of the students exit before I did. Robert came to my side and asked what was next on my schedule.</p>
        <p><em>17&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>“Science—Room 120B,” I said.</p>
        <p><em>18&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>“You’re going to love that,” Robert said.</p>
        <p><em>19&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>“Really?” I asked.</p>
        <p><em>20&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>“No, not at all. I was kidding,” he quickly replied, smiling. “I’m in there, too, and it’s a true test of my clowning skills to make that class interesting.”</p>
        <p><em>21&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>So we walked together to Room 120B. Robert told me to take a desk near his. After science was math. I was on my own, since Robert went to band class then.</p>
        <p><em>22&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>Robert peeked at my schedule before he left and saw that we both had lunch at the same time. He told me to wait for him outside my math class. I did. I waited and waited, but Robert didn’t show up. I told myself I should have known better and started toward the lunchroom alone.</p>
        <p><em>23&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>Then I heard someone call, “Hey, Michael. Wait up.” Robert was lugging a tuba case.</p>
        <p><em>24&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>That was when I began to think that this move might just work out O.K. “Dude, you play the tuba? That could be so punk!” I said. “Let me tell you what I’ve got in mind.”</p>

        </p>
        <p><em>1</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;“Michael Bevons,” the teacher called. “Michael Bevons.”</p>
        <p><em>2</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;It was clear to everyone in the room that the teacher was calling my name. I was, after all, the new kid. I was expected to parade to the front of the room so all the students could stare at this person named Michael Bevons.</p>
        <p><em>3</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;Such was my fate. This change was set in motion two months ago when my mother broached the subject of moving from burning-hot Texas to tolerably hot Southern California. Even though this was the first I’d heard of it, I didn’t really have any objections. I was sure that I would make a lot of friends in California. Everyone knows that people there are more open-minded than anywhere else. In the small Texas town where we lived, people didn’t understand why I love skateboarding and punk music. My mother was excited about her new job. Plus, she would be living near my aunt. Although I didn’t exactly share in the joy of being near my younger cousins, I figured the new scene would suit me just fine.</p>
        <p><em>4</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;But after we arrived, my conception of California changed completely. No one in my neighborhood seemed to share my interests. I happened to move to a place in California where everything is about being in or on the water. I had lived in West Texas my whole life, and I had never even been to a beach. I quickly discovered that sand is no good for skateboarding. And as far as music, I think cricket symphonies are the only thing my new neighbors listen to. When I wasn’t practicing guitar, the neighborhood was nearly silent. I rode my skateboard alone on the sidewalk and played only solos on my guitar.</p>
        <p><em>5</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;I felt right at home today while riding the bus to school—I had been alone in West Texas, and I was alone here. The bus crawled along as kids murmured questions like “What’s his deal?” about the new person on board. My hair, a carefully spiked Mohawk, appeared to be the focus of every conversation.</p>
        <p><em>6</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;I didn’t get it. I had thought that in California, people would know that being different was cool. Nope. I was still just that weirdo that people hoped would not sit next to them. But I wasn’t about to go home and change my hairstyle. Then I’d lose what dignity I had left. So I walked into the classroom anyway.</p>
        <p><em>7</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;“Would you like to come get your book, Michael?” the teacher asked.</p>
        <p><em>8</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;“Actually, no,” I thought. But I knew I didn’t have a choice.</p>
        <p><em>9</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;In the few moments before I was to make my move, I had already calculated the number of steps it would take to reach her desk—nine. I hoped to blaze the path with the quickness of a sprinter. As I took each step, I cringed, thinking at any point that the whispering would start again.</p>
        <p><em>10&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>“We’re starting a new chapter today, so you came on a good day, Michael,” the teacher said cheerfully. She was holding out the book with both hands and smiled as I took it from her.</p>
        <p><em>11&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>“One more thing,” she said. “Robert will show you around today.”</p>
        <p><em>12&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>“All right,” I muttered before starting back to my seat.</p>
        <p><em>13&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>“He’s the class clown,” the teacher said, “so don’t let him annoy you too much.” She seemed to be addressing Robert rather than me.</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
                  <img width="77%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766021113/guabxbpxpojjvyamc47w.png" alt="stt19_RC_11">


        </p>
        <p><em>14&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>As I scanned the room, one student hopped on his chair and started acting like a monkey, miming the peeling of a banana and grunting. “He’s the class monkey today,” a student near him said.</p>
        <p><em>15&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>Robert was the perfect shield. While he was distracting the other students, I quickly retreated to my desk.</p>
        <p><em>16&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>The rest of the class time went by fairly quickly. Fortunately, everyone appeared engaged with the teacher’s lesson, so no one was looking my way. When the bell rang, I let most of the students exit before I did. Robert came to my side and asked what was next on my schedule.</p>
        <p><em>17&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>“Science—Room 120B,” I said.</p>
        <p><em>18&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>“You’re going to love that,” Robert said.</p>
        <p><em>19&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>“Really?” I asked.</p>
        <p><em>20&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>“No, not at all. I was kidding,” he quickly replied, smiling. “I’m in there, too, and it’s a true test of my clowning skills to make that class interesting.”</p>
        <p><em>21&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>So we walked together to Room 120B. Robert told me to take a desk near his. After science was math. I was on my own, since Robert went to band class then.</p>
        <p><em>22&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>Robert peeked at my schedule before he left and saw that we both had lunch at the same time. He told me to wait for him outside my math class. I did. I waited and waited, but Robert didn’t show up. I told myself I should have known better and started toward the lunchroom alone.</p>
        <p><em>23&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>Then I heard someone call, “Hey, Michael. Wait up.” Robert was lugging a tuba case.</p>
        <p><em>24&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>That was when I began to think that this move might just work out O.K. “Dude, you play the tuba? That could be so punk!” I said. “Let me tell you what I’ve got in mind.”</p>

        </p>
        <p><em>1</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;“Michael Bevons,” the teacher called. “Michael Bevons.”</p>
        <p><em>2</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;It was clear to everyone in the room that the teacher was calling my name. I was, after all, the new kid. I was expected to parade to the front of the room so all the students could stare at this person named Michael Bevons.</p>
        <p><em>3</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;Such was my fate. This change was set in motion two months ago when my mother broached the subject of moving from burning-hot Texas to tolerably hot Southern California. Even though this was the first I’d heard of it, I didn’t really have any objections. I was sure that I would make a lot of friends in California. Everyone knows that people there are more open-minded than anywhere else. In the small Texas town where we lived, people didn’t understand why I love skateboarding and punk music. My mother was excited about her new job. Plus, she would be living near my aunt. Although I didn’t exactly share in the joy of being near my younger cousins, I figured the new scene would suit me just fine.</p>
        <p><em>4</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;But after we arrived, my conception of California changed completely. No one in my neighborhood seemed to share my interests. I happened to move to a place in California where everything is about being in or on the water. I had lived in West Texas my whole life, and I had never even been to a beach. I quickly discovered that sand is no good for skateboarding. And as far as music, I think cricket symphonies are the only thing my new neighbors listen to. When I wasn’t practicing guitar, the neighborhood was nearly silent. I rode my skateboard alone on the sidewalk and played only solos on my guitar.</p>
        <p><em>5</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;I felt right at home today while riding the bus to school—I had been alone in West Texas, and I was alone here. The bus crawled along as kids murmured questions like “What’s his deal?” about the new person on board. My hair, a carefully spiked Mohawk, appeared to be the focus of every conversation.</p>
        <p><em>6</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;I didn’t get it. I had thought that in California, people would know that being different was cool. Nope. I was still just that weirdo that people hoped would not sit next to them. But I wasn’t about to go home and change my hairstyle. Then I’d lose what dignity I had left. So I walked into the classroom anyway.</p>
        <p><em>7</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;“Would you like to come get your book, Michael?” the teacher asked.</p>
        <p><em>8</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;“Actually, no,” I thought. But I knew I didn’t have a choice.</p>
        <p><em>9</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;In the few moments before I was to make my move, I had already calculated the number of steps it would take to reach her desk—nine. I hoped to blaze the path with the quickness of a sprinter. As I took each step, I cringed, thinking at any point that the whispering would start again.</p>
        <p><em>10&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>“We’re starting a new chapter today, so you came on a good day, Michael,” the teacher said cheerfully. She was holding out the book with both hands and smiled as I took it from her.</p>
        <p><em>11&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>“One more thing,” she said. “Robert will show you around today.”</p>
        <p><em>12&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>“All right,” I muttered before starting back to my seat.</p>
        <p><em>13&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>“He’s the class clown,” the teacher said, “so don’t let him annoy you too much.” She seemed to be addressing Robert rather than me.</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
                  <img width="77%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766021550/fyecphfmy6lsocotps8d.png" alt="stt19_RC_11">


        </p>
        <p><em>14&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>As I scanned the room, one student hopped on his chair and started acting like a monkey, miming the peeling of a banana and grunting. “He’s the class monkey today,” a student near him said.</p>
        <p><em>15&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>Robert was the perfect shield. While he was distracting the other students, I quickly retreated to my desk.</p>
        <p><em>16&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>The rest of the class time went by fairly quickly. Fortunately, everyone appeared engaged with the teacher’s lesson, so no one was looking my way. When the bell rang, I let most of the students exit before I did. Robert came to my side and asked what was next on my schedule.</p>
        <p><em>17&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>“Science—Room 120B,” I said.</p>
        <p><em>18&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>“You’re going to love that,” Robert said.</p>
        <p><em>19&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>“Really?” I asked.</p>
        <p><em>20&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>“No, not at all. I was kidding,” he quickly replied, smiling. “I’m in there, too, and it’s a true test of my clowning skills to make that class interesting.”</p>
        <p><em>21&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>So we walked together to Room 120B. Robert told me to take a desk near his. After science was math. I was on my own, since Robert went to band class then.</p>
        <p><em>22&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>Robert peeked at my schedule before he left and saw that we both had lunch at the same time. He told me to wait for him outside my math class. I did. I waited and waited, but Robert didn’t show up. I told myself I should have known better and started toward the lunchroom alone.</p>
        <p><em>23&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>Then I heard someone call, “Hey, Michael. Wait up.” Robert was lugging a tuba case.</p>
        <p><em>24&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>That was when I began to think that this move might just work out O.K. “Dude, you play the tuba? That could be so punk!” I said. “Let me tell you what I’ve got in mind.”</p>

        </p>
        <p><em>1</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The check bounced. “Insufficient funds,” says the little note attached. Well, I’m sure it’s just a mistake. Probably the people didn’t make a transfer in time or something. “No big deal,” I keep saying to myself, standing at the mailbox.</p>
        <p><em>2</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the check bounced! Isn’t that strange? I mean, is there a message here? The check was payment to us for the sale of Cricket, our ex-horse, and Sassy, our ex-mule. A sale, truth be told, I’ve been regretting. And now the check has bounced. Is it a sign?</p>
        <p><em>3</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; No, of course not. Probably just a clerical error.</p>
        <p><em>4</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, as I take the long walk back home, I get a picture in my head. I imagine that somehow Cricket and Sassy understand that the check bounced, that they understand the legal ramifications of this, that technically the deal is null and void, and in one burst of horse energy they leap over the buyer’s fence and come bounding in slow motion, as if in a shampoo commercial, up our driveway, toward me, kicking and snorting with glee, and I run toward them and we hug and live happily ever after. Together. As it was meant to be.</p>
        <p><em>5</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I get home I snap out of it. No, we did the right thing, selling Cricket and Sassy. They’re in a better place now. Cricket will be a brood mare. A mom!</p>
        <p><em>6</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; And Sassy, her friend, will be at her side. It’s better for them. Better for us. Cricket, a registered American saddlebred, is too much horse for novices like us. And Sassy is too short for an adult to ride. And we have another horse and mule that we do ride. So this really is the best thing for all concerned. And what did I tell myself ? Yes, some friendships are meant to end. That’s it. Never mind that Cricket was our love-horse, the horse that walked up our driveway on our wedding day. And Sassy was our love-mule, the mule that walked up our driveway beside her. They had flowers in their hair. Never mind! Because some friendships are just meant to end. And I am a mature person with a logical head who understands this.</p>
        <p><em>7</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; So I call Cricket and Sassy’s new owners. “The check bounced,” I say.</p>
        <p><em>8</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; “Oh, that’s our stupid bank,” the woman says. Then she gives me her bank’s stupid phone number, should I want to call for proof that her account is in good standing, which I don’t really, but I write the number down anyway. “Just resubmit the check, okay?” she says. I ask her how Cricket and Sassy are doing, and she says, “Great!” Nothing more. I wish she had said more.</p>
        <p><em>9</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Meantime, all this horse thinking gets my mind on Billy. Because not all fading friendships are meant to end. Billy is the neighbor who sold Cricket and Sassy to us. He’s the one who rode Sassy up the driveway on our wedding day, his feet dragging on the ground. Tom, his son, rode Cricket. They’re the ones who put the flowers in their hair. Billy and I used to see each other more. I don’t know why we’ve drifted. There never seems to be a real reason for friendships to fade. Friendships take work. Maybe that’s all there is to it.</p>
        <p><em>10&nbsp;</em>&nbsp; I call Billy just to say hi. He seems happy to hear from me. “We got a donkey!” he says. “She’s so goofy. You’d love her.” I tell him the news about Cricket and Sassy, and when I mention the buyers he seems concerned: “Did you happen to insist on a certified check?”</p>
        <p><em>11&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Oh.</p>
        <p><em>12&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Sure enough, a few days later, I’m at the mailbox. “Insufficient funds.” I can’t believe it. What do they think, I’m an idiot or something? I stomp into the house. What about that bank phone number? I’ll call that bank, I’ll get to the bottom of this. What did I do with that number? I must have thrown it out. I start picking through the trash.</p>
        <p><em>13&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Here it is! But the paper is wet and the number is blurred.</p>
        <p><em>14&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Isn’t that strange? I mean, is there a message here? It’s hard not to think of disappearing ink as a message from above. I start getting shampoo commercials in my head again. Oh, dear.</p>
        <p><em>15&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Why am I putting myself through all of this? Why can’t I just admit that I made a mistake? Not just the part about selling my beloved pets to, well, some questionable buyers. But selling them at all. And, anyway, why can’t we breed Cricket? A lot of work, perhaps. But wouldn’t that be an amazing experience?</p>
        <p><em>16&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>I imagine Cricket back in our barn. I imagine brushing her, telling her everything I’ve learned. “Well, Cricket, friendships take work,” I’ll say. “That’s all there is to it.”</p>
        <p><em>17&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>So I call the woman, sound very businesslike. “The check bounced again,” I say calmly. “The deal is off.” Strangely, she doesn’t sound surprised. I get the distinct sense she and her husband have been through this before.</p>
        <p><em>18&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>I call Billy. “Would you be able to go pick up Cricket and Sassy in your horse trailer and bring them back home?” I ask. He says of course. No questions asked. And I think that’s what friends are for. And I say yeah, I’d love to stop over and meet his new donkey.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em>1</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The check bounced. “Insufficient funds,” says the little note attached. Well, I’m sure it’s just a mistake. Probably the people didn’t make a transfer in time or something. “No big deal,” I keep saying to myself, standing at the mailbox.</p>
        <p><em>2</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the check bounced! Isn’t that strange? I mean, is there a message here? The check was payment to us for the sale of Cricket, our ex-horse, and Sassy, our ex-mule. A sale, truth be told, I’ve been regretting. And now the check has bounced. Is it a sign?</p>
        <p><em>3</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; No, of course not. Probably just a clerical error.</p>
        <p><em>4</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, as I take the long walk back home, I get a picture in my head. I imagine that somehow Cricket and Sassy understand that the check bounced, that they understand the legal ramifications of this, that technically the deal is null and void, and in one burst of horse energy they leap over the buyer’s fence and come bounding in slow motion, as if in a shampoo commercial, up our driveway, toward me, kicking and snorting with glee, and I run toward them and we hug and live happily ever after. Together. As it was meant to be.</p>
        <p><em>5</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I get home I snap out of it. No, we did the right thing, selling Cricket and Sassy. They’re in a better place now. Cricket will be a brood mare. A mom!</p>
        <p><em>6</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; And Sassy, her friend, will be at her side. It’s better for them. Better for us. Cricket, a registered American saddlebred, is too much horse for novices like us. And Sassy is too short for an adult to ride. And we have another horse and mule that we do ride. So this really is the best thing for all concerned. And what did I tell myself ? Yes, some friendships are meant to end. That’s it. Never mind that Cricket was our love-horse, the horse that walked up our driveway on our wedding day. And Sassy was our love-mule, the mule that walked up our driveway beside her. They had flowers in their hair. Never mind! Because some friendships are just meant to end. And I am a mature person with a logical head who understands this.</p>
        <p><em>7</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; So I call Cricket and Sassy’s new owners. “The check bounced,” I say.</p>
        <p><em>8</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; “Oh, that’s our stupid bank,” the woman says. Then she gives me her bank’s stupid phone number, should I want to call for proof that her account is in good standing, which I don’t really, but I write the number down anyway. “Just resubmit the check, okay?” she says. I ask her how Cricket and Sassy are doing, and she says, “Great!” Nothing more. I wish she had said more.</p>
        <p><em>9</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Meantime, all this horse thinking gets my mind on Billy. Because not all fading friendships are meant to end. Billy is the neighbor who sold Cricket and Sassy to us. He’s the one who rode Sassy up the driveway on our wedding day, his feet dragging on the ground. Tom, his son, rode Cricket. They’re the ones who put the flowers in their hair. Billy and I used to see each other more. I don’t know why we’ve drifted. There never seems to be a real reason for friendships to fade. Friendships take work. Maybe that’s all there is to it.</p>
        <p><em>10&nbsp;</em>&nbsp; I call Billy just to say hi. He seems happy to hear from me. “We got a donkey!” he says. “She’s so goofy. You’d love her.” I tell him the news about Cricket and Sassy, and when I mention the buyers he seems concerned: “Did you happen to insist on a certified check?”</p>
        <p><em>11&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Oh.</p>
        <p><em>12&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Sure enough, a few days later, I’m at the mailbox. “Insufficient funds.” I can’t believe it. What do they think, I’m an idiot or something? I stomp into the house. What about that bank phone number? I’ll call that bank, I’ll get to the bottom of this. What did I do with that number? I must have thrown it out. I start picking through the trash.</p>
        <p><em>13&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Here it is! But the paper is wet and the number is blurred.</p>
        <p><em>14&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Isn’t that strange? I mean, is there a message here? It’s hard not to think of disappearing ink as a message from above. I start getting shampoo commercials in my head again. Oh, dear.</p>
        <p><em>15&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Why am I putting myself through all of this? Why can’t I just admit that I made a mistake? Not just the part about selling my beloved pets to, well, some questionable buyers. But selling them at all. And, anyway, why can’t we breed Cricket? A lot of work, perhaps. But wouldn’t that be an amazing experience?</p>
        <p><em>16&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>I imagine Cricket back in our barn. I imagine brushing her, telling her everything I’ve learned. “Well, Cricket, friendships take work,” I’ll say. “That’s all there is to it.”</p>
        <p><em>17&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>So I call the woman, sound very businesslike. “The check bounced again,” I say calmly. “The deal is off.” Strangely, she doesn’t sound surprised. I get the distinct sense she and her husband have been through this before.</p>
        <p><em>18&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>I call Billy. “Would you be able to go pick up Cricket and Sassy in your horse trailer and bring them back home?” I ask. He says of course. No questions asked. And I think that’s what friends are for. And I say yeah, I’d love to stop over and meet his new donkey.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em>1</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The check bounced. “Insufficient funds,” says the little note attached. Well, I’m sure it’s just a mistake. Probably the people didn’t make a transfer in time or something. “No big deal,” I keep saying to myself, standing at the mailbox.</p>
        <p><em>2</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the check bounced! Isn’t that strange? I mean, is there a message here? The check was payment to us for the sale of Cricket, our ex-horse, and Sassy, our ex-mule. A sale, truth be told, I’ve been regretting. And now the check has bounced. Is it a sign?</p>
        <p><em>3</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; No, of course not. Probably just a clerical error.</p>
        <p><em>4</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, as I take the long walk back home, I get a picture in my head. I imagine that somehow Cricket and Sassy understand that the check bounced, that they understand the legal ramifications of this, that technically the deal is null and void, and in one burst of horse energy they leap over the buyer’s fence and come bounding in slow motion, as if in a shampoo commercial, up our driveway, toward me, kicking and snorting with glee, and I run toward them and we hug and live happily ever after. Together. As it was meant to be.</p>
        <p><em>5</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I get home I snap out of it. No, we did the right thing, selling Cricket and Sassy. They’re in a better place now. Cricket will be a brood mare. A mom!</p>
        <p><em>6</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; And Sassy, her friend, will be at her side. It’s better for them. Better for us. Cricket, a registered American saddlebred, is too much horse for novices like us. And Sassy is too short for an adult to ride. And we have another horse and mule that we do ride. So this really is the best thing for all concerned. And what did I tell myself ? Yes, some friendships are meant to end. That’s it. Never mind that Cricket was our love-horse, the horse that walked up our driveway on our wedding day. And Sassy was our love-mule, the mule that walked up our driveway beside her. They had flowers in their hair. Never mind! Because some friendships are just meant to end. And I am a mature person with a logical head who understands this.</p>
        <p><em>7</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; So I call Cricket and Sassy’s new owners. “The check bounced,” I say.</p>
        <p><em>8</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; “Oh, that’s our stupid bank,” the woman says. Then she gives me her bank’s stupid phone number, should I want to call for proof that her account is in good standing, which I don’t really, but I write the number down anyway. “Just resubmit the check, okay?” she says. I ask her how Cricket and Sassy are doing, and she says, “Great!” Nothing more. I wish she had said more.</p>
        <p><em>9</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Meantime, all this horse thinking gets my mind on Billy. Because not all fading friendships are meant to end. Billy is the neighbor who sold Cricket and Sassy to us. He’s the one who rode Sassy up the driveway on our wedding day, his feet dragging on the ground. Tom, his son, rode Cricket. They’re the ones who put the flowers in their hair. Billy and I used to see each other more. I don’t know why we’ve drifted. There never seems to be a real reason for friendships to fade. Friendships take work. Maybe that’s all there is to it.</p>
        <p><em>10&nbsp;</em>&nbsp; I call Billy just to say hi. He seems happy to hear from me. “We got a donkey!” he says. “She’s so goofy. You’d love her.” I tell him the news about Cricket and Sassy, and when I mention the buyers he seems concerned: “Did you happen to insist on a certified check?”</p>
        <p><em>11&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Oh.</p>
        <p><em>12&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Sure enough, a few days later, I’m at the mailbox. “Insufficient funds.” I can’t believe it. What do they think, I’m an idiot or something? I stomp into the house. What about that bank phone number? I’ll call that bank, I’ll get to the bottom of this. What did I do with that number? I must have thrown it out. I start picking through the trash.</p>
        <p><em>13&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Here it is! But the paper is wet and the number is blurred.</p>
        <p><em>14&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Isn’t that strange? I mean, is there a message here? It’s hard not to think of disappearing ink as a message from above. I start getting shampoo commercials in my head again. Oh, dear.</p>
        <p><em>15&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Why am I putting myself through all of this? Why can’t I just admit that I made a mistake? Not just the part about selling my beloved pets to, well, some questionable buyers. But selling them at all. And, anyway, why can’t we breed Cricket? A lot of work, perhaps. But wouldn’t that be an amazing experience?</p>
        <p><em>16&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>I imagine Cricket back in our barn. I imagine brushing her, telling her everything I’ve learned. “Well, Cricket, friendships take work,” I’ll say. “That’s all there is to it.”</p>
        <p><em>17&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>So I call the woman, sound very businesslike. “The check bounced again,” I say calmly. “The deal is off.” Strangely, she doesn’t sound surprised. I get the distinct sense she and her husband have been through this before.</p>
        <p><em>18&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>I call Billy. “Would you be able to go pick up Cricket and Sassy in your horse trailer and bring them back home?” I ask. He says of course. No questions asked. And I think that’s what friends are for. And I say yeah, I’d love to stop over and meet his new donkey.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em>1</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The check bounced. “Insufficient funds,” says the little note attached. Well, I’m sure it’s just a mistake. Probably the people didn’t make a transfer in time or something. “No big deal,” I keep saying to myself, standing at the mailbox.</p>
        <p><em>2</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the check bounced! Isn’t that strange? I mean, is there a message here? The check was payment to us for the sale of Cricket, our ex-horse, and Sassy, our ex-mule. A sale, truth be told, I’ve been regretting. And now the check has bounced. Is it a sign?</p>
        <p><em>3</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; No, of course not. Probably just a clerical error.</p>
        <p><em>4</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, as I take the long walk back home, I get a picture in my head. I imagine that somehow Cricket and Sassy understand that the check bounced, that they understand the legal ramifications of this, that technically the deal is null and void, and in one burst of horse energy they leap over the buyer’s fence and come bounding in slow motion, as if in a shampoo commercial, up our driveway, toward me, kicking and snorting with glee, and I run toward them and we hug and live happily ever after. Together. As it was meant to be.</p>
        <p><em>5</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I get home I snap out of it. No, we did the right thing, selling Cricket and Sassy. They’re in a better place now. Cricket will be a brood mare. A mom!</p>
        <p><em>6</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; And Sassy, her friend, will be at her side. It’s better for them. Better for us. Cricket, a registered American saddlebred, is too much horse for novices like us. And Sassy is too short for an adult to ride. And we have another horse and mule that we do ride. So this really is the best thing for all concerned. And what did I tell myself ? Yes, some friendships are meant to end. That’s it. Never mind that Cricket was our love-horse, the horse that walked up our driveway on our wedding day. And Sassy was our love-mule, the mule that walked up our driveway beside her. They had flowers in their hair. Never mind! Because some friendships are just meant to end. And I am a mature person with a logical head who understands this.</p>
        <p><em>7</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; So I call Cricket and Sassy’s new owners. “The check bounced,” I say.</p>
        <p><em>8</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; “Oh, that’s our stupid bank,” the woman says. Then she gives me her bank’s stupid phone number, should I want to call for proof that her account is in good standing, which I don’t really, but I write the number down anyway. “Just resubmit the check, okay?” she says. I ask her how Cricket and Sassy are doing, and she says, “Great!” Nothing more. I wish she had said more.</p>
        <p><em>9</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Meantime, all this horse thinking gets my mind on Billy. Because not all fading friendships are meant to end. Billy is the neighbor who sold Cricket and Sassy to us. He’s the one who rode Sassy up the driveway on our wedding day, his feet dragging on the ground. Tom, his son, rode Cricket. They’re the ones who put the flowers in their hair. Billy and I used to see each other more. I don’t know why we’ve drifted. There never seems to be a real reason for friendships to fade. Friendships take work. Maybe that’s all there is to it.</p>
        <p><em>10&nbsp;</em>&nbsp; I call Billy just to say hi. He seems happy to hear from me. “We got a donkey!” he says. “She’s so goofy. You’d love her.” I tell him the news about Cricket and Sassy, and when I mention the buyers he seems concerned: “Did you happen to insist on a certified check?”</p>
        <p><em>11&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Oh.</p>
        <p><em>12&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Sure enough, a few days later, I’m at the mailbox. “Insufficient funds.” I can’t believe it. What do they think, I’m an idiot or something? I stomp into the house. What about that bank phone number? I’ll call that bank, I’ll get to the bottom of this. What did I do with that number? I must have thrown it out. I start picking through the trash.</p>
        <p><em>13&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Here it is! But the paper is wet and the number is blurred.</p>
        <p><em>14&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Isn’t that strange? I mean, is there a message here? It’s hard not to think of disappearing ink as a message from above. I start getting shampoo commercials in my head again. Oh, dear.</p>
        <p><em>15&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Why am I putting myself through all of this? Why can’t I just admit that I made a mistake? Not just the part about selling my beloved pets to, well, some questionable buyers. But selling them at all. And, anyway, why can’t we breed Cricket? A lot of work, perhaps. But wouldn’t that be an amazing experience?</p>
        <p><em>16&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>I imagine Cricket back in our barn. I imagine brushing her, telling her everything I’ve learned. “Well, Cricket, friendships take work,” I’ll say. “That’s all there is to it.”</p>
        <p><em>17&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>So I call the woman, sound very businesslike. “The check bounced again,” I say calmly. “The deal is off.” Strangely, she doesn’t sound surprised. I get the distinct sense she and her husband have been through this before.</p>
        <p><em>18&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>I call Billy. “Would you be able to go pick up Cricket and Sassy in your horse trailer and bring them back home?” I ask. He says of course. No questions asked. And I think that’s what friends are for. And I say yeah, I’d love to stop over and meet his new donkey.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em>1</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The check bounced. “Insufficient funds,” says the little note attached. Well, I’m sure it’s just a mistake. Probably the people didn’t make a transfer in time or something. “No big deal,” I keep saying to myself, standing at the mailbox.</p>
        <p><em>2</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the check bounced! Isn’t that strange? I mean, is there a message here? The check was payment to us for the sale of Cricket, our ex-horse, and Sassy, our ex-mule. A sale, truth be told, I’ve been regretting. And now the check has bounced. Is it a sign?</p>
        <p><em>3</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; No, of course not. Probably just a clerical error.</p>
        <p><em>4</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, as I take the long walk back home, I get a picture in my head. I imagine that somehow Cricket and Sassy understand that the check bounced, that they understand the legal ramifications of this, that technically the deal is null and void, and in one burst of horse energy they leap over the buyer’s fence and come bounding in slow motion, as if in a shampoo commercial, up our driveway, toward me, kicking and snorting with glee, and I run toward them and we hug and live happily ever after. Together. As it was meant to be.</p>
        <p><em>5</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I get home I snap out of it. No, we did the right thing, selling Cricket and Sassy. They’re in a better place now. Cricket will be a brood mare. A mom!</p>
        <p><em>6</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; And Sassy, her friend, will be at her side. It’s better for them. Better for us. Cricket, a registered American saddlebred, is too much horse for novices like us. And Sassy is too short for an adult to ride. And we have another horse and mule that we do ride. So this really is the best thing for all concerned. And what did I tell myself ? Yes, some friendships are meant to end. That’s it. Never mind that Cricket was our love-horse, the horse that walked up our driveway on our wedding day. And Sassy was our love-mule, the mule that walked up our driveway beside her. They had flowers in their hair. Never mind! Because some friendships are just meant to end. And I am a mature person with a logical head who understands this.</p>
        <p><em>7</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; So I call Cricket and Sassy’s new owners. “The check bounced,” I say.</p>
        <p><em>8</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; “Oh, that’s our stupid bank,” the woman says. Then she gives me her bank’s stupid phone number, should I want to call for proof that her account is in good standing, which I don’t really, but I write the number down anyway. “Just resubmit the check, okay?” she says. I ask her how Cricket and Sassy are doing, and she says, “Great!” Nothing more. I wish she had said more.</p>
        <p><em>9</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Meantime, all this horse thinking gets my mind on Billy. Because not all fading friendships are meant to end. Billy is the neighbor who sold Cricket and Sassy to us. He’s the one who rode Sassy up the driveway on our wedding day, his feet dragging on the ground. Tom, his son, rode Cricket. They’re the ones who put the flowers in their hair. Billy and I used to see each other more. I don’t know why we’ve drifted. There never seems to be a real reason for friendships to fade. Friendships take work. Maybe that’s all there is to it.</p>
        <p><em>10&nbsp;</em>&nbsp; I call Billy just to say hi. He seems happy to hear from me. “We got a donkey!” he says. “She’s so goofy. You’d love her.” I tell him the news about Cricket and Sassy, and when I mention the buyers he seems concerned: “Did you happen to insist on a certified check?”</p>
        <p><em>11&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Oh.</p>
        <p><em>12&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Sure enough, a few days later, I’m at the mailbox. “Insufficient funds.” I can’t believe it. What do they think, I’m an idiot or something? I stomp into the house. What about that bank phone number? I’ll call that bank, I’ll get to the bottom of this. What did I do with that number? I must have thrown it out. I start picking through the trash.</p>
        <p><em>13&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Here it is! But the paper is wet and the number is blurred.</p>
        <p><em>14&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Isn’t that strange? I mean, is there a message here? It’s hard not to think of disappearing ink as a message from above. I start getting shampoo commercials in my head again. Oh, dear.</p>
        <p><em>15&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Why am I putting myself through all of this? Why can’t I just admit that I made a mistake? Not just the part about selling my beloved pets to, well, some questionable buyers. But selling them at all. And, anyway, why can’t we breed Cricket? A lot of work, perhaps. But wouldn’t that be an amazing experience?</p>
        <p><em>16&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>I imagine Cricket back in our barn. I imagine brushing her, telling her everything I’ve learned. “Well, Cricket, friendships take work,” I’ll say. “That’s all there is to it.”</p>
        <p><em>17&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>So I call the woman, sound very businesslike. “The check bounced again,” I say calmly. “The deal is off.” Strangely, she doesn’t sound surprised. I get the distinct sense she and her husband have been through this before.</p>
        <p><em>18&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>I call Billy. “Would you be able to go pick up Cricket and Sassy in your horse trailer and bring them back home?” I ask. He says of course. No questions asked. And I think that’s what friends are for. And I say yeah, I’d love to stop over and meet his new donkey.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em>1</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The check bounced. “Insufficient funds,” says the little note attached. Well, I’m sure it’s just a mistake. Probably the people didn’t make a transfer in time or something. “No big deal,” I keep saying to myself, standing at the mailbox.</p>
        <p><em>2</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the check bounced! Isn’t that strange? I mean, is there a message here? The check was payment to us for the sale of Cricket, our ex-horse, and Sassy, our ex-mule. A sale, truth be told, I’ve been regretting. And now the check has bounced. Is it a sign?</p>
        <p><em>3</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; No, of course not. Probably just a clerical error.</p>
        <p><em>4</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, as I take the long walk back home, I get a picture in my head. I imagine that somehow Cricket and Sassy understand that the check bounced, that they understand the legal ramifications of this, that technically the deal is null and void, and in one burst of horse energy they leap over the buyer’s fence and come bounding in slow motion, as if in a shampoo commercial, up our driveway, toward me, kicking and snorting with glee, and I run toward them and we hug and live happily ever after. Together. As it was meant to be.</p>
        <p><em>5</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I get home I snap out of it. No, we did the right thing, selling Cricket and Sassy. They’re in a better place now. Cricket will be a brood mare. A mom!</p>
        <p><em>6</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; And Sassy, her friend, will be at her side. It’s better for them. Better for us. Cricket, a registered American saddlebred, is too much horse for novices like us. And Sassy is too short for an adult to ride. And we have another horse and mule that we do ride. So this really is the best thing for all concerned. And what did I tell myself ? Yes, some friendships are meant to end. That’s it. Never mind that Cricket was our love-horse, the horse that walked up our driveway on our wedding day. And Sassy was our love-mule, the mule that walked up our driveway beside her. They had flowers in their hair. Never mind! Because some friendships are just meant to end. And I am a mature person with a logical head who understands this.</p>
        <p><em>7</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; So I call Cricket and Sassy’s new owners. “The check bounced,” I say.</p>
        <p><em>8</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; “Oh, that’s our stupid bank,” the woman says. Then she gives me her bank’s stupid phone number, should I want to call for proof that her account is in good standing, which I don’t really, but I write the number down anyway. “Just resubmit the check, okay?” she says. I ask her how Cricket and Sassy are doing, and she says, “Great!” Nothing more. I wish she had said more.</p>
        <p><em>9</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Meantime, all this horse thinking gets my mind on Billy. Because not all fading friendships are meant to end. Billy is the neighbor who sold Cricket and Sassy to us. He’s the one who rode Sassy up the driveway on our wedding day, his feet dragging on the ground. Tom, his son, rode Cricket. They’re the ones who put the flowers in their hair. Billy and I used to see each other more. I don’t know why we’ve drifted. There never seems to be a real reason for friendships to fade. Friendships take work. Maybe that’s all there is to it.</p>
        <p><em>10&nbsp;</em>&nbsp; I call Billy just to say hi. He seems happy to hear from me. “We got a donkey!” he says. “She’s so goofy. You’d love her.” I tell him the news about Cricket and Sassy, and when I mention the buyers he seems concerned: “Did you happen to insist on a certified check?”</p>
        <p><em>11&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Oh.</p>
        <p><em>12&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Sure enough, a few days later, I’m at the mailbox. “Insufficient funds.” I can’t believe it. What do they think, I’m an idiot or something? I stomp into the house. What about that bank phone number? I’ll call that bank, I’ll get to the bottom of this. What did I do with that number? I must have thrown it out. I start picking through the trash.</p>
        <p><em>13&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Here it is! But the paper is wet and the number is blurred.</p>
        <p><em>14&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Isn’t that strange? I mean, is there a message here? It’s hard not to think of disappearing ink as a message from above. I start getting shampoo commercials in my head again. Oh, dear.</p>
        <p><em>15&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Why am I putting myself through all of this? Why can’t I just admit that I made a mistake? Not just the part about selling my beloved pets to, well, some questionable buyers. But selling them at all. And, anyway, why can’t we breed Cricket? A lot of work, perhaps.

You’d love her.” I tell him the news about Cricket and Sassy, and when I mention the buyers he seems concerned: “Did you happen to insist on a certified check?”</p>
        <p><em>11&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Oh.</p>
        <p><em>12&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Sure enough, a few days later, I’m at the mailbox. “Insufficient funds.” I can’t believe it. What do they think, I’m an idiot or something? I stomp into the house. What about that bank phone number? I’ll call that bank, I’ll get to the bottom of this. What did I do with that number? I must have thrown it out. I start picking through the trash.</p>
        <p><em>13&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Here it is! But the paper is wet and the number is blurred.</p>
        <p><em>14&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Isn’t that strange? I mean, is there a message here? It’s hard not to think of disappearing ink as a message from above. I start getting shampoo commercials in my head again. Oh, dear.</p>
        <p><em>15&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Why am I putting myself through all of this? Why can’t I just admit that I made a mistake? Not just the part about selling my beloved pets to, well, some questionable buyers. But selling them at all. And, anyway, why can’t we breed Cricket? A lot of work, perhaps. But wouldn’t that be an amazing experience?</p>
        <p><em>16&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>I imagine Cricket back in our barn. I imagine brushing her, telling her everything I’ve learned. “Well, Cricket, friendships take work,” I’ll say. “That’s all there is to it.”</p>
        <p><em>17&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>So I call the woman, sound very businesslike. “The check bounced again,” I say calmly. “The deal is off.” Strangely, she doesn’t sound surprised. I get the distinct sense she and her husband have been through this before.</p>
        <p><em>18&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>I call Billy. “Would you be able to go pick up Cricket and Sassy in your horse trailer and bring them back home?” I ask. He says of course. No questions asked. And I think that’s what friends are for. And I say yeah, I’d love to stop over and meet his new donkey.</p>
