<p>When you’ve finally made the decision to&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">sell your car</span>, attracting a buyer as quickly as possible means the quicker you can help finance your next vehicle or boost your savings.</p>

<p>But what are the key factors to passing on your car keys in the shortest amount of time? How do you make your car stand out in Gumtree’s popular classifieds section?</p>

<p>We decided to find out by talking to a Gumtree user who managed to pique the interest of a buyer for his car in the space of a day.<br>
<br>
<span class="txt-underline"><strong>How to Sell Your Car in 24 Hours</strong></span><br>
Gavin,&nbsp;a 37-year-old&nbsp;from Penrith, NSW, is a regular advertiser on Gumtree, and he spoke to Gumtree about how he sold his 2005&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">Ford Falcon</span>&nbsp;XR8 ute.</p>

<p>The sale was prompted by the birth of a second child, with Gavin and his wife deciding to offload the least practical of their two vehicles (they also own a Mazda 3).</p>

<p>“I’ve sold heaps of stuff through Gumtree, not just cars, and the site is a piece of cake to use,” says Gavin. “It’s also free where some other sites are getting so expensive [to advertise].”</p>

<p>Gavin says the first step was to assess the worth of his Falcon ute by checking&nbsp;similar XR8 models featured on Gumtree to compare vehicle condition and kilometres travelled.</p>

<p>He filled in all the requisite Gumtree ad boxes without going overboard with extra embellishments, though ensuring he had included details such as key vehicle features, when the car was last serviced, and where it was kept when not being driven (garage, carport, etc).</p>

<p>Gavin says it’s also important to be as honest as you can, without necessarily listing a whole range of negatives.</p>

<p>“I wrote ‘Regretful sale’ on the ad as it lets people know you don’t really want to get rid of the car – which was absolutely true. I’d had the XR8 ute for about four years and loved it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;“And I mentioned there had been a slight oil leak from gearbox, which was the only issue I found.”</p>

<p>Gavin also believes using the word ‘Negotiable’ is important when advertising a price for your vehicle.</p>

<p>“I think you need to give people some room to move [on price]. If they’re nice people, I’ll usually look after them with a discount! And I’ve met some wonderful people over the years through Gumtree.”</p>

<p>While words and pricing are important, Gavin also stresses the need to get your vehicle appropriately prepared and photographed.</p>

<p>“I give the car a pressure-wash if it’s particularly dirty, then I give the car a polish, clean up the tyres, and vacuum the interior. I’m fastidious with all my cars and bikes and try to make them look like a million bucks. I’d walk away if looking at a car [for sale] and it wasn’t presented well.</p>

<p>“I take photos using my smartphone, which makes uploading straight to Gumtree simple.</p>

<p>“Just make sure it’s a beautiful day and make sure every angle of the car is photographed. I open up all the doors and take shots of the interior and dash. I took the tonneau cover off the back of the XR8 so I could photograph the tray. And don’t forget images of the engine and wheels.</p>

<p>“The photographs can help show potential buyers that you’ve looked after the car.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t long before several messages of interest were popping up on Gavin’s phone, though it was a more obscure one that led to the sale.</p>

<p>“I had a text asking if I could ring this number… I thought it might be a scam, but he was a genuine guy from Bathurst who had a pre-paid phone plan and had simply run out of credit to make a phone call.</p>

<p>“He was actually looking for a six-cylinder Falcon ute but my [V8-powered] XR8 had caught his eye and he decided he just had to have it!”</p>

<p>Although Gavin paid $7000 when he bought the XR8 ute second-hand himself, he advertised it at $10,000 Negotiable based on his Gumtree research.</p>

<p>It’s clear that Australian-built cars such as the Ford Falcon and Holden Commodore, especially the iconic ute variants, are capable of appreciating in value now that local manufacturing has ended.</p>

<p>And there was further proof when the buyer from Bathurst offered Gavin $9500 in cash after taking the XR8 for a spin. “He loved it,” says Gavin.</p>

<p>“I wrote ‘Regretful sale’ on the ad as it lets people know you don’t really want to get rid of the car – which was absolutely true. I’d had the XR8 ute for about four years and loved it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;“And I mentioned there had been a slight oil leak from gearbox, which was the only issue I found.”</p>

<p>Gavin also believes using the word ‘Negotiable’ is important when advertising a price for your vehicle.</p>

<p>“I think you need to give people some room to move [on price]. If they’re nice people, I’ll usually look after them with a discount! And I’ve met some wonderful people over the years through Gumtree.”</p>

<p>While words and pricing are important, Gavin also stresses the need to get your vehicle appropriately prepared and photographed.</p>

<p>“I give the car a pressure-wash if it’s particularly dirty, then I give the car a polish, clean up the tyres, and vacuum the interior. I’m fastidious with all my cars and bikes and try to make them look like a million bucks. I’d walk away if looking at a car [for sale] and it wasn’t presented well.</p>

<p>“I take photos using my smartphone, which makes uploading straight to Gumtree simple.</p>

<p>“Just make sure it’s a beautiful day and make sure every angle of the car is photographed. I open up all the doors and take shots of the interior and dash. I took the tonneau cover off the back of the XR8 so I could photograph the tray. And don’t forget images of the engine and wheels.</p>

<p>“The photographs can help show potential buyers that you’ve looked after the car.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t long before several messages of interest were popping up on Gavin’s phone, though it was a more obscure one that led to the sale.</p>

<p>“I had a text asking if I could ring this number… I thought it might be a scam, but he was a genuine guy from Bathurst who had a pre-paid phone plan and had simply run out of credit to make a phone call.</p>

<p>“He was actually looking for a six-cylinder Falcon ute but my [V8-powered] XR8 had caught his eye and he decided he just had to have it!”</p>

<p>Although Gavin paid $7000 when he bought the XR8 ute second-hand himself, he advertised it at $10,000 Negotiable based on his Gumtree research.</p>

<p>It’s clear that Australian-built cars such as the Ford Falcon and Holden Commodore, especially the iconic ute variants, are capable of appreciating in value now that local manufacturing has ended.</p>

<p>And there was further proof when the buyer from Bathurst offered Gavin $9500 in cash after taking the XR8 for a spin. “He loved it,” says Gavin.</p>

<p>When you’ve finally made the decision to&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">sell your car</span>, attracting a buyer as quickly as possible means the quicker you can help finance your next vehicle or boost your savings.</p>

<p>But what are the key factors to passing on your car keys in the shortest amount of time? How do you make your car stand out in Gumtree’s popular classifieds section?</p>

<p>We decided to find out by talking to a Gumtree user who managed to pique the interest of a buyer for his car in the space of a day.<br>
<br>
<span class="txt-underline"><strong>How to Sell Your Car in 24 Hours</strong></span><br>
Gavin,&nbsp;a 37-year-old&nbsp;from Penrith, NSW, is a regular advertiser on Gumtree, and he spoke to Gumtree about how he sold his 2005&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">Ford Falcon</span>&nbsp;XR8 ute.</p>

<p>The sale was prompted by the birth of a second child, with Gavin and his wife deciding to offload the least practical of their two vehicles (they also own a Mazda 3).</p>

<p>“I’ve sold heaps of stuff through Gumtree, not just cars, and the site is a piece of cake to use,” says Gavin. “It’s also free where some other sites are getting so expensive [to advertise].”</p>

<p>Gavin says the first step was to assess the worth of his Falcon ute by checking&nbsp;similar XR8 models featured on Gumtree to compare vehicle condition and kilometres travelled.</p>

<p>He filled in all the requisite Gumtree ad boxes without going overboard with extra embellishments, though ensuring he had included details such as key vehicle features, when the car was last serviced, and where it was kept when not being driven (garage, carport, etc).</p>

<p>Gavin says it’s also important to be as honest as you can, without necessarily listing a whole range of negatives.</p>

<p>“I wrote ‘Regretful sale’ on the ad as it lets people know you don’t really want to get rid of the car – which was absolutely true. I’d had the XR8 ute for about four years and loved it.</p>

<p>When you’ve finally made the decision to&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">sell your car</span>, attracting a buyer as quickly as possible means the quicker you can help finance your next vehicle or boost your savings.</p>

<p>But what are the key factors to passing on your car keys in the shortest amount of time? How do you make your car stand out in Gumtree’s popular classifieds section?</p>

<p>We decided to find out by talking to a Gumtree user who managed to pique the interest of a buyer for his car in the space of a day.<br>
<br>
<span class="txt-underline"><strong>How to Sell Your Car in 24 Hours</strong></span><br>
Gavin,&nbsp;a 37-year-old&nbsp;from Penrith, NSW, is a regular advertiser on Gumtree, and he spoke to Gumtree about how he sold his 2005&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">Ford Falcon</span>&nbsp;XR8 ute.</p>

<p>The sale was prompted by the birth of a second child, with Gavin and his wife deciding to offload the least practical of their two vehicles (they also own a Mazda 3).</p>

<p>“I’ve sold heaps of stuff through Gumtree, not just cars, and the site is a piece of cake to use,” says Gavin. “It’s also free where some other sites are getting so expensive [to advertise].”</p>

<p>Gavin says the first step was to assess the worth of his Falcon ute by checking&nbsp;similar XR8 models featured on Gumtree to compare vehicle condition and kilometres travelled.</p>

<p>He filled in all the requisite Gumtree ad boxes without going overboard with extra embellishments, though ensuring he had included details such as key vehicle features, when the car was last serviced, and where it was kept when not being driven (garage, carport, etc).</p>

<p>Gavin says it’s also important to be as honest as you can, without necessarily listing a whole range of negatives.</p>

<p>“I wrote ‘Regretful sale’ on the ad as it lets people know you don’t really want to get rid of the car – which was absolutely true. I’d had the XR8 ute for about four years and loved it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;“And I mentioned there had been a slight oil leak from gearbox, which was the only issue I found.”</p>

<p>Gavin also believes using the word ‘Negotiable’ is important when advertising a price for your vehicle.</p>

<p>“I think you need to give people some room to move [on price]. If they’re nice people, I’ll usually look after them with a discount! And I’ve met some wonderful people over the years through Gumtree.”</p>

<p>While words and pricing are important, Gavin also stresses the need to get your vehicle appropriately prepared and photographed.</p>

<p>“I give the car a pressure-wash if it’s particularly dirty, then I give the car a polish, clean up the tyres, and vacuum the interior. I’m fastidious with all my cars and bikes and try to make them look like a million bucks. I’d walk away if looking at a car [for sale] and it wasn’t presented well.</p>

<p>“I take photos using my smartphone, which makes uploading straight to Gumtree simple.</p>

<p>“Just make sure it’s a beautiful day and make sure every angle of the car is photographed. I open up all the doors and take shots of the interior and dash. I took the tonneau cover off the back of the XR8 so I could photograph the tray. And don’t forget images of the engine and wheels.</p>

<p>“The photographs can help show potential buyers that you’ve looked after the car.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t long before several messages of interest were popping up on Gavin’s phone, though it was a more obscure one that led to the sale.</p>

<p>“I had a text asking if I could ring this number… I thought it might be a scam, but he was a genuine guy from Bathurst who had a pre-paid phone plan and had simply run out of credit to make a phone call.</p>

<p>“He was actually looking for a six-cylinder Falcon ute but my [V8-powered] XR8 had caught his eye and he decided he just had to have it!”</p>

<p>Although Gavin paid $7000 when he bought the XR8 ute second-hand himself, he advertised it at $10,000 Negotiable based on his Gumtree research.</p>

<p>It’s clear that Australian-built cars such as the Ford Falcon and Holden Commodore, especially the iconic ute variants, are capable of appreciating in value now that local manufacturing has ended.</p>

<p>And there was further proof when the buyer from Bathurst offered Gavin $9500 in cash after taking the XR8 for a spin. “He loved it,” says Gavin.</p>

<p>When you’ve finally made the decision to&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">sell your car</span>, attracting a buyer as quickly as possible means the quicker you can help finance your next vehicle or boost your savings.</p>

<p>But what are the key factors to passing on your car keys in the shortest amount of time? How do you make your car stand out in Gumtree’s popular classifieds section?</p>

<p>We decided to find out by talking to a Gumtree user who managed to pique the interest of a buyer for his car in the space of a day.<br>
<br>
<span class="txt-underline"><strong>How to Sell Your Car in 24 Hours</strong></span><br>
Gavin,&nbsp;a 37-year-old&nbsp;from Penrith, NSW, is a regular advertiser on Gumtree, and he spoke to Gumtree about how he sold his 2005&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">Ford Falcon</span>&nbsp;XR8 ute.</p>

<p>The sale was prompted by the birth of a second child, with Gavin and his wife deciding to offload the least practical of their two vehicles (they also own a Mazda 3).</p>

<p>“I’ve sold heaps of stuff through Gumtree, not just cars, and the site is a piece of cake to use,” says Gavin. “It’s also free where some other sites are getting so expensive [to advertise].”</p>

<p>Gavin says the first step was to assess the worth of his Falcon ute by checking&nbsp;similar XR8 models featured on Gumtree to compare vehicle condition and kilometres travelled.</p>

<p>He filled in all the requisite Gumtree ad boxes without going overboard with extra embellishments, though ensuring he had included details such as key vehicle features, when the car was last serviced, and where it was kept when not being driven (garage, carport, etc).</p>

<p>Gavin says it’s also important to be as honest as you can, without necessarily listing a whole range of negatives.</p>

<p>“I wrote ‘Regretful sale’ on the ad as it lets people know you don’t really want to get rid of the car – which was absolutely true. I’d had the XR8 ute for about four years and loved it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;“And I mentioned there had been a slight oil leak from gearbox, which was the only issue I found.”</p>

<p>Gavin also believes using the word ‘Negotiable’ is important when advertising a price for your vehicle.</p>

<p>“I think you need to give people some room to move [on price]. If they’re nice people, I’ll usually look after them with a discount! And I’ve met some wonderful people over the years through Gumtree.”</p>

<p>While words and pricing are important, Gavin also stresses the need to get your vehicle appropriately prepared and photographed.</p>

<p>“I give the car a pressure-wash if it’s particularly dirty, then I give the car a polish, clean up the tyres, and vacuum the interior. I’m fastidious with all my cars and bikes and try to make them look like a million bucks. I’d walk away if looking at a car [for sale] and it wasn’t presented well.</p>

<p>“I take photos using my smartphone, which makes uploading straight to Gumtree simple.</p>

<p>“Just make sure it’s a beautiful day and make sure every angle of the car is photographed. I open up all the doors and take shots of the interior and dash. I took the tonneau cover off the back of the XR8 so I could photograph the tray. And don’t forget images of the engine and wheels.</p>

<p>“The photographs can help show potential buyers that you’ve looked after the car.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t long before several messages of interest were popping up on Gavin’s phone, though it was a more obscure one that led to the sale.</p>

<p>“I had a text asking if I could ring this number… I thought it might be a scam, but he was a genuine guy from Bathurst who had a pre-paid phone plan and had simply run out of credit to make a phone call.</p>

<p>“He was actually looking for a six-cylinder Falcon ute but my [V8-powered] XR8 had caught his eye and he decided he just had to have it!”</p>

<p>Although Gavin paid $7000 when he bought the XR8 ute second-hand himself, he advertised it at $10,000 Negotiable based on his Gumtree research.</p>

<p>It’s clear that Australian-built cars such as the Ford Falcon and Holden Commodore, especially the iconic ute variants, are capable of appreciating in value now that local manufacturing has ended.</p>

<p>And there was further proof when the buyer from Bathurst offered Gavin $9500 in cash after taking the XR8 for a spin. “He loved it,” says Gavin.</p>

<p><strong>How to Sell Your Car in 24 Hour&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>https://blog.gumtree.com.au/how-to-sell-your-car-in-24-hours</em><br>
<em>September 27, 2018&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cars &amp; Autos&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 Comments</em></p>

<p>When you’ve finally made the decision to&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">sell your car</span>, attracting a buyer as quickly as possible means the quicker you can help finance your next vehicle or boost your savings.</p>

<p>But what are the key factors to passing on your car keys in the shortest amount of time? How do you make your car stand out in Gumtree’s popular classifieds section?</p>

<p>We decided to find out by talking to a Gumtree user who managed to pique the interest of a buyer for his car in the space of a day.<br>
<br>
<span class="txt-underline"><strong>How to Sell Your Car in 24 Hours</strong></span><br>
Gavin,&nbsp;a 37-year-old&nbsp;from Penrith, NSW, is a regular advertiser on Gumtree, and he spoke to Gumtree about how he sold his 2005&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">Ford Falcon</span>&nbsp;XR8 ute.</p>

<p>The sale was prompted by the birth of a second child, with Gavin and his wife deciding to offload the least practical of their two vehicles (they also own a Mazda 3).</p>

<p>“I’ve sold heaps of stuff through Gumtree, not just cars, and the site is a piece of cake to use,” says Gavin. “It’s also free where some other sites are getting so expensive [to advertise].”</p>

<p>Gavin says the first step was to assess the worth of his Falcon ute by checking&nbsp;similar XR8 models featured on Gumtree to compare vehicle condition and kilometres travelled.</p>

<p>He filled in all the requisite Gumtree ad boxes without going overboard with extra embellishments, though ensuring he had included details such as key vehicle features, when the car was last serviced, and where it was kept when not being driven (garage, carport, etc).</p>

<p>Gavin says it’s also important to be as honest as you can, without necessarily listing a whole range of negatives.</p>

<p>“I wrote ‘Regretful sale’ on the ad as it lets people know you don’t really want to get rid of the car – which was absolutely true. I’d had the XR8 ute for about four years and loved it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;“And I mentioned there had been a slight oil leak from gearbox, which was the only issue I found.”</p>

<p>Gavin also believes using the word ‘Negotiable’ is important when advertising a price for your vehicle.</p>

<p>“I think you need to give people some room to move [on price]. If they’re nice people, I’ll usually look after them with a discount! And I’ve met some wonderful people over the years through Gumtree.”</p>

<p>While words and pricing are important, Gavin also stresses the need to get your vehicle appropriately prepared and photographed.</p>

<p>“I give the car a pressure-wash if it’s particularly dirty, then I give the car a polish, clean up the tyres, and vacuum the interior. I’m fastidious with all my cars and bikes and try to make them look like a million bucks. I’d walk away if looking at a car [for sale] and it wasn’t presented well.</p>

<p>“I take photos using my smartphone, which makes uploading straight to Gumtree simple.</p>

<p>“Just make sure it’s a beautiful day and make sure every angle of the car is photographed. I open up all the doors and take shots of the interior and dash. I took the tonneau cover off the back of the XR8 so I could photograph the tray. And don’t forget images of the engine and wheels.</p>

<p>“The photographs can help show potential buyers that you’ve looked after the car.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t long before several messages of interest were popping up on Gavin’s phone, though it was a more obscure one that led to the sale.</p>

<p>“I had a text asking if I could ring this number… I thought it might be a scam, but he was a genuine guy from Bathurst who had a pre-paid phone plan and had simply run out of credit to make a phone call.</p>

<p>“He was actually looking for a six-cylinder Falcon ute but my [V8-powered] XR8 had caught his eye and he decided he just had to have it!”</p>

<p>Although Gavin paid $7000 when he bought the XR8 ute second-hand himself, he advertised it at $10,000 Negotiable based on his Gumtree research.</p>

<p>It’s clear that Australian-built cars such as the Ford Falcon and Holden Commodore, especially the iconic ute variants, are capable of appreciating in value now that local manufacturing has ended.</p>

<p>And there was further proof when the buyer from Bathurst offered Gavin $9500 in cash after taking the XR8 for a spin. “He loved it,” says Gavin.</p>

        <p><strong>Using Sentences and Paragrap<br>
<br>
<span class="txt-underline">Sentences</span></strong><br>
We are going to look at how we construct well-written sentences.</p>
        <p>We can say that a sentence is a group of words expressing a complete thought.</p>
        <p>Let’s look at the following example.</p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Johnny smiled.</em>
        </p>
        <p>Is that a full sentence? A properly constructed sentence?</p>
        <p>You may be surprised but it actually is. Firstly it is a complete thought. ‘Johnny smiled.’ It’s a complete idea. It makes sense. Secondly we know who or what did what. That’s all you need for a sentence. A subject (Johnny) and a verb, (smiled).</p>
        <p>But usually what we want to say is more complicated than that. So we may write&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Johnny smiled at the new student.</em>
        </p>
        <p>So now we have added a phrase to give more information. But this is still a SIMPLE SENTENCE because it’s one idea, one action. We call it a single CLAUSE. So let’s add more on.</p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Johnny smiled at the new student because she looked lonely.</em>
        </p>
        <p>So now we know, not only know what Johnny did, but how the girl looked. This is now a COMPLEX SENTENCE. But it is still one idea because it explains why Johnny did something. Now we have two clauses</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Johnny smiled at the new student / because she looked lonely.</em></p>
        <p>Here are two clauses in the one sentence. Each clause has its own VERB – ‘smiled’ … <em>and … ‘looked’.</em></p>
        <p>The CONJUNCTION, ‘because’ links the two sentences together and explains the relationship between the two parts.</p>
        <p>But we still want to add more information.</p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Johnny smiled at the new student because she looked lonely, and he knew from experience how stressful starting a new school could be.</em>
        </p>
        <p>Now we have four clauses in the one sentences, each with its own verb</p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Johnny smiled at the new student / because she looked lonely, /and he knew from experience / how stressful starting a new school could be.</em>
        </p>
        <p>In a COMPLEX SENTENCE, one clause will be the MAIN CLAUSE and the other three clauses will be the SUBORDINATE CLAUSES. The subordinate clauses don’t make sense on their own – they are linked to the main clause.</p>
        <p>Remember when you are writing your own sentences not to have more than three or four subordinate clauses because your sentence will most likely become clumsy and confusing.</p>
        <p>Now within each clause you might find a PHRASE or two. There is one in the main clause</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Johnny smiled <span class="txt-underline">at the new student</span>.</em></p>
        <p>A phrase consists of a preposition (at) and a noun group (the new student). This is an adverbial phrase because it tells us more about the verb, ‘smiled’.</p>
        <p>The second phrase in the sentence has a preposition ‘from’ and a noun, ‘experience’ to make up the phrase</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>and he knew <span class="txt-underline">from experience</span></em></p>
        <p>The other most common phrase is the ADJECTIVAL PHRASE which describes one of the nouns in the sentence. Let’s say we added the following words to the main clause</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Johnny smiled at the new student <span class="txt-underline">with the bright orange hair</span> ….</em></p>
        <p>‘with the bright orange hair’ is an adjectival phrase because it describes the noun ‘student’</p>
        <p>Now, last thing before we finish …..</p>
        <p>A simple sentence or a clause must have a SUBJECT and a VERB, but it may, or may not have an OBJECT. Consider the following sentence.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>The excited young boy kicked the brightly coloured ball.</em></p>
        <p>‘The excited young boy’ is the SUBJECT and ‘kicked’ is the VERB. The OBJECT is ‘the brightly coloured ball’.</p>
        <p>The subject and the object will be made up of a noun or noun group, or a pronoun. A ‘NOUN GROUP’ is a noun with the adjectives and articles attached to it.</p>
        <p>To identify the subject and object, do the following. Find the verb e.g. ‘Kicked’. Then ask and answer the following question</p>
        <p><span class="txt-underline">WHO, or WHAT</span>&nbsp; (Subject) …..&nbsp; <span class="txt-underline">KICKED</span> (verb) …..&nbsp; <span class="txt-underline">WHO, or WHAT</span>?&nbsp;&nbsp; (Object)</p>
        <p>So the SUBJECT is ‘The excited young boy’ and the OBJECT is ‘the brightly coloured ball.</p>
        <p>Ok, that’s more than enough for one day!</p>
        <p>By now you should be able to identify, understand and write examples of these parts of a sentence:</p>
        <p>simple sentence; complex sentence; main clause; subordinate clause; subject; object; verb; adjectival phrase; adverbial phrase; noun group.</p>
        <p>You may need to reread the above explanation a number of times before you remember it all.</p>

        <p><strong>Using Sentences and Paragrap<br>
<br>
<span class="txt-underline">Sentences</span></strong><br>
We are going to look at how we construct well-written sentences.</p>
        <p>We can say that a sentence is a group of words expressing a complete thought.</p>
        <p>Let’s look at the following example.</p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Johnny smiled.</em>
        </p>
        <p>Is that a full sentence? A properly constructed sentence?</p>
        <p>You may be surprised but it actually is. Firstly it is a complete thought. ‘Johnny smiled.’ It’s a complete idea. It makes sense. Secondly we know who or what did what. That’s all you need for a sentence. A subject (Johnny) and a verb, (smiled).</p>
        <p>But usually what we want to say is more complicated than that. So we may write&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Johnny smiled at the new student.</em>
        </p>
        <p>So now we have added a phrase to give more information. But this is still a SIMPLE SENTENCE because it’s one idea, one action. We call it a single CLAUSE. So let’s add more on.</p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Johnny smiled at the new student because she looked lonely.</em>
        </p>
        <p>So now we know, not only know what Johnny did, but how the girl looked. This is now a COMPLEX SENTENCE. But it is still one idea because it explains why Johnny did something. Now we have two clauses</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Johnny smiled at the new student / because she looked lonely.</em></p>
        <p>Here are two clauses in the one sentence. Each clause has its own VERB – ‘smiled’ … <em>and … ‘looked’.</em></p>
        <p>The CONJUNCTION, ‘because’ links the two sentences together and explains the relationship between the two parts.</p>
        <p>But we still want to add more information.</p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Johnny smiled at the new student because she looked lonely, and he knew from experience how stressful starting a new school could be.</em>
        </p>
        <p>Now we have four clauses in the one sentences, each with its own verb</p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Johnny smiled at the new student / because she looked lonely, /and he knew from experience / how stressful starting a new school could be.</em>
        </p>
        <p>In a COMPLEX SENTENCE, one clause will be the MAIN CLAUSE and the other three clauses will be the SUBORDINATE CLAUSES. The subordinate clauses don’t make sense on their own – they are linked to the main clause.</p>
        <p>Remember when you are writing your own sentences not to have more than three or four subordinate clauses because your sentence will most likely become clumsy and confusing.</p>
        <p>Now within each clause you might find a PHRASE or two. There is one in the main clause</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Johnny smiled <span class="txt-underline">at the new student</span>.</em></p>
        <p>A phrase consists of a preposition (at) and a noun group (the new student). This is an adverbial phrase because it tells us more about the verb, ‘smiled’.</p>
        <p>The second phrase in the sentence has a preposition ‘from’ and a noun, ‘experience’ to make up the phrase</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>and he knew <span class="txt-underline">from experience</span></em></p>
        <p>The other most common phrase is the ADJECTIVAL PHRASE which describes one of the nouns in the sentence. Let’s say we added the following words to the main clause</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Johnny smiled at the new student <span class="txt-underline">with the bright orange hair</span> ….</em></p>
        <p>‘with the bright orange hair’ is an adjectival phrase because it describes the noun ‘student’</p>
        <p>Now, last thing before we finish …..</p>
        <p>A simple sentence or a clause must have a SUBJECT and a VERB, but it may, or may not have an OBJECT. Consider the following sentence.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>The excited young boy kicked the brightly coloured ball.</em></p>
        <p>‘The excited young boy’ is the SUBJECT and ‘kicked’ is the VERB. The OBJECT is ‘the brightly coloured ball’.</p>
        <p>The subject and the object will be made up of a noun or noun group, or a pronoun. A ‘NOUN GROUP’ is a noun with the adjectives and articles attached to it.</p>
        <p>To identify the subject and object, do the following. Find the verb e.g. ‘Kicked’. Then ask and answer the following question</p>
        <p><span class="txt-underline">WHO, or WHAT</span>&nbsp; (Subject) …..&nbsp; <span class="txt-underline">KICKED</span> (verb) …..&nbsp; <span class="txt-underline">WHO, or WHAT</span>?&nbsp;&nbsp; (Object)</p>
        <p>So the SUBJECT is ‘The excited young boy’ and the OBJECT is ‘the brightly coloured ball.</p>
        <p>Ok, that’s more than enough for one day!</p>
        <p>By now you should be able to identify, understand and write examples of these parts of a sentence:</p>
        <p>simple sentence; complex sentence; main clause; subordinate clause; subject; object; verb; adjectival phrase; adverbial phrase; noun group.</p>
        <p>You may need to reread the above explanation a number of times before you remember it all.</p>

        <p><strong>Using Sentences and Paragrap<br>
<br>
<span class="txt-underline">Sentences</span></strong><br>
We are going to look at how we construct well-written sentences.</p>
        <p>We can say that a sentence is a group of words expressing a complete thought.</p>
        <p>Let’s look at the following example.</p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Johnny smiled.</em>
        </p>
        <p>Is that a full sentence? A properly constructed sentence?</p>
        <p>You may be surprised but it actually is. Firstly it is a complete thought. ‘Johnny smiled.’ It’s a complete idea. It makes sense. Secondly we know who or what did what. That’s all you need for a sentence. A subject (Johnny) and a verb, (smiled).</p>
        <p>But usually what we want to say is more complicated than that. So we may write&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Johnny smiled at the new student.</em>
        </p>
        <p>So now we have added a phrase to give more information. But this is still a SIMPLE SENTENCE because it’s one idea, one action. We call it a single CLAUSE. So let’s add more on.</p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Johnny smiled at the new student because she looked lonely.</em>
        </p>
        <p>So now we know, not only know what Johnny did, but how the girl looked. This is now a COMPLEX SENTENCE. But it is still one idea because it explains why Johnny did something. Now we have two clauses</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Johnny smiled at the new student / because she looked lonely.</em></p>
        <p>Here are two clauses in the one sentence. Each clause has its own VERB – ‘smiled’ … <em>and … ‘looked’.</em></p>
        <p>The CONJUNCTION, ‘because’ links the two sentences together and explains the relationship between the two parts.</p>
        <p>But we still want to add more information.</p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Johnny smiled at the new student because she looked lonely, and he knew from experience how stressful starting a new school could be.</em>
        </p>
        <p>Now we have four clauses in the one sentences, each with its own verb</p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Johnny smiled at the new student / because she looked lonely, /and he knew from experience / how stressful starting a new school could be.</em>
        </p>
        <p>In a COMPLEX SENTENCE, one clause will be the MAIN CLAUSE and the other three clauses will be the SUBORDINATE CLAUSES. The subordinate clauses don’t make sense on their own – they are linked to the main clause.</p>
        <p>Remember when you are writing your own sentences not to have more than three or four subordinate clauses because your sentence will most likely become clumsy and confusing.</p>
        <p>Now within each clause you might find a PHRASE or two. There is one in the main clause</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Johnny smiled <span class="txt-underline">at the new student</span>.</em></p>
        <p>A phrase consists of a preposition (at) and a noun group (the new student). This is an adverbial phrase because it tells us more about the verb, ‘smiled’.</p>
        <p>The second phrase in the sentence has a preposition ‘from’ and a noun, ‘experience’ to make up the phrase</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>and he knew <span class="txt-underline">from experience</span></em></p>
        <p>The other most common phrase is the ADJECTIVAL PHRASE which describes one of the nouns in the sentence. Let’s say we added the following words to the main clause</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Johnny smiled at the new student <span class="txt-underline">with the bright orange hair</span> ….</em></p>
        <p>‘with the bright orange hair’ is an adjectival phrase because it describes the noun ‘student’</p>
        <p>Now, last thing before we finish …..</p>
        <p>A simple sentence or a clause must have a SUBJECT and a VERB, but it may, or may not have an OBJECT. Consider the following sentence.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>The excited young boy kicked the brightly coloured ball.</em></p>
        <p>‘The excited young boy’ is the SUBJECT and ‘kicked’ is the VERB. The OBJECT is ‘the brightly coloured ball’.</p>
        <p>The subject and the object will be made up of a noun or noun group, or a pronoun. A ‘NOUN GROUP’ is a noun with the adjectives and articles attached to it.</p>
        <p>To identify the subject and object, do the following. Find the verb e.g. ‘Kicked’. Then ask and answer the following question</p>
        <p><span class="txt-underline">WHO, or WHAT</span>&nbsp; (Subject) …..&nbsp; <span class="txt-underline">KICKED</span> (verb) …..&nbsp; <span class="txt-underline">WHO, or WHAT</span>?&nbsp;&nbsp; (Object)</p>
        <p>So the SUBJECT is ‘The excited young boy’ and the OBJECT is ‘the brightly coloured ball.</p>
        <p>Ok, that’s more than enough for one day!</p>
        <p>By now you should be able to identify, understand and write examples of these parts of a sentence:</p>
        <p>simple sentence; complex sentence; main clause; subordinate clause; subject; object; verb; adjectival phrase; adverbial phrase; noun group.</p>
        <p>You may need to reread the above explanation a number of times before you remember it all.</p>
