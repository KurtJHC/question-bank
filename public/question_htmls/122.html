          <strong>A Tired Tale</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Come on, sleepyhead. It is 7:30 and time to get up and get ready for school,” Mama Bear said as she gently shook her slumbering son.</p>
        <p>“Aw, Mom, do I have to?” questioned Buster the Bear in a groggy voice. “Can’t I sleep just ten more minutes?”</p>
        <p>“Your ten minutes more have a strange way of becoming half an hour,” replied Mama Bear. “Now get out of bed and shake a leg or you’ll be late.’’</p>
        <p>Buster dragged himself out of bed and grumbled all the way to the bathroom. It was not that Buster didn’t want to go to school. He liked his teacher, Mrs. Honeycomb, and his best friend Billy was in his class. Buster just liked to sleep. No, he didn’t like to sleep, he LOVED to sleep! While the other bears excelled at things like fishing, wrestling, and climbing, Buster was a champion dozer! “I wish I could sleep all the time,” he muttered.</p>
        <p>Mama Bear overheard and cautioned, “Now, you don’t mean that, Buster. You can’t sleep all the time. You’d miss out on everything.”</p>
        <p>“Well, maybe not all the time, but I wouldn’t miss much if I could sleep twice as much. And you know sleep is important,” argued Buster.</p>
        <p>“Yes, sleep is good for you, but only when appropriate. You can have too much of a good thing,” answered Mama Bear. She could tell her cub was still not convinced; but she gave him a big bear hug and a kiss and sent him off on his way. Later that evening, after Buster had gone to bed, Mama Bear described the morning’s events to Papa Bear. “We need to take care of this problem right away. If sleep is what he wants then that is what he’ll get,” declared Papa Bear. “Tomorrow let him sleep in as late as he wants and whenever he wants during the day. He should soon see what he’s missing.”</p>
        <p>The next morning 7:30 came and went as Buster slumbered on. At 10:30 Buster awoke, looked at the clock and called out, “Mama, Mama, I’ve overslept! You didn’t wake me up.”</p>
        <p>“That’s right,” replied Mama Bear. “I’m letting you get the sleep you wanted just like you asked. Are you ready to go to school now?”</p>
        <p>“Cool!” exclaimed Buster. “I’ll be ready in two blinks of a bear’s eye.”</p>
        <p>As Buster slid into his seat in class, Billy turned to him and whispered excitedly, “Boy did you miss out on all the action this morning!”</p>
        <p>“What happened?” questioned Buster.</p>
        <p>“The KAVE Newschopper landed on the playground this morning and a bunch of us got to take a ride in the helicopter. It was awesome! I wish you could have been here,” said Billy.</p>
        <p>“So do I,” muttered Buster under his breath. After school Buster and his friends went to the park to play. While the other cubs were playing tag, Buster sat down under a tree and started to nap. Hearing a loud commotion, Buster opened his eyes to see what was going on.</p>
        <p>“Did you see him? Did you see him?” shouted Billy. “Wow! I can’t believe Justin Timbearlake was here at our park and I got his autograph. Isn’t that great?”</p>
        <p>“Yeah, great,” grumbled Buster. “I can’t believe I slept through it.”</p>
        <p>That night after dinner Buster and his father sat down to watch their favorite team play baseball. Barely into the 7th inning, Buster had begun to doze off on the couch. He was jolted awake when Papa Bear jumped up from the couch cheering.</p>
        <p>“Hooray!” he yelled. “Fantastic! A once in a lifetime experience!”</p>
        <p>“What happened? What happened?” begged Buster.</p>
        <p>“Your favorite player, Beary Bonds just hit a world record 800th home run. That will never happen again.”</p>
        <p>Suddenly Buster burst out crying.</p>
        <p>“What’s the matter, son?” asked Papa Bear.</p>
        <p>“I’ve missed everything great today just because I was sleeping,” wailed Buster. “Mom was right. I’m never going to sleep again.”</p>
        <p>“Now, now son,” comforted Papa Bear “You still need some sleep, but only the right amount at the right time.”</p>
        <p>After that Buster the Bear slept when he should and played when he should for he had learned a valuable lesson –</p>

          <strong>A Tired Tale</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Come on, sleepyhead. It is 7:30 and time to get up and get ready for school,” Mama Bear said as she gently shook her slumbering son.</p>
        <p>“Aw, Mom, do I have to?” questioned Buster the Bear in a groggy voice. “Can’t I sleep just ten more minutes?”</p>
        <p>“Your ten minutes more have a strange way of becoming half an hour,” replied Mama Bear. “Now get out of bed and shake a leg or you’ll be late.’’</p>
        <p>Buster dragged himself out of bed and grumbled all the way to the bathroom. It was not that Buster didn’t want to go to school. He liked his teacher, Mrs. Honeycomb, and his best friend Billy was in his class. Buster just liked to sleep. No, he didn’t like to sleep, he LOVED to sleep! While the other bears excelled at things like fishing, wrestling, and climbing, Buster was a champion dozer! “I wish I could sleep all the time,” he muttered.</p>
        <p>Mama Bear overheard and cautioned, “Now, you don’t mean that, Buster. You can’t sleep all the time. You’d miss out on everything.”</p>
        <p>“Well, maybe not all the time, but I wouldn’t miss much if I could sleep twice as much. And you know sleep is important,” argued Buster.</p>
        <p>“Yes, sleep is good for you, but only when appropriate. You can have too much of a good thing,” answered Mama Bear. She could tell her cub was still not convinced; but she gave him a big bear hug and a kiss and sent him off on his way. Later that evening, after Buster had gone to bed, Mama Bear described the morning’s events to Papa Bear. “We need to take care of this problem right away. If sleep is what he wants then that is what he’ll get,” declared Papa Bear. “Tomorrow let him sleep in as late as he wants and whenever he wants during the day. He should soon see what he’s missing.”</p>
        <p>The next morning 7:30 came and went as Buster slumbered on. At 10:30 Buster awoke, looked at the clock and called out, “Mama, Mama, I’ve overslept! You didn’t wake me up.”</p>
        <p>“That’s right,” replied Mama Bear. “I’m letting you get the sleep you wanted just like you asked. Are you ready to go to school now?”</p>
        <p>“Cool!” exclaimed Buster. “I’ll be ready in two blinks of a bear’s eye.”</p>
        <p>As Buster slid into his seat in class, Billy turned to him and whispered excitedly, “Boy did you miss out on all the action this morning!”</p>
        <p>“What happened?” questioned Buster.</p>
        <p>“The KAVE Newschopper landed on the playground this morning and a bunch of us got to take a ride in the helicopter. It was awesome! I wish you could have been here,” said Billy.</p>
        <p>“So do I,” muttered Buster under his breath. After school Buster and his friends went to the park to play. While the other cubs were playing tag, Buster sat down under a tree and started to nap. Hearing a loud commotion, Buster opened his eyes to see what was going on.</p>
        <p>“Did you see him? Did you see him?” shouted Billy. “Wow! I can’t believe Justin Timbearlake was here at our park and I got his autograph. Isn’t that great?”</p>
        <p>“Yeah, great,” grumbled Buster. “I can’t believe I slept through it.”</p>
        <p>That night after dinner Buster and his father sat down to watch their favorite team play baseball. Barely into the 7th inning, Buster had begun to doze off on the couch. He was jolted awake when Papa Bear jumped up from the couch cheering.</p>
        <p>“Hooray!” he yelled. “Fantastic! A once in a lifetime experience!”</p>
        <p>“What happened? What happened?” begged Buster.</p>
        <p>“Your favorite player, Beary Bonds just hit a world record 800th home run. That will never happen again.”</p>
        <p>Suddenly Buster burst out crying.</p>
        <p>“What’s the matter, son?” asked Papa Bear.</p>
        <p>“I’ve missed everything great today just because I was sleeping,” wailed Buster. “Mom was right. I’m never going to sleep again.”</p>
        <p>“Now, now son,” comforted Papa Bear “You still need some sleep, but only the right amount at the right time.”</p>
        <p>After that Buster the Bear slept when he should and played when he should for he had learned a valuable lesson –</p>

        <p>“Yes, sleep is good for you, but only when appropriate. You can have too much of a good thing,” answered Mama Bear. She could tell her cub was still not convinced; but she gave him a big bear hug and a kiss and sent him off on his way. Later that evening, after Buster had gone to bed, Mama Bear described the morning’s events to Papa Bear. “We need to take care of this problem right away. If sleep is what he wants then that is what he’ll get,” declared Papa Bear. “Tomorrow let him sleep in as late as he wants and whenever he wants during the day. He should soon see what he’s missing.”</p>
        <p>The next morning 7:30 came and went as Buster slumbered on. At 10:30 Buster awoke, looked at the clock and called out, “Mama, Mama, I’ve overslept! You didn’t wake me up.”</p>
        <p>“That’s right,” replied Mama Bear. “I’m letting you get the sleep you wanted just like you asked. Are you ready to go to school now?”</p>
        <p>“Cool!” exclaimed Buster. “I’ll be ready in two blinks of a bear’s eye.”</p>
        <p>As Buster slid into his seat in class, Billy turned to him and whispered excitedly, “Boy did you miss out on all the action this morning!”</p>
        <p>“What happened?” questioned Buster.</p>
        <p>“The KAVE Newschopper landed on the playground this morning and a bunch of us got to take a ride in the helicopter. It was awesome! I wish you could have been here,” said Billy.</p>
        <p>“So do I,” muttered Buster under his breath. After school Buster and his friends went to the park to play. While the other cubs were playing tag, Buster sat down under a tree and started to nap. Hearing a loud commotion, Buster opened his eyes to see what was going on.</p>
        <p>“Did you see him? Did you see him?” shouted Billy. “Wow! I can’t believe Justin Timbearlake was here at our park and I got his autograph. Isn’t that great?”</p>
        <p>“Yeah, great,” grumbled Buster. “I can’t believe I slept through it.”</p>
        <p>That night after dinner Buster and his father sat down to watch their favorite team play baseball. Barely into the 7th inning, Buster had begun to doze off on the couch. He was jolted awake when Papa Bear jumped up from the couch cheering.</p>
        <p>“Hooray!” he yelled. “Fantastic! A once in a lifetime experience!”</p>
        <p>“What happened? What happened?” begged Buster.</p>
        <p>“Your favorite player, Beary Bonds just hit a world record 800th home run. That will never happen again.”</p>
        <p>Suddenly Buster burst out crying.</p>
        <p>“What’s the matter, son?” asked Papa Bear.</p>
        <p>“I’ve missed everything great today just because I was sleeping,” wailed Buster. “Mom was right. I’m never going to sleep again.”</p>
        <p>“Now, now son,” comforted Papa Bear “You still need some sleep, but only the right amount at the right time.”</p>
        <p>After that Buster the Bear slept when he should and played when he should for he had learned a valuable lesson –</p>

          <strong>A Tired Tale</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Come on, sleepyhead. It is 7:30 and time to get up and get ready for school,” Mama Bear said as she gently shook her slumbering son.</p>
        <p>“Aw, Mom, do I have to?” questioned Buster the Bear in a groggy voice. “Can’t I sleep just ten more minutes?”</p>
        <p>“Your ten minutes more have a strange way of becoming half an hour,” replied Mama Bear. “Now get out of bed and shake a leg or you’ll be late.’’</p>
        <p>Buster dragged himself out of bed and grumbled all the way to the bathroom. It was not that Buster didn’t want to go to school. He liked his teacher, Mrs. Honeycomb, and his best friend Billy was in his class. Buster just liked to sleep. No, he didn’t like to sleep, he LOVED to sleep! While the other bears excelled at things like fishing, wrestling, and climbing, Buster was a champion dozer! “I wish I could sleep all the time,” he muttered.</p>
        <p>Mama Bear overheard and cautioned, “Now, you don’t mean that, Buster. You can’t sleep all the time. You’d miss out on everything.”</p>

        <p>“Hooray!” he yelled. “Fantastic! A once in a lifetime experience!”</p>
        <p>“What happened? What happened?” begged Buster.</p>
        <p>“Your favorite player, Beary Bonds just hit a world record 800th home run. That will never happen again.”</p>
        <p>Suddenly Buster burst out crying.</p>
        <p>“What’s the matter, son?” asked Papa Bear.</p>
        <p>“I’ve missed everything great today just because I was sleeping,” wailed Buster. “Mom was right. I’m never going to sleep again.”</p>
        <p>“Now, now son,” comforted Papa Bear “You still need some sleep, but only the right amount at the right time.”</p>
        <p>After that Buster the Bear slept when he should and played when he should for he had learned a valuable lesson –</p>

          <strong>A Tired Tale</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Come on, sleepyhead. It is 7:30 and time to get up and get ready for school,” Mama Bear said as she gently shook her slumbering son.</p>
        <p>“Aw, Mom, do I have to?” questioned Buster the Bear in a groggy voice. “Can’t I sleep just ten more minutes?”</p>
        <p>“Your ten minutes more have a strange way of becoming half an hour,” replied Mama Bear. “Now get out of bed and shake a leg or you’ll be late.’’</p>
        <p>Buster dragged himself out of bed and grumbled all the way to the bathroom. It was not that Buster didn’t want to go to school. He liked his teacher, Mrs. Honeycomb, and his best friend Billy was in his class. Buster just liked to sleep. No, he didn’t like to sleep, he LOVED to sleep! While the other bears excelled at things like fishing, wrestling, and climbing, Buster was a champion dozer! “I wish I could sleep all the time,” he muttered.</p>
        <p>Mama Bear overheard and cautioned, “Now, you don’t mean that, Buster. You can’t sleep all the time. You’d miss out on everything.”</p>
        <p>“Well, maybe not all the time, but I wouldn’t miss much if I could sleep twice as much. And you know sleep is important,” argued Buster.</p>
        <p>“Yes, sleep is good for you, but only when appropriate. You can have too much of a good thing,” answered Mama Bear. She could tell her cub was still not convinced; but she gave him a big bear hug and a kiss and sent him off on his way. Later that evening, after Buster had gone to bed, Mama Bear described the morning’s events to Papa Bear. “We need to take care of this problem right away. If sleep is what he wants then that is what he’ll get,” declared Papa Bear. “Tomorrow let him sleep in as late as he wants and whenever he wants during the day. He should soon see what he’s missing.”</p>
        <p>The next morning 7:30 came and went as Buster slumbered on. At 10:30 Buster awoke, looked at the clock and called out, “Mama, Mama, I’ve overslept! You didn’t wake me up.”</p>
        <p>“That’s right,” replied Mama Bear. “I’m letting you get the sleep you wanted just like you asked. Are you ready to go to school now?”</p>
        <p>“Cool!” exclaimed Buster. “I’ll be ready in two blinks of a bear’s eye.”</p>
        <p>As Buster slid into his seat in class, Billy turned to him and whispered excitedly, “Boy did you miss out on all the action this morning!”</p>
        <p>“What happened?” questioned Buster.</p>
        <p>“The KAVE Newschopper landed on the playground this morning and a bunch of us got to take a ride in the helicopter. It was awesome! I wish you could have been here,” said Billy.</p>
        <p>“So do I,” muttered Buster under his breath. After school Buster and his friends went to the park to play. While the other cubs were playing tag, Buster sat down under a tree and started to nap. Hearing a loud commotion, Buster opened his eyes to see what was going on.</p>
        <p>“Did you see him? Did you see him?” shouted Billy. “Wow! I can’t believe Justin Timbearlake was here at our park and I got his autograph. Isn’t that great?”</p>
        <p>“Yeah, great,” grumbled Buster. “I can’t believe I slept through it.”</p>
        <p>That night after dinner Buster and his father sat down to watch their favorite team play baseball. Barely into the 7th inning, Buster had begun to doze off on the couch. He was jolted awake when Papa Bear jumped up from the couch cheering.</p>
