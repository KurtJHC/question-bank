        <p><strong>Read the text below. Six sentences&nbsp;have been removed from this text so that there are six gaps.</strong><br><br><strong>Social media: a blessing and a curse&nbsp;</strong><br><br><em>Our Social Media Manager, Tess Macpherson-Woods, shares her experience working here in the busy world of social media.&nbsp;</em><br><br>
When I tell people what I do for a living, I think this often conjures up images of me surrounded by kittens and puppies, scrolling through Facebook at my leisure... As much as I love my job, kittens and puppies - this couldn't be further from the truth! <strong>(A)</strong>&nbsp;………. . As a nation of animal lovers, we all feel very strongly about speaking up for the voiceless, and want to help - but as well-intentioned as posts and comments online may be, they can sometimes make it harder for us to help.</p>
        <p>Every day we use social media to achieve amazing things, from finding perpetrators of animal cruelty, to rehoming animals, offering the best pet care advice, and gathering petition signatures to change the law. <strong>(B)</strong> ………. . We're incredibly grateful for these passionate and dedicated animal lovers - we couldn't help as many animals as we do without them!&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, with social media also comes fake news, malicious rumours and inaccuracies, which can spread like wildfire. Sometimes such posts are shared by people who don't understand the restrictions we face as a charity, or our very stretched resources; other times they're shared by people who have had a negative experience with us in the past, perhaps due to harming an animal themselves. These posts are not only damaging to our reputation, affecting our ability to help animals, but they can also be unintentionally damaging to specific animals' lives.</p>
        <p>In the past reports have been made to us, with people expecting immediate action and updates, and have then shared our perceived lack of action on social media. <strong>(C)</strong> ………. . There are times when people wrongly claim to have reported concerns to us, say we've not attended when we've barely been given a chance to do so, or tell the world that we don't care. <strong>(D)</strong> ………. .</p>
        <p>Each day, my small team deals with hundreds of messages on our social channels. We love speaking to inspirational animal advocates, passionate pet owners, keen campaigners, and fabulous fundraisers - but we also have to deal with terrible trolls. <strong>(E)</strong> ………. . It's a sad fact that there will always be people that don't like us. As an organisation which investigates and prosecutes people for animal cruelty, we'll always have enemies, and people's expectations of us (often, wrongly, as the animal police!) will always be far greater than we can realistically deliver.</p>
        <p>As a charity, we have no legal powers and a call comes in every 30 seconds, but we have fewer than 400 full-time members of staff in our inspectorate to pick up these calls.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, people's expectations are that we should arrive within minutes to seize an abused dog without evidence or the police to sign them over to us, always be there to collect a poorly but mobile fox, or immediately come to the rescue of a legally tethered, healthy horse. <strong>(F)</strong> ………. . Unfortunately, receiving more calls about these incidents without more information won't help the situation - and sharing the issue online and trolling us will also make things more difficult to solve.</p>

        <p><strong>Read the text below. Six sentences&nbsp;have been removed from this text so that there are six gaps.</strong><br><br><strong>How Many People Speak English, And Where Is It Spoken?</strong><br><br>
English is the most-spoken language in the world, and it can be found spread far and wide. While there’s no official common language for the planet, English is often used to communicate across nations. This is because of a number of historical factors, most notably the patterns of colonialism by English speakers.</p>
        <p><strong>(A)</strong> .......... . That means it’s descended from Proto-Germanic, along with German, Dutch and Swedish, as well as 43 other living Germanic languages. If you go back even further up the language family tree, English is an Indo-European language, which is one of the largest language families in the world and comprises most of the languages spoken that originated in Europe.</p>
        <p>Historical linguists date the English language back to the fifth century, when Germanic tribes (speaking Proto-Germanic) invaded Britain. The languages of these groups influenced each other, forming Old English. The earliest form of English looks very different from our modern form, but the two share a number of words and roots of words. In 1066, the Normans — <strong>(B)</strong> .......... — conquered England and brought with them a form of French. Many French words, along with some Latin, were mixed in with Old English, and these eventually changed the language so much that Middle English was born.</p>
        <p><strong>(C)</strong> .......... . First was the advent of printing in the 16th century, which allowed mass-produced language for the first time. <strong>(D)</strong> .......... . The United Kingdom imposed English on their territories around the world, and when the period of British colonialism was coming to a close it was only replaced with American imperialism, which is what forcefully made the English language as widespread as it is today.</p>
        <p>Out of the world’s approximately 7.8 billion inhabitants, 1.35 billion speak English. <strong>(E)</strong> .......... . Only about 360 million people speak English as their first language. <strong>(F)</strong> .......... , followed distantly by Spanish and then, in third, comes English.</p>

History of London</strong><br><br>
London is situated on the banks of the River Thames. It is the seat of the Government of the United Kingdom and the country’s financial centre. The city has used its privileged location in south-eastern England to its advantage, having always been a densely populated and wealthy area. <strong>(A)</strong> ……….&nbsp; Whitehall is lined with government departments and ministries. To the north, Trafalgar Square marks the beginning of London’s West End, an area with a great night life. Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, Westminster Cathedral and Westminster Palace are found in these two areas.

<p>The city of London was founded by the Romans and their rule extended from 43 AD to the fifth century AD, when the Empire fell. During the third century, Londinium, the Roman town, had a population of 50,000, mainly due to the influence of its major port. <strong>(B)</strong> ……….&nbsp; During the eighth century it became the capital of the Kingdom of Essex. During the ninth century, the town suffered numerous Viking attacks, but then Danish settlers arrived in the area, encouraging trade and opening businesses in the town, transforming it into the first urban centre of England. The town’s wealth and power attracted the Danish Great Heathen Army, which besieged the city until it was captured by King Alfred the Great in 886.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 1067, after the Norman invasion of England, the newly crowned King of England, William Duke of Normandy established the city's existing rights, laws and privileges, and the Tower of London was built.<strong> (C)</strong> ……….&nbsp; For many years, England had no capital city, but the institutions of central government were moved to Westminster, close to London. This and the rise of trade in the area were two decisive factors in London's emergence as the capital of England.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the fourteenth century, London’s port became a European hub for the distribution of goods. This was strengthened during the fifteenth century by its textile industry. From the sixteenth to mid-seventeenth century, London benefited from its maritime trade expansion. During Henry VIII’s reign, London had 100,000 inhabitants. In mid-seventeenth century it had over 500,000. In 1665, the city was still held inside the ancient walls although large-scale urban planning had already started. The population’s poor living conditions were responsible for the Great Plague, killing 70,000 people, and the following year, a huge fire burnt down most of the city. <strong>(D) </strong>……….&nbsp; The architect Christopher Wren’s masterpieces such as St. Paul’s Cathedral increased the appeal of London, and thus the capital became the centre of English social life with palaces, halls, theatres, societies (Royal Society, 1662) and museums (British Museum, 1753)</p>

<p>London continued to grow thanks to the foundation of the Bank of England in 1694. It was the second central bank in the world, rapidly following the Swedish Sveriges Riksbank, and arguably the most successful. It provided the financial flexibility which would be the foundation of the empire's power and whose vestiges can be seen today in London's pre-eminence as a financial centre. Most of current London is from the Victorian period. The Industrial Revolution drew millions of people to London, expanding the city. <strong>(E)</strong> ……….&nbsp; Another was the great stink of 1858, with the hottest months of summer, worsening the smell of the sewers dumped in the River Thames, which even led to the suspension of the parliament.</p>

<p>From 1750, the population increased from 700,000 to over 4,500,000 in 1901. <strong>(F)</strong> ……….&nbsp; The administrative needs of a city with so much commercial activity led the creation of a new autonomous territorial unit in 1888, the County of London, ruled by the "London county council". This county was divided into twenty-nine electoral units (the city and 28 metropolitan boroughs), but the progressive expansion soon overflowed outside the county boundaries to the suburban areas. After a steady period, the population of the capital began to decline at the end of World War I and fell below 3.5 million by 1950. In contrast, the suburban area grew steadily. In 1963 a new division of London was made, comprising the old town and 32 metropolitan boroughs, and these are the divisions which can be seen today</p>

“Thirsty consumers around the globe now enjoy Coca-Cola Company products 1.7 billion times every single day, with about 19,400 beverages every second.” Coca-Cola’s history began in 1886 when Atlanta pharmacist, Dr. John S.

        <p>Coca-Cola is a beverage that people enjoy most of all, but is not the only thing that made Coca-Cola the world’s most valuable company. Coca-Cola used unique marketing strategies to achieve its goals. Let’s become familiar with Coca-Cola’s most important marketing strategies. The first is its logo. From 1886 till now Coca-Cola changed its logo almost 10 times. Frank Mason Robinson then decided that Coca-Cola’s logo should be written in the Spencerian script to differentiate it from its competitors. <strong>(B)</strong> ……….&nbsp; Frank M. Robinson also suggested the name “Coca-Cola”, thinking that “the two Cs would look well in advertising”. The Coca-Cola logo is recognised internationally. The white swirl of the logo stimulates passion and zeal of the youth today. The colours used in the Coca-Cola logo are red and white, both are pulsating and simple in design, which makes the logo appealing in the eyes of youngsters. The font of the logo is printed in white, with a vibrant red background.</p>
        <p>The second strategy is its unique bottle. Coca-Cola’s history has revolved a lot around the&nbsp; bottle – more than 115 years’ worth, in fact. The Coca-Cola bottle remains unique in its design. It was created in 1915, by Earl R. Dean; the Coca-Cola bottle was first introduced as a ‘contour bottle’ or ‘hobble-skirt’ bottle, wide from the center and slender from below. By 1915, CEO, Candler was losing market share to hundreds of competitors. He launched a national contest for a new bottle design that would signal to consumers that Coke was a premium product. The Root Glass Company in Indiana decided to enter the contest and base its design off the product’s name. The cocoa pod has a strange but appealing shape. They were declared the contest winners the next year. Coca-Cola commissioned the bottle design as a piece of defensive marketing, but began promoting the shape as much as the logo and product. <strong>(C)</strong> ……….&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The third strategy is that Coke sells “happiness” in a bottle. Coke doesn’t sell a drink in a bottle, it sells “happiness” in a bottle. <strong>(D)</strong> ……….&nbsp; A lot of companies focus on the products themselves, but Coke aims to sell consumers the experience and lifestyle associated with its brand. For example, in 2009, the “Open Happiness” campaign was unveiled globally. The central message of “Open Happiness” is an invitation to billions around the world to pause, refresh with a Coca-Cola, and continue to enjoy one of life’s simple pleasures. The “Open Happiness” message was seen in stores, on billboards, in TV spots and printed advertising along with digital mediums.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Another strategy is Coca-Cola’s slogans. Since Coca-Cola was born in 1886, it has been using various advertising campaign slogans. The first official advertising slogan said that Coke was “Delicious! Refreshing! Exhilarating! Invigorating!” The 1980s featured such memorable slogans as “Coke is It!”, “Catch the Wave” and “Can’t Beat the Feeling”. In 1993, Coca-Cola experimented with computer animation, and the popular “Always Coca-Cola” campaign was launched in a series of ads featuring animated polar bears. Later it used one global creative campaign: “Taste the Feeling.” “Taste the Feeling” will bring to life the idea that drinking a Coca-Cola – any Coca-Cola – is a simple pleasure that makes everyday moments more special. <strong>(E)</strong> ……….&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then there is Coca-Cola’s pricing strategy. It’s common today for tech start-ups to begin by offering a service for free and then charging a higher price to consumers and/or advertisers once they’ve become hooked. Coca-Cola used a similar approach to scale across the US and then throughout the world. <strong>(F)</strong> ……….&nbsp; The Coca-Cola products prices are set around the same level as its competitors, so Coca-Cola has to be perceived as different but still affordable.</p>

Mt VesuviusMount</strong><br><br>
Vesuvius is an active&nbsp;volcano&nbsp;in southern&nbsp;Italy. Rising above the Bay of Naples, the volcano is situated on the plain of Campania, about 11 kilometres from the city of&nbsp;Naples. Its fiery eruptions have claimed a high toll in lives and property through the centuries. <strong>(A)</strong> ………. &nbsp;There are industrial towns along the bay, and small agricultural centres thrive on the northern slopes.

<p>Mount Vesuvius stands about 1,280 metres high, but its height changes after each major eruption. The mountain originated some 200,000 years ago and for a time had only one peak. Now a high, semicircular ridge known as Mount Somma partly surrounds the main cone of Vesuvius and has a slope of its own, beginning at about 600 metres and climbing to 1,132 metres. The area between the ridge and the cone is known as Valle del Gigante, or Giant’s Valley.&nbsp; <strong>(B)</strong> ………. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Volcanic ash has made the soil of Vesuvius very fertile, and the lower slopes are covered with vineyards and orchards. Up the mountain from the farmlands, the volcano’s slopes are cloaked with thickets of oak and chestnut trees. <strong>(C)</strong> ………. &nbsp;However, on the higher western side the chestnut groves give way to small shrubs on plateau areas at an altitude of 610 metres. Still higher, the surface of the great cone is almost bare.</p>

<p><strong>(D)</strong> ………. &nbsp;Readings far above 540 °C are common. Rising temperatures are one indicator of forthcoming eruptions.</p>

<p>The most famous eruption of Vesuvius occurred in&nbsp;ad&nbsp;79, when lava and ashes buried the towns of&nbsp;Pompeii,&nbsp;Herculaneum, and Stabiae. Excavations have uncovered parts of the cities. Since that disaster, nearly 50 eruptions of varying intensity have been reported. An eruption in 1631 buried villages and blew ashes as far as 240 kilometres. <strong>(E)</strong> ………. &nbsp;More than 3,000 were killed. Another great upheaval in 1794 destroyed the village of Torre del Greco for the fourth time.</p>

<p><strong>(F)</strong> ………. &nbsp;In this type of eruption, large volumes of gases boil out of gas-rich magma and generate enormous, nearly continuous jetting blasts. The blasts rip apart the core of the magma column. The volcano’s fierce turbulence has caused many changes in the mountain’s shape and height. In 1906, an eruption killed hundreds of people and reduced the volcano’s height by several hundred feet. In 1944, another powerful surge raised the height by about 150 metres and widened the top crater threefold to its present width.</p>

<br>
How do ants communicate?</strong><br><br>
How does an ant society actually function? The ants are unable to talk to each other, and their eyes are nowhere near our human eyes. So how do they communicate with each other? When presented with the word communication, most humans would probably associate it with language or speech. <strong>(A)</strong> ………. &nbsp;This way, we can create an infinite amount of words and as a result tell extremely complex stories. The communication of ants is not quite as advanced, but most people would probably agree that it is impressingly refined.</p>
        <p>An ant colony can consist of several millions of workers. How can such a large society be the well-organised machinery we’ve observed it to be? The ants solve the barriers of communication in several ways: scent (pheromones); touch; body language; and sound. <strong>(B)</strong> ………. &nbsp;Using them and with the help of an advanced system of pheromones they can “smell” a wide range of topics, ranging from colony activity to territorial conquest. Through millions of years the ants have developed specific pheromone-cocktails to communicate different things to fellow ants. To receive the messages they use their antennas, much the same way we would use our nose if blind and deaf. Of course, all scents aren’t known by man, but we do know a lot about their system. For example, each colony carries their own unique set of pheromones, making it possible to tell friend from foe. For a human being it might seem odd that an ant can sort this out in a matter of milliseconds, but through scent it is possible, and it often comes in very handy.</p>
        <p>Ants communicate through motion and touch. Myrmecologists, Bert Hölldobler and Edward O. Wilson gives an account of observations of weaver ant communication (Oecophylla longinoda) in their book Journey to the Ants. It is clear that it is all actually quite advanced. For example, the ants tend to lay out scent trails to food sources, like breadcrumbs, for other workers to find and follow. When a single worker has found something they will run back to the colony whilst sprinkling small drops of pheromones on the ground for other workers to follow. The myrmecologists explains that there are five different ways the ants can mix and vary these signals. When a worker ant meets a member of the colony, they can tell it things by moving their body in a specific manner, or simply by the touching of antennas. <strong>(C)</strong> ………. &nbsp;If the first ant has found something edible, they will most likely give the other ant a taste of it from a sample out of their mouth.</p>
        <p>Ants also communicate through body language. Just like humans, the ants use body language to communicate things. <strong>(D)</strong> ………. &nbsp;This way, they can combine signals of pheromones with that of touch and body language, providing an advanced form of communication. One example of a peculiar dialogue is when the ants, by lightly pressing a section of another ant’s head, can produce a jaw reflex, giving the first ant the opportunity to taste the diet of the other ant. It is not uncommon for ants to save some of their food for later or for members of the colony. This dialogue might seem strange to us, but there is no reluctance involved in this from any of the two ants.</p>
        <p>Do ants speak to each other? Yes! Another peculiar way of how ants communicate is by sound. A majority of ant species can communicate by sound, although it is commonly unknown to most people because of its low resonance. The ants can procure different sounds by scraping their legs on a washboard-like part of their body, thus accomplishing different sounds. <strong>(E)</strong> ………. &nbsp;The sound is actually possible for us to perceive if we hold an ant very close to the ear, listening carefully.</p>
        <p>The sounds are used in different ways, depending on the species. A great example of the use of sound is when a worker ant has been caught somewhere. <strong>(F)</strong> ………. &nbsp;The ant can use sound as a distress call, signalling their location to the other workers through the walls. This could not be achieved by pheromones.</p>

Ned Kelly</strong><br><br>
Ned Kelly is a nickname of Edward Kelly. He was born in June 1855 in Beveridge, Victoria, Australia and died on November 11, 1880, in Melbourne and is the most famous of the bushrangers, the Australian rural outlaws of the 19th century. The name, bushranger, refers to any of the bandits of the Australian bush, or outback, who harassed the settlers, miners, and Aborigines of the frontier in the late 18th and 19th centuries. <strong>(A)</strong> ……….&nbsp; Acting individually or in small bands, these variants of the classical bandit or highwayman followed the usual pattern of robbery, rape, and murder. They specialised in robbing, or “bailing up”, stagecoaches, banks, and small settlements.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>From 1789, when John Caesar (called “Black Caesar”) took to the bush and probably became the first bushranger, until the 1850s, the bushrangers were almost exclusively escaped convicts. From the 1850s until their disappearance after 1880, most bushrangers were free settlers who had run afoul of the law. The last major bushranger—and also the most celebrated—was Ned Kelly. While many bushrangers, such as John Lynch and Daniel “Mad” Morgan, were ruthless killers, the glorification of bushranging in Australian society stems in part from the actual deeds of certain figures. Matthew Brady and Edward “Teddy” Davis, both transported convicts, were known for their humane treatment of their victims. Davis actually shared his loot with the poor. <strong>(B)</strong> ……….&nbsp; The cult of the bushranger is the source of such folk songs as “Bold Jack Donahoe” and “Wild Colonial Boy”, as well as the expression “as game as Ned Kelly”.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>(C)</strong> ……….&nbsp; The brothers fled to the bush, where two other men joined them to form the Kelly gang. The Kelly gang’s perpetration of a series of daring robberies in the Victoria–New South Wales borderland (1878–80) captured the imagination of the public. Some viewed Ned Kelly as a personification of the plight of workers set against large landowners in an economically depressed period. In June 1880, after several police shootings and robberies, the gang took possession of Glenrowan township, where they were besieged by police. Kelly was wounded and captured in the ensuing fray; his fellow gang members were killed. Later that year he was taken to Melbourne jail, where he was hanged.</p>
        <p>Who were the Kelly Gang? In 1878 an arrest warrant (order) was issued for Ned’s younger brother, Dan Kelly. On 15 April Constable Fitzpatrick of the Greta police arrived at the Kelly home to arrest Dan. While there, he was reportedly offensive to 15-year-old Kate Kelly. This outraged the Kelly’s and in the fight that followed, Fitzpatrick was shot in the wrist. Fitzpatrick claimed that Ned was the shooter, but the shooter’s identity was never confirmed. Ellen Kelly, Ned’s mother, also took part in the fight wielding a spade. Fitzpatrick subsequently brought charges of attempted murder against her and she was sentenced to three years in prison. Ned and Dan fled into the bush in the Wombat Ranges to escape arrest. <strong>(D)</strong> ……….&nbsp; These became the four main members of the Kelly Gang.</p>
        <p>In 1880, fed up with life on the run, the Kelly Gang planned an attack on the Victorian police at the town of Glenrowan. On 26 June, the gang rode to Glenrowan where they destroyed part of the railway line. At around 3am on 28 June, officers from the train surrounded the Glenrowan Inn. <strong>(E)</strong> ……….&nbsp; The police began to shoot as the gang stepped out of the inn. Joe Byrne was shot and killed, and stray bullets injured many of the hostages inside the building. Dan Kelly and Steve Hart came back to the inn and kept shooting at the police. This created a diversion while Ned retreated into the bush behind the hotel and circled around behind the police. At dawn on 28 June, Ned came towards the police from behind and began shooting. He was shot in the legs and captured. The siege kept going for hours as Dan Kelly and Steve Hart were still inside the Glenrowan Inn. They let their hostages go later in the afternoon. The two men were then either shot by police or shot themselves to avoid being captured. Ned was captured alive.</p>
        <p>The 2003 film version sees the story of Ned Kelly as follows. <strong>(F)</strong> ……….&nbsp; In days when an arrest equalled guilt and a conviction, his unfair imprisonment for horse thievery puts him steadfast, in the eyes of Victorian police, on the wrong side of things for life. With a sister unable to dissuade the unwanted advances of Constable Fitzpatrick, Ned, his brother Dan, and friends Joe Byrne and Steve Hart soon find themselves labelled "an outlaw gang" by the less-than-honourable constable. It's a designation they're apt to live up to after Ned's mother is unfairly arrested and sentenced to three years hard labour. In retaliation, the Kelly Gang strikes out against the oppressive Victorian government, with ultimately tragic results and their passage into Australian folklore.<br>

        <strong>Kangaroos</strong>
        <p>The Iconic Australian Marsupial<br>
<br>
Kangaroos are one of Australia’s most iconic animals, recognized worldwide for their distinctive appearance and unique mode of locomotion. Their unique way of moving by hopping is not only efficient but also an adaptation to the vast, open landscapes of Australia. Kangaroos are often seen as symbols of the Australian outback, representing the wild and untamed nature of the continent.</p>
        <p>Kangaroos are found across a variety of Australian landscapes, from the open plains and grasslands to forests and savannas. <strong>(A)</strong> ……………&nbsp; The most well-known species include the Red Kangaroo, the Eastern Grey Kangaroo, and the Western Grey Kangaroo. Each species has its own distinct range and preferred habitat, but all kangaroos are generally associated with open spaces where they can hop freely. These environments provide the necessary resources for their survival, such as food and water, and allow them to maintain their social structures. The adaptability of kangaroos to different environments is a testament to their evolutionary success in Australia.</p>
        <p>Kangaroos are characterized by their large size, with the Red Kangaroo being the largest, standing over 6 feet tall and weighing up to 200 pounds. Their powerful hind legs allow them to travel at speeds of up to 35 miles per hour and leap distances of over 25 feet in a single bound. <strong>(B)</strong>&nbsp; ……………&nbsp; In addition to their legs, kangaroos have large, muscular tails that help with balance and stability while hopping. Their forelimbs are much smaller but are used for feeding and grooming. The combination of these physical traits makes kangaroos highly specialized for their environment.</p>
        <p>Kangaroos are herbivores, primarily feeding on grasses and shrubs. Their digestive system is specially adapted to extract maximum nutrients from their fibrous diet. Kangaroos are social animals, often seen in groups called mobs. These groups provide safety in numbers and social interaction, which is important for their survival. Mobs are typically led by a dominant male, known as the alpha, who has breeding rights with the females in the group. <strong>(C)</strong>&nbsp; ……………&nbsp; The social structure of kangaroos plays a crucial role in their daily lives, influencing their behaviour and interactions.</p>
        <p>Kangaroos have a unique reproductive process. Female kangaroos give birth to tiny, underdeveloped young, known as joeys, after a short gestation period of about 30 to 36 days. The newborn joey then crawls into its mother’s pouch. <strong>(D)</strong>&nbsp; …………….&nbsp; The pouch provides a safe environment for the joey to nurse and grow until it is ready to venture out on its own. During this time, the mother provides all the necessary care and protection for her joey. The bond between a mother and her joey is strong, and the joey often returns to the pouch for safety even after it begins to explore the outside world.</p>
        <p>Kangaroos are generally abundant across Australia. <strong>(E)</strong>&nbsp; ……………&nbsp; However, they do face threats from habitat destruction, climate change, and human activities such as hunting and vehicle collisions. Conservation efforts are in place to ensure that kangaroo populations remain stable and that their habitats are protected for future generations. Organizations work to monitor kangaroo populations, manage their habitats, and promote sustainable practices.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Kangaroos hold a special place in Australian culture and are a symbol of the country’s unique wildlife. They appear in Aboriginal art and mythology, as well as public media and are featured prominently in the national emblem. The kangaroo’s image is also used by various Australian organizations and brands, highlighting its importance as a national icon. In Aboriginal culture, kangaroos are often seen as totems and are integral to various stories and traditions. <strong>(F)&nbsp;</strong> ………………..&nbsp; As a symbol of the country’s natural heritage, it is crucial to continue efforts to protect and preserve these remarkable animals and their habitats.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>Jack in the Pulpit</strong><br>
(Arisaema triphyllum)&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Lynne Bittner, a botanical illustrator, frequently encounters many people at art and craft shows in New England who share a fascination with early spring woodland wildflowers. <strong>(A)</strong>&nbsp;……………&nbsp; This preference may stem from its unique appearance and the nostalgic memories it evokes of a simpler time. Bittner herself was first introduced to Jack-in-the-Pulpit as a child, during a memorable adventure in the woods. The plant’s distinctive look, with its striped spathe and protruding spadix, left a lasting impression on her and her friends.</p>
        <p>The Jack-in-the-Pulpit is easily recognized by its peculiar structure, which includes a spathe that surrounds a spadix. The plant’s common names, such as cuckoo pint and dog’s dilly, hint at its whimsical nature in folklore. This wildflower’s unique design not only makes it visually striking but also functional for its survival. <strong>(B)</strong>&nbsp;……………&nbsp; However, this allure can sometimes be a trap for the insects, ensuring that pollination occurs, even if it means some insects may not escape.</p>
        <p>Despite its beauty, Jack-in-the-Pulpit is not meant for consumption. The plant contains crystalline calcium oxalate, a substance that can cause intense burning sensations and severe gastric distress if ingested. Native Americans utilized the plant for various medicinal purposes and even reportedly used it to create traps for their enemies. <strong>(C)</strong> …………….&nbsp; The entire plant, including its berries, contains this toxic substance, with the highest concentration found in its root or corm.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, Jack-in-the-Pulpit can change its sex from year to year based on nutritional availability. Male plants, which require less nutrition, produce pollen, while female plants, needing more resources, produce seeds and fruit. <strong>(D)</strong> …………….&nbsp; When conditions are favourable, female plants will also produce additional leaves to maximize nutrient intake through photosynthesis. This dynamic ability to switch between male and female forms highlights the plant’s resilience and evolutionary strategy.</p>
        <p>The plant’s pollination strategy is equally fascinating. Jack-in-the-Pulpit relies primarily on fungus gnats, which are attracted by the spadix’s mushroom-like scent. The structure of the spathe confuses the gnats, leading them to the base where they can become trapped. Male spathes have an exit hole allowing pollen-laden gnats to escape, while female spathes do not, ensuring that the gnats final act is to pollinate the female flowers. <strong>(E)</strong> …………….&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Bittner concludes that Jack-in-the-Pulpit, with its unique characteristics and adaptive strategies, has successfully carved out a niche for itself in the woodland ecosystem. <strong>(F)</strong> ……………&nbsp; Protecting these wildflowers is crucial to preserving the beauty and biodiversity of our woodlands. By appreciating and conserving such plants, we can ensure that future generations will also be able to marvel at the wonders of the Jack-in-the-Pulpit and other woodland wildflowers.</p>

The Titanic, built by White Star Line, was completed on 31 March 1912 in Belfast, Ireland, after three years of construction. <strong>(A)</strong> …………… It measured 28 meters wide, 53 meters tall, and 269 meters long. The Titanic embarked on its maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York, USA, on 10 April 1912, stopping at Cherbourg, France, and Queenstown, Ireland, to pick up passengers. Known as RMS Titanic, which stands for ‘Royal Mail Steamer,’ the ship carried 3,500 sacks of letters, packages, and documents along with over 2,200 passengers and crew members. The ship was referred to as ‘she,’ a tradition linked to ancient language or the idea of goddesses protecting ships.</p>
        <p>The Titanic’s passengers were divided into three classes based on their wealth. First-class passengers enjoyed luxurious accommodations and facilities, including private suites, a swimming pool, and a dining room. Second-class passengers had comfortable cabins with access to amenities like a library and dining room. Third-class passengers, although in more basic accommodations, experienced better conditions than on other ships of that era. The Titanic was powered by its coal-burning engines, with 175 firemen shovelling 600 tons of coal daily. <strong>(B)</strong> …………… Despite claims of being the safest ship due to its hull design, the Titanic met disaster on its fifth day at sea.</p>
        <p>On the night of 14 April 1912, the Titanic struck an iceberg in the North Atlantic, tearing holes in at least four sections of its hull. The collision was catastrophic, and Captain Edward John Smith and his crew quickly realized the ship would sink within hours. Distress signals were sent out, and passengers were ordered to the lifeboats. However, the Titanic only had 20 lifeboats, enough for about half of those on board, and the initial lifeboats were launched half-empty. <strong>(C) </strong>…………… The ship eventually broke in two, with the bow sinking first and the stern rising before sinking.</p>
        <p>The freezing -2°C waters proved fatal for most passengers who ended up in the ocean. <strong>(D)</strong> …………… The RMS Carpathia was the first ship to respond to the distress signals, arriving over an hour after the Titanic sank. It rescued around 705 survivors from the lifeboats and transported them to New York. Tragically, over 1,500 people lost their lives, with many bodies never recovered. In the aftermath, ships retrieved 300 bodies, which were either buried at sea or taken to Halifax, Canada, for identification. The wreck of the Titanic remained hidden for nearly 70 years until discovered in 1985 by oceanographer Dr.&nbsp;Robert Ballard.</p>
        <p>Since the discovery, numerous expeditions have salvaged over 6,000 items from the Titanic wreckage, now displayed in museums worldwide. These artifacts include jewellery, perfumes, plates, clothes, furniture, and even lunch menus. <strong>(E)</strong> .…………… The Titanic’s story has inspired many documentaries and movies, the most famous being the 1997 film “Titanic,” directed by James Cameron. This film, featuring a fictionalized romance between characters played by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, became one of the highest grossing films of all time.</p>
        <p>The Titanic was famously dubbed “unsinkable” before its maiden voyage. This belief was partly due to its advanced safety features, such as 16 compartments within the hull designed to contain flooding. <strong>(F)</strong> …………… The ship’s grandeur and luxury, rather than its safety, were its main selling points. Despite the “unsinkable” reputation, the Titanic’s sinking revealed flaws in its design and safety measures, highlighting the importance of adequate lifeboat provisions and emergency preparedness. The disaster led to significant changes in maritime safety regulations, ensuring that such a tragedy would not be repeated.</p>

        <p><strong>Read the text below. Six sentences&nbsp;have been removed from this text so that there are six gaps.</strong><br><br><strong>The Invention of the Wheel</strong><br><br>
The invention of the wheel is often associated with modern vehicles or ancient Roman chariots, but the earliest wheels were significantly different. The wheel was invented by the ancient Sumerians, who lived in Mesopotamia, an area now part of modern-day Iraq. <strong>(A)</strong>&nbsp;…………… Extensive studies of their writings have revealed that they were also the inventors of the wheel. Initially, the wheel emerged from the Sumerians’ creation of the potter’s wheel around 3500 B.C. This was a heavy, flat disk made of hardened clay, spun horizontally to shape wet clay into pots and jars.</p>
        <p>The Sumerians’ innovation did not stop with the potter’s wheel. They eventually created what can be considered the first wheel by making man-made logs. These logs were used to roll heavy objects by placing the objects on the logs and rolling them forward. Due to a lack of large trees, the Sumerians fashioned logs from flat planks of wood, chiseled into curved shapes to facilitate rolling. <strong>(B)</strong>&nbsp;…………… However, it was clear that they needed a more efficient solution for moving heavy loads, which led to further innovations.</p>
        <p>Next, the Sumerians invented the “sledge,” a device without rollers, which resembled a large sled with curved runners. <strong>(C)</strong>&nbsp;………… When the terrain became challenging, the sledge often caught on obstacles. To improve this, the Sumerians combined the sledge with their roller concept, placing the sledge on top of rollers to aid movement. While this worked well on flat ground, it struggled on inclines as the runners tended to slip off the rollers, causing the load to tip over.</p>
        <p>To address these issues, the Sumerians refined their design by cutting grooves into the rollers where the runners of the sledge would sit. This grooved roller significantly improved the stability of the load. Yet, transporting the heavy rollers themselves was still cumbersome. The Sumerians then had the idea to reduce the roller to just its ends, connected by a narrower axle. <strong>(D)</strong>&nbsp;…………… They added pegs to keep the sledge in place on the axle, resulting in a more manageable and efficient design.</p>
        <p>The final iteration of the Sumerian wheel included attaching the axle directly to the sledge using wooden bearings. This development created a more robust and reliable cart, which laid the groundwork for the chariots and wheeled vehicles used by subsequent civilizations. <strong>(E)</strong>&nbsp;…………… The Sumerians’ persistence and ingenuity in refining the wheel design revolutionized human society. It made it one of the most critical inventions in history.</p>
        <p>Over time, other civilizations adopted and improved upon the Sumerian wheel. The Egyptians, Assyrians, Greeks, and Romans all contributed to the wheel’s evolution, each adding their unique enhancements. The wheel became essential for various purposes, from transportation to warfare. <strong>(F)</strong>&nbsp;…………… Despite these advancements, the fundamental principles established by the Sumerians remained integral to the wheel’s function and utility.</p>

A volcano is an opening on a planet’s surface that allows molten material, known as magma, to escape from its interior. This process leads to an eruption, which can either be explosive, sending material high into the sky, or calmer, with slower, but equally deadly flows of lava. <strong>(A)</strong> …………… Volcanoes are categorized into three types: active, dormant, and extinct. Active volcanoes have had recent eruptions or are expected to erupt soon. Dormant volcanoes have not erupted recently but could potentially erupt in the future. Extinct volcanoes are those that are unlikely to erupt again.</p>
        <p>Volcanoes form when magma, which is lighter than surrounding rocks, rises through the Earth’s crust. <strong>(B)</strong> …………… These movements create various types of volcanoes, including those with steep slopes (cone volcanoes), broad, dome-like shapes (shield volcanoes), or flat tops with central craters (calderas). The characteristics of an eruption depend on the magma’s viscosity and gas content. Runny, low-gas magma leads to gentle eruptions of slow moving lava, while sticky, gas-rich magma can cause explosive eruptions, producing ash clouds and pyroclastic flows.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The explosiveness of an eruption is influenced by the magma’s properties. For instance, magma with low viscosity and gas content, like that in Hawaii, results in slow-moving lava flows and shield volcanoes. In contrast, magma that is viscous and gas-rich can cause violent eruptions, as seen with the Fuego volcano in Guatemala. <strong>(C)</strong> …………… These eruptions can also produce pyroclastic flows, which are fast-moving, hot clouds of ash, gas, and rocks that devastate everything in their path.</p>
        <p><strong>(D)</strong> ………….. Volcanic ash enriches the soil, making it fertile for agriculture. Additionally, the geothermal energy from volcanoes is harnessed to generate electricity, powering homes and industries. The diversity of volcanoes is remarkable, ranging from the largest mountains on Earth to small hills. They can erupt multiple times over millennia or have single, dramatic events. While some volcanoes primarily consist of volcanic ash, others are formed from lava flows, and some have complex structures with a mix of pyroclastic deposits, lava domes, and landslides.</p>
        <p>Volcanoes are not unique to Earth; they are found throughout the solar system. Mars and&nbsp;&nbsp;Venus have numerous extinct volcanoes, and moons of Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune exhibit active volcanic activity. <strong>(E)</strong> …………… This has been evidenced by images from NASA’s Voyager 1 spacecraft. This discovery of active extraterrestrial volcanoes has expanded our understanding of geological processes beyond our planet, revealing that volcanic activity is a common phenomenon in the solar system.</p>
        <p>Studying volcanoes offers insights into Earth’s interior and the immense power of nature, though it can be perilous. Over the past 60 years, 31 volcanologists have died while researching volcanoes. The most tragic periods include the 1991 Mount Unzen eruption in Japan, which killed Maurice and Katia Krafft, and the 1993 Galeras eruption in Colombia, which claimed six lives during a United Nations conference. <strong>(F)</strong> …………… With around 1500 active volcanoes worldwide and weekly eruptions, understanding and respecting these natural phenomena remain crucial for minimizing risks and harnessing their benefits.</p>

The Himalayan Mountain Range<br>
<br>
The Himalayas, known as the “Abode of Snow,” is the youngest mountain range on Earth, stretching across the northern border of the Indian subcontinent. <strong>(A)&nbsp;</strong>.…………… Everest is known as Chomolungma to Tibetans, meaning “Goddess Mother of the World.” Extending approximately 1,550 miles from west to east, the Himalayas boast over 30 peaks that rise above 24,000 feet. Notable among these are Mount Everest at 29,032 feet, Kanchenjunga at 28,169 feet, Makalu at 27,766 feet, and Dhaulagiri at 26,795 feet. The Himalayas have 9 of the world’s 14 highest mountain peaks. The permanent snowfields above the snow line justify the Sanskrit name, with the mountains presenting formidable challenges to mountaineers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;The Himalayas’ distinguishing features include their immense height, complex geology, snowcapped peaks, extensive glaciers, deep gorges, and rich vegetation. The Great Himalayas form the range’s backbone, featuring nine of the world’s fourteen highest peaks, including Everest. <strong>(B)</strong> …………… They are chiefly fold mountains which were formed primarily from Precambrian metamorphic rocks. Their uplift occurred in three phases, with the most recent phase starting about seven million years ago during the late Neogene period. This phase resulted in the formation of the Siwalik Range, the foothills of the Outer Himalayas.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;The Himalayas significantly influence the climate of the Indian subcontinent and Central Asia. <strong>(C)&nbsp;</strong>…………… Winters last from October to February, summers from March to June, and the rainy season from June to September. The snow line is generally around 16,000 feet. The Himalayas block cold, dry air from the north in winter and force monsoonal winds to release moisture, resulting in heavy rainfall and snow on the Indian side and arid conditions in Tibet. Rainfall decreases from east to west, with Cherrapunji in northeastern India having the world’s second-highest average annual rainfall.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;The Himalayas are drained by 19 major rivers, including the Indus and Brahmaputra, the largest. The rivers on the southern slopes are more numerous and have significant hydroelectric potential. Major river-valley projects like the Bhakra Nangal on the Sutlej River illustrate this potential. <strong>(D)</strong> …………… The region also hosts numerous freshwater lakes and extensive glaciers, such as the 20-mile-long Gangotri glacier in northern India, contributing to the water supply.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;The Himalayas host a diverse array of vegetation and wildlife, influenced by altitude and rainfall. The soils vary, with dark brown soils supporting fruit trees and upland soils in Darjeeling and Assam suited for tea cultivation. Vegetation ranges from tropical evergreen forests at lower altitudes to alpine meadows and mosses at higher elevations. Wildlife includes elephants, tigers, and rhinoceroses in the lower forests, while higher altitudes support snow leopards, yaks, and red pandas. <strong>(E)</strong> ……………&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The people of the Himalayas include those of Tibeto-Burman and Indo-European descent. Communities like the Gaddis and Gujars are known for their migratory pastoral lifestyle. Ethnic groups such as the Newars, Tamangs, Gurangs, Sherpas, and Gurkhas populate Nepal. <strong>(F)</strong> …………… The Himalayas offer significant economic resources, including rich arable land, minerals, and hydroelectric power potential. Agriculture includes terraced cultivation of various crops and fruit orchards. Despite poor transportation facilities historically limiting economic growth, modern highways and airports now improve accessibility, supporting economic development and tourism in the region. The Himalayas were first mapped in 1590, and their peaks accurately measured in the mid-19th century, revealing Everest as the highest peak.</p>

Nuclear energy is derived from the nucleus of atoms through two primary processes: nuclear fusion, where atomic nuclei are fused together, and nuclear fission, where nuclei are split apart. In nuclear power plants, the latter process is employed to generate electricity, particularly using the radioactive element uranium. Uranium, formed when the Earth was created, is a naturally occurring but non-renewable resource found in various rocks. <strong>(A)</strong>&nbsp;……………&nbsp; By splitting uranium atoms, substantial amounts of energy are released, which is harnessed to produce electricity, underscoring the importance of nuclear energy in the global power landscape.</p>
        <p>Nuclear reactors are central to the functioning of nuclear power plants. These reactors manage nuclear chain reactions to produce heat through fission. <strong>(B)&nbsp;</strong>.……………&nbsp; With over 400 reactors worldwide, including 93 in the United States, nuclear energy remains a significant source of reliable and carbon-free electricity. The reactors utilize uranium fuel, which is processed into ceramic pellets and enclosed in metal tubes called fuel rods. These rods are grouped into fuel assemblies within the reactor core, where they interact to sustain the fission process, generating the heat needed for electricity production.</p>
        <p>The operational mechanisms of nuclear reactors involve intricate systems designed to manage the fission process safely and efficiently. Fuel rods within the reactor vessel are immersed in water, which serves as both a coolant and a moderator to control the reaction rate. <strong>(C)</strong> ……………&nbsp; The heat generated by fission converts water into steam, which drives turbines to produce electricity. This method ensures a steady supply of carbon-free energy, highlighting the efficiency and environmental benefits of nuclear power.</p>
        <p>In the United States, all commercial nuclear reactors are light-water reactors, which use normal water as a coolant and neutron moderator. There are two main types: pressurized-water reactors (PWRs) and boiling water reactors (BWRs). PWRs, making up over 65% of U.S. reactors, maintain water under high pressure to prevent boiling within the reactor core. The heated water is circulated through a heat exchanger to create steam from a secondary water source, which then drives turbines. BWRs, comprising about a third of U.S. reactors, produce steam directly within the reactor vessel, which is then used to generate electricity. <strong>(D)&nbsp;</strong>.……………&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The debate over nuclear energy continues in various parts of the world, including Australia. Sixteen-year-old William Shackel is actively campaigning to lift Australia’s ban on nuclear energy, arguing it is a cleaner and more efficient alternative to coal amidst the current energy and climate crisis. Shackel’s campaign, Nuclear For Australia, aims to promote nuclear energy as a viable solution for the country’s energy needs. <strong>(E)</strong> ……………&nbsp; Despite Australia’s ban on nuclear power since 1998, proponents like Shackel see a significant opportunity for change.</p>
        <p>Historical incidents like the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 have left a lasting impact on public perception of nuclear energy. The catastrophic explosion and meltdown at the Chernobyl Power Station in Ukraine resulted in severe radioactive fallout, affecting countless lives and leading to a long-standing exclusion zone around the site. A protective shelter now covers the reactor to prevent further radiation leakage. The incident remains a stark reminder of the risks associated with nuclear power. <strong>(F)</strong> ……………&nbsp; Despite these concerns, advancements in reactor technology and safety measures continue to shape the future of nuclear energy as a critical component of the global energy mix.</p>

          <strong>Tracks surf magazine<br>
Returns to its Roots</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Tracks surf magazine, an iconic publication in the surfing world, has undergone a significant transformation as it returns to its roots under new ownership. The magazine, first published in 1970, has been acquired by a group of surfers from commercial publishers Next Media. This return to surfer ownership is seen as completing a full circle for the magazine, which has always held a special place in the hearts of Australian surfers. <strong>(A)</strong> ……………&nbsp; He highlighted the significance of the publication’s cultural and historical impact on the surfing community.</p>
        <p>Tracks magazine has long been a cornerstone of Australian surfing culture. <strong>(B)</strong> …………….&nbsp; Over the years, it has cemented its position as a major voice in the surfing world, offering more than just surfing tips and tricks but embodying a state of mind. The magazine faced significant challenges in 2020, from devastating bushfires to the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic, which saw many magazines, including Tracks, temporarily cease printing. The publication’s 50th anniversary in October 2020 came with the uncertainty of its future.</p>
        <p>Determined to preserve Tracks’ legacy, editor Luke Kennedy and four other surfers acquired the magazine in February. This group, including long-time Tracks employee and advertising director Damian Martin, felt the weight of their responsibility to uphold the magazine’s storied heritage. <strong>(C)</strong> ……………&nbsp; Despite the current challenges in the print media industry, the new owners are optimistic and passionate about the magazine’s future, seeing it as a labour of love and a critical part of the surfing community.</p>
        <p>Tracks magazine’s new ownership comes at a time when surfing is gaining mainstream attention, highlighted by its inclusion in the upcoming Tokyo Olympics. <strong>(D)</strong> ……………&nbsp; John Witzig, who co-founded the magazine after being let go from Surf International, recalls the inspiration from influential American publications like Rolling Stone. Tracks quickly became a success, resonating deeply with the surfing community and addressing environmental concerns long before they were widely recognized.<br>
Under its new ownership, Tracks is committed to continuing its advocacy for environmental and social issues, aiming to maintain a distinct voice different from mainstream media.</p>
        <p><strong>(E)</strong> ……………&nbsp; This criticism came to a head in 2014 when a young female surfer wrote a letter criticizing the magazine’s portrayal of women. The new owners acknowledge this shortcoming and are dedicated to being more inclusive and representative of female surfers in the future, striving to correct past failings and better reflect the diversity of the surfing community.</p>
        <p><strong>(F)</strong> …………… They aim to balance respect for the magazine’s legacy with the need to engage a new generation of readers. While there are concerns about the commercialization and crowded nature of modern surfing spots, the new owners are determined to ensure Tracks remains a vital part of the surfing world. The magazine’s survival, especially in the face of the recent closure of the United States’ leading surfing magazine, Surfer, is seen as a testament to its enduring significance and the passion of its readership. Tracks continues to leave its mark on surfing culture, providing a sense of identity for Australian surfers and reflecting the evolving nature of the sport.</p>
