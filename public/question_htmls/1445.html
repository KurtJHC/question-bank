        <p>On December 5, 1945, five Navy planes took off from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, USA, on a training mission. They flew over the Bermuda Triangle. The men, along with the planes, disappeared and were never seen again. From that day forward, people became fascinated with the Bermuda Triangle. Over the years, numerous ships and aircraft have vanished with no apparent explanation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Are you wondering what the Bermuda Triangle is all about? Can humans ever survive a trip to the Bermuda Triangle? There are many theories that try to explain the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Bermuda Triangle is an area in the Atlantic Ocean that is twice the size of Texas. That's about 500,000 square miles. The Bermuda Triangle has a triangular shape with ends — geometry teachers would call them vertices — in Miami, Florida, Bermuda and Puerto Rico. Within this triangle of water, compasses often act strangely. Most compasses don't point directly north toward the North Pole. Instead, they point to something called “magnetic north", which is in Canada. In the Bermuda Triangle, however, a compass will often point directly to the North Pole. That's mysterious! There are many more mysterious incidents and unexplained disappearances besides these tragic stories. So far, scientists have not come up with clear reasons to explain the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle.</p>

        <p>Why do oceans and seas matter? We live on a blue planet, with oceans and seas covering more than 70 per cent of the Earth’s surface. Oceans feed us, regulate our climate and generate most of the oxygen we breathe. They also serve as the foundation for much of the world’s economy, supporting sectors from tourism to fisheries to international shipping.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But despite their importance, oceans are facing unprecedented threats as a result of human activity. Every year, an estimated 8 million tonnes of plastic waste end up in the world’s oceans. At the same time, climate change is damaging coral reefs and other key ecosystems; overfishing is threatening the stability of fish stocks; nutrient pollution is contributing to the creation of dead zones; and nearly 80 per cent of the world’s wastewater is discharged without treatment. UN Environment is tackling these challenges head-on. They have initiated several campaigns and work with governments, businesses, universities and civil society groups around the world to promote the protection and sustainable management of our precious marine and coastal environments.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>What lies at the lowest point of the ocean? At the deepest point of the ocean, strange creatures, you have never seen before, thrive. As vast as the planet and undiscovered like space, are the depths of the ocean. While we continue to make progress in biological discoveries, some parts of the ocean are so inaccessible, that we have only discovered a sliver of the truth. But we do know something about the Mariana Trench, the lowest part of the ocean, which surrounds the Mariana islands near Japan.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So, what lies in these treacherously deep, dark waters. Find out if you can afford a scare. Flappy ears, deep-set eyes and eight tiny tentacles; named after the Disney favourite, the Dumbo Octopus is arguably the most eye-soothing sight, found at least 9,800 metres under the sea in the Mariana trench. Hardly spooky, these adorable 8– 12-inch creatures stream through the ocean by flapping their ears. Charming as they may be, the dumbo octopus is a predator that can swallow its prey in one gulp. Then, there’s the Black Seadevil Fish. Any fan of ‘<em>Finding Nemo</em>’ might quickly recognise this fish. Featured as a scary creature in the film, the Black Seadevil is just as terrifying in real life. Sharp teeth, gaping mouth and eyes exploding out of their sockets; this angler fish is known for its luminous antenna-like muscle protruding from its head. This light attracts its prey into close vicinity for an easy catch. These are only two of the amazing creatures of the deepest parts of the ocean.</p>

        <p>In our recent National Poetry Day poll, Samuel Coleridge's poetic ballad, "<em>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</em>" was enthusiastically mentioned by several pollsters. It's a poem most people read when young; quickly falling under the powerful spell of its simple ballad rhyme and rhythm, its dramatic storytelling and ever-shifting imagery. <em>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</em> recounts the experiences of a sailor who has returned from a long sea voyage. The mariner (sailor) stops a man who is on his way to a wedding ceremony and begins to narrate a story. The story is about a man on a voyage by ship, who in one impulsive and terrible act, changes the course of his life – and death. The Mariner faces an inner struggle over the crime he has committed and he must understand his actions and perform his penance.&nbsp;</p>

Flappy ears, deep-set eyes and eight tiny tentacles; named after the Disney favourite, the Dumbo Octopus is arguably the most eye-soothing sight, found at least 9,800 metres under the sea in the Mariana trench. Hardly spooky, these adorable 8– 12-inch creatures stream through the ocean by flapping their ears. Charming as they may be, the dumbo octopus is a predator that can swallow its prey in one gulp. Then, there’s the Black Seadevil Fish. Any fan of ‘<em>Finding Nemo</em>’ might quickly recognise this fish. Featured as a scary creature in the film, the Black Seadevil is just as terrifying in real life. Sharp teeth, gaping mouth and eyes exploding out of their sockets; this angler fish is known for its luminous antenna-like muscle protruding from its head. This light attracts its prey into close vicinity for an easy catch. These are only two of the amazing creatures of the deepest parts of the ocean.</p>

It's a poem most people read when young; quickly falling under the powerful spell of its simple ballad rhyme and rhythm, its dramatic storytelling and ever-shifting imagery. <em>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</em> recounts the experiences of a sailor who has returned from a long sea voyage. The mariner (sailor) stops a man who is on his way to a wedding ceremony and begins to narrate a story. The story is about a man on a voyage by ship, who in one impulsive and terrible act, changes the course of his life – and death. The Mariner faces an inner struggle over the crime he has committed and he must understand his actions and perform his penance.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>On December 5, 1945, five Navy planes took off from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, USA, on a training mission. They flew over the Bermuda Triangle. The men, along with the planes, disappeared and were never seen again. From that day forward, people became fascinated with the Bermuda Triangle. Over the years, numerous ships and aircraft have vanished with no apparent explanation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Are you wondering what the Bermuda Triangle is all about? Can humans ever survive a trip to the Bermuda Triangle? There are many theories that try to explain the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Bermuda Triangle is an area in the Atlantic Ocean that is twice the size of Texas. That's about 500,000 square miles. The Bermuda Triangle has a triangular shape with ends — geometry teachers would call them vertices — in Miami, Florida, Bermuda and Puerto Rico. Within this triangle of water, compasses often act strangely. Most compasses don't point directly north toward the North Pole. Instead, they point to something called “magnetic north", which is in Canada. In the Bermuda Triangle, however, a compass will often point directly to the North Pole. That's mysterious! There are many more mysterious incidents and unexplained disappearances besides these tragic stories. So far, scientists have not come up with clear reasons to explain the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle.</p>

        <p>Why do oceans and seas matter? We live on a blue planet, with oceans and seas covering more than 70 per cent of the Earth’s surface. Oceans feed us, regulate our climate and generate most of the oxygen we breathe. They also serve as the foundation for much of the world’s economy, supporting sectors from tourism to fisheries to international shipping.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But despite their importance, oceans are facing unprecedented threats as a result of human activity. Every year, an estimated 8 million tonnes of plastic waste end up in the world’s oceans. At the same time, climate change is damaging coral reefs and other key ecosystems; overfishing is threatening the stability of fish stocks; nutrient pollution is contributing to the creation of dead zones; and nearly 80 per cent of the world’s wastewater is discharged without treatment. UN Environment is tackling these challenges head-on. They have initiated several campaigns and work with governments, businesses, universities and civil society groups around the world to promote the protection and sustainable management of our precious marine and coastal environments.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>On December 5, 1945, five Navy planes took off from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, USA, on a training mission. They flew over the Bermuda Triangle. The men, along with the planes, disappeared and were never seen again. From that day forward, people became fascinated with the Bermuda Triangle. Over the years, numerous ships and aircraft have vanished with no apparent explanation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Are you wondering what the Bermuda Triangle is all about? Can humans ever survive a trip to the Bermuda Triangle? There are many theories that try to explain the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Bermuda Triangle is an area in the Atlantic Ocean that is twice the size of Texas. That's about 500,000 square miles. The Bermuda Triangle has a triangular shape with ends — geometry teachers would call them vertices — in Miami, Florida, Bermuda and Puerto Rico. Within this triangle of water, compasses often act strangely. Most compasses don't point directly north toward the North Pole. Instead, they point to something called “magnetic north", which is in Canada. In the Bermuda Triangle, however, a compass will often point directly to the North Pole. That's mysterious! There are many more mysterious incidents and unexplained disappearances besides these tragic stories. So far, scientists have not come up with clear reasons to explain the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle.</p>

        <p>Why do oceans and seas matter? We live on a blue planet, with oceans and seas covering more than 70 per cent of the Earth’s surface. Oceans feed us, regulate our climate and generate most of the oxygen we breathe. They also serve as the foundation for much of the world’s economy, supporting sectors from tourism to fisheries to international shipping.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But despite their importance, oceans are facing unprecedented threats as a result of human activity. Every year, an estimated 8 million tonnes of plastic waste end up in the world’s oceans. At the same time, climate change is damaging coral reefs and other key ecosystems; overfishing is threatening the stability of fish stocks; nutrient pollution is contributing to the creation of dead zones; and nearly 80 per cent of the world’s wastewater is discharged without treatment. UN Environment is tackling these challenges head-on. They have initiated several campaigns and work with governments, businesses, universities and civil society groups around the world to promote the protection and sustainable management of our precious marine and coastal environments.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>What lies at the lowest point of the ocean? At the deepest point of the ocean, strange creatures, you have never seen before, thrive. As vast as the planet and undiscovered like space, are the depths of the ocean. While we continue to make progress in biological discoveries, some parts of the ocean are so inaccessible, that we have only discovered a sliver of the truth. But we do know something about the Mariana Trench, the lowest part of the ocean, which surrounds the Mariana islands near Japan.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So, what lies in these treacherously deep, dark waters. Find out if you can afford a scare. Flappy ears, deep-set eyes and eight tiny tentacles; named after the Disney favourite, the Dumbo Octopus is arguably the most eye-soothing sight, found at least 9,800 metres under the sea in the Mariana trench. Hardly spooky, these adorable 8– 12-inch creatures stream through the ocean by flapping their ears. Charming as they may be, the dumbo octopus is a predator that can swallow its prey in one gulp. Then, there’s the Black Seadevil Fish. Any fan of ‘<em>Finding Nemo</em>’ might quickly recognise this fish. Featured as a scary creature in the film, the Black Seadevil is just as terrifying in real life. Sharp teeth, gaping mouth and eyes exploding out of their sockets; this angler fish is known for its luminous antenna-like muscle protruding from its head. This light attracts its prey into close vicinity for an easy catch. These are only two of the amazing creatures of the deepest parts of the ocean.</p>

        <p>In our recent National Poetry Day poll, Samuel Coleridge's poetic ballad, "<em>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</em>" was enthusiastically mentioned by several pollsters. It's a poem most people read when young; quickly falling under the powerful spell of its simple ballad rhyme and rhythm, its dramatic storytelling and ever-shifting imagery. <em>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</em> recounts the experiences of a sailor who has returned from a long sea voyage. The mariner (sailor) stops a man who is on his way to a wedding ceremony and begins to narrate a story. The story is about a man on a voyage by ship, who in one impulsive and terrible act, changes the course of his life – and death. The Mariner faces an inner struggle over the crime he has committed and he must understand his actions and perform his penance.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Freediving is the practice of holding your breath when diving underwater without the use of breathing equipment, such as a scuba tank. Freediving is a way of life for some, a competitive sport for others and a hobby for many. Read on to find out more information about what freediving is and why people are doing it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Recreational freediving is freediving for leisure, such as on vacation or training (noncompetitively) with a certified buddy. People freedive recreationally for many reasons: to challenge themselves physically and mentally, to take beautiful underwater photos, to improve their mental health, to explore the underwater world or to improve their fitness. The reasons are endless. But most freedivers will mention the feeling of peace and calm they have when they dive, and how they use it as a form of meditation and feeling connected to their surroundings. Applied freediving is freediving with a purpose, such as hunting for seafood, various underwater sports, or performing scientific research. Freediving can be a part of daily life for some people, like the female “Ama” divers in Japan that collect pearls and seafood, or the Bajau tribes of Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, who live at the sea and spearfish. Freediving encompasses their existence and is part of their way of life.</p>

        <p>Clearance divers have commando training and are an elite combat group that operates so far under the radar that officially it does not even have a name. But in the Middle East aboard HMAS Toowoomba, the crack boarding team works under the call sign Trident. The men who serve in Trident are part of the "higher end" of the Royal Australian Navy's already elite clearance diver unit. Based in Rockingham, the divers are those tough enough to pass a special forces-style selection course, after which they go on to receive training from the elite 2nd Commando Regiment in Sydney. Trident Commander Lt R said his men were unique. "We're not commandos, we're clearance divers with commando training," he said. "We're trained specifically to conduct high-level boardings, but our main role as clearance divers is mine countermeasures, searching and finding mines to gain access to ports and keep sea lanes open."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On the Toowoomba's flight deck, Trident divers practise shooting at targets with a variety of weapons. Despite the ship rolling and pitching in the Arabian Sea, every time an empty shell casing bounces on the deck a new bullet hole appears in each target. The exact role of the divers on Toowoomba, which is nearing the end of a counter piracy and terrorism mission in the Middle East, could not be disclosed for operational security reasons. "We're here to do whatever is required," Lt R said.</p>

        <p>Jacques Cousteau, 1910 - 1997, was a French naval officer, ocean explorer and coinventor of the Aqua-Lung, known for his extensive underseas investigations. After graduating from France’s naval academy in 1933, he was commissioned a second lieutenant. However, his plans to become a navy pilot were undermined by an almost fatal automobile accident in which both his arms were broken. Cousteau, not formally trained as a scientist, was drawn to undersea exploration by his love for both the ocean and underwater diving.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In 1943, Cousteau and French engineer Émile Gagnan developed the first fully automatic compressed-air Aqua-Lung (scuba apparatus), which allowed divers to swim freely underwater for extended periods of time. Cousteau helped to invent many other tools useful to oceanographers, including the diving saucer (an easily maneuverable small submarine for seafloor exploration), in 1959, and a number of underwater cameras. Cousteau produced and starred in many television programs, including the American series, “<em>The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau </em>(1968– 76)”.</p>

        <p>I'm 35 miles west of Key West, Florida, diving with Mel Fisher's Treasures, a company named for America's most renowned treasure hunter. Over the course of 35 years, Mel Fisher and his divers recovered gold, silver and jewels from some of the richest wrecks in the Western Hemisphere. I’ve seen survey boats tow 4-ft.-long metal "fish" mounted with side-scan sonar (which can help locate piles of ballast rock) and cesium magnetometers, which are used to find chunks of iron from decomposing ships. When wreckage is located, the work becomes even more basic: Scuba divers with metal detectors scour the seabed and excavate artifacts by hand. The wreck I’m working at is the Santa Margarita, which left Havana for Spain in the fall of 1622. The 630-ton galleon and another vessel in the 28-ship convoy, the Nuestra Señora de Atocha, carried emeralds, gold and silver jewelry, and coins and bullion from Central and South America.</p>

However, his plans to become a navy pilot were undermined by an almost fatal automobile accident in which both his arms were broken. Cousteau, not formally trained as a scientist, was drawn to undersea exploration by his love for both the ocean and underwater diving.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In 1943, Cousteau and French engineer Émile Gagnan developed the first fully automatic compressed-air Aqua-Lung (scuba apparatus), which allowed divers to swim freely underwater for extended periods of time. Cousteau helped to invent many other tools useful to oceanographers, including the diving saucer (an easily maneuverable small submarine for seafloor exploration), in 1959, and a number of underwater cameras. Cousteau produced and starred in many television programs, including the American series, “<em>The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau</em> (1968– 76)”.</p>

        <p>I'm 35 miles west of Key West, Florida, diving with Mel Fisher's Treasures, a company named for America's most renowned treasure hunter. Over the course of 35 years, Mel Fisher and his divers recovered gold, silver and jewels from some of the richest wrecks in the Western Hemisphere. I’ve seen survey boats tow 4-ft.-long metal "fish" mounted with side-scan sonar (which can help locate piles of ballast rock) and cesium magnetometers, which are used to find chunks of iron from decomposing ships. When wreckage is located, the work becomes even more basic: Scuba divers with metal detectors scour the seabed and excavate artifacts by hand. The wreck I’m working at is the Santa Margarita, which left Havana for Spain in the fall of 1622. The 630-ton galleon and another vessel in the 28-ship convoy, the Nuestra Señora de Atocha, carried emeralds, gold and silver jewelry, and coins and bullion from Central and South America.</p>

        <p>Freediving is the practice of holding your breath when diving underwater without the use of breathing equipment, such as a scuba tank. Freediving is a way of life for some, a competitive sport for others and a hobby for many. Read on to find out more information about what freediving is and why people are doing it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Recreational freediving is freediving for leisure, such as on vacation or training (noncompetitively) with a certified buddy. People freedive recreationally for many reasons: to challenge themselves physically and mentally, to take beautiful underwater photos, to improve their mental health, to explore the underwater world or to improve their fitness. The reasons are endless. But most freedivers will mention the feeling of peace and calm they have when they dive, and how they use it as a form of meditation and feeling connected to their surroundings. Applied freediving is freediving with a purpose, such as hunting for seafood, various underwater sports, or performing scientific research. Freediving can be a part of daily life for some people, like the female “Ama” divers in Japan that collect pearls and seafood, or the Bajau tribes of Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, who live at the sea and spearfish. Freediving encompasses their existence and is part of their way of life.</p>

        <p>Clearance divers have commando training and are an elite combat group that operates so far under the radar that officially it does not even have a name. But in the Middle East aboard HMAS Toowoomba, the crack boarding team works under the call sign Trident. The men who serve in Trident are part of the "higher end" of the Royal Australian Navy's already elite clearance diver unit. Based in Rockingham, the divers are those tough enough to pass a special forces-style selection course, after which they go on to receive training from the elite 2nd Commando Regiment in Sydney. Trident Commander Lt R said his men were unique. "We're not commandos, we're clearance divers with commando training," he said. "We're trained specifically to conduct high-level boardings, but our main role as clearance divers is mine countermeasures, searching and finding mines to gain access to ports and keep sea lanes open."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On the Toowoomba's flight deck, Trident divers practise shooting at targets with a variety of weapons. Despite the ship rolling and pitching in the Arabian Sea, every time an empty shell casing bounces on the deck a new bullet hole appears in each target. The exact role of the divers on Toowoomba, which is nearing the end of a counter piracy and terrorism mission in the Middle East, could not be disclosed for operational security reasons. "We're here to do whatever is required," Lt R said.</p>

        <p>Freediving is the practice of holding your breath when diving underwater without the use of breathing equipment, such as a scuba tank. Freediving is a way of life for some, a competitive sport for others and a hobby for many. Read on to find out more information about what freediving is and why people are doing it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Recreational freediving is freediving for leisure, such as on vacation or training (noncompetitively) with a certified buddy. People freedive recreationally for many reasons: to challenge themselves physically and mentally, to take beautiful underwater photos, to improve their mental health, to explore the underwater world or to improve their fitness. The reasons are endless. But most freedivers will mention the feeling of peace and calm they have when they dive, and how they use it as a form of meditation and feeling connected to their surroundings. Applied freediving is freediving with a purpose, such as hunting for seafood, various underwater sports, or performing scientific research. Freediving can be a part of daily life for some people, like the female “Ama” divers in Japan that collect pearls and seafood, or the Bajau tribes of Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, who live at the sea and spearfish. Freediving encompasses their existence and is part of their way of life.</p>

        <p>Clearance divers have commando training and are an elite combat group that operates so far under the radar that officially it does not even have a name. But in the Middle East aboard HMAS Toowoomba, the crack boarding team works under the call sign Trident. The men who serve in Trident are part of the "higher end" of the Royal Australian Navy's already elite clearance diver unit. Based in Rockingham, the divers are those tough enough to pass a special forces-style selection course, after which they go on to receive training from the elite 2nd Commando Regiment in Sydney. Trident Commander Lt R said his men were unique. "We're not commandos, we're clearance divers with commando training," he said. "We're trained specifically to conduct high-level boardings, but our main role as clearance divers is mine countermeasures, searching and finding mines to gain access to ports and keep sea lanes open."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On the Toowoomba's flight deck, Trident divers practise shooting at targets with a variety of weapons. Despite the ship rolling and pitching in the Arabian Sea, every time an empty shell casing bounces on the deck a new bullet hole appears in each target. The exact role of the divers on Toowoomba, which is nearing the end of a counter piracy and terrorism mission in the Middle East, could not be disclosed for operational security reasons. "We're here to do whatever is required," Lt R said.</p>

        <p>Jacques Cousteau, 1910 - 1997, was a French naval officer, ocean explorer and coinventor of the Aqua-Lung, known for his extensive underseas investigations. After graduating from France’s naval academy in 1933, he was commissioned a second lieutenant.

        <p>In 1943, Cousteau and French engineer Émile Gagnan developed the first fully automatic compressed-air Aqua-Lung (scuba apparatus), which allowed divers to swim freely underwater for extended periods of time. Cousteau helped to invent many other tools useful to oceanographers, including the diving saucer (an easily maneuverable small submarine for seafloor exploration), in 1959, and a number of underwater cameras. Cousteau produced and starred in many television programs, including the American series, “<em>The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau</em> (1968– 76)”.</p>

        <p>I'm 35 miles west of Key West, Florida, diving with Mel Fisher's Treasures, a company named for America's most renowned treasure hunter. Over the course of 35 years, Mel Fisher and his divers recovered gold, silver and jewels from some of the richest wrecks in the Western Hemisphere. I’ve seen survey boats tow 4-ft.-long metal "fish" mounted with side-scan sonar (which can help locate piles of ballast rock) and cesium magnetometers, which are used to find chunks of iron from decomposing ships. When wreckage is located, the work becomes even more basic: Scuba divers with metal detectors scour the seabed and excavate artifacts by hand. The wreck I’m working at is the Santa Margarita, which left Havana for Spain in the fall of 1622. The 630-ton galleon and another vessel in the 28-ship convoy, the Nuestra Señora de Atocha, carried emeralds, gold and silver jewelry, and coins and bullion from Central and South America.</p>

Cousteau helped to invent many other tools useful to oceanographers, including the diving saucer (an easily maneuverable small submarine for seafloor exploration), in 1959, and a number of underwater cameras. Cousteau produced and starred in many television programs, including the American series, “<em>The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau</em> (1968– 76)”.</p>

        <p>I'm 35 miles west of Key West, Florida, diving with Mel Fisher's Treasures, a company named for America's most renowned treasure hunter. Over the course of 35 years, Mel Fisher and his divers recovered gold, silver and jewels from some of the richest wrecks in the Western Hemisphere. I’ve seen survey boats tow 4-ft.-long metal "fish" mounted with side-scan sonar (which can help locate piles of ballast rock) and cesium magnetometers, which are used to find chunks of iron from decomposing ships. When wreckage is located, the work becomes even more basic: Scuba divers with metal detectors scour the seabed and excavate artifacts by hand. The wreck I’m working at is the Santa Margarita, which left Havana for Spain in the fall of 1622. The 630-ton galleon and another vessel in the 28-ship convoy, the Nuestra Señora de Atocha, carried emeralds, gold and silver jewelry, and coins and bullion from Central and South America.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Freediving is the practice of holding your breath when diving underwater without the use of breathing equipment, such as a scuba tank. Freediving is a way of life for some, a competitive sport for others and a hobby for many. Read on to find out more information about what freediving is and why people are doing it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Recreational freediving is freediving for leisure, such as on vacation or training (noncompetitively) with a certified buddy. People freedive recreationally for many reasons: to challenge themselves physically and mentally, to take beautiful underwater photos, to improve their mental health, to explore the underwater world or to improve their fitness. The reasons are endless. But most freedivers will mention the feeling of peace and calm they have when they dive, and how they use it as a form of meditation and feeling connected to their surroundings. Applied freediving is freediving with a purpose, such as hunting for seafood, various underwater sports, or performing scientific research. Freediving can be a part of daily life for some people, like the female “Ama” divers in Japan that collect pearls and seafood, or the Bajau tribes of Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, who live at the sea and spearfish. Freediving encompasses their existence and is part of their way of life.</p>

        <p>Clearance divers have commando training and are an elite combat group that operates so far under the radar that officially it does not even have a name. But in the Middle East aboard HMAS Toowoomba, the crack boarding team works under the call sign Trident. The men who serve in Trident are part of the "higher end" of the Royal Australian Navy's already elite clearance diver unit. Based in Rockingham, the divers are those tough enough to pass a special forces-style selection course, after which they go on to receive training from the elite 2nd Commando Regiment in Sydney. Trident Commander Lt R said his men were unique. "We're not commandos, we're clearance divers with commando training," he said. "We're trained specifically to conduct high-level boardings, but our main role as clearance divers is mine countermeasures, searching and finding mines to gain access to ports and keep sea lanes open."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On the Toowoomba's flight deck, Trident divers practise shooting at targets with a variety of weapons. Despite the ship rolling and pitching in the Arabian Sea, every time an empty shell casing bounces on the deck a new bullet hole appears in each target. The exact role of the divers on Toowoomba, which is nearing the end of a counter piracy and terrorism mission in the Middle East, could not be disclosed for operational security reasons. "We're here to do whatever is required," Lt R said.</p>

        <p>Jacques Cousteau, 1910 - 1997, was a French naval officer, ocean explorer and coinventor of the Aqua-Lung, known for his extensive underseas investigations. After graduating from France’s naval academy in 1933, he was commissioned a second lieutenant. However, his plans to become a navy pilot were undermined by an almost fatal automobile accident in which both his arms were broken. Cousteau, not formally trained as a scientist, was drawn to undersea exploration by his love for both the ocean and underwater diving.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In 1943, Cousteau and French engineer Émile Gagnan developed the first fully automatic compressed-air Aqua-Lung (scuba apparatus), which allowed divers to swim freely underwater for extended periods of time. Cousteau helped to invent many other tools useful to oceanographers, including the diving saucer (an easily maneuverable small submarine for seafloor exploration), in 1959, and a number of underwater cameras.

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Mark Twain said that “Humour is the great thing, the saving thing after all. The minute it crops up, all our hardnesses yield, all our irritations, and resentments flit away and a sunny spirit takes their place.”<br>
<br>
He is certainly not wrong. Humour may very well be the great thing. It touches upon nearly every facet of life — 90 percent of men and 81 percent of women report that a sense of humour is the most important quality in a partner, it’s a crucial quality for leaders and it’s even been shown to improve cancer treatments.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Humour doesn’t just guard against depression. It also improves people’s overall quality of life. Researchers have found that people who score highly in certain types of humour have better self-esteem, more positive affect, greater self-competency, more control over anxiety and better performance in social interactions.<br>
<br>
In addition to working as a mental immune system, research has shown that humour can actually improve your physical immune system.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Laughter can also improve cardiovascular health and lowers heart rates, blood pressure, and muscular tension. Aside from improving your health, laughter can also lead to greater creativity and a productivity tool as well. This is because laughter lights up the anterior cingulate cortex, an area of the brain associated with attention and decision-making.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There’s no doubt that humour is a life skill that everybody needs, but how do we define it? Can it be taught? The jury is still out on those issues.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
A colleague accused me of having a tendency to over-react, so I have no choice but to burn down his house and wish him only bad luck. Fair’s fair, right? I learned to respond strongly to things from a former boss who used to say the following sentence at least once a day: “Some fool has moved my (random object) and when I find out who did it, God help me, I am going to tear this place down… oh, there it is.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Some people think overreacting is a bad thing but look at the evidence. The richest country in the world is the United States, from which a reader has just sent me a video of a man riding a moped pursued by 12 police cars. A moped, for those who don’t know, is a motorbike powered by an engine with the strength of a mosquito suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But just days later, the US record on maximum overreaction was beaten by a news report sent to me by a reader in Canada. Twelve police squad cars and a tactical attack squad were sent to a block of flats in Winnipeg, Ontario, after an unknown person slammed a door in the building.<br>
<br>
This makes me want to live in Canada. I’ve lived in places where the police don’t even react to murders unless they happen at the actual police station, and even then, the only reaction is an irritated desk sergeant looking up from Candy Crush and raising an eyebrow.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Learning how to be funny is an essential people skill. Most people don’t realise you can learn how to be funny. In fact, I want to convince you that the funniest people hone their witty craft. And being funny matters.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
You’ll be more successful if you know how to make people laugh … but only the good kind of laugh, not the awkward kind: So, this is how you do it. Give the opposite answer to yes/no questions. Play with Numbers e.g. only 2000 people at the small party. Use The Rule of 3, that establishes a pattern, then ends with something unexpected. Use a Character Switch e.g. if you meet a bear in the woods, scary for the bear! Use “Whatever” as Your Secret Weapon. Use real-life stories, not jokes. Delay the funny. Now, I am going to end on something you know: practise makes perfect.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Hey, you don't read this book. Do NOT read this book. Just shut it quietly and put it back where you found it. Look, bozo, I'm not kidding. What is there about the last sentence that you don't understand? Are you being rude or are you just really, really stupid? Can you even read? Let me try it one more time: Shut this book and put it back right now. I see we have an extremely difficult customer here. Take my advice, shut this book and put it back on the shelf. It's for your own good. There are BAD things in this book. REALLY BAD things. Not convinced? Then I'm going to have to list some of the things in this book. Don't blame me if it upsets you. It's not my fault; I warned you. VIOLENCE. Yep. There's blood in this book. Red stuff. It's nasty. It's yucky. It's downright gory. SAD THINGS. I'm talking about accidents, people going insane, even dying. We take no responsibility for any deeply traumatic condition that may yuck up your life if you are stupid enough to read this book despite the loads and loads of warnings telling you not to. Good grief! You really are a pest, aren't you? Well, this is your final chance. Put the book down quietly and go away.<br>

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Mark Twain said that “Humour is the great thing, the saving thing after all. The minute it crops up, all our hardnesses yield, all our irritations, and resentments flit away and a sunny spirit takes their place.”<br>
<br>
He is certainly not wrong. Humour may very well be the great thing. It touches upon nearly every facet of life — 90 percent of men and 81 percent of women report that a sense of humour is the most important quality in a partner, it’s a crucial quality for leaders and it’s even been shown to improve cancer treatments.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Humour doesn’t just guard against depression. It also improves people’s overall quality of life. Researchers have found that people who score highly in certain types of humour have better self-esteem, more positive affect, greater self-competency, more control over anxiety and better performance in social interactions.<br>
<br>
In addition to working as a mental immune system, research has shown that humour can actually improve your physical immune system.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Laughter can also improve cardiovascular health and lowers heart rates, blood pressure, and muscular tension. Aside from improving your health, laughter can also lead to greater creativity and a productivity tool as well. This is because laughter lights up the anterior cingulate cortex, an area of the brain associated with attention and decision-making.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There’s no doubt that humour is a life skill that everybody needs, but how do we define it? Can it be taught? The jury is still out on those issues.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
A colleague accused me of having a tendency to over-react, so I have no choice but to burn down his house and wish him only bad luck. Fair’s fair, right? I learned to respond strongly to things from a former boss who used to say the following sentence at least once a day: “Some fool has moved my (random object) and when I find out who did it, God help me, I am going to tear this place down… oh, there it is.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Some people think overreacting is a bad thing but look at the evidence. The richest country in the world is the United States, from which a reader has just sent me a video of a man riding a moped pursued by 12 police cars. A moped, for those who don’t know, is a motorbike powered by an engine with the strength of a mosquito suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But just days later, the US record on maximum overreaction was beaten by a news report sent to me by a reader in Canada. Twelve police squad cars and a tactical attack squad were sent to a block of flats in Winnipeg, Ontario, after an unknown person slammed a door in the building.<br>
<br>
This makes me want to live in Canada. I’ve lived in places where the police don’t even react to murders unless they happen at the actual police station, and even then, the only reaction is an irritated desk sergeant looking up from Candy Crush and raising an eyebrow.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Learning how to be funny is an essential people skill. Most people don’t realise you can learn how to be funny. In fact, I want to convince you that the funniest people hone their witty craft. And being funny matters.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
You’ll be more successful if you know how to make people laugh … but only the good kind of laugh, not the awkward kind: So, this is how you do it. Give the opposite answer to yes/no questions. Play with Numbers e.g. only 2000 people at the small party. Use The Rule of 3, that establishes a pattern, then ends with something unexpected. Use a Character Switch e.g. if you meet a bear in the woods, scary for the bear! Use “Whatever” as Your Secret Weapon. Use real-life stories, not jokes. Delay the funny. Now, I am going to end on something you know: practise makes perfect.<br>

Hey, you don't read this book. Do NOT read this book. Just shut it quietly and put it back where you found it. Look, bozo, I'm not kidding. What is there about the last sentence that you don't understand? Are you being rude or are you just really, really stupid? Can you even read? Let me try it one more time: Shut this book and put it back right now. I see we have an extremely difficult customer here. Take my advice, shut this book and put it back on the shelf. It's for your own good. There are BAD things in this book. REALLY BAD things. Not convinced? Then I'm going to have to list some of the things in this book. Don't blame me if it upsets you. It's not my fault; I warned you. VIOLENCE. Yep. There's blood in this book. Red stuff. It's nasty. It's yucky. It's downright gory. SAD THINGS. I'm talking about accidents, people going insane, even dying. We take no responsibility for any deeply traumatic condition that may yuck up your life if you are stupid enough to read this book despite the loads and loads of warnings telling you not to. Good grief! You really are a pest, aren't you? Well, this is your final chance. Put the book down quietly and go away.<br>

Mark Twain said that “Humour is the great thing, the saving thing after all. The minute it crops up, all our hardnesses yield, all our irritations, and resentments flit away and a sunny spirit takes their place.”<br>
<br>
He is certainly not wrong. Humour may very well be the great thing. It touches upon nearly every facet of life — 90 percent of men and 81 percent of women report that a sense of humour is the most important quality in a partner, it’s a crucial quality for leaders and it’s even been shown to improve cancer treatments.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Humour doesn’t just guard against depression. It also improves people’s overall quality of life. Researchers have found that people who score highly in certain types of humour have better self-esteem, more positive affect, greater self-competency, more control over anxiety and better performance in social interactions.<br>
<br>
In addition to working as a mental immune system, research has shown that humour can actually improve your physical immune system.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Laughter can also improve cardiovascular health and lowers heart rates, blood pressure, and muscular tension. Aside from improving your health, laughter can also lead to greater creativity and a productivity tool as well. This is because laughter lights up the anterior cingulate cortex, an area of the brain associated with attention and decision-making.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There’s no doubt that humour is a life skill that everybody needs, but how do we define it? Can it be taught? The jury is still out on those issues.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
A colleague accused me of having a tendency to over-react, so I have no choice but to burn down his house and wish him only bad luck. Fair’s fair, right? I learned to respond strongly to things from a former boss who used to say the following sentence at least once a day: “Some fool has moved my (random object) and when I find out who did it, God help me, I am going to tear this place down… oh, there it is.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Some people think overreacting is a bad thing but look at the evidence. The richest country in the world is the United States, from which a reader has just sent me a video of a man riding a moped pursued by 12 police cars. A moped, for those who don’t know, is a motorbike powered by an engine with the strength of a mosquito suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But just days later, the US record on maximum overreaction was beaten by a news report sent to me by a reader in Canada. Twelve police squad cars and a tactical attack squad were sent to a block of flats in Winnipeg, Ontario, after an unknown person slammed a door in the building.<br>
<br>
This makes me want to live in Canada. I’ve lived in places where the police don’t even react to murders unless they happen at the actual police station, and even then, the only reaction is an irritated desk sergeant looking up from Candy Crush and raising an eyebrow.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Learning how to be funny is an essential people skill. Most people don’t realise you can learn how to be funny. In fact, I want to convince you that the funniest people hone their witty craft. And being funny matters.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
You’ll be more successful if you know how to make people laugh … but only the good kind of laugh, not the awkward kind: So, this is how you do it. Give the opposite answer to yes/no questions. Play with Numbers e.g. only 2000 people at the small party. Use The Rule of 3, that establishes a pattern, then ends with something unexpected. Use a Character Switch e.g. if you meet a bear in the woods, scary for the bear! Use “Whatever” as Your Secret Weapon. Use real-life stories, not jokes. Delay the funny. Now, I am going to end on something you know: practise makes perfect.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Hey, you don't read this book. Do NOT read this book. Just shut it quietly and put it back where you found it. Look, bozo, I'm not kidding. What is there about the last sentence that you don't understand? Are you being rude or are you just really, really stupid? Can you even read? Let me try it one more time: Shut this book and put it back right now. I see we have an extremely difficult customer here. Take my advice, shut this book and put it back on the shelf. It's for your own good. There are BAD things in this book. REALLY BAD things. Not convinced? Then I'm going to have to list some of the things in this book. Don't blame me if it upsets you. It's not my fault; I warned you. VIOLENCE. Yep. There's blood in this book. Red stuff. It's nasty. It's yucky. It's downright gory. SAD THINGS. I'm talking about accidents, people going insane, even dying. We take no responsibility for any deeply traumatic condition that may yuck up your life if you are stupid enough to read this book despite the loads and loads of warnings telling you not to. Good grief! You really are a pest, aren't you? Well, this is your final chance. Put the book down quietly and go away.<br>
