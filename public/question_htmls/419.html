          <strong>Home Sweet Catalog Home</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In 1925, the year I turned 13, a Sears catalog changed my life. Up until then my family had rented a tiny three-room apartment on Main Street. My three brothers slept in the bedroom with my parents. My younger sister and I slept on a foldaway sofa in the living room. Daddy didn’t make much money as a coal miner, so having our own house seemed like an impossible dream—that is, until the day the <em>Sears Modern Homes</em> catalog came in the mail. Daddy had ordered the catalog and paid a whole dollar for it. Mama wasn’t too happy about his spending so extravagantly on a catalog, but Daddy said it was worth every penny.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The catalog showed the different houses that could be built from a Sears do-it-yourself home kit. The kit came with everything a family needed to build its very own house. There were blueprints and a book of instructions that showed how to build the house, as well as all the wood, nails, paint, roofing, and so on. Each house had a different name, such as the Salem or the Woodland. Some of the houses were big and some small, but they were all beautiful. It didn’t seem possible that we could ever have a home like one of those.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mama thought Daddy was just dreaming. She looked at the catalog over his shoulder. “John, that house costs more than a thousand dollars!” Mama exclaimed. “We can’t afford that.”</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“There are cheaper houses in here,” Daddy said, flipping to a different page and contemplating the features of another house. “Look! Here’s one that starts around $600—the Estes.” He put the catalog down and looked at my mother. “Grace, you know no bank will give us a loan so we can get our own place. But we can do it if you get a job to help make the extra money.”</p>

        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mama still looked doubtful. It took a while, but Daddy finally wore down Mama’s resistance. Mama found a job as a seamstress, sewing clothes for people. She was able to work from home, so she could still take care of the little ones. I even started collecting soda bottles to make money. After several months we used our family’s small savings to buy a piece of land outside town. Then we all studied the catalog until we just about knew it by heart. We finally decided to order a house called the Solace. It had not one, not two, but <em>three </em>bedrooms—one for my parents, one for the boys, and one for us girls!</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally the big day came. Our kit arrived at the train station, and we had to go pick it up. Daddy borrowed a wagon and two horses to pull the kit. Then he, my older brother Peter, and I rode to the station together. I had read in the catalog that each home kit contained 30,000 pieces, but it didn’t really sink in until I saw how enormous our shipment was. Again and again we loaded the wagon with the pieces we would use to build our house. Again and again we made the trip between the train station and our land. How my arms ached from loading and unloading that wagon!</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;During the weeks before our house arrived, on Daddy’s days off, he and my oldest brother had dug and laid the foundation for the house. The day after our shipment came, we all started to build the frame. Daddy called this the bones of the house—the pieces of wood that would later be covered by the walls and the roof. It was hard work, but Daddy’s excitement was contagious. Even the little kids helped out by sorting the materials. Sears had told the truth—the kit contained everything we needed to build our dream house, including doorknobs, windowpanes, and flooring.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Every minute that Daddy wasn’t working in the mines was spent working on our house. Every day our dream was slowly becoming a reality. Mama was talking about where she would hang the curtains she was making with the material left over from her sewing jobs.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then disaster struck. Daddy became sick with a bad cold that turned into pneumonia. The doctor told us that Daddy had to stay in bed and that it could take him weeks, even months, to get better. Daddy was too sick to argue. The sound of his coughing filled our apartment. Meanwhile, five miles away, our house stood unfinished. It was September, and the days were getting shorter and colder. I knew how badly Daddy had wanted to finish the house before winter, but that seemed unlikely now. Our hopes of ever finishing it started to fade.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One afternoon when Daddy was sleeping, Mama gathered all of us together. There was an <span class="txt-underline">obstinate</span> look on her face. I had seen this look before, when Mama had her mind set on something, and I knew that nothing was going to stand in her way. “I’ve been reading the directions Sears sent,” she said in a firm voice, “and we are going to finish our house.” It was Mama’s turn to take over.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We were surprised, but we weren’t about to argue. Whenever she could, Mama would go to the house and work. She would tell Daddy she was running errands or taking the younger kids out to the park so that he could get his rest. As soon as school was out for the day, my older brother and I would go straight to the house. We built and painted walls. We laid down pine floors. We even put black tar paper on the roof to waterproof it and covered that with shingles. Sometimes Mama got a friend or neighbor to help, but she and my brothers and sister and I did most of the work. The best part was that Daddy didn’t know what we were up to. Several weeks later, when he was feeling much better, he got the surprise of his life. As we all stood inside our new home and looked around, Daddy’s face had the biggest smile I have ever seen.</p>

          <strong>Home Sweet Catalog Home</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In 1925, the year I turned 13, a Sears catalog changed my life. Up until then my family had rented a tiny three-room apartment on Main Street. My three brothers slept in the bedroom with my parents. My younger sister and I slept on a foldaway sofa in the living room. Daddy didn’t make much money as a coal miner, so having our own house seemed like an impossible dream—that is, until the day the <em>Sears Modern Homes</em> catalog came in the mail. Daddy had ordered the catalog and paid a whole dollar for it. Mama wasn’t too happy about his spending so extravagantly on a catalog, but Daddy said it was worth every penny.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The catalog showed the different houses that could be built from a Sears do-it-yourself home kit. The kit came with everything a family needed to build its very own house. There were blueprints and a book of instructions that showed how to build the house, as well as all the wood, nails, paint, roofing, and so on. Each house had a different name, such as the Salem or the Woodland. Some of the houses were big and some small, but they were all beautiful. It didn’t seem possible that we could ever have a home like one of those.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mama thought Daddy was just dreaming. She looked at the catalog over his shoulder. “John, that house costs more than a thousand dollars!” Mama exclaimed. “We can’t afford that.”</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“There are cheaper houses in here,” Daddy said, flipping to a different page and contemplating the features of another house. “Look! Here’s one that starts around $600—the Estes.” He put the catalog down and looked at my mother. “Grace, you know no bank will give us a loan so we can get our own place. But we can do it if you get a job to help make the extra money.”</p>

        </p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mama still looked doubtful. It took a while, but Daddy finally wore down Mama’s resistance. Mama found a job as a seamstress, sewing clothes for people. She was able to work from home, so she could still take care of the little ones. I even started collecting soda bottles to make money. After several months we used our family’s small savings to buy a piece of land outside town. Then we all studied the catalog until we just about knew it by heart. We finally decided to order a house called the Solace. It had not one, not two, but <em>three </em>bedrooms—one for my parents, one for the boys, and one for us girls!</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally the big day came. Our kit arrived at the train station, and we had to go pick it up. Daddy borrowed a wagon and two horses to pull the kit. Then he, my older brother Peter, and I rode to the station together. I had read in the catalog that each home kit contained 30,000 pieces, but it didn’t really sink in until I saw how enormous our shipment was. Again and again we loaded the wagon with the pieces we would use to build our house. Again and again we made the trip between the train station and our land. How my arms ached from loading and unloading that wagon!</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;During the weeks before our house arrived, on Daddy’s days off, he and my oldest brother had dug and laid the foundation for the house. The day after our shipment came, we all started to build the frame. Daddy called this the bones of the house—the pieces of wood that would later be covered by the walls and the roof. It was hard work, but Daddy’s excitement was contagious. Even the little kids helped out by sorting the materials. Sears had told the truth—the kit contained everything we needed to build our dream house, including doorknobs, windowpanes, and flooring.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Every minute that Daddy wasn’t working in the mines was spent working on our house. Every day our dream was slowly becoming a reality. Mama was talking about where she would hang the curtains she was making with the material left over from her sewing jobs.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then disaster struck. Daddy became sick with a bad cold that turned into pneumonia. The doctor told us that Daddy had to stay in bed and that it could take him weeks, even months, to get better. Daddy was too sick to argue. The sound of his coughing filled our apartment. Meanwhile, five miles away, our house stood unfinished. It was September, and the days were getting shorter and colder. I knew how badly Daddy had wanted to finish the house before winter, but that seemed unlikely now. Our hopes of ever finishing it started to fade.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One afternoon when Daddy was sleeping, Mama gathered all of us together. There was an <span class="txt-underline">obstinate</span> look on her face. I had seen this look before, when Mama had her mind set on something, and I knew that nothing was going to stand in her way. “I’ve been reading the directions Sears sent,” she said in a firm voice, “and we are going to finish our house.” It was Mama’s turn to take over.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We were surprised, but we weren’t about to argue. Whenever she could, Mama would go to the house and work. She would tell Daddy she was running errands or taking the younger kids out to the park so that he could get his rest. As soon as school was out for the day, my older brother and I would go straight to the house. We built and painted walls. We laid down pine floors. We even put black tar paper on the roof to waterproof it and covered that with shingles. Sometimes Mama got a friend or neighbor to help, but she and my brothers and sister and I did most of the work. The best part was that Daddy didn’t know what we were up to. Several weeks later, when he was feeling much better, he got the surprise of his life. As we all stood inside our new home and looked around, Daddy’s face had the biggest smile I have ever seen.</p>

          <strong>Home Sweet Catalog Home</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In 1925, the year I turned 13, a Sears catalog changed my life. Up until then my family had rented a tiny three-room apartment on Main Street. My three brothers slept in the bedroom with my parents. My younger sister and I slept on a foldaway sofa in the living room. Daddy didn’t make much money as a coal miner, so having our own house seemed like an impossible dream—that is, until the day the <em>Sears Modern Homes</em> catalog came in the mail. Daddy had ordered the catalog and paid a whole dollar for it. Mama wasn’t too happy about his spending so extravagantly on a catalog, but Daddy said it was worth every penny.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The catalog showed the different houses that could be built from a Sears do-it-yourself home kit. The kit came with everything a family needed to build its very own house. There were blueprints and a book of instructions that showed how to build the house, as well as all the wood, nails, paint, roofing, and so on. Each house had a different name, such as the Salem or the Woodland. Some of the houses were big and some small, but they were all beautiful. It didn’t seem possible that we could ever have a home like one of those.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mama thought Daddy was just dreaming. She looked at the catalog over his shoulder. “John, that house costs more than a thousand dollars!” Mama exclaimed. “We can’t afford that.”</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“There are cheaper houses in here,” Daddy said, flipping to a different page and contemplating the features of another house. “Look! Here’s one that starts around $600—the Estes.” He put the catalog down and looked at my mother. “Grace, you know no bank will give us a loan so we can get our own place. But we can do it if you get a job to help make the extra money.”</p>

        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mama still looked doubtful. It took a while, but Daddy finally wore down Mama’s resistance. Mama found a job as a seamstress, sewing clothes for people. She was able to work from home, so she could still take care of the little ones. I even started collecting soda bottles to make money. After several months we used our family’s small savings to buy a piece of land outside town. Then we all studied the catalog until we just about knew it by heart. We finally decided to order a house called the Solace. It had not one, not two, but <em>three </em>bedrooms—one for my parents, one for the boys, and one for us girls!</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally the big day came. Our kit arrived at the train station, and we had to go pick it up. Daddy borrowed a wagon and two horses to pull the kit. Then he, my older brother Peter, and I rode to the station together. I had read in the catalog that each home kit contained 30,000 pieces, but it didn’t really sink in until I saw how enormous our shipment was. Again and again we loaded the wagon with the pieces we would use to build our house. Again and again we made the trip between the train station and our land. How my arms ached from loading and unloading that wagon!</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;During the weeks before our house arrived, on Daddy’s days off, he and my oldest brother had dug and laid the foundation for the house. The day after our shipment came, we all started to build the frame. Daddy called this the bones of the house—the pieces of wood that would later be covered by the walls and the roof. It was hard work, but Daddy’s excitement was contagious. Even the little kids helped out by sorting the materials. Sears had told the truth—the kit contained everything we needed to build our dream house, including doorknobs, windowpanes, and flooring.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Every minute that Daddy wasn’t working in the mines was spent working on our house. Every day our dream was slowly becoming a reality. Mama was talking about where she would hang the curtains she was making with the material left over from her sewing jobs.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then disaster struck. Daddy became sick with a bad cold that turned into pneumonia. The doctor told us that Daddy had to stay in bed and that it could take him weeks, even months, to get better. Daddy was too sick to argue. The sound of his coughing filled our apartment. Meanwhile, five miles away, our house stood unfinished. It was September, and the days were getting shorter and colder. I knew how badly Daddy had wanted to finish the house before winter, but that seemed unlikely now. Our hopes of ever finishing it started to fade.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One afternoon when Daddy was sleeping, Mama gathered all of us together. There was an <span class="txt-underline">obstinate</span> look on her face. I had seen this look before, when Mama had her mind set on something, and I knew that nothing was going to stand in her way. “I’ve been reading the directions Sears sent,” she said in a firm voice, “and we are going to finish our house.” It was Mama’s turn to take over.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We were surprised, but we weren’t about to argue. Whenever she could, Mama would go to the house and work. She would tell Daddy she was running errands or taking the younger kids out to the park so that he could get his rest. As soon as school was out for the day, my older brother and I would go straight to the house. We built and painted walls. We laid down pine floors. We even put black tar paper on the roof to waterproof it and covered that with shingles. Sometimes Mama got a friend or neighbor to help, but she and my brothers and sister and I did most of the work. The best part was that Daddy didn’t know what we were up to. Several weeks later, when he was feeling much better, he got the surprise of his life. As we all stood inside our new home and looked around, Daddy’s face had the biggest smile I have ever seen.</p>

          <strong>Home Sweet Catalog Home</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In 1925, the year I turned 13, a Sears catalog changed my life. Up until then my family had rented a tiny three-room apartment on Main Street. My three brothers slept in the bedroom with my parents. My younger sister and I slept on a foldaway sofa in the living room. Daddy didn’t make much money as a coal miner, so having our own house seemed like an impossible dream—that is, until the day the <em>Sears Modern Homes</em> catalog came in the mail. Daddy had ordered the catalog and paid a whole dollar for it. Mama wasn’t too happy about his spending so extravagantly on a catalog, but Daddy said it was worth every penny.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The catalog showed the different houses that could be built from a Sears do-it-yourself home kit. The kit came with everything a family needed to build its very own house. There were blueprints and a book of instructions that showed how to build the house, as well as all the wood, nails, paint, roofing, and so on. Each house had a different name, such as the Salem or the Woodland. Some of the houses were big and some small, but they were all beautiful. It didn’t seem possible that we could ever have a home like one of those.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mama thought Daddy was just dreaming. She looked at the catalog over his shoulder. “John, that house costs more than a thousand dollars!” Mama exclaimed. “We can’t afford that.”</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“There are cheaper houses in here,” Daddy said, flipping to a different page and contemplating the features of another house. “Look! Here’s one that starts around $600—the Estes.” He put the catalog down and looked at my mother. “Grace, you know no bank will give us a loan so we can get our own place. But we can do it if you get a job to help make the extra money.”</p>

        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mama still looked doubtful. It took a while, but Daddy finally wore down Mama’s resistance. Mama found a job as a seamstress, sewing clothes for people. She was able to work from home, so she could still take care of the little ones. I even started collecting soda bottles to make money. After several months we used our family’s small savings to buy a piece of land outside town. Then we all studied the catalog until we just about knew it by heart. We finally decided to order a house called the Solace. It had not one, not two, but <em>three </em>bedrooms—one for my parents, one for the boys, and one for us girls!</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally the big day came. Our kit arrived at the train station, and we had to go pick it up. Daddy borrowed a wagon and two horses to pull the kit. Then he, my older brother Peter, and I rode to the station together. I had read in the catalog that each home kit contained 30,000 pieces, but it didn’t really sink in until I saw how enormous our shipment was. Again and again we loaded the wagon with the pieces we would use to build our house. Again and again we made the trip between the train station and our land. How my arms ached from loading and unloading that wagon!</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;During the weeks before our house arrived, on Daddy’s days off, he and my oldest brother had dug and laid the foundation for the house. The day after our shipment came, we all started to build the frame. Daddy called this the bones of the house—the pieces of wood that would later be covered by the walls and the roof. It was hard work, but Daddy’s excitement was contagious. Even the little kids helped out by sorting the materials. Sears had told the truth—the kit contained everything we needed to build our dream house, including doorknobs, windowpanes, and flooring.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Every minute that Daddy wasn’t working in the mines was spent working on our house. Every day our dream was slowly becoming a reality. Mama was talking about where she would hang the curtains she was making with the material left over from her sewing jobs.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then disaster struck. Daddy became sick with a bad cold that turned into pneumonia. The doctor told us that Daddy had to stay in bed and that it could take him weeks, even months, to get better. Daddy was too sick to argue. The sound of his coughing filled our apartment. Meanwhile, five miles away, our house stood unfinished. It was September, and the days were getting shorter and colder. I knew how badly Daddy had wanted to finish the house before winter, but that seemed unlikely now. Our hopes of ever finishing it started to fade.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One afternoon when Daddy was sleeping, Mama gathered all of us together. There was an <span class="txt-underline">obstinate</span> look on her face. I had seen this look before, when Mama had her mind set on something, and I knew that nothing was going to stand in her way. “I’ve been reading the directions Sears sent,” she said in a firm voice, “and we are going to finish our house.” It was Mama’s turn to take over.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We were surprised, but we weren’t about to argue. Whenever she could, Mama would go to the house and work. She would tell Daddy she was running errands or taking the younger kids out to the park so that he could get his rest. As soon as school was out for the day, my older brother and I would go straight to the house. We built and painted walls. We laid down pine floors. We even put black tar paper on the roof to waterproof it and covered that with shingles. Sometimes Mama got a friend or neighbor to help, but she and my brothers and sister and I did most of the work. The best part was that Daddy didn’t know what we were up to. Several weeks later, when he was feeling much better, he got the surprise of his life. As we all stood inside our new home and looked around, Daddy’s face had the biggest smile I have ever seen.</p>

        <p class="txt-ctr"><em>ScienceDaily (Mar. 26, 2007)—</em>An Emory University paleontologist, collaborating with colleagues from Montana State University and Japan, has uncovered the world’s first fossil evidence of burrowing behavior in dinosaurs. The study appears in the current Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences issue online.</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">________________________________________________</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The 95-million-year-old skeletal remains of the&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">diminutive</span> dinosaur—along with the bones of two juveniles—were found tucked into a fossilized chamber at the end of a sediment<sup>1</sup>-filled burrow in southwestern Montana.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“The discovery represents the first scientific evidence that some dinosaurs not only dug burrows but also cared extensively for their young inside their dens,” says Anthony Martin, senior lecturer in Emory’s Department of Environmental Studies, of the newly named species of dinosaur, <em>Oryctodromeus cubicularis</em>, meaning “digging runner of the lair.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The discovery is reported by Martin and his colleagues, David Varricchio, of Montana State University, Bozeman; and Yoshihiro Katsura of Gifu Prefectural Museum in Japan. The study was funded by the Jurassic Foundation and the Department of Earth Sciences at Montana State University.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“The presence of an adult and two juveniles within a denning chamber represents some of the best evidence for dinosaur parental care,” Varricchio says. “The burrow likely protected the adult and young <em>Oryctodromeus cubicularis</em> from predators and harsh environmental conditions. Burrowing behavior may have allowed other dinosaurs to survive in extreme environments such as polar regions and deserts, and questions some end-Cretaceous extinction hypotheses.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The study notes that the dimensions of the burrowing tunnel and its end chamber were only slightly larger than the skeletal remains of the adult <em>Oryctodromeus cubicularis</em>, making it difficult for relatively large predators to enter the tunnel. Through computational analysis, the researchers estimated that the herbivorous<sup>2</sup> dinosaur weighed between 22 kg and 32 kg (48–70 pounds), was 2.1 m long (about seven feet), including a 1.25 m tail (4 feet), and had a trunk breadth of 26 cm to 30 cm (10–12 inches). The juveniles were about 55 to 65 percent the size of the adult.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Because the burrow was filled with sediment, the researchers hypothesize that the dinosaurs had drowned after water breached a nearby riverbank and flooded their den. The sediment, says Martin, helped preserve all three skeletons as well as the burrow structure.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; The dinosaur’s functional morphology<sup>3</sup> gleaned from its skeleton also confirms that <em>Oryctodromeus cubicularis</em> was both a seasoned digger and an accomplished runner. <em>Oryctodromeus cubicularis</em> possessed several physical traits suited for digging: a modified snout that could be used as a shovel; large bony attachments in the shoulder to accommodate powerful muscles; and a robustly built hip that allowed for bracing during digging. In contrast to many modern digging animals, the dinosaur had long hind limbs and was well adapted for running on two legs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In addition to the three dinosaurs found, the team also uncovered fossil evidence of other burrowing animals, most likely invertebrates, which lived alongside <em>Oryctodromeus cubicularis</em>. The finding reinforces the idea that the dinosaur was a burrower.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“As we dug, we found five or six small burrows coming off the main one, filled with the same sediment, which convinced me that this was a dinosaur burrow,” says Martin. “Burrowing vertebrates often live in the same environment with burrowing bees, wasps or beetles.” Martin says he and his colleagues will return to Montana to see if they can find more burrows as previously uncovered fossil evidence indicates that other species of herbivorous dinosaurs often lived in nesting colonies.</p>

        <p class="txt-ctr"><em>ScienceDaily (Mar. 26, 2007)—</em>An Emory University paleontologist, collaborating with colleagues from Montana State University and Japan, has uncovered the world’s first fossil evidence of burrowing behavior in dinosaurs. The study appears in the current Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences issue online.</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">________________________________________________</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The 95-million-year-old skeletal remains of the&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">diminutive</span> dinosaur—along with the bones of two juveniles—were found tucked into a fossilized chamber at the end of a sediment<sup>1</sup>-filled burrow in southwestern Montana.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“The discovery represents the first scientific evidence that some dinosaurs not only dug burrows but also cared extensively for their young inside their dens,” says Anthony Martin, senior lecturer in Emory’s Department of Environmental Studies, of the newly named species of dinosaur, <em>Oryctodromeus cubicularis</em>, meaning “digging runner of the lair.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The discovery is reported by Martin and his colleagues, David Varricchio, of Montana State University, Bozeman; and Yoshihiro Katsura of Gifu Prefectural Museum in Japan. The study was funded by the Jurassic Foundation and the Department of Earth Sciences at Montana State University.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“The presence of an adult and two juveniles within a denning chamber represents some of the best evidence for dinosaur parental care,” Varricchio says. “The burrow likely protected the adult and young <em>Oryctodromeus cubicularis</em> from predators and harsh environmental conditions. Burrowing behavior may have allowed other dinosaurs to survive in extreme environments such as polar regions and deserts, and questions some end-Cretaceous extinction hypotheses.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The study notes that the dimensions of the burrowing tunnel and its end chamber were only slightly larger than the skeletal remains of the adult <em>Oryctodromeus cubicularis</em>, making it difficult for relatively large predators to enter the tunnel. Through computational analysis, the researchers estimated that the herbivorous<sup>2</sup> dinosaur weighed between 22 kg and 32 kg (48–70 pounds), was 2.1 m long (about seven feet), including a 1.25 m tail (4 feet), and had a trunk breadth of 26 cm to 30 cm (10–12 inches). The juveniles were about 55 to 65 percent the size of the adult.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Because the burrow was filled with sediment, the researchers hypothesize that the dinosaurs had drowned after water breached a nearby riverbank and flooded their den. The sediment, says Martin, helped preserve all three skeletons as well as the burrow structure.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; The dinosaur’s functional morphology<sup>3</sup> gleaned from its skeleton also confirms that <em>Oryctodromeus cubicularis</em> was both a seasoned digger and an accomplished runner. <em>Oryctodromeus cubicularis</em> possessed several physical traits suited for digging: a modified snout that could be used as a shovel; large bony attachments in the shoulder to accommodate powerful muscles; and a robustly built hip that allowed for bracing during digging. In contrast to many modern digging animals, the dinosaur had long hind limbs and was well adapted for running on two legs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In addition to the three dinosaurs found, the team also uncovered fossil evidence of other burrowing animals, most likely invertebrates, which lived alongside <em>Oryctodromeus cubicularis</em>. The finding reinforces the idea that the dinosaur was a burrower.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“As we dug, we found five or six small burrows coming off the main one, filled with the same sediment, which convinced me that this was a dinosaur burrow,” says Martin. “Burrowing vertebrates often live in the same environment with burrowing bees, wasps or beetles.” Martin says he and his colleagues will return to Montana to see if they can find more burrows as previously uncovered fossil evidence indicates that other species of herbivorous dinosaurs often lived in nesting colonies.</p>

        <p class="txt-ctr">________________________________________________</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The 95-million-year-old skeletal remains of the&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">diminutive</span> dinosaur—along with the bones of two juveniles—were found tucked into a fossilized chamber at the end of a sediment<sup>1</sup>-filled burrow in southwestern Montana.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“The discovery represents the first scientific evidence that some dinosaurs not only dug burrows but also cared extensively for their young inside their dens,” says Anthony Martin, senior lecturer in Emory’s Department of Environmental Studies, of the newly named species of dinosaur, <em>Oryctodromeus cubicularis</em>, meaning “digging runner of the lair.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The discovery is reported by Martin and his colleagues, David Varricchio, of Montana State University, Bozeman; and Yoshihiro Katsura of Gifu Prefectural Museum in Japan. The study was funded by the Jurassic Foundation and the Department of Earth Sciences at Montana State University.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“The presence of an adult and two juveniles within a denning chamber represents some of the best evidence for dinosaur parental care,” Varricchio says. “The burrow likely protected the adult and young <em>Oryctodromeus cubicularis</em> from predators and harsh environmental conditions. Burrowing behavior may have allowed other dinosaurs to survive in extreme environments such as polar regions and deserts, and questions some end-Cretaceous extinction hypotheses.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The study notes that the dimensions of the burrowing tunnel and its end chamber were only slightly larger than the skeletal remains of the adult <em>Oryctodromeus cubicularis</em>, making it difficult for relatively large predators to enter the tunnel. Through computational analysis, the researchers estimated that the herbivorous<sup>2</sup> dinosaur weighed between 22 kg and 32 kg (48–70 pounds), was 2.1 m long (about seven feet), including a 1.25 m tail (4 feet), and had a trunk breadth of 26 cm to 30 cm (10–12 inches). The juveniles were about 55 to 65 percent the size of the adult.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Because the burrow was filled with sediment, the researchers hypothesize that the dinosaurs had drowned after water breached a nearby riverbank and flooded their den. The sediment, says Martin, helped preserve all three skeletons as well as the burrow structure.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; The dinosaur’s functional morphology<sup>3</sup> gleaned from its skeleton also confirms that <em>Oryctodromeus cubicularis</em> was both a seasoned digger and an accomplished runner. <em>Oryctodromeus cubicularis</em> possessed several physical traits suited for digging: a modified snout that could be used as a shovel; large bony attachments in the shoulder to accommodate powerful muscles; and a robustly built hip that allowed for bracing during digging. In contrast to many modern digging animals, the dinosaur had long hind limbs and was well adapted for running on two legs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In addition to the three dinosaurs found, the team also uncovered fossil evidence of other burrowing animals, most likely invertebrates, which lived alongside <em>Oryctodromeus cubicularis</em>. The finding reinforces the idea that the dinosaur was a burrower.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“As we dug, we found five or six small burrows coming off the main one, filled with the same sediment, which convinced me that this was a dinosaur burrow,” says Martin. “Burrowing vertebrates often live in the same environment with burrowing bees, wasps or beetles.” Martin says he and his colleagues will return to Montana to see if they can find more burrows as previously uncovered fossil evidence indicates that other species of herbivorous dinosaurs often lived in nesting colonies.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Because the burrow was filled with sediment, the researchers hypothesize that the dinosaurs had drowned after water breached a nearby riverbank and flooded their den. The sediment, says Martin, helped preserve all three skeletons as well as the burrow structure.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; The dinosaur’s functional morphology<sup>3</sup> gleaned from its skeleton also confirms that <em>Oryctodromeus cubicularis</em> was both a seasoned digger and an accomplished runner. <em>Oryctodromeus cubicularis</em> possessed several physical traits suited for digging: a modified snout that could be used as a shovel; large bony attachments in the shoulder to accommodate powerful muscles; and a robustly built hip that allowed for bracing during digging. In contrast to many modern digging animals, the dinosaur had long hind limbs and was well adapted for running on two legs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In addition to the three dinosaurs found, the team also uncovered fossil evidence of other burrowing animals, most likely invertebrates, which lived alongside <em>Oryctodromeus cubicularis</em>. The finding reinforces the idea that the dinosaur was a burrower.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“As we dug, we found five or six small burrows coming off the main one, filled with the same sediment, which convinced me that this was a dinosaur burrow,” says Martin. “Burrowing vertebrates often live in the same environment with burrowing bees, wasps or beetles.” Martin says he and his colleagues will return to Montana to see if they can find more burrows as previously uncovered fossil evidence indicates that other species of herbivorous dinosaurs often lived in nesting colonies.</p>
