With new video game consoles out, Microsoft and Sony are decades-long incumbents in the industry. But that wasn't always the case. More than 25 years ago, Sony unleashed its first PlayStation, barging into a marketplace dominated by Nintendo and, to a lesser extent, Sega. Seven years later, Microsoft brought forth its Xbox. Whether you are voting with your wallet this holiday season for a new Xbox Series X or S, or PlayStation 5, you must agree that these two tech giants have made countless contributions to advance video gaming over the years.<br>
<br>
Sony and Microsoft also expanded the audience. The PlayStation was released in the U.S. in September 1995, and would sell more than 102 million units, blasting past sales figures for previous video game consoles that connected to TVs. Nintendo continued to dominate in portable game systems, but it would be a decade until one of its consoles cracked the&nbsp;100 million sales mark: The Wii, released in November 2006, would go on to sell 101.6 million consoles.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Sony solidified its position with the PlayStation 2, a console that remains the biggest top-seller ever at more than 155 million systems sold. In comparison, the PlayStation 4 has sold more than 113.5 million since its arrival seven years ago. As the latest consoles arrive in homes, Microsoft is gaining on Sony for dominance. And the tech titans are building out cloud-based game services – as are competitors Google, Amazon and Facebook.<br>

As we watch our children and teens use screens more often to play video games during the COVID-19 pandemic, many parents wonder: How much is too much? People are spending a lot more time staring at digital screens. But after your kids log off from school and homework for the day, is it okay if they spend a few hours gaming with their friends? When video game lives replace real-life time with family and friends, is it a sign of addiction? There is growing research on the effects of video games on children.<br>
<br>
Too much video gaming can lead to poor social skills, time away from family, schoolwork and other hobbies, lower grades, reading less, exercising less, becoming overweight, and having aggressive thoughts and behaviours. Children play video games at the expense of homework, sleep, exercise or relationships with family and friends. Children may end up having depression, anxiety, shyness, aggression, and problems with too much cell phone use. Children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) may be particularly vulnerable.<br>

Which are the most popular video games at present? Let’s take a look. In third place is Wow. Who would have thought that World of Warcraft would make the list? This is another genre-defining game. Unfathomable amounts of total in-game hours, millions of subscribers, and never enough loot. This MMORPG has really made a name for itself, and that name is Popular. In CounterStrike, Counter-Terrorists win the 2nd place price in the popularity contest! We had to put a real old school, original gangster game up here near the peak of video game popularity. In its age and its continued popularity, it’s earned this spot. We heard the Xbox version was getting remastered for Xbox One (just kidding, don’t believe us, we aren’t telling the truth). But top of the popularity pile is Minecraft. Companies are building office buildings inside Minecraft on private servers! And they actually use the building to meet with clients and discuss business! That doesn’t happen if you’re an unpopular game. Minecraft exploded onto the scene and has continued to snowball ever since. It’s everywhere. Adults are playing it, tiny baby kids are playing it, and we’ll get in there and carve out the occasional secret hobbit hole. It’s so charming and fun, and it’s comfortable in any social setting or social circle. Yeah, Minecraft is the king of the school this time around.<br>

Should a video game be enjoyable from the beginning? My answer is a resounding yes. Similar to books and movies, you need to open strong and finish stronger. Super Mario 3D Land, for example, is great from beginning to end. On the console side, the same can be said of Mass Effect 2. The best game designers are not only aware of this, but know how to execute. The rest stumble around hoping to have epiphanies of their own. In most cases, I give a video game a good 30 minutes to grab my attention, and for smart phone games, it's considerably less, more like five to ten minutes. After that, my eyes start to glaze over, I begin fumbling around and there may even be a yawn or two.<br>

How many planets make up our solar system? There are eight planets in our solar system, which is part of the Milky Way galaxy. Pluto was once called the ninth planet in our solar system, but the International Astronomical Union made some category changes in 2006 and Pluto became a minor, or dwarf planet. The main reason for this decision is that Pluto’s wild-card orbit crosses the orbit of Neptune. The idea of a ninth planet has persisted, and astronomers are now searching for Planet X, or Planet Nine, after mathematical evidence from 2016. Planet Nine is thought to be five thousand times the mass of Pluto and 10 times the mass of Earth, and to orbit beyond Neptune. The planets are typically ordered by their distance from the Sun, with Mercury being the closest. Half of the eight planets are known as the terrestrial, or inner, planets - with Mercury being closest to the Sun, followed by Venus, Earth, and then Mars. The other half are the Jovian, or Jupiter-like planets. In order of distance from the Sun, these are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.&nbsp;<br>

The Little Prince asked me: “What is that object?”&nbsp;<br>
“That is not an object. It flies. It is an air-plane. It is my air-plane.” And I was proud to have him learn that I could fly. He cried out, then “What! You dropped down from the sky?”<br>
“Yes,” I answered, modestly.<br>
“Oh! That is funny!” And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter, which irritated me very much. Then he added: “So you, too, come from the sky! Which is your planet?” At&nbsp;that moment I caught a gleam of light in the impenetrable mystery of his presence; and I demanded, abruptly: “Do you come from another planet?” But he did not reply. He tossed his head gently, without taking his eyes from my plane: “It is true that on that you can’t have come from very far away...” Then the little prince said, earnestly: “That doesn’t matter. Where I live, everything is so small!” And, with perhaps a hint of sadness, he added: “Straight ahead of you, nobody can go very far...” I had thus learned a second fact of great importance: this was that the planet the little prince came from was scarcely any larger than a house!<br>

THE COMING OF THE MARTIANS. No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man’s and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinised and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their control over physical matter. It is possible that small creatures under the microscope do the same. No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources of human danger, or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable.<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue-green planet whose ape-descended life forms still think that digital watches are a pretty neat idea. This planet has – or rather had – a problem, which was this; most people living on it were unhappy for pretty much most of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn’t the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy. And then one Thursday ... a girl sitting in a café in Rickmansworth suddenly realised what had been going wrong ... and how the world could be made a happy and good place. Sadly, however, before she could tell anyone about it, a terrible, stupid catastrophe occurred and the idea was lost for ever.<br>

How many planets make up our solar system? There are eight planets in our solar system, which is part of the Milky Way galaxy. Pluto was once called the ninth planet in our solar system, but the International Astronomical Union made some category changes in 2006 and Pluto became a minor, or dwarf planet. The main reason for this decision is that Pluto’s wild-card orbit crosses the orbit of Neptune. The idea of a ninth planet has persisted, and astronomers are now searching for Planet X, or Planet Nine, after mathematical evidence from 2016. Planet Nine is thought to be five thousand times the mass of Pluto and 10 times the mass of Earth, and to orbit beyond Neptune. The planets are typically ordered by their distance from the Sun, with Mercury being the closest. Half of the eight planets are known as the terrestrial, or inner, planets - with Mercury being closest to the Sun, followed by Venus, Earth, and then Mars. The other half are the Jovian, or Jupiter-like planets. In order of distance from the Sun, these are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.&nbsp;<br>

The Little Prince asked me: “What is that object?”&nbsp;<br>
“That is not an object. It flies. It is an air-plane. It is my air-plane.” And I was proud to have him learn that I could fly. He cried out, then “What! You dropped down from the sky?”<br>
“Yes,” I answered, modestly.<br>
“Oh! That is funny!” And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter, which irritated me very much. Then he added: “So you, too, come from the sky! Which is your planet?” At&nbsp;that moment I caught a gleam of light in the impenetrable mystery of his presence; and I demanded, abruptly: “Do you come from another planet?” But he did not reply. He tossed his head gently, without taking his eyes from my plane: “It is true that on that you can’t have come from very far away...” Then the little prince said, earnestly: “That doesn’t matter. Where I live, everything is so small!” And, with perhaps a hint of sadness, he added: “Straight ahead of you, nobody can go very far...” I had thus learned a second fact of great importance: this was that the planet the little prince came from was scarcely any larger than a house!<br>

THE COMING OF THE MARTIANS. No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man’s and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinised and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their control over physical matter. It is possible that small creatures under the microscope do the same. No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources of human danger, or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable.<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue-green planet whose ape-descended life forms still think that digital watches are a pretty neat idea. This planet has – or rather had – a problem, which was this; most people living on it were unhappy for pretty much most of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn’t the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy. And then one Thursday ... a girl sitting in a café in Rickmansworth suddenly realised what had been going wrong ... and how the world could be made a happy and good place. Sadly, however, before she could tell anyone about it, a terrible, stupid catastrophe occurred and the idea was lost for ever.<br>
