          <strong>Extract from “Growing Up Amish”</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>From the outside, it might seem that Amish kids must be bored. Nothing to do but work and play around the home and farm. No TV, no video games. No computers. Not even so much as a bicycle in most communities. Children have only their imaginations, homemade toys, and maybe a little red wagon. But I can’t recall ever being bored.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We were always tackling some project – building dams across the little creek behind the barn after a hard rain, chasing some adventure in field and woods and pond. And working, of course. From about the age of three, each of us had our own chores to do.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With all that going on, we didn’t have time to be bored, although there was one possible exception: church, where we had to sit, silent and still, on wooden, backless benches for what seemed like an eternity.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And it quite nearly was, because the Amish church services are long affairs, usually lasting around three hours, sometimes longer. Services are held in homes, a practice dating back to our Anabaptist roots during a time when the authorities actively hunted and prosecuted those they deemed heretics. In an effort to avoid unwanted attention, our forefathers were forced to hold church services secretly in their homes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Early Anabaptists, fearing persecution from the State authorities, were forced to meet in secret, in forests and in caves. Churches of the State Catholic church were seen as symbols of excess and worldliness. Anabaptists at the time—as well as Amish today—did not see much practical value in constructing a church building to be used only occasionally. The informal nature of church meetings continued as persecution died down and the Anabaptists were able to worship more openly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amish also take a literal Biblical view of church not as a physical building, but as the people that comprise it. Holding church service in a variety of changing venues emphasises the importance of the body of believers as the church and diminishes the importance of the structure itself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amish church occurs every two weeks, rotating among members of a given church district. An Amish family will prepare well ahead of time for church, cleaning the home and getting together food for the after-church meal. Visiting and viewing a member’s home for church is also an informal means of helping to uphold church standards. Amish housewives in particular will take pains to present a tidy home. A large enclosed wagon, known as a church wagon, will bring the benches and song books the Amish use to its latest destination.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On the day of church, the man of the house or his sons serve as hostlers, helping guests stable and water their horses. Men will meet typically in the barn, and go around the line shaking hands. Men will chat while waiting for others to arrive. In some districts all male church members will walk down the line of men in order to exchange the holy kiss. In others only the ministers will exchange this Biblical greeting (mentioned in Scriptural passages such as I Peter 5:14 and I Corinthians 16:20). Women meet separately in the home.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A little before 9 am, men will begin filing into the structure where church will be held, commonly a basement, shop, room of the home, or sometimes barn (particularly in more conservative affiliations). Women are already seated when men begin to enter. Ministers and older men enter first, followed by younger married men, and finally, unbaptised youth and boys. Men sit on one side of the room and women on the other, facing each other.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amish emphasise Scriptural values of unity, humility, and submission. The church is seen as one body, and maintaining the purity of that body is paramount. Amish will hold Communion services twice a year, a very important ritual which is an opportunity to work out any contentious church issues, reaffirm commitment to the&nbsp;<em>Ordnung</em>,&nbsp;and which generally serves as a “symbolic cleansing” of the church body.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Communion service lasts all day, and includes the consumption of bread and wine, as well as the rite of footwashing. Amish values of humility and unity are fully evident in this biannual event. Coming together for Communion is meant to be a joyous occasion of renewal.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Amish church service reflects key values of the Amish approach to Christianity. Amish see the church as existing in the body of believers and not in a physical institution. Amish services are simple and emphasise Scripture. Amish songs gives praise to God and acknowledges the suffering of their Anabaptist martyr predecessors. Amish values of brotherhood, unity, and humility are all exhibited in preaching, prayer, and kneeling during the church service.</p>

        <p>We were always tackling some project – building dams across the little creek behind the barn after a hard rain, chasing some adventure in field and woods and pond. And working, of course. From about the age of three, each of us had our own chores to do.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With all that going on, we didn’t have time to be bored, although there was one possible exception: church, where we had to sit, silent and still, on wooden, backless benches for what seemed like an eternity.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And it quite nearly was, because the Amish church services are long affairs, usually lasting around three hours, sometimes longer. Services are held in homes, a practice dating back to our Anabaptist roots during a time when the authorities actively hunted and prosecuted those they deemed heretics. In an effort to avoid unwanted attention, our forefathers were forced to hold church services secretly in their homes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Early Anabaptists, fearing persecution from the State authorities, were forced to meet in secret, in forests and in caves. Churches of the State Catholic church were seen as symbols of excess and worldliness. Anabaptists at the time—as well as Amish today—did not see much practical value in constructing a church building to be used only occasionally. The informal nature of church meetings continued as persecution died down and the Anabaptists were able to worship more openly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amish also take a literal Biblical view of church not as a physical building, but as the people that comprise it. Holding church service in a variety of changing venues emphasises the importance of the body of believers as the church and diminishes the importance of the structure itself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amish church occurs every two weeks, rotating among members of a given church district. An Amish family will prepare well ahead of time for church, cleaning the home and getting together food for the after-church meal. Visiting and viewing a member’s home for church is also an informal means of helping to uphold church standards. Amish housewives in particular will take pains to present a tidy home. A large enclosed wagon, known as a church wagon, will bring the benches and song books the Amish use to its latest destination.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On the day of church, the man of the house or his sons serve as hostlers, helping guests stable and water their horses. Men will meet typically in the barn, and go around the line shaking hands. Men will chat while waiting for others to arrive. In some districts all male church members will walk down the line of men in order to exchange the holy kiss. In others only the ministers will exchange this Biblical greeting (mentioned in Scriptural passages such as I Peter 5:14 and I Corinthians 16:20). Women meet separately in the home.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A little before 9 am, men will begin filing into the structure where church will be held, commonly a basement, shop, room of the home, or sometimes barn (particularly in more conservative affiliations). Women are already seated when men begin to enter. Ministers and older men enter first, followed by younger married men, and finally, unbaptised youth and boys. Men sit on one side of the room and women on the other, facing each other.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amish emphasise Scriptural values of unity, humility, and submission. The church is seen as one body, and maintaining the purity of that body is paramount. Amish will hold Communion services twice a year, a very important ritual which is an opportunity to work out any contentious church issues, reaffirm commitment to the&nbsp;<em>Ordnung</em>,&nbsp;and which generally serves as a “symbolic cleansing” of the church body.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Communion service lasts all day, and includes the consumption of bread and wine, as well as the rite of footwashing. Amish values of humility and unity are fully evident in this biannual event. Coming together for Communion is meant to be a joyous occasion of renewal.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Amish church service reflects key values of the Amish approach to Christianity. Amish see the church as existing in the body of believers and not in a physical institution. Amish services are simple and emphasise Scripture. Amish songs gives praise to God and acknowledges the suffering of their Anabaptist martyr predecessors. Amish values of brotherhood, unity, and humility are all exhibited in preaching, prayer, and kneeling during the church service.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>From the outside, it might seem that Amish kids must be bored. Nothing to do but work and play around the home and farm. No TV, no video games. No computers. Not even so much as a bicycle in most communities. Children have only their imaginations, homemade toys, and maybe a little red wagon. But I can’t recall ever being bored.&nbsp;</p>

The informal nature of church meetings continued as persecution died down and the Anabaptists were able to worship more openly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amish also take a literal Biblical view of church not as a physical building, but as the people that comprise it. Holding church service in a variety of changing venues emphasises the importance of the body of believers as the church and diminishes the importance of the structure itself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amish church occurs every two weeks, rotating among members of a given church district. An Amish family will prepare well ahead of time for church, cleaning the home and getting together food for the after-church meal. Visiting and viewing a member’s home for church is also an informal means of helping to uphold church standards. Amish housewives in particular will take pains to present a tidy home. A large enclosed wagon, known as a church wagon, will bring the benches and song books the Amish use to its latest destination.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On the day of church, the man of the house or his sons serve as hostlers, helping guests stable and water their horses. Men will meet typically in the barn, and go around the line shaking hands. Men will chat while waiting for others to arrive. In some districts all male church members will walk down the line of men in order to exchange the holy kiss. In others only the ministers will exchange this Biblical greeting (mentioned in Scriptural passages such as I Peter 5:14 and I Corinthians 16:20). Women meet separately in the home.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A little before 9 am, men will begin filing into the structure where church will be held, commonly a basement, shop, room of the home, or sometimes barn (particularly in more conservative affiliations). Women are already seated when men begin to enter. Ministers and older men enter first, followed by younger married men, and finally, unbaptised youth and boys. Men sit on one side of the room and women on the other, facing each other.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amish emphasise Scriptural values of unity, humility, and submission. The church is seen as one body, and maintaining the purity of that body is paramount. Amish will hold Communion services twice a year, a very important ritual which is an opportunity to work out any contentious church issues, reaffirm commitment to the&nbsp;<em>Ordnung</em>,&nbsp;and which generally serves as a “symbolic cleansing” of the church body.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Communion service lasts all day, and includes the consumption of bread and wine, as well as the rite of footwashing. Amish values of humility and unity are fully evident in this biannual event. Coming together for Communion is meant to be a joyous occasion of renewal.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Amish church service reflects key values of the Amish approach to Christianity. Amish see the church as existing in the body of believers and not in a physical institution. Amish services are simple and emphasise Scripture. Amish songs gives praise to God and acknowledges the suffering of their Anabaptist martyr predecessors. Amish values of brotherhood, unity, and humility are all exhibited in preaching, prayer, and kneeling during the church service.</p>

        <p>Of his socks too – it’s purplish and green</p>
        <p>With a darn in the heel. His sister Jean</p>

        <p>After the visit to the pantomime?</p>

        <p>Well I think that’s all. I will close now,</p>
        <p>Best wishes, yours sincerely, Maureen Howe</p>
        <p>(Mrs). PS I did once write before</p>
        <p>About his father’s hat that Raymond wore</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the school play and later could not find,</p>
        <p>But got no reply. Still, never mind,</p>
        <p>Raymond tells me now he might have lost the note,</p>
        <p>Or left it in the pocket of his coat.</p>

          <strong>WHAT TYPE OF PEOPLE ARE MOST LIKELY TO BE SCAMMED?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If you think you aren’t at risk of being scammed, then you’re likely at risk of being a victim. <strong>12 ………. </strong>The most vulnerable people are not those who most people would expect, especially the potential targets themselves.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>People think of the stereotypical financial fraud victim as a frail elderly person living alone who probably has reduced cognitive functions. <strong>13 ……….</strong> Financial abuse is different from fraud. Research done in the last few years, including a study sponsored by AARP, indicates fraud victims are far from that stereotype. <strong>14 ………. </strong>and also, the times when each of us is most vulnerable.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A key to remember is that if you believe you aren’t likely to be scammed, then you’re at greater risk than others.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>15 ………. </strong>Also, the more of a risk-taker a person is, the more likely he or she is to be scammed.<strong> 16 ………. </strong>To them, acquiring wealth is an important achievement in life.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>17 ……….</strong> Even after being scammed, they continue to be open to and even seek new and unconventional investment opportunities, sometimes reasoning that they need to make up their previous losses.</p>

        <p>A key to remember is that if you believe you aren’t likely to be scammed, then you’re at greater risk than others.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>17 ……….</strong> Even after being scammed, they continue to be open to and even seek new and unconventional investment opportunities, sometimes reasoning that they need to make up their previous losses.</p>

          <strong>WHAT TYPE OF PEOPLE ARE MOST LIKELY TO BE SCAMMED?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If you think you aren’t at risk of being scammed, then you’re likely at risk of being a victim. <strong>12 ………. </strong>The most vulnerable people are not those who most people would expect, especially the potential targets themselves.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>People think of the stereotypical financial fraud victim as a frail elderly person living alone who probably has reduced cognitive functions. <strong>13 ……….</strong> Financial abuse is different from fraud. Research done in the last few years, including a study sponsored by AARP, indicates fraud victims are far from that stereotype. <strong>14 ………. </strong>and also, the times when each of us is most vulnerable.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A key to remember is that if you believe you aren’t likely to be scammed, then you’re at greater risk than others.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>15 ………. </strong>Also, the more of a risk-taker a person is, the more likely he or she is to be scammed.<strong> 16 ………. </strong>To them, acquiring wealth is an important achievement in life.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>17 ……….</strong> Even after being scammed, they continue to be open to and even seek new and unconventional investment opportunities, sometimes reasoning that they need to make up their previous losses.</p>

The only real limitation of power is the natural consequences of the principles themselves. We are free to choose our own actions, based on our knowledge of correct principles, but we are not free to choose the consequences of those actions.&nbsp; Remember, “If you pick up one end of the stick, you pick up the other.”<br>
<br>
Principles always have natural consequences attached to them. There are positive consequences when we live in harmony with the principles. There are negative consequences when we ignore them. The more we know of correct principles, the greater our personal freedom to act wisely is.<br>

Habits are powerful factors in our lives. Because they are consistent, often unconscious patterns, they constantly, daily, express our character and produce our effectiveness... or ineffectiveness. As Horace Mann, the great educator, once said, “Habits are like a cable. We weave a strand of it every day and soon it cannot be broken.” I personally do not agree with the last part of his expression. I know they can be broken. Habits can be learned and unlearned. But I also know it isn’t a quick fix. It involves a process and tremendous commitment.<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C&nbsp;</strong>^}<br>
On the maturity continuum, dependence is the paradigm of you – you take care of me, you come through for me, you didn’t come through. I blame you for the results. Independence is the paradigm of I. I can do it. I am responsible. I can choose. Interdependence is the paradigm of we. We can do it. We can combine our talents.<br>
<br>
Dependent people need others to get what they want. Independent people can get what they want through their own effort. Interdependent people combine their own efforts with the efforts of others to achieve their greatest success.<br>

We are not our feelings. We are not our moods. We are not even our thoughts. The very fact that we can think about these things separates us from them and from the animal world. Self-awareness enables us to stand apart and examine even the way we “see” ourselves – our self-paradigm, the most fundamental paradigm of effectiveness. It affects not only our attitudes and behaviours, but also how we see other people. It becomes our map of the basic nature of mankind.</div>

            <p>Habits are powerful factors in our lives. Because they are consistent, often unconscious patterns, they constantly, daily, express our character and produce our effectiveness… or ineffectiveness. As Horace Mann, the great educator, once said, “Habits are like a cable. We weave a strand of it every day and soon it cannot be broken.” I personally do not agree with the last part of his expression. I know they can be broken. Habits can be learned and unlearned. But I also know it isn’t a quick fix. It involves a process and tremendous commitment.</p>

            <p>The only real limitation of power is the natural consequences of the principles themselves. We are free to choose our own actions, based on our knowledge of correct principles, but we are not free to choose the consequences of those actions. Remember, “If you pick up one end of the stick, you pick up the other.”</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Principles always have natural consequences attached to them. There are positive consequences when we live in harmony with the principles. There are negative consequences when we ignore them. The more we know of correct principles, the greater our personal freedom to act wisely is.</p>

            <p>Habits are powerful factors in our lives. Because they are consistent, often unconscious patterns, they constantly, daily, express our character and produce our effectiveness… or ineffectiveness. As Horace Mann, the great educator, once said, “Habits are like a cable. We weave a strand of it every day and soon it cannot be broken.” I personally do not agree with the last part of his expression. I know they can be broken. Habits can be learned and unlearned. But I also know it isn’t a quick fix. It involves a process and tremendous commitment.</p>
