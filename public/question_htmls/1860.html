          <strong>The Adventures of Huck Finn</strong>
        </p>
        <p>He was barefooted, and the snake bit him right on the heel. That all comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it. Jim told me to chop off the snake’s head and throw it away, and then skin the body and roast a piece of it. I done it, and he eat it and said it would help cure him. He made me take off the rattles and tie them around his wrist, too. He said that that would help. Then I slid out quiet and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for I warn’t going to let Jim find out it was all my fault, not if I could help it.</p>
        <p>Jim sucked and sucked at the jug, and now and then he got out of his head and pitched around and yelled; but every time he come to himself he went to sucking at the jug again. His foot swelled up pretty big, and so did his leg; but by and by the drunk begun to come, and so I judged he was all right; but I’d druther been bit with a snake than pap’s whisky.</p>
        <p>Jim was laid up for four days and nights. Then the swelling was all gone and he was around again. I made up my mind I wouldn’t ever take a-holt of a snake-skin again with my hands, now that I see what had come of it. Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time. And he said that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn’t got to the end of it yet. He said he druther see the new moon over his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snake-skin in his hand. Well, I was getting to feel that way myself, though I’ve always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do….</p>
        <p>Well, the days went along, and the river went down between its banks again; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was as big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two hundred pounds. We couldn’t handle him, of course; he would a flung us into Illinois. We just set there and watched him rip and tear around till he drownded. We found a brass button in his stomach and a round ball, and lots of rubbage. We split the ball open with the hatchet, and there was a spool in it. Jim said he’d had it there a long time, to coat it over so and make a ball of it. It was as big a fish as was ever catched in the Mississippi, I reckon. Jim said he hadn’t ever seen a bigger one. He would a been worth a good deal over at the village. They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the market-house there; everybody buys some of him; his meat’s as white as snow and makes a good fry.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Hissstory</strong>: how the science of snake bite treatments has changed.</p>
        <p>A typical case from 1868 suggests the complexity – and desperation – of colonial remedies. When Victorian railway workers killed a brown snake at Elsternwick Station, they threw its body to stationmaster John Brown. Either the serpent was still alive, or Brown brushed its fangs, when he struck it “with an angry gesture”. The usual signs of envenomation (venom injected into the skin) soon appeared: vomiting, physical weakness then creeping paralysis followed by “coma”. Death, seemingly, was inevitable.</p>
        <p>The stationmaster was rushed to nearby Balaclava, where surgeon George Arnold tied a ligature (tourniquet) around Brown’s arm before slicing out the bite site, hoping to remove the venom. He then poured ammonia (a hazardous chemical used today in cleaning) onto the wound to neutralise any remaining venom before urging Brown to drink six ounces (175mL) of brandy to stimulate his circulation. He waved pungent smelling salts under Brown’s nose then applied a paste-like poultice of mustard to his patient’s hands, feet and abdomen to alleviate internal congestion. Further stimulation followed via electric shocks before the staggering, semi-conscious stationmaster was marched up and down to keep him awake – and alive. Brown, nevertheless, kept deteriorating.</p>
        <p>Arnold urgently summoned the colony’s only medical professor, George Halford at Melbourne University, who reluctantly agreed to apply his new snake bite remedy. He opened a vein in Brown’s arm and injected ammonia directly into the bloodstream. The stationmaster revived almost immediately, leading another doctor to assert “the injection of Ammonia saved the man’s life” (do not try this at home).</p>
        <p>Another approach, directly neutralising venom, underlay both Australia’s hugely popular folk “cures” and the novel “antivenene” technology developed in the 1890s. Now they are known as antivenoms and are created by injecting venom into (generally) horses, prompting an immune response, then purifying antibodies from their blood to inject into snake-bitten patients. But antivenenes suffered a slow acceptance in Australia. It wasn’t until 1930 that commercial tiger snake antivenene came onto the Australian market. Other injections targeting a wider range of serpents …. only emerged from the mid-1950s. Meanwhile, patients continued to undergo various first-aid measures, particularly ligatures and Condy’s crystals (potassium permanganate, used to clean wounds) applied to the bite in the hope of inactivating venom.</p>
        <p>Current snake bite management only stabilised in the 1980s. Two developments were key: rapid tests to identify the injected venom and a new first-aid strategy. Scientist&nbsp;Struan Sutherland&nbsp;pioneered the “pressure immobilisation technique”. This recommends tightly wrapping a bandage around the bitten region, adding a splint and minimising movement to slow venom spread. Not washing or cutting the bite site leaves a venom sample to aid identification and so choose the most appropriate antivenom</p>

          <strong>The Adventures of Huck Finn</strong>
        </p>
        <p>He was barefooted, and the snake bit him right on the heel. That all comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it. Jim told me to chop off the snake’s head and throw it away, and then skin the body and roast a piece of it. I done it, and he eat it and said it would help cure him. He made me take off the rattles and tie them around his wrist, too. He said that that would help. Then I slid out quiet and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for I warn’t going to let Jim find out it was all my fault, not if I could help it.</p>
        <p>Jim sucked and sucked at the jug, and now and then he got out of his head and pitched around and yelled; but every time he come to himself he went to sucking at the jug again. His foot swelled up pretty big, and so did his leg; but by and by the drunk begun to come, and so I judged he was all right; but I’d druther been bit with a snake than pap’s whisky.</p>
        <p>Jim was laid up for four days and nights. Then the swelling was all gone and he was around again. I made up my mind I wouldn’t ever take a-holt of a snake-skin again with my hands, now that I see what had come of it. Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time. And he said that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn’t got to the end of it yet. He said he druther see the new moon over his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snake-skin in his hand. Well, I was getting to feel that way myself, though I’ve always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do….</p>
        <p>Well, the days went along, and the river went down between its banks again; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was as big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two hundred pounds. We couldn’t handle him, of course; he would a flung us into Illinois. We just set there and watched him rip and tear around till he drownded. We found a brass button in his stomach and a round ball, and lots of rubbage. We split the ball open with the hatchet, and there was a spool in it. Jim said he’d had it there a long time, to coat it over so and make a ball of it. It was as big a fish as was ever catched in the Mississippi, I reckon. Jim said he hadn’t ever seen a bigger one. He would a been worth a good deal over at the village. They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the market-house there; everybody buys some of him; his meat’s as white as snow and makes a good fry.</p>
        <p><br><strong>Hissstory</strong>: how the science of snake bite treatments has changed.</p>
        <p>A typical case from 1868 suggests the complexity – and desperation – of colonial remedies. When Victorian railway workers killed a brown snake at Elsternwick Station, they threw its body to stationmaster John Brown. Either the serpent was still alive, or Brown brushed its fangs, when he struck it “with an angry gesture”. The usual signs of envenomation (venom injected into the skin) soon appeared: vomiting, physical weakness then creeping paralysis followed by “coma”. Death, seemingly, was inevitable.</p>
        <p>The stationmaster was rushed to nearby Balaclava, where surgeon George Arnold tied a ligature (tourniquet) around Brown’s arm before slicing out the bite site, hoping to remove the venom. He then poured ammonia (a hazardous chemical used today in cleaning) onto the wound to neutralise any remaining venom before urging Brown to drink six ounces (175mL) of brandy to stimulate his circulation. He waved pungent smelling salts under Brown’s nose then applied a paste-like poultice of mustard to his patient’s hands, feet and abdomen to alleviate internal congestion. Further stimulation followed via electric shocks before the staggering, semi-conscious stationmaster was marched up and down to keep him awake – and alive. Brown, nevertheless, kept deteriorating.</p>
        <p>Arnold urgently summoned the colony’s only medical professor, George Halford at Melbourne University, who reluctantly agreed to apply his new snake bite remedy. He opened a vein in Brown’s arm and injected ammonia directly into the bloodstream. The stationmaster revived almost immediately, leading another doctor to assert “the injection of Ammonia saved the man’s life” (do not try this at home).</p>
        <p>Another approach, directly neutralising venom, underlay both Australia’s hugely popular folk “cures” and the novel “antivenene” technology developed in the 1890s. Now they are known as antivenoms and are created by injecting venom into (generally) horses, prompting an immune response, then purifying antibodies from their blood to inject into snake-bitten patients. But antivenenes suffered a slow acceptance in Australia. It wasn’t until 1930 that commercial tiger snake antivenene came onto the Australian market. Other injections targeting a wider range of serpents …. only emerged from the mid-1950s. Meanwhile, patients continued to undergo various first-aid measures, particularly ligatures and Condy’s crystals (potassium permanganate, used to clean wounds) applied to the bite in the hope of inactivating venom.</p>
        <p>Current snake bite management only stabilised in the 1980s. Two developments were key: rapid tests to identify the injected venom and a new first-aid strategy. Scientist&nbsp;Struan Sutherland&nbsp;pioneered the “pressure immobilisation technique”. This recommends tightly wrapping a bandage around the bitten region, adding a splint and minimising movement to slow venom spread. Not washing or cutting the bite site leaves a venom sample to aid identification and so choose the most appropriate antivenom</p>

          <strong>The Adventures of Huck Finn</strong>
        </p>
        <p>He was barefooted, and the snake bit him right on the heel. That all comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it. Jim told me to chop off the snake’s head and throw it away, and then skin the body and roast a piece of it. I done it, and he eat it and said it would help cure him. He made me take off the rattles and tie them around his wrist, too. He said that that would help. Then I slid out quiet and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for I warn’t going to let Jim find out it was all my fault, not if I could help it.</p>
        <p>Jim sucked and sucked at the jug, and now and then he got out of his head and pitched around and yelled; but every time he come to himself he went to sucking at the jug again. His foot swelled up pretty big, and so did his leg; but by and by the drunk begun to come, and so I judged he was all right; but I’d druther been bit with a snake than pap’s whisky.</p>
        <p>Jim was laid up for four days and nights. Then the swelling was all gone and he was around again. I made up my mind I wouldn’t ever take a-holt of a snake-skin again with my hands, now that I see what had come of it. Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time. And he said that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn’t got to the end of it yet. He said he druther see the new moon over his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snake-skin in his hand. Well, I was getting to feel that way myself, though I’ve always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do….</p>
        <p>Well, the days went along, and the river went down between its banks again; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was as big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two hundred pounds. We couldn’t handle him, of course; he would a flung us into Illinois. We just set there and watched him rip and tear around till he drownded. We found a brass button in his stomach and a round ball, and lots of rubbage. We split the ball open with the hatchet, and there was a spool in it. Jim said he’d had it there a long time, to coat it over so and make a ball of it. It was as big a fish as was ever catched in the Mississippi, I reckon. Jim said he hadn’t ever seen a bigger one. He would a been worth a good deal over at the village. They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the market-house there; everybody buys some of him; his meat’s as white as snow and makes a good fry.</p>
        <p><br><strong>Hissstory</strong>: how the science of snake bite treatments has changed.</p>
        <p>A typical case from 1868 suggests the complexity – and desperation – of colonial remedies. When Victorian railway workers killed a brown snake at Elsternwick Station, they threw its body to stationmaster John Brown. Either the serpent was still alive, or Brown brushed its fangs, when he struck it “with an angry gesture”. The usual signs of envenomation (venom injected into the skin) soon appeared: vomiting, physical weakness then creeping paralysis followed by “coma”. Death, seemingly, was inevitable.</p>
        <p>The stationmaster was rushed to nearby Balaclava, where surgeon George Arnold tied a ligature (tourniquet) around Brown’s arm before slicing out the bite site, hoping to remove the venom. He then poured ammonia (a hazardous chemical used today in cleaning) onto the wound to neutralise any remaining venom before urging Brown to drink six ounces (175mL) of brandy to stimulate his circulation. He waved pungent smelling salts under Brown’s nose then applied a paste-like poultice of mustard to his patient’s hands, feet and abdomen to alleviate internal congestion. Further stimulation followed via electric shocks before the staggering, semi-conscious stationmaster was marched up and down to keep him awake – and alive. Brown, nevertheless, kept deteriorating.</p>
        <p>Arnold urgently summoned the colony’s only medical professor, George Halford at Melbourne University, who reluctantly agreed to apply his new snake bite remedy. He opened a vein in Brown’s arm and injected ammonia directly into the bloodstream. The stationmaster revived almost immediately, leading another doctor to assert “the injection of Ammonia saved the man’s life” (do not try this at home).</p>
        <p>Another approach, directly neutralising venom, underlay both Australia’s hugely popular folk “cures” and the novel “antivenene” technology developed in the 1890s. Now they are known as antivenoms and are created by injecting venom into (generally) horses, prompting an immune response, then purifying antibodies from their blood to inject into snake-bitten patients. But antivenenes suffered a slow acceptance in Australia. It wasn’t until 1930 that commercial tiger snake antivenene came onto the Australian market. Other injections targeting a wider range of serpents …. only emerged from the mid-1950s. Meanwhile, patients continued to undergo various first-aid measures, particularly ligatures and Condy’s crystals (potassium permanganate, used to clean wounds) applied to the bite in the hope of inactivating venom.</p>
        <p>Current snake bite management only stabilised in the 1980s. Two developments were key: rapid tests to identify the injected venom and a new first-aid strategy. Scientist&nbsp;Struan Sutherland&nbsp;pioneered the “pressure immobilisation technique”. This recommends tightly wrapping a bandage around the bitten region, adding a splint and minimising movement to slow venom spread. Not washing or cutting the bite site leaves a venom sample to aid identification and so choose the most appropriate antivenom</p>

          <strong>The Adventures of Huck Finn</strong>
        </p>
        <p>He was barefooted, and the snake bit him right on the heel. That all comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it. Jim told me to chop off the snake’s head and throw it away, and then skin the body and roast a piece of it. I done it, and he eat it and said it would help cure him. He made me take off the rattles and tie them around his wrist, too. He said that that would help. Then I slid out quiet and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for I warn’t going to let Jim find out it was all my fault, not if I could help it.</p>
        <p>Jim sucked and sucked at the jug, and now and then he got out of his head and pitched around and yelled; but every time he come to himself he went to sucking at the jug again. His foot swelled up pretty big, and so did his leg; but by and by the drunk begun to come, and so I judged he was all right; but I’d druther been bit with a snake than pap’s whisky.</p>
        <p>Jim was laid up for four days and nights. Then the swelling was all gone and he was around again. I made up my mind I wouldn’t ever take a-holt of a snake-skin again with my hands, now that I see what had come of it. Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time. And he said that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn’t got to the end of it yet. He said he druther see the new moon over his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snake-skin in his hand. Well, I was getting to feel that way myself, though I’ve always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do….</p>
        <p>Well, the days went along, and the river went down between its banks again; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was as big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two hundred pounds. We couldn’t handle him, of course; he would a flung us into Illinois. We just set there and watched him rip and tear around till he drownded. We found a brass button in his stomach and a round ball, and lots of rubbage. We split the ball open with the hatchet, and there was a spool in it. Jim said he’d had it there a long time, to coat it over so and make a ball of it. It was as big a fish as was ever catched in the Mississippi, I reckon. Jim said he hadn’t ever seen a bigger one. He would a been worth a good deal over at the village. They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the market-house there; everybody buys some of him; his meat’s as white as snow and makes a good fry.</p>
        <p><br><strong>Hissstory</strong>: how the science of snake bite treatments has changed.</p>
        <p>A typical case from 1868 suggests the complexity – and desperation – of colonial remedies. When Victorian railway workers killed a brown snake at Elsternwick Station, they threw its body to stationmaster John Brown. Either the serpent was still alive, or Brown brushed its fangs, when he struck it “with an angry gesture”. The usual signs of envenomation (venom injected into the skin) soon appeared: vomiting, physical weakness then creeping paralysis followed by “coma”. Death, seemingly, was inevitable.</p>
        <p>The stationmaster was rushed to nearby Balaclava, where surgeon George Arnold tied a ligature (tourniquet) around Brown’s arm before slicing out the bite site, hoping to remove the venom. He then poured ammonia (a hazardous chemical used today in cleaning) onto the wound to neutralise any remaining venom before urging Brown to drink six ounces (175mL) of brandy to stimulate his circulation. He waved pungent smelling salts under Brown’s nose then applied a paste-like poultice of mustard to his patient’s hands, feet and abdomen to alleviate internal congestion. Further stimulation followed via electric shocks before the staggering, semi-conscious stationmaster was marched up and down to keep him awake – and alive. Brown, nevertheless, kept deteriorating.</p>
        <p>Arnold urgently summoned the colony’s only medical professor, George Halford at Melbourne University, who reluctantly agreed to apply his new snake bite remedy. He opened a vein in Brown’s arm and injected ammonia directly into the bloodstream. The stationmaster revived almost immediately, leading another doctor to assert “the injection of Ammonia saved the man’s life” (do not try this at home).</p>
        <p>Another approach, directly neutralising venom, underlay both Australia’s hugely popular folk “cures” and the novel “antivenene” technology developed in the 1890s. Now they are known as antivenoms and are created by injecting venom into (generally) horses, prompting an immune response, then purifying antibodies from their blood to inject into snake-bitten patients. But antivenenes suffered a slow acceptance in Australia. It wasn’t until 1930 that commercial tiger snake antivenene came onto the Australian market. Other injections targeting a wider range of serpents …. only emerged from the mid-1950s. Meanwhile, patients continued to undergo various first-aid measures, particularly ligatures and Condy’s crystals (potassium permanganate, used to clean wounds) applied to the bite in the hope of inactivating venom.</p>
        <p>Current snake bite management only stabilised in the 1980s. Two developments were key: rapid tests to identify the injected venom and a new first-aid strategy. Scientist&nbsp;Struan Sutherland&nbsp;pioneered the “pressure immobilisation technique”. This recommends tightly wrapping a bandage around the bitten region, adding a splint and minimising movement to slow venom spread. Not washing or cutting the bite site leaves a venom sample to aid identification and so choose the most appropriate antivenom</p>

          <br>
          <strong>The Adventures of Huck Finn</strong>
        </p>
        <p>He was barefooted, and the snake bit him right on the heel. That all comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it. Jim told me to chop off the snake’s head and throw it away, and then skin the body and roast a piece of it. I done it, and he eat it and said it would help cure him. He made me take off the rattles and tie them around his wrist, too. He said that that would help. Then I slid out quiet and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for I warn’t going to let Jim find out it was all my fault, not if I could help it.</p>
        <p>Jim sucked and sucked at the jug, and now and then he got out of his head and pitched around and yelled; but every time he come to himself he went to sucking at the jug again. His foot swelled up pretty big, and so did his leg; but by and by the drunk begun to come, and so I judged he was all right; but I’d druther been bit with a snake than pap’s whisky.</p>
        <p>Jim was laid up for four days and nights. Then the swelling was all gone and he was around again. I made up my mind I wouldn’t ever take a-holt of a snake-skin again with my hands, now that I see what had come of it. Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time. And he said that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn’t got to the end of it yet. He said he druther see the new moon over his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snake-skin in his hand. Well, I was getting to feel that way myself, though I’ve always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do….</p>
        <p>Well, the days went along, and the river went down between its banks again; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was as big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two hundred pounds. We couldn’t handle him, of course; he would a flung us into Illinois. We just set there and watched him rip and tear around till he drownded. We found a brass button in his stomach and a round ball, and lots of rubbage. We split the ball open with the hatchet, and there was a spool in it. Jim said he’d had it there a long time, to coat it over so and make a ball of it. It was as big a fish as was ever catched in the Mississippi, I reckon. Jim said he hadn’t ever seen a bigger one. He would a been worth a good deal over at the village. They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the market-house there; everybody buys some of him; his meat’s as white as snow and makes a good fry.</p>
        <p><strong>Hissstory</strong>: how the science of snake bite treatments has changed.</p>
        <p>A typical case from 1868 suggests the complexity – and desperation – of colonial remedies. When Victorian railway workers killed a brown snake at Elsternwick Station, they threw its body to stationmaster John Brown. Either the serpent was still alive, or Brown brushed its fangs, when he struck it “with an angry gesture”. The usual signs of envenomation (venom injected into the skin) soon appeared: vomiting, physical weakness then creeping paralysis followed by “coma”. Death, seemingly, was inevitable.</p>
        <p>The stationmaster was rushed to nearby Balaclava, where surgeon George Arnold tied a ligature (tourniquet) around Brown’s arm before slicing out the bite site, hoping to remove the venom. He then poured ammonia (a hazardous chemical used today in cleaning) onto the wound to neutralise any remaining venom before urging Brown to drink six ounces (175mL) of brandy to stimulate his circulation. He waved pungent smelling salts under Brown’s nose then applied a paste-like poultice of mustard to his patient’s hands, feet and abdomen to alleviate internal congestion. Further stimulation followed via electric shocks before the staggering, semi-conscious stationmaster was marched up and down to keep him awake – and alive. Brown, nevertheless, kept deteriorating.</p>
        <p>Arnold urgently summoned the colony’s only medical professor, George Halford at Melbourne University, who reluctantly agreed to apply his new snake bite remedy. He opened a vein in Brown’s arm and injected ammonia directly into the bloodstream. The stationmaster revived almost immediately, leading another doctor to assert “the injection of Ammonia saved the man’s life” (do not try this at home).</p>
        <p>Another approach, directly neutralising venom, underlay both Australia’s hugely popular folk “cures” and the novel “antivenene” technology developed in the 1890s. Now they are known as antivenoms and are created by injecting venom into (generally) horses, prompting an immune response, then purifying antibodies from their blood to inject into snake-bitten patients. But antivenenes suffered a slow acceptance in Australia. It wasn’t until 1930 that commercial tiger snake antivenene came onto the Australian market. Other injections targeting a wider range of serpents …. only emerged from the mid-1950s. Meanwhile, patients continued to undergo various first-aid measures, particularly ligatures and Condy’s crystals (potassium permanganate, used to clean wounds) applied to the bite in the hope of inactivating venom.</p>
        <p>Current snake bite management only stabilised in the 1980s. Two developments were key: rapid tests to identify the injected venom and a new first-aid strategy. Scientist&nbsp;Struan Sutherland&nbsp;pioneered the “pressure immobilisation technique”. This recommends tightly wrapping a bandage around the bitten region, adding a splint and minimising movement to slow venom spread. Not washing or cutting the bite site leaves a venom sample to aid identification and so choose the most appropriate antivenom</p>

The oceans tidal swell.<br>
Opening my heart&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>5</em><br>
To the rawest of elements.<br>
I ride the anticipation<br>
Of the coming waves.<br>
Conquering the building<br>
Fear as the water leaps high.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>10</em><br>

Unfurling its rippling energy.<br>
Through the tube,<br>

Flirting with danger,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>15</em><br>
Risking everything,<br>
Inside a living<br>
Hollow cocoon of<br>
Thundering power.<br>
Controlled fear beats&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>20</em><br>
Inside my pumping heart,<br>
Driving my adrenaline<br>
Through to spiritual fulfilment.<br>
On exiting the beast,<br>
It rolls onward to its death.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>25</em><br>
Through its existence<br>
We both lived, sharing<br>
A unique oneness.<br>
Children of nature within<br>
A union of creation, so special,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>30</em><br>
It takes the breath away.<br>
Savouring my exhilaration,&nbsp;<br>
I see another wave being born,<br>
And prepare to surf again.</p>

Opening my heart&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>5</em><br>

        <p><em>Read the text below, which consists of six paragraphs.</em><br><br><strong>Sun</strong><br><br><strong>15</strong> ………... The sun is an ordinary star, one of about 100 billion in our galaxy, the Milky Way. The sun has extremely important influences on our planet: It drives weather, ocean currents, seasons, and climate, and makes plant life possible through photosynthesis. Without the sun’s heat and light, life on Earth would not exist. The sun is about 150 million kilometres (93 million miles) from Earth. This distance, called an astronomical unit (AU), is a standard measure of distance for astronomers and astrophysicists. An AU can be measured at light speed, or the time it takes for a photon of light to travel from the sun to Earth. It takes light on the sun about eight minutes and 19 seconds to reach Earth.<br>
<br>
<strong>16</strong> ………. About 4.5 billion years ago, the sun began to take shape from a molecular cloud that was mainly composed of hydrogen and helium. A nearby supernova emitted a shockwave, which came in contact with the molecular cloud and energized it. The molecular cloud began to compress, and some regions of gas collapsed under their own gravitational pull. As one of these regions collapsed, it also began to rotate and heat up from increasing pressure. Much of the hydrogen and helium remained in the centre of this hot, rotating mass. Eventually, the gases heated up enough to begin nuclear fusion, and became the sun in our solar system. Other parts of the molecular cloud cooled into a disc around the brand-new sun and became planets, asteroids, comets, and other bodies in our solar system.<br>
<br>
<strong>17 </strong>………. The sun has not always been a subject of scientific discovery and inquiry. For thousands of years, the sun was known in cultures all over the world as a god, a goddess, and a symbol of life. To the ancient Aztecs, the sun was a powerful deity known as Tonatiuh, who required human sacrifice to travel across the sky. In Baltic mythology, the sun was a goddess named Saule, who brought fertility and health. Chinese mythology held that the sun is the only remaining of 10 sun gods. In 150 A.D., Greek scholar Claudius Ptolemy created a geocentric model of the solar system in which the moon, planets, and sun revolved around Earth. It was not until the 16th century that Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus used mathematical and scientific reasoning to prove that planets rotated around the sun. This heliocentric model is the one we use today.<br>
<br>
<strong>18 </strong>………. In the 17th century, the telescope allowed people to examine the sun in detail. The sun is much too bright to allow us to study it with our eyes unprotected. With a telescope, it was possible for the first time to project a clear image of the sun onto a screen for examination. English scientist Sir Isaac Newton used a telescope and prism to scatter the light of the sun, and proved that sunlight was actually made of a spectrum of colours. In 1800, infrared and ultraviolet light were discovered to exist just outside of the visible spectrum. An optical instrument called a spectroscope made it possible to separate visible light and other electromagnetic radiation into its various wavelengths. Spectroscopy also helped scientists identify gases in the sun’s atmosphere—each element has its own wavelength pattern. In 1868, English astronomer Joseph Norman Lockyer was studying the sun’s electromagnetic spectrum. He guessed that there was an element isolated on the sun, and named it helium after the Greek sun god, Helios.<br>
<br>
<strong>19 </strong>………. Technology continued to improve and allowed scientists to uncover new features of the sun Twentieth-century astronomers used balloons and rockets to send specialized telescopes high above Earth, and examined the sun without any interference from Earth's atmosphere. Solrad 1 was the first spacecraft designed to study the sun, and was launched by the United States in 1960. That decade, NASA sent five Pioneer satellites to orbit the sun and collect information about the star. In 1980, NASA launched a mission during the solar maximum to gather information about the high-frequency gamma rays, UV rays, and x-rays that are emitted during solar flares.<br>
<br>
<strong>20</strong>. ………. The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) was developed in Europe and put into orbit in 1996 to collect information. SOHO has been successfully collecting data and forecasting space weather for 12 years. Voyager 1 and 2 are spacecraft traveling to the edge of the heliosphere to discover what the atmosphere is made of where solar wind meets the interstellar medium. Voyager 1 crossed this boundary in 2012 and Voyager 2 did so in 2018. Another development in the study of the sun is helioseismology, the study of solar waves.. By studying these waves, scientists understand more about the sun’s interior and the cause of solar activity.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below, which consists of six paragraphs.</em><br><br><strong>Sun</strong><br><br><strong>15</strong> ………... The sun is an ordinary star, one of about 100 billion in our galaxy, the Milky Way. The sun has extremely important influences on our planet: It drives weather, ocean currents, seasons, and climate, and makes plant life possible through photosynthesis. Without the sun’s heat and light, life on Earth would not exist. The sun is about 150 million kilometres (93 million miles) from Earth. This distance, called an astronomical unit (AU), is a standard measure of distance for astronomers and astrophysicists. An AU can be measured at light speed, or the time it takes for a photon of light to travel from the sun to Earth. It takes light on the sun about eight minutes and 19 seconds to reach Earth.<br>
<br>
<strong>16</strong> ………. About 4.5 billion years ago, the sun began to take shape from a molecular cloud that was mainly composed of hydrogen and helium. A nearby supernova emitted a shockwave, which came in contact with the molecular cloud and energized it. The molecular cloud began to compress, and some regions of gas collapsed under their own gravitational pull. As one of these regions collapsed, it also began to rotate and heat up from increasing pressure. Much of the hydrogen and helium remained in the centre of this hot, rotating mass. Eventually, the gases heated up enough to begin nuclear fusion, and became the sun in our solar system. Other parts of the molecular cloud cooled into a disc around the brand-new sun and became planets, asteroids, comets, and other bodies in our solar system.<br>
<br>
<strong>17 </strong>………. The sun has not always been a subject of scientific discovery and inquiry. For thousands of years, the sun was known in cultures all over the world as a god, a goddess, and a symbol of life. To the ancient Aztecs, the sun was a powerful deity known as Tonatiuh, who required human sacrifice to travel across the sky. In Baltic mythology, the sun was a goddess named Saule, who brought fertility and health. Chinese mythology held that the sun is the only remaining of 10 sun gods. In 150 A.D., Greek scholar Claudius Ptolemy created a geocentric model of the solar system in which the moon, planets, and sun revolved around Earth. It was not until the 16th century that Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus used mathematical and scientific reasoning to prove that planets rotated around the sun. This heliocentric model is the one we use today.<br>
<br>
<strong>18 </strong>………. In the 17th century, the telescope allowed people to examine the sun in detail. The sun is much too bright to allow us to study it with our eyes unprotected. With a telescope, it was possible for the first time to project a clear image of the sun onto a screen for examination. English scientist Sir Isaac Newton used a telescope and prism to scatter the light of the sun, and proved that sunlight was actually made of a spectrum of colours. In 1800, infrared and ultraviolet light were discovered to exist just outside of the visible spectrum. An optical instrument called a spectroscope made it possible to separate visible light and other electromagnetic radiation into its various wavelengths. Spectroscopy also helped scientists identify gases in the sun’s atmosphere—each element has its own wavelength pattern. In 1868, English astronomer Joseph Norman Lockyer was studying the sun’s electromagnetic spectrum. He guessed that there was an element isolated on the sun, and named it helium after the Greek sun god, Helios.<br>
<br>
<strong>19 </strong>………. Technology continued to improve and allowed scientists to uncover new features of the sun Twentieth-century astronomers used balloons and rockets to send specialized telescopes high above Earth, and examined the sun without any interference from Earth's atmosphere. Solrad 1 was the first spacecraft designed to study the sun, and was launched by the United States in 1960. That decade, NASA sent five Pioneer satellites to orbit the sun and collect information about the star. In 1980, NASA launched a mission during the solar maximum to gather information about the high-frequency gamma rays, UV rays, and x-rays that are emitted during solar flares.<br>
<br>
<strong>20</strong>. ………. The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) was developed in Europe and put into orbit in 1996 to collect information. SOHO has been successfully collecting data and forecasting space weather for 12 years. Voyager 1 and 2 are spacecraft traveling to the edge of the heliosphere to discover what the atmosphere is made of where solar wind meets the interstellar medium. Voyager 1 crossed this boundary in 2012 and Voyager 2 did so in 2018. Another development in the study of the sun is helioseismology, the study of solar waves.. By studying these waves, scientists understand more about the sun’s interior and the cause of solar activity.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below, which consists of six paragraphs.</em><br><br><strong>Sun</strong><br><br><strong>15</strong> ………... The sun is an ordinary star, one of about 100 billion in our galaxy, the Milky Way. The sun has extremely important influences on our planet: It drives weather, ocean currents, seasons, and climate, and makes plant life possible through photosynthesis. Without the sun’s heat and light, life on Earth would not exist. The sun is about 150 million kilometres (93 million miles) from Earth. This distance, called an astronomical unit (AU), is a standard measure of distance for astronomers and astrophysicists. An AU can be measured at light speed, or the time it takes for a photon of light to travel from the sun to Earth. It takes light on the sun about eight minutes and 19 seconds to reach Earth.<br>
<br>
<strong>16</strong> ………. About 4.5 billion years ago, the sun began to take shape from a molecular cloud that was mainly composed of hydrogen and helium. A nearby supernova emitted a shockwave, which came in contact with the molecular cloud and energized it. The molecular cloud began to compress, and some regions of gas collapsed under their own gravitational pull. As one of these regions collapsed, it also began to rotate and heat up from increasing pressure. Much of the hydrogen and helium remained in the centre of this hot, rotating mass. Eventually, the gases heated up enough to begin nuclear fusion, and became the sun in our solar system. Other parts of the molecular cloud cooled into a disc around the brand-new sun and became planets, asteroids, comets, and other bodies in our solar system.<br>
<br>
<strong>17 </strong>………. The sun has not always been a subject of scientific discovery and inquiry. For thousands of years, the sun was known in cultures all over the world as a god, a goddess, and a symbol of life. To the ancient Aztecs, the sun was a powerful deity known as Tonatiuh, who required human sacrifice to travel across the sky. In Baltic mythology, the sun was a goddess named Saule, who brought fertility and health. Chinese mythology held that the sun is the only remaining of 10 sun gods. In 150 A.D., Greek scholar Claudius Ptolemy created a geocentric model of the solar system in which the moon, planets, and sun revolved around Earth. It was not until the 16th century that Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus used mathematical and scientific reasoning to prove that planets rotated around the sun. This heliocentric model is the one we use today.<br>
<br>
<strong>18 </strong>………. In the 17th century, the telescope allowed people to examine the sun in detail. The sun is much too bright to allow us to study it with our eyes unprotected. With a telescope, it was possible for the first time to project a clear image of the sun onto a screen for examination. English scientist Sir Isaac Newton used a telescope and prism to scatter the light of the sun, and proved that sunlight was actually made of a spectrum of colours. In 1800, infrared and ultraviolet light were discovered to exist just outside of the visible spectrum. An optical instrument called a spectroscope made it possible to separate visible light and other electromagnetic radiation into its various wavelengths. Spectroscopy also helped scientists identify gases in the sun’s atmosphere—each element has its own wavelength pattern. In 1868, English astronomer Joseph Norman Lockyer was studying the sun’s electromagnetic spectrum. He guessed that there was an element isolated on the sun, and named it helium after the Greek sun god, Helios.<br>
<br>
<strong>19 </strong>………. Technology continued to improve and allowed scientists to uncover new features of the sun Twentieth-century astronomers used balloons and rockets to send specialized telescopes high above Earth, and examined the sun without any interference from Earth's atmosphere. Solrad 1 was the first spacecraft designed to study the sun, and was launched by the United States in 1960. That decade, NASA sent five Pioneer satellites to orbit the sun and collect information about the star. In 1980, NASA launched a mission during the solar maximum to gather information about the high-frequency gamma rays, UV rays, and x-rays that are emitted during solar flares.<br>
<br>
<strong>20</strong>. ………. The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) was developed in Europe and put into orbit in 1996 to collect information. SOHO has been successfully collecting data and forecasting space weather for 12 years. Voyager 1 and 2 are spacecraft traveling to the edge of the heliosphere to discover what the atmosphere is made of where solar wind meets the interstellar medium. Voyager 1 crossed this boundary in 2012 and Voyager 2 did so in 2018. Another development in the study of the sun is helioseismology, the study of solar waves.. By studying these waves, scientists understand more about the sun’s interior and the cause of solar activity.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below, which consists of six paragraphs.</em><br><br><strong>Sun</strong><br><br><strong>15</strong> ………... The sun is an ordinary star, one of about 100 billion in our galaxy, the Milky Way. The sun has extremely important influences on our planet: It drives weather, ocean currents, seasons, and climate, and makes plant life possible through photosynthesis. Without the sun’s heat and light, life on Earth would not exist. The sun is about 150 million kilometres (93 million miles) from Earth. This distance, called an astronomical unit (AU), is a standard measure of distance for astronomers and astrophysicists. An AU can be measured at light speed, or the time it takes for a photon of light to travel from the sun to Earth. It takes light on the sun about eight minutes and 19 seconds to reach Earth.<br>
<br>
<strong>16</strong> ………. About 4.5 billion years ago, the sun began to take shape from a molecular cloud that was mainly composed of hydrogen and helium. A nearby supernova emitted a shockwave, which came in contact with the molecular cloud and energized it. The molecular cloud began to compress, and some regions of gas collapsed under their own gravitational pull. As one of these regions collapsed, it also began to rotate and heat up from increasing pressure. Much of the hydrogen and helium remained in the centre of this hot, rotating mass. Eventually, the gases heated up enough to begin nuclear fusion, and became the sun in our solar system. Other parts of the molecular cloud cooled into a disc around the brand-new sun and became planets, asteroids, comets, and other bodies in our solar system.<br>
<br>
<strong>17 </strong>………. The sun has not always been a subject of scientific discovery and inquiry. For thousands of years, the sun was known in cultures all over the world as a god, a goddess, and a symbol of life. To the ancient Aztecs, the sun was a powerful deity known as Tonatiuh, who required human sacrifice to travel across the sky. In Baltic mythology, the sun was a goddess named Saule, who brought fertility and health. Chinese mythology held that the sun is the only remaining of 10 sun gods. In 150 A.D., Greek scholar Claudius Ptolemy created a geocentric model of the solar system in which the moon, planets, and sun revolved around Earth. It was not until the 16th century that Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus used mathematical and scientific reasoning to prove that planets rotated around the sun. This heliocentric model is the one we use today.<br>
<br>
<strong>18 </strong>………. In the 17th century, the telescope allowed people to examine the sun in detail. The sun is much too bright to allow us to study it with our eyes unprotected. With a telescope, it was possible for the first time to project a clear image of the sun onto a screen for examination. English scientist Sir Isaac Newton used a telescope and prism to scatter the light of the sun, and proved that sunlight was actually made of a spectrum of colours. In 1800, infrared and ultraviolet light were discovered to exist just outside of the visible spectrum. An optical instrument called a spectroscope made it possible to separate visible light and other electromagnetic radiation into its various wavelengths. Spectroscopy also helped scientists identify gases in the sun’s atmosphere—each element has its own wavelength pattern. In 1868, English astronomer Joseph Norman Lockyer was studying the sun’s electromagnetic spectrum. He guessed that there was an element isolated on the sun, and named it helium after the Greek sun god, Helios.<br>
<br>
<strong>19 </strong>………. Technology continued to improve and allowed scientists to uncover new features of the sun Twentieth-century astronomers used balloons and rockets to send specialized telescopes high above Earth, and examined the sun without any interference from Earth's atmosphere. Solrad 1 was the first spacecraft designed to study the sun, and was launched by the United States in 1960. That decade, NASA sent five Pioneer satellites to orbit the sun and collect information about the star. In 1980, NASA launched a mission during the solar maximum to gather information about the high-frequency gamma rays, UV rays, and x-rays that are emitted during solar flares.<br>
<br>
<strong>20</strong>. ………. The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) was developed in Europe and put into orbit in 1996 to collect information. SOHO has been successfully collecting data and forecasting space weather for 12 years. Voyager 1 and 2 are spacecraft traveling to the edge of the heliosphere to discover what the atmosphere is made of where solar wind meets the interstellar medium. Voyager 1 crossed this boundary in 2012 and Voyager 2 did so in 2018. Another development in the study of the sun is helioseismology, the study of solar waves.. By studying these waves, scientists understand more about the sun’s interior and the cause of solar activity.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below, which consists of six paragraphs.</em><br><br><strong>Sun</strong><br><br><strong>15</strong> ………... The sun is an ordinary star, one of about 100 billion in our galaxy, the Milky Way. The sun has extremely important influences on our planet: It drives weather, ocean currents, seasons, and climate, and makes plant life possible through photosynthesis. Without the sun’s heat and light, life on Earth would not exist. The sun is about 150 million kilometres (93 million miles) from Earth. This distance, called an astronomical unit (AU), is a standard measure of distance for astronomers and astrophysicists. An AU can be measured at light speed, or the time it takes for a photon of light to travel from the sun to Earth. It takes light on the sun about eight minutes and 19 seconds to reach Earth.<br>
<br>
<strong>16</strong> ………. About 4.5 billion years ago, the sun began to take shape from a molecular cloud that was mainly composed of hydrogen and helium. A nearby supernova emitted a shockwave, which came in contact with the molecular cloud and energized it. The molecular cloud began to compress, and some regions of gas collapsed under their own gravitational pull. As one of these regions collapsed, it also began to rotate and heat up from increasing pressure. Much of the hydrogen and helium remained in the centre of this hot, rotating mass. Eventually, the gases heated up enough to begin nuclear fusion, and became the sun in our solar system. Other parts of the molecular cloud cooled into a disc around the brand-new sun and became planets, asteroids, comets, and other bodies in our solar system.<br>
<br>
<strong>17 </strong>………. The sun has not always been a subject of scientific discovery and inquiry. For thousands of years, the sun was known in cultures all over the world as a god, a goddess, and a symbol of life. To the ancient Aztecs, the sun was a powerful deity known as Tonatiuh, who required human sacrifice to travel across the sky. In Baltic mythology, the sun was a goddess named Saule, who brought fertility and health. Chinese mythology held that the sun is the only remaining of 10 sun gods. In 150 A.D., Greek scholar Claudius Ptolemy created a geocentric model of the solar system in which the moon, planets, and sun revolved around Earth. It was not until the 16th century that Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus used mathematical and scientific reasoning to prove that planets rotated around the sun. This heliocentric model is the one we use today.<br>
<br>
<strong>18 </strong>………. In the 17th century, the telescope allowed people to examine the sun in detail. The sun is much too bright to allow us to study it with our eyes unprotected. With a telescope, it was possible for the first time to project a clear image of the sun onto a screen for examination. English scientist Sir Isaac Newton used a telescope and prism to scatter the light of the sun, and proved that sunlight was actually made of a spectrum of colours. In 1800, infrared and ultraviolet light were discovered to exist just outside of the visible spectrum. An optical instrument called a spectroscope made it possible to separate visible light and other electromagnetic radiation into its various wavelengths. Spectroscopy also helped scientists identify gases in the sun’s atmosphere—each element has its own wavelength pattern. In 1868, English astronomer Joseph Norman Lockyer was studying the sun’s electromagnetic spectrum. He guessed that there was an element isolated on the sun, and named it helium after the Greek sun god, Helios.<br>
<br>
<strong>19 </strong>………. Technology continued to improve and allowed scientists to uncover new features of the sun Twentieth-century astronomers used balloons and rockets to send specialized telescopes high above Earth, and examined the sun without any interference from Earth's atmosphere. Solrad 1 was the first spacecraft designed to study the sun, and was launched by the United States in 1960. That decade, NASA sent five Pioneer satellites to orbit the sun and collect information about the star. In 1980, NASA launched a mission during the solar maximum to gather information about the high-frequency gamma rays, UV rays, and x-rays that are emitted during solar flares.<br>
<br>
<strong>20</strong>. ………. The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) was developed in Europe and put into orbit in 1996 to collect information. SOHO has been successfully collecting data and forecasting space weather for 12 years. Voyager 1 and 2 are spacecraft traveling to the edge of the heliosphere to discover what the atmosphere is made of where solar wind meets the interstellar medium. Voyager 1 crossed this boundary in 2012 and Voyager 2 did so in 2018. Another development in the study of the sun is helioseismology, the study of solar waves.. By studying these waves, scientists understand more about the sun’s interior and the cause of solar activity.</p>

Is it hard to become an actor? It’s important that you’re prepared for the reality of this business: As an actor, there’s no guarantee of success in the traditional sense. Sure, making it big is about talent—but it’s also about having good luck and the right connections. That’s why it’s vital to make sure you’re in show business for the right reasons. “Often actors are mainly focused on questions like, ‘How do I get representation?’ or ‘How do I get work?’ but perhaps the first question to ask oneself, if one is just beginning, is ‘Why do I want to act?’” says casting director Ilene Starger. “If it’s about the work and the process, terrific; if it’s about becoming famous, that is a far more elusive goal—and one which will lead to disappointment, most likely.” You’ll need patience and perspective if you’re going to make it as an actor. “Never, ever look to the prize,” Academy Award-winner Octavia Spencer says. “That’s something that you can’t control. What you can control is the work ethic and treating the material with respect. It took me 15 years to become an overnight success, so if you’re only at the three-year mark, honey, you’ve got some time.” Expect to put in years of hard work before you see real, tangible results. Rejection is a constant (yes, even for established actors!), so make sure that you can handle a long string of “no’s” before finally landing that coveted “yes.”<br>

There’s a reason the Alexander Technique is the only form of movement training that many drama schools require students to take. It’s an extremely powerful practice of body-mind integration that pays dividends on many levels. If you talk to an Alexander Technique teacher, they’re probably going to speak about the ease of movement and efficiency—both extremely important when it comes to acting. The ability to be vulnerable and fully engaged in a situation is essential to crafting a memorable performance. According to Wood, the Alexander Technique allows actors to do both—its tension-releasing methods prepare you before the performance and keep you open to physical spontaneity during it. “The characters we play have needs, and we need to embody these needs and then take up the character’s struggle to get those needs met,” Wood says. “The technique’s capacity to help us become more emotionally available on the one hand and to assert ourselves without overexerting on the other are gifts any actor can derive enormous benefit from for fuller, richer, more memorable work. It’s reason enough for budding actors to sign up for the training. I mean, why wouldn’t they?”<br>

Whether they started their career on our local shores or took the plunge in Hollywood, what you may not know about some of your favourites is that they do not come from America or Britain. In fact, they come from the land Down Under. Although Russell Crowe was born in New Zealand, he grew up in Australia and now identifies as a proud Aussie – sorry NZ! This actor, film producer, and musician is one of Australia’s most recognised actors, having received four major awards including the Academy Award and the Empire Award for Best Actor for his performance in Gladiator (2000). Crowe has also appeared in Robin Hood (2010) and 2016’s The Nice Guys. Since making her film debut in 1983, Nicole Kidman has amassed 80 acting credits including critically acclaimed roles in Moulin Rouge, The Others, The Hours and Cold Mountain. Most recently the Hawaiian born, Australian actress has been commended for her work in the biographical drama Lion and HBO mini-series Big Little Lies. The actress has received four Oscar nominations, and in 2002 she won an Oscar and a BAFTA award for her portrayal of Virginia Woolf in The Hours. Kidman currently has two films in post-production and is filming the crime thriller Destroyer.<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
If I want to be an actor, should I take a survival job? You likely won’t be making a liveable wage as an actor straight out of the gate. That’s where a "survival job" comes in. Walking dogs, tutoring, babysitting, waiting tables—it’s unlikely these are your passions in life, but work with flexible schedules and non-set hours is key to finding time for auditions and casting calls. It’s also important that you don’t hate your survival job! If you spend most of your day dreading going back to work, that’s a mental drain that will make it more difficult to nail your auditions. The restaurant industry is an old standby for survival jobs—you could be a server, host, bartender, maître d', barback, cater waiter, or barista. But the growing gig economy has widened the possibilities when it comes to survival jobs. Driving for Uber or Lyft is one possibility, assuming you own a car; serving as a virtual assistant on Upwork or Fiverr are also options. But not every job is a survival job! Full-time jobs obviously offer more financial security, but if you’re working in a traditional 9-to-5 office, it’s going to be almost impossible to show up to daytime casting calls and auditions.</p>

The restaurant industry is an old standby for survival jobs—you could be a server, host, bartender, maître d', barback, cater waiter, or barista. But the growing gig economy has widened the possibilities when it comes to survival jobs. Driving for Uber or Lyft is one possibility, assuming you own a car; serving as a virtual assistant on Upwork or Fiverr are also options. But not every job is a survival job! Full-time jobs obviously offer more financial security, but if you’re working in a traditional 9-to-5 office, it’s going to be almost impossible to show up to daytime casting calls and auditions.</p>

Is it hard to become an actor? It’s important that you’re prepared for the reality of this business: As an actor, there’s no guarantee of success in the traditional sense. Sure, making it big is about talent—but it’s also about having good luck and the right connections. That’s why it’s vital to make sure you’re in show business for the right reasons. “Often actors are mainly focused on questions like, ‘How do I get representation?’ or ‘How do I get work?’ but perhaps the first question to ask oneself, if one is just beginning, is ‘Why do I want to act?’” says casting director Ilene Starger. “If it’s about the work and the process, terrific; if it’s about becoming famous, that is a far more elusive goal—and one which will lead to disappointment, most likely.” You’ll need patience and perspective if you’re going to make it as an actor. “Never, ever look to the prize,” Academy Award-winner Octavia Spencer says. “That’s something that you can’t control. What you can control is the work ethic and treating the material with respect. It took me 15 years to become an overnight success, so if you’re only at the three-year mark, honey, you’ve got some time.” Expect to put in years of hard work before you see real, tangible results. Rejection is a constant (yes, even for established actors!), so make sure that you can handle a long string of “no’s” before finally landing that coveted “yes.”<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
There’s a reason the Alexander Technique is the only form of movement training that many drama schools require students to take. It’s an extremely powerful practice of body-mind integration that pays dividends on many levels. If you talk to an Alexander Technique teacher, they’re probably going to speak about the ease of movement and efficiency—both extremely important when it comes to acting. The ability to be vulnerable and fully engaged in a situation is essential to crafting a memorable performance. According to Wood, the Alexander Technique allows actors to do both—its tension-releasing methods prepare you before the performance and keep you open to physical spontaneity during it. “The characters we play have needs, and we need to embody these needs and then take up the character’s struggle to get those needs met,” Wood says. “The technique’s capacity to help us become more emotionally available on the one hand and to assert ourselves without overexerting on the other are gifts any actor can derive enormous benefit from for fuller, richer, more memorable work. It’s reason enough for budding actors to sign up for the training. I mean, why wouldn’t they?”<br>

Whether they started their career on our local shores or took the plunge in Hollywood, what you may not know about some of your favourites is that they do not come from America or Britain. In fact, they come from the land Down Under. Although Russell Crowe was born in New Zealand, he grew up in Australia and now identifies as a proud Aussie – sorry NZ! This actor, film producer, and musician is one of Australia’s most recognised actors, having received four major awards including the Academy Award and the Empire Award for Best Actor for his performance in Gladiator (2000). Crowe has also appeared in Robin Hood (2010) and 2016’s The Nice Guys. Since making her film debut in 1983, Nicole Kidman has amassed 80 acting credits including critically acclaimed roles in Moulin Rouge, The Others, The Hours and Cold Mountain. Most recently the Hawaiian born, Australian actress has been commended for her work in the biographical drama Lion and HBO mini-series Big Little Lies. The actress has received four Oscar nominations, and in 2002 she won an Oscar and a BAFTA award for her portrayal of Virginia Woolf in The Hours. Kidman currently has two films in post-production and is filming the crime thriller Destroyer.<br>

Is it hard to become an actor? It’s important that you’re prepared for the reality of this business: As an actor, there’s no guarantee of success in the traditional sense. Sure, making it big is about talent—but it’s also about having good luck and the right connections. That’s why it’s vital to make sure you’re in show business for the right reasons. “Often actors are mainly focused on questions like, ‘How do I get representation?’ or ‘How do I get work?’ but perhaps the first question to ask oneself, if one is just beginning, is ‘Why do I want to act?’” says casting director Ilene Starger. “If it’s about the work and the process, terrific; if it’s about becoming famous, that is a far more elusive goal—and one which will lead to disappointment, most likely.” You’ll need patience and perspective if you’re going to make it as an actor. “Never, ever look to the prize,” Academy Award-winner Octavia Spencer says. “That’s something that you can’t control. What you can control is the work ethic and treating the material with respect. It took me 15 years to become an overnight success, so if you’re only at the three-year mark, honey, you’ve got some time.” Expect to put in years of hard work before you see real, tangible results. Rejection is a constant (yes, even for established actors!), so make sure that you can handle a long string of “no’s” before finally landing that coveted “yes.”<br>

There’s a reason the Alexander Technique is the only form of movement training that many drama schools require students to take. It’s an extremely powerful practice of body-mind integration that pays dividends on many levels. If you talk to an Alexander Technique teacher, they’re probably going to speak about the ease of movement and efficiency—both extremely important when it comes to acting. The ability to be vulnerable and fully engaged in a situation is essential to crafting a memorable performance. According to Wood, the Alexander Technique allows actors to do both—its tension-releasing methods prepare you before the performance and keep you open to physical spontaneity during it. “The characters we play have needs, and we need to embody these needs and then take up the character’s struggle to get those needs met,” Wood says. “The technique’s capacity to help us become more emotionally available on the one hand and to assert ourselves without overexerting on the other are gifts any actor can derive enormous benefit from for fuller, richer, more memorable work. It’s reason enough for budding actors to sign up for the training. I mean, why wouldn’t they?”<br>

Whether they started their career on our local shores or took the plunge in Hollywood, what you may not know about some of your favourites is that they do not come from America or Britain. In fact, they come from the land Down Under. Although Russell Crowe was born in New Zealand, he grew up in Australia and now identifies as a proud Aussie – sorry NZ! This actor, film producer, and musician is one of Australia’s most recognised actors, having received four major awards including the Academy Award and the Empire Award for Best Actor for his performance in Gladiator (2000). Crowe has also appeared in Robin Hood (2010) and 2016’s The Nice Guys. Since making her film debut in 1983, Nicole Kidman has amassed 80 acting credits including critically acclaimed roles in Moulin Rouge, The Others, The Hours and Cold Mountain. Most recently the Hawaiian born, Australian actress has been commended for her work in the biographical drama Lion and HBO mini-series Big Little Lies. The actress has received four Oscar nominations, and in 2002 she won an Oscar and a BAFTA award for her portrayal of Virginia Woolf in The Hours. Kidman currently has two films in post-production and is filming the crime thriller Destroyer.<br>

If I want to be an actor, should I take a survival job? You likely won’t be making a liveable wage as an actor straight out of the gate. That’s where a "survival job" comes in. Walking dogs, tutoring, babysitting, waiting tables—it’s unlikely these are your passions in life, but work with flexible schedules and non-set hours is key to finding time for auditions and casting calls. It’s also important that you don’t hate your survival job! If you spend most of your day dreading going back to work, that’s a mental drain that will make it more difficult to nail your auditions. The restaurant industry is an old standby for survival jobs—you could be a server, host, bartender, maître d', barback, cater waiter, or barista. But the growing gig economy has widened the possibilities when it comes to survival jobs. Driving for Uber or Lyft is one possibility, assuming you own a car; serving as a virtual assistant on Upwork or Fiverr are also options. But not every job is a survival job! Full-time jobs obviously offer more financial security, but if you’re working in a traditional 9-to-5 office, it’s going to be almost impossible to show up to daytime casting calls and auditions.</p>
