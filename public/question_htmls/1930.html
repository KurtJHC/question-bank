          <strong>The Adventures of Jerry Muskrat&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Thornton W Burgess</em><br><br>
What was it Mother Muskrat had said about Farmer Brown’s boy and his traps? Jerry Muskrat sat on the edge of the Big Rock and kicked his heels while he tried to remember. The fact is, Jerry had not half heeded. He had been thinking of other things. Besides, it seemed to him that Mother Muskrat was altogether foolish about a great many things.</p>
        <p>“Pooh!” said Jerry, throwing out his chest, “I guess I can take care of myself without being tied to my mother’s apron strings! What if Farmer Brown’s boy is setting traps around the Smiling Pool? I guess he can’t fool your Uncle Jerry. He isn’t so smart as he thinks he is; I can fool him any day.” Jerry chuckled. He was thinking of how he had once fooled Farmer Brown’s boy into thinking a big trout was on his hook.</p>
        <p>Slowly Jerry slid into the Smiling Pool and swam over towards his favourite log. Peter Rabbit stuck his head over the edge of the bank. “Hi, Jerry,” he shouted, “last night I saw Farmer Brown’s boy coming over this way with a lot of traps. Better watch out!”</p>
        <p>“Go chase yourself, Peter Rabbit. I guess I can look out for myself,” replied Jerry, just a little crossly.</p>
        <p>Peter made a wry face and started for the sweet clover patch. Hardly was he out of sight when Billy Mink and Bobby Coon came down the Laughing Brook together. They seemed very much excited. When they saw Jerry Muskrat, they beckoned for him to come over where they were, and when he got there, they both talked at once, and it was all about Farmer Brown’s boy and his traps.</p>
        <p>“You’d better watch out, Jerry,” warned Billy Mink, who is a great traveller and has had wide experience.</p>
        <p>“Oh, I guess I’m able to take care of myself,” said Jerry airily, and once more started for his favourite log. And what do you suppose he was thinking about as he swam along? He was wishing that he knew what a trap looked like, for despite his boasting he didn’t even know what he was to look out for. As he drew near his favourite log, something tickled his nose. He stopped swimming to sniff and sniff. My, how good it did smell! And it seemed to come right straight from the old log. Jerry began to swim as fast as he could. In a few minutes he scrambled out on the old log. Then Jerry rubbed his eyes three times to be sure that he saw aright. There were luscious pieces of carrot lying right in front of him.</p>
        <p>Now there is nothing that Jerry Muskrat likes better than carrot. So he didn’t stop to wonder how it got there. He just reached out for the nearest piece and ate it. Then he reached for the next piece and ate it. Then he did a funny little dance just for joy. When he was quite out of breath, he sat down to rest. Snap! Something had Jerry Muskrat by the tail! Jerry squealed with fright and pain. Oh, how it did hurt! He twisted and turned, but he was held fast and could not see what had him. Then he pulled and pulled, until it seemed as if his tail would pull off. But it didn’t. So he kept pulling, and pretty soon the thing let go so suddenly that Jerry tumbled head first into the water.<br>
When he reached home, Mother Muskrat did his sore tail up for him. “What did I tell you about traps?” she asked severely.</p>
        <p>Jerry stopped crying. “Was that a trap?” he asked. Then he remembered that in his fright he didn’t even see it. “Oh, dear,” he moaned, “I wouldn’t know one today if I met it.”</p>

          <em>An extract from&nbsp;</em>
          <br>
          <strong>The Adventures of Jerry Muskrat&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Thornton W Burgess</em><br><br>
What was it Mother Muskrat had said about Farmer Brown’s boy and his traps? Jerry Muskrat sat on the edge of the Big Rock and kicked his heels while he tried to remember. The fact is, Jerry had not half heeded. He had been thinking of other things. Besides, it seemed to him that Mother Muskrat was altogether foolish about a great many things.</p>
        <p>“Pooh!” said Jerry, throwing out his chest, “I guess I can take care of myself without being tied to my mother’s apron strings! What if Farmer Brown’s boy is setting traps around the Smiling Pool? I guess he can’t fool your Uncle Jerry. He isn’t so smart as he thinks he is; I can fool him any day.” Jerry chuckled. He was thinking of how he had once fooled Farmer Brown’s boy into thinking a big trout was on his hook.</p>
        <p>Slowly Jerry slid into the Smiling Pool and swam over towards his favourite log. Peter Rabbit stuck his head over the edge of the bank. “Hi, Jerry,” he shouted, “last night I saw Farmer Brown’s boy coming over this way with a lot of traps. Better watch out!”</p>
        <p>“Go chase yourself, Peter Rabbit. I guess I can look out for myself,” replied Jerry, just a little crossly.</p>
        <p>Peter made a wry face and started for the sweet clover patch. Hardly was he out of sight when Billy Mink and Bobby Coon came down the Laughing Brook together. They seemed very much excited. When they saw Jerry Muskrat, they beckoned for him to come over where they were, and when he got there, they both talked at once, and it was all about Farmer Brown’s boy and his traps.</p>
        <p>“You’d better watch out, Jerry,” warned Billy Mink, who is a great traveller and has had wide experience.</p>
        <p>“Oh, I guess I’m able to take care of myself,” said Jerry airily, and once more started for his favourite log. And what do you suppose he was thinking about as he swam along? He was wishing that he knew what a trap looked like, for despite his boasting he didn’t even know what he was to look out for. As he drew near his favourite log, something tickled his nose. He stopped swimming to sniff and sniff. My, how good it did smell! And it seemed to come right straight from the old log. Jerry began to swim as fast as he could. In a few minutes he scrambled out on the old log. Then Jerry rubbed his eyes three times to be sure that he saw aright. There were luscious pieces of carrot lying right in front of him.</p>
        <p>Now there is nothing that Jerry Muskrat likes better than carrot. So he didn’t stop to wonder how it got there. He just reached out for the nearest piece and ate it. Then he reached for the next piece and ate it. Then he did a funny little dance just for joy. When he was quite out of breath, he sat down to rest. Snap! Something had Jerry Muskrat by the tail! Jerry squealed with fright and pain. Oh, how it did hurt! He twisted and turned, but he was held fast and could not see what had him. Then he pulled and pulled, until it seemed as if his tail would pull off. But it didn’t. So he kept pulling, and pretty soon the thing let go so suddenly that Jerry tumbled head first into the water.<br>
When he reached home, Mother Muskrat did his sore tail up for him. “What did I tell you about traps?” she asked severely.</p>
        <p>Jerry stopped crying. “Was that a trap?” he asked. Then he remembered that in his fright he didn’t even see it. “Oh, dear,” he moaned, “I wouldn’t know one today if I met it.”</p>

        </p>
        <p>My Shadow</p>
        <p>I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me,<br>
And what can be the use of him is more than I can see.<br>
He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head;<br>
And I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed.</p>
        <p>The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow—<br>
Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow;<br>
For he sometimes shoots up taller like an india-rubber ball,<br>
And he sometimes gets so little that there’s none of him at all.</p>
        <p>He hasn’t got a notion of how children ought to play,<br>
And can only make a fool of me in every sort of way.<br>
He stays so close beside me, he’s a coward you can see;<br>
I’d think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me!</p>
        <p>One morning, very early, before the sun was up,<br>
I rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup;<br>
But my lazy little shadow, like an arrant sleepy-head,<br>
Had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep in bed.</p>

        <p>My Shadow</p>
        <p>I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me,<br>
And what can be the use of him is more than I can see.<br>
He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head;<br>
And I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed.</p>
        <p>The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow—<br>
Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow;<br>
For he sometimes shoots up taller like an india-rubber ball,<br>
And he sometimes gets so little that there’s none of him at all.</p>
        <p>He hasn’t got a notion of how children ought to play,<br>
And can only make a fool of me in every sort of way.<br>
He stays so close beside me, he’s a coward you can see;<br>
I’d think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me!</p>
        <p>One morning, very early, before the sun was up,<br>
I rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup;<br>
But my lazy little shadow, like an arrant sleepy-head,<br>
Had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep in bed.</p>

          <em>Read the poem below by Robert L Stevenson then answer the questions.</em>
        </p>
        <p>My Shadow</p>
        <p>I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me,<br>
And what can be the use of him is more than I can see.<br>
He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head;<br>
And I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed.</p>
        <p>The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow—<br>
Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow;<br>
For he sometimes shoots up taller like an india-rubber ball,<br>
And he sometimes gets so little that there’s none of him at all.</p>
        <p>He hasn’t got a notion of how children ought to play,<br>
And can only make a fool of me in every sort of way.<br>
He stays so close beside me, he’s a coward you can see;<br>
I’d think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me!</p>
        <p>One morning, very early, before the sun was up,<br>
I rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup;<br>
But my lazy little shadow, like an arrant sleepy-head,<br>
Had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep in bed.</p>

          <strong>Olympic Games</strong>
        </p>
        <p><strong>1</strong>............&nbsp; Athletes from more than 200 countries compete in them. The Olympics include the Summer Games and the Winter Games. Each is held in a different country once every four years. Until the early 1990s the Summer and Winter Games were held in the same year. Today they are separated by two years.</p>
        <p>The Olympic Games were first held in ancient Greece at a site called Olympia. The ancient Greek Games lasted until 393 CE. <strong>2</strong>............&nbsp; The Games that began then are called the modern Olympics.</p>
        <p>The International Olympic Committee (IOC) governs the modern Games. It was founded in 1894. Its headquarters are in Lausanne, Switzerland. The IOC decides on the sports to include in the Olympics. It also chooses the cities that will host the Games. <strong>3</strong>............&nbsp; In addition to the IOC, each country has its own national Olympic committee.</p>
        <p>The flag of the Olympic Games has five linked rings on a white background. The rings represent the five parts of the world joined together by the Games: the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia. <strong>4</strong>............&nbsp; The colours of the rings and the white background came from national flags. At least one of the colours appears in every country’s flag.</p>
        <p><strong>5</strong>............&nbsp; Each country’s team enters the Olympic stadium dressed in its official uniform. An athlete carrying the team’s national flag leads each group. The Greek team is always the first to enter the stadium. The other nations follow in alphabetical order, according to the language of the host country. The host team is always the last.</p>
        <p>During the ceremony the Olympic flag is raised. Then an important person from the host country carries a torch into the stadium and lights a fire, called the Olympic flame. (The torch is lit in Olympia, Greece. A series of runners then carries the torch from Greece to the host country.) <strong>6</strong>............</p>
        <p>A victory ceremony is held during the Games after the end of each event. Medals are awarded for first, second, and third place. In order from first to third, the medals are gold, silver, and bronze. The flags of the winners’ countries are raised while the national anthem of the gold medal winner is played.</p>
        <p>The closing ceremony takes place after the final event. It is less formal than the opening ceremony. The Olympic flame is put out, and the Olympic flag is lowered.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Olympic Games</strong>
        </p>
        <p><strong>1</strong>............&nbsp; Athletes from more than 200 countries compete in them. The Olympics include the Summer Games and the Winter Games. Each is held in a different country once every four years. Until the early 1990s the Summer and Winter Games were held in the same year. Today they are separated by two years.</p>
        <p>The Olympic Games were first held in ancient Greece at a site called Olympia. The ancient Greek Games lasted until 393 CE. <strong>2</strong>............&nbsp; The Games that began then are called the modern Olympics.</p>
        <p>The International Olympic Committee (IOC) governs the modern Games. It was founded in 1894. Its headquarters are in Lausanne, Switzerland. The IOC decides on the sports to include in the Olympics. It also chooses the cities that will host the Games. <strong>3</strong>............&nbsp; In addition to the IOC, each country has its own national Olympic committee.</p>
        <p>The flag of the Olympic Games has five linked rings on a white background. The rings represent the five parts of the world joined together by the Games: the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia. <strong>4</strong>............&nbsp; The colours of the rings and the white background came from national flags. At least one of the colours appears in every country’s flag.</p>
        <p><strong>5</strong>............&nbsp; Each country’s team enters the Olympic stadium dressed in its official uniform. An athlete carrying the team’s national flag leads each group. The Greek team is always the first to enter the stadium. The other nations follow in alphabetical order, according to the language of the host country. The host team is always the last.</p>
        <p>During the ceremony the Olympic flag is raised. Then an important person from the host country carries a torch into the stadium and lights a fire, called the Olympic flame. (The torch is lit in Olympia, Greece. A series of runners then carries the torch from Greece to the host country.) <strong>6</strong>............</p>
        <p>A victory ceremony is held during the Games after the end of each event. Medals are awarded for first, second, and third place. In order from first to third, the medals are gold, silver, and bronze. The flags of the winners’ countries are raised while the national anthem of the gold medal winner is played.</p>
        <p>The closing ceremony takes place after the final event. It is less formal than the opening ceremony. The Olympic flame is put out, and the Olympic flag is lowered.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Olympic Games</strong>
        </p>
        <p><strong>1</strong>............&nbsp; Athletes from more than 200 countries compete in them. The Olympics include the Summer Games and the Winter Games. Each is held in a different country once every four years. Until the early 1990s the Summer and Winter Games were held in the same year. Today they are separated by two years.</p>
        <p>The Olympic Games were first held in ancient Greece at a site called Olympia. The ancient Greek Games lasted until 393 CE. <strong>2</strong>............&nbsp; The Games that began then are called the modern Olympics.</p>
        <p>The International Olympic Committee (IOC) governs the modern Games. It was founded in 1894. Its headquarters are in Lausanne, Switzerland. The IOC decides on the sports to include in the Olympics. It also chooses the cities that will host the Games. <strong>3</strong>............&nbsp; In addition to the IOC, each country has its own national Olympic committee.</p>
        <p>The flag of the Olympic Games has five linked rings on a white background. The rings represent the five parts of the world joined together by the Games: the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia. <strong>4</strong>............&nbsp; The colours of the rings and the white background came from national flags. At least one of the colours appears in every country’s flag.</p>
        <p><strong>5</strong>............&nbsp; Each country’s team enters the Olympic stadium dressed in its official uniform. An athlete carrying the team’s national flag leads each group. The Greek team is always the first to enter the stadium. The other nations follow in alphabetical order, according to the language of the host country. The host team is always the last.</p>
        <p>During the ceremony the Olympic flag is raised. Then an important person from the host country carries a torch into the stadium and lights a fire, called the Olympic flame. (The torch is lit in Olympia, Greece. A series of runners then carries the torch from Greece to the host country.) <strong>6</strong>............</p>
        <p>A victory ceremony is held during the Games after the end of each event. Medals are awarded for first, second, and third place. In order from first to third, the medals are gold, silver, and bronze. The flags of the winners’ countries are raised while the national anthem of the gold medal winner is played.</p>
        <p>The closing ceremony takes place after the final event. It is less formal than the opening ceremony. The Olympic flame is put out, and the Olympic flag is lowered.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Olympic Games</strong>
        </p>
        <p><strong>1</strong>............&nbsp; Athletes from more than 200 countries compete in them. The Olympics include the Summer Games and the Winter Games. Each is held in a different country once every four years. Until the early 1990s the Summer and Winter Games were held in the same year. Today they are separated by two years.</p>
        <p>The Olympic Games were first held in ancient Greece at a site called Olympia. The ancient Greek Games lasted until 393 CE. <strong>2</strong>............&nbsp; The Games that began then are called the modern Olympics.</p>
        <p>The International Olympic Committee (IOC) governs the modern Games. It was founded in 1894. Its headquarters are in Lausanne, Switzerland. The IOC decides on the sports to include in the Olympics. It also chooses the cities that will host the Games. <strong>3</strong>............&nbsp; In addition to the IOC, each country has its own national Olympic committee.</p>
        <p>The flag of the Olympic Games has five linked rings on a white background. The rings represent the five parts of the world joined together by the Games: the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia. <strong>4</strong>............&nbsp; The colours of the rings and the white background came from national flags. At least one of the colours appears in every country’s flag.</p>
        <p><strong>5</strong>............&nbsp; Each country’s team enters the Olympic stadium dressed in its official uniform. An athlete carrying the team’s national flag leads each group. The Greek team is always the first to enter the stadium. The other nations follow in alphabetical order, according to the language of the host country. The host team is always the last.</p>
        <p>During the ceremony the Olympic flag is raised. Then an important person from the host country carries a torch into the stadium and lights a fire, called the Olympic flame. (The torch is lit in Olympia, Greece. A series of runners then carries the torch from Greece to the host country.) <strong>6</strong>............</p>
        <p>A victory ceremony is held during the Games after the end of each event. Medals are awarded for first, second, and third place. In order from first to third, the medals are gold, silver, and bronze. The flags of the winners’ countries are raised while the national anthem of the gold medal winner is played.</p>
        <p>The closing ceremony takes place after the final event. It is less formal than the opening ceremony. The Olympic flame is put out, and the Olympic flag is lowered.&nbsp;</p>

The Australian education system is considered one of the best education systems in the world, for both domestic and international students. It enjoys high standards, a comprehensive curriculum, and highly qualified teachers. Formal schooling in Australia is divided into four educational stages – early childhood education, primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education. Australia is the third-largest provider of education to international students. Under the Education and Training Reform Act 2006, schooling is compulsory for students aged between 6 and 17 years. The three very visible sectors of schooling in Australia are the public or the government schools, followed by the Catholic and the independent schools, referred to as private schools.&nbsp;<br>

The events of that sunny spring day turned out to change the course of history at our school. I am proud of being one of the revolutionaries who drove the change. The problem was our school uniform, which was more or less bearable in winter but became a cause of students’ torture in spring because it was too hot. This is why the girls from our class agreed to wear jeans instead of the uniform one day, to show our protest against the silly school rule of wearing the uniform even when it was too hot for it. We felt a bit scared before the beginning of the first lesson. Mrs. Stone, our Geography teacher, had to be the first to see our silent protest.<br>

When the students walk in on the first day of third grade, I tell them to take their backpack and put it in the hallway. Then, on their desk, I always have a freshly sharpened pencil and playdough! Starting with playdough allows the students to get any nerves out that they have as they play and sculpt. It also gives the students a chance to talk and catch up from summer. I have found that by giving them this time to chat and sculpt, they are less likely to want to talk throughout the day. This also is a great way for me to get all the things that I need to get done or the questions that I need to answer completely!<br>

“Wake up,” my mom said. Then she politely tapped my shoulder.<br>
It was 6:00 am, and it would be my first day of middle school in the United States. Months before my dad had taken us from Mexico to Paramount a small city in Los Angeles County “I don’t want to go” I said to my mom,” you have to go that’s why we came here.” That morning I was scared of starting school in a new country, with people speaking a different language that I did not even know a word of. After waking up, I took a shower and put on the plain uniform and then went to the kitchen to eat some cereal. I looked at my back pack to check that I had the essentials. Then I told my parents that I was ready. When we got to school, I looked at the students inside - they all wore the same uniform - a white polo shirt with blue jeans. It looked like a small army of little soldiers - all in lines waiting for the teacher to come.&nbsp;<br>

The Australian education system is considered one of the best education systems in the world, for both domestic and international students. It enjoys high standards, a comprehensive curriculum, and highly qualified teachers. Formal schooling in Australia is divided into four educational stages – early childhood education, primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education. Australia is the third-largest provider of education to international students. Under the Education and Training Reform Act 2006, schooling is compulsory for students aged between 6 and 17 years. The three very visible sectors of schooling in Australia are the public or the government schools, followed by the Catholic and the independent schools, referred to as private schools.&nbsp;<br>

The events of that sunny spring day turned out to change the course of history at our school. I am proud of being one of the revolutionaries who drove the change. The problem was our school uniform, which was more or less bearable in winter but became a cause of students’ torture in spring because it was too hot. This is why the girls from our class agreed to wear jeans instead of the uniform one day, to show our protest against the silly school rule of wearing the uniform even when it was too hot for it. We felt a bit scared before the beginning of the first lesson. Mrs. Stone, our Geography teacher, had to be the first to see our silent protest.<br>

When the students walk in on the first day of third grade, I tell them to take their backpack and put it in the hallway. Then, on their desk, I always have a freshly sharpened pencil and playdough! Starting with playdough allows the students to get any nerves out that they have as they play and sculpt. It also gives the students a chance to talk and catch up from summer. I have found that by giving them this time to chat and sculpt, they are less likely to want to talk throughout the day. This also is a great way for me to get all the things that I need to get done or the questions that I need to answer completely!<br>

“Wake up,” my mom said. Then she politely tapped my shoulder.<br>
It was 6:00 am, and it would be my first day of middle school in the United States. Months before my dad had taken us from Mexico to Paramount a small city in Los Angeles County “I don’t want to go” I said to my mom,” you have to go that’s why we came here.” That morning I was scared of starting school in a new country, with people speaking a different language that I did not even know a word of. After waking up, I took a shower and put on the plain uniform and then went to the kitchen to eat some cereal. I looked at my back pack to check that I had the essentials. Then I told my parents that I was ready. When we got to school, I looked at the students inside - they all wore the same uniform - a white polo shirt with blue jeans. It looked like a small army of little soldiers - all in lines waiting for the teacher to come.&nbsp;<br>

When the students walk in on the first day of third grade, I tell them to take their backpack and put it in the hallway. Then, on their desk, I always have a freshly sharpened pencil and playdough! Starting with playdough allows the students to get any nerves out that they have as they play and sculpt. It also gives the students a chance to talk and catch up from summer. I have found that by giving them this time to chat and sculpt, they are less likely to want to talk throughout the day. This also is a great way for me to get all the things that I need to get done or the questions that I need to answer completely!<br>

“Wake up,” my mom said. Then she politely tapped my shoulder.<br>
It was 6:00 am, and it would be my first day of middle school in the United States. Months before my dad had taken us from Mexico to Paramount a small city in Los Angeles County “I don’t want to go” I said to my mom,” you have to go that’s why we came here.” That morning I was scared of starting school in a new country, with people speaking a different language that I did not even know a word of. After waking up, I took a shower and put on the plain uniform and then went to the kitchen to eat some cereal. I looked at my back pack to check that I had the essentials. Then I told my parents that I was ready. When we got to school, I looked at the students inside - they all wore the same uniform - a white polo shirt with blue jeans. It looked like a small army of little soldiers - all in lines waiting for the teacher to come.&nbsp;<br>

          <strong>The Strap Box Flyer</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Paul Jennings</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Hundreds of people were watching Giffen. They thought he was a bit mad. But they couldn’t stop looking. He was very interesting.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Giffen went over to his truck and got out a tube of glue. On the tube it said GIFFENS GREAT GLUE. IT WILL STICK ANYTHING. Giffen held the glue over his head. ‘This is the best glue in the world,’ he said. ‘It can mend anything that is broken. Who has something that is broken?’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;A small boy came out the front. He held up a bow and arrow. ‘My bow is broken,’ he said. ‘And no one can fix it.’ Giffen took the bow out of the boy’s hand He put a bit of glue on the broken ends and joined them together. Then he put the arrow in the bow and shot it into the air. The people were surprised. They all clapped and cheered.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;‘That’s nothing,’ Giffen told them. You haven’t seen anything yet.’ He went over to the back of his truck where he had a big crane. It had a rope on the end of it. Giffen grabbed the rope. He put a dab of glue on the end of it. Then he put the rope on to the roof of the car. This glue can hold up a car,’ he told the crowd. He stepped into his truck and started up the crane. The car was lifted up into the air. The only thing that held the rope on to the car was the glue.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The crowd thought this was great. No one had ever seen glue like this before. ‘Now,’ said Giffen, ‘who wants to buy some of Giffen’s Great Glue?’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The crowd rushed forward. Everyone wanted some glue. They couldn’t get it quick enough. They thought it was terrific. ‘Get it while it lasts,’ shouted Giffen. ‘Only ten dollars a tube.’ Giffen sold two hundred tubes of glue. He made two thousand dollars in one day. The customers took their glue and went home to try it out.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;‘You fools,’ said Giffen to himself. ‘You will soon find out that the glue stops working after four hours.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Miss Tibbs had bought a tube of Giffen’s Great Glue. She was a very old lady. She lived all on her own. Most of her friends were dead. There was no one to help her to fix things up when they got broken. So she was very glad to have the glue. Miss Tibbs collected china. She had spent all of her life saving pieces of china. She had plates and cups and saucers from all over the world. She also had little china dolls and toy animals. She had so many pieces that she didn’t know where to put them all. This is why she wanted the glue. She wanted to put up a new shelf.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;As soon as she got home Miss Tibbs went and fetched a piece of wood from the shed in her back garden. Then she put some of Giffen’s Great Glue along the edge of the wood and stuck it on to the wall. It worked well. The shelf was very strong. ‘This is wonderful glue,’ she said. ‘It dries straight away.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Miss Tibbs started to put her china pieces on to the shelf. She decided to put her favourite piece out first. It was a small china horse. She had owned it for many years. It had been given to her by her father before he died. Miss Tibbs loved this horse. She put it in the best spot, right in the middle of the shelf. After she had put all of the other pieces out Miss Tibbs sat down and had a rest. She was very tired. She fell asleep in her armchair in front of the fire.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Four hours later Miss Tibbs was woken up by a loud crash. The glue had stopped working. The shelf had fallen off the wall and all of the china pieces were smashed. Miss Tibbs went down on to her hands and knees. She started to pick up all of the broken pieces. Then she remembered her horse. Her precious horse. She looked for it among the bits. She couldn’t find it. Then she found something that made her cry. A leg and a tail and a 2 tiny head. The horse was smashed to pieces. Miss Tibbs cried and cried. She got her tube of Giffen’s Great Glue and threw it in the fire. Then she decided that she would go and find Giffen. She would tell him that his glue was no good. She would ask him to pay for the broken china.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;She hurried back to the place where Giffen had been. But he was gone. There was no sign of him. She knew that he would never come back.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Another person who bought a tube of Giffen’s Great Glue was Scott Bridges. He had bought it to mend his canoe. It had broken in half. Scott’s father had told him the canoe could not be repaired. He said that its back was broken. He told Scott to take it to the tip. But now that Scott had a tube of Giffen’s Great Glue he knew that he could fix it. The canoe was down at the lake. Scott went down there all his own. He didn’t tell his father where he was going. He pulled the two pieces of the canoe together, and put Giffen’s Great Glue along the join.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;‘Great,’ yelled Scott. ‘It’s as good as new. This glue is fantastic.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;He pushed the canoe into the water and climbed in. It floated well. It didn’t leak at all. Scott began to paddle out into the middle of the lake. He was very happy. And excited. He paddled off as fast as he could go. Scott was not allowed to go out in the canoe without a life jacket. But on this day he had forgotten. All that he could think about was the canoe and Giffen’s Great Glue. It was a sunny day and the time passed quickly. Soon four hours had passed. Scott noticed that some water was starting to leak into the canoe. He decided to start paddling for home. But it was too late. The glue had come unstuck. The canoe broke in two and sank. The water was icy cold. Scott was frightened. It was a long way to the shore. ‘Help,’ he screamed at the top of his voice.&nbsp;</p>

          <em>An extract from&nbsp;</em>
          <br>
          <strong>The Strap Box Flyer</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Paul Jennings</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Hundreds of people were watching Giffen. They thought he was a bit mad. But they couldn’t stop looking. He was very interesting.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Giffen went over to his truck and got out a tube of glue. On the tube it said GIFFENS GREAT GLUE. IT WILL STICK ANYTHING. Giffen held the glue over his head. ‘This is the best glue in the world,’ he said. ‘It can mend anything that is broken. Who has something that is broken?’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;A small boy came out the front. He held up a bow and arrow. ‘My bow is broken,’ he said. ‘And no one can fix it.’ Giffen took the bow out of the boy’s hand He put a bit of glue on the broken ends and joined them together. Then he put the arrow in the bow and shot it into the air. The people were surprised. They all clapped and cheered.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;‘That’s nothing,’ Giffen told them. You haven’t seen anything yet.’ He went over to the back of his truck where he had a big crane. It had a rope on the end of it. Giffen grabbed the rope. He put a dab of glue on the end of it. Then he put the rope on to the roof of the car. This glue can hold up a car,’ he told the crowd. He stepped into his truck and started up the crane. The car was lifted up into the air. The only thing that held the rope on to the car was the glue.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The crowd thought this was great. No one had ever seen glue like this before. ‘Now,’ said Giffen, ‘who wants to buy some of Giffen’s Great Glue?’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The crowd rushed forward. Everyone wanted some glue. They couldn’t get it quick enough. They thought it was terrific. ‘Get it while it lasts,’ shouted Giffen. ‘Only ten dollars a tube.’ Giffen sold two hundred tubes of glue. He made two thousand dollars in one day. The customers took their glue and went home to try it out.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;‘You fools,’ said Giffen to himself. ‘You will soon find out that the glue stops working after four hours.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Miss Tibbs had bought a tube of Giffen’s Great Glue. She was a very old lady. She lived all on her own. Most of her friends were dead. There was no one to help her to fix things up when they got broken. So she was very glad to have the glue. Miss Tibbs collected china. She had spent all of her life saving pieces of china. She had plates and cups and saucers from all over the world. She also had little china dolls and toy animals. She had so many pieces that she didn’t know where to put them all. This is why she wanted the glue. She wanted to put up a new shelf.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;As soon as she got home Miss Tibbs went and fetched a piece of wood from the shed in her back garden. Then she put some of Giffen’s Great Glue along the edge of the wood and stuck it on to the wall. It worked well. The shelf was very strong. ‘This is wonderful glue,’ she said. ‘It dries straight away.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Miss Tibbs started to put her china pieces on to the shelf. She decided to put her favourite piece out first. It was a small china horse. She had owned it for many years. It had been given to her by her father before he died. Miss Tibbs loved this horse. She put it in the best spot, right in the middle of the shelf. After she had put all of the other pieces out Miss Tibbs sat down and had a rest. She was very tired. She fell asleep in her armchair in front of the fire.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Four hours later Miss Tibbs was woken up by a loud crash. The glue had stopped working. The shelf had fallen off the wall and all of the china pieces were smashed. Miss Tibbs went down on to her hands and knees. She started to pick up all of the broken pieces. Then she remembered her horse. Her precious horse. She looked for it among the bits. She couldn’t find it. Then she found something that made her cry. A leg and a tail and a 2 tiny head. The horse was smashed to pieces. Miss Tibbs cried and cried. She got her tube of Giffen’s Great Glue and threw it in the fire. Then she decided that she would go and find Giffen. She would tell him that his glue was no good. She would ask him to pay for the broken china.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;She hurried back to the place where Giffen had been. But he was gone. There was no sign of him. She knew that he would never come back.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Another person who bought a tube of Giffen’s Great Glue was Scott Bridges. He had bought it to mend his canoe. It had broken in half. Scott’s father had told him the canoe could not be repaired. He said that its back was broken. He told Scott to take it to the tip. But now that Scott had a tube of Giffen’s Great Glue he knew that he could fix it. The canoe was down at the lake. Scott went down there all his own. He didn’t tell his father where he was going. He pulled the two pieces of the canoe together, and put Giffen’s Great Glue along the join.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;‘Great,’ yelled Scott. ‘It’s as good as new. This glue is fantastic.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;He pushed the canoe into the water and climbed in. It floated well. It didn’t leak at all. Scott began to paddle out into the middle of the lake. He was very happy. And excited. He paddled off as fast as he could go. Scott was not allowed to go out in the canoe without a life jacket. But on this day he had forgotten. All that he could think about was the canoe and Giffen’s Great Glue. It was a sunny day and the time passed quickly. Soon four hours had passed. Scott noticed that some water was starting to leak into the canoe. He decided to start paddling for home. But it was too late. The glue had come unstuck. The canoe broke in two and sank. The water was icy cold. Scott was frightened. It was a long way to the shore. ‘Help,’ he screamed at the top of his voice.&nbsp;</p>

          <em>An extract from&nbsp;</em>
          <br>
          <strong>The Strap Box Flyer</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Paul Jennings</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Hundreds of people were watching Giffen. They thought he was a bit mad. But they couldn’t stop looking. He was very interesting.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Giffen went over to his truck and got out a tube of glue. On the tube it said GIFFENS GREAT GLUE. IT WILL STICK ANYTHING. Giffen held the glue over his head. ‘This is the best glue in the world,’ he said. ‘It can mend anything that is broken. Who has something that is broken?’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;A small boy came out the front. He held up a bow and arrow. ‘My bow is broken,’ he said. ‘And no one can fix it.’ Giffen took the bow out of the boy’s hand He put a bit of glue on the broken ends and joined them together. Then he put the arrow in the bow and shot it into the air. The people were surprised. They all clapped and cheered.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;‘That’s nothing,’ Giffen told them. You haven’t seen anything yet.’ He went over to the back of his truck where he had a big crane. It had a rope on the end of it. Giffen grabbed the rope. He put a dab of glue on the end of it. Then he put the rope on to the roof of the car. This glue can hold up a car,’ he told the crowd. He stepped into his truck and started up the crane. The car was lifted up into the air. The only thing that held the rope on to the car was the glue.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The crowd thought this was great. No one had ever seen glue like this before. ‘Now,’ said Giffen, ‘who wants to buy some of Giffen’s Great Glue?’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The crowd rushed forward. Everyone wanted some glue. They couldn’t get it quick enough. They thought it was terrific. ‘Get it while it lasts,’ shouted Giffen. ‘Only ten dollars a tube.’ Giffen sold two hundred tubes of glue. He made two thousand dollars in one day. The customers took their glue and went home to try it out.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;‘You fools,’ said Giffen to himself. ‘You will soon find out that the glue stops working after four hours.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Miss Tibbs had bought a tube of Giffen’s Great Glue. She was a very old lady. She lived all on her own. Most of her friends were dead. There was no one to help her to fix things up when they got broken. So she was very glad to have the glue. Miss Tibbs collected china. She had spent all of her life saving pieces of china. She had plates and cups and saucers from all over the world. She also had little china dolls and toy animals. She had so many pieces that she didn’t know where to put them all. This is why she wanted the glue. She wanted to put up a new shelf.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;As soon as she got home Miss Tibbs went and fetched a piece of wood from the shed in her back garden. Then she put some of Giffen’s Great Glue along the edge of the wood and stuck it on to the wall. It worked well. The shelf was very strong. ‘This is wonderful glue,’ she said. ‘It dries straight away.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Miss Tibbs started to put her china pieces on to the shelf. She decided to put her favourite piece out first. It was a small china horse. She had owned it for many years. It had been given to her by her father before he died. Miss Tibbs loved this horse. She put it in the best spot, right in the middle of the shelf. After she had put all of the other pieces out Miss Tibbs sat down and had a rest. She was very tired. She fell asleep in her armchair in front of the fire.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Four hours later Miss Tibbs was woken up by a loud crash. The glue had stopped working. The shelf had fallen off the wall and all of the china pieces were smashed. Miss Tibbs went down on to her hands and knees. She started to pick up all of the broken pieces. Then she remembered her horse. Her precious horse. She looked for it among the bits. She couldn’t find it. Then she found something that made her cry. A leg and a tail and a 2 tiny head. The horse was smashed to pieces. Miss Tibbs cried and cried. She got her tube of Giffen’s Great Glue and threw it in the fire. Then she decided that she would go and find Giffen. She would tell him that his glue was no good. She would ask him to pay for the broken china.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;She hurried back to the place where Giffen had been. But he was gone. There was no sign of him. She knew that he would never come back.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Another person who bought a tube of Giffen’s Great Glue was Scott Bridges. He had bought it to mend his canoe. It had broken in half. Scott’s father had told him the canoe could not be repaired. He said that its back was broken. He told Scott to take it to the tip. But now that Scott had a tube of Giffen’s Great Glue he knew that he could fix it. The canoe was down at the lake. Scott went down there all his own. He didn’t tell his father where he was going. He pulled the two pieces of the canoe together, and put Giffen’s Great Glue along the join.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;‘Great,’ yelled Scott. ‘It’s as good as new. This glue is fantastic.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;He pushed the canoe into the water and climbed in. It floated well. It didn’t leak at all. Scott began to paddle out into the middle of the lake. He was very happy. And excited. He paddled off as fast as he could go. Scott was not allowed to go out in the canoe without a life jacket. But on this day he had forgotten. All that he could think about was the canoe and Giffen’s Great Glue. It was a sunny day and the time passed quickly. Soon four hours had passed. Scott noticed that some water was starting to leak into the canoe. He decided to start paddling for home. But it was too late. The glue had come unstuck. The canoe broke in two and sank. The water was icy cold. Scott was frightened. It was a long way to the shore. ‘Help,’ he screamed at the top of his voice.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>The Bashful Earthquake</strong>

        <p>The Earthquake rumbled<br>
And <span class="txt-underline"><strong>mumbled</strong></span><br>
And <span class="txt-underline"><strong>grumbled</strong></span>;<br>
And then he bumped,<br>
And everything tumbled—<br>
Bumpyty-thump!<br>
Thumpyty-bump!—<br>
Houses and palaces all in a lump!</p>
        <p>“Oh, what a crash!<br>
Oh, what a smash!<br>
How could I ever be so rash?”<br>
The Earthquake cried.<br>
“What under the sun<br>
Have I gone and done?<br>
I never before was so mortified!”<br>
Then away he fled,<br>
And groaned as he sped:<br>
“This comes of not looking before I tread.”</p>
