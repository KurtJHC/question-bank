        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; THE BUFFALO no longer wandered the prairie, and the grass was wilted and brown. The streams no longer ran full and deep. In the glare of the sun, the parched earth lay burning, for drought had come into the country of the Blackfoot, and with the drought came famine. Many miles wandered the hunters in search of game, only to return empty handed and with <span class="txt-underline">waning</span> strength. Bad days had come to the Blackfoot nation and powerful ceremonies were to be held in the hope of securing relief.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Along the shore of a well-loved lake, two medicine lodges had been built, and here the ceremonies were carried on. Chants were sung and accompanied with elaborate ritual. At last these earnest prayers were heard by Old Man. Through His spirit helpers, He sent word to the suffering nation that they must send seven of their oldest and wisest men to the top of the mountain where the Wind Spirit lived. (Chief Mountain.) It was the Wind Spirit who was causing the drought, and it was he who must be appeased.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;And so the seven were selected and sent forth to climb the steep mountain to its summit. But when they reached the top, the Wind Spirit was such an awe-inspiring person that their hearts failed them and they turned and fled in fear. Therefore the drought continued, the suffering increased, and the Blackfoot were in desperate straits.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Now Old Man sent word again—this time that fourteen of the young warriors must journey to the home of the Wind Spirit. The fourteen bravest were selected—those who had earned many of the hard-won eagle plumes and whose deeds were most often recounted about the evening camp fires. They made their way up the trail until they, too, stood upon the mountain crest.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Wind Spirit waited in the door of his lodge, dreadful to behold. But these were warriors, tried and true, and though they were fearful they were brave as well. They gave no sign of weakness but drew nearer until they could reach out and touch the robe of this Mighty One.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Their courage pleased the Wind Spirit greatly. He sent them home with these words to carry to their people. “Now am I sure that the Blackfoot are a nation of men and deserving of my favor.” He brought forth the life-giving rains and poured them down upon the parched land, drenching the earth with the cool, sweet water.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When the young men reached the lake shore, they found the grass growing thick and green, the streams replenished, and the buffalo returned. From that day forth there was happiness and prosperity where dwelt the bands of the Blackfoot nation.</p>

          <strong>Extract from <em>To Build a Fire</em> by Jack London</strong>
        </p>
        <p><br>
He plunged in among the big spruce trees. The trail was faint. A foot of snow had fallen since the last sled had passed over, and he was glad he was without a sled, travelling light. In fact, he carried nothing but the lunch wrapped in the handkerchief. He was surprised, however, at the cold. It certainly was cold, he concluded, as he rubbed his numbed nose and cheek–bones with his mittened hand. He was a warm–<br>
whiskered man, but the hair on his face did not protect the high cheek-bones and the eager nose that thrust itself aggressively into the frosty air.</p>
        <p>At the man’s heel trotted a dog, a big native husky, the proper wolf-dog, grey-coated and without any visible or temperamental difference from its brother, the wild wolf. The animal was depressed by the tremendous cold. It knew that it was no time for travelling. Its instinct told it a truer tale than was told to the man by the man’s judgment. In reality, it was not merely colder than fifty below zero; it was colder than sixty below, than seventy below. It was seventy-five below zero. Since the freezing point is thirty-two above zero, it meant that one hundred and seven degrees of frost obtained. The dog did not know anything about thermometers. Possibly in its brain there was no sharp consciousness of a condition of very cold such as was in the man’s brain. But the brute had its instinct. It experienced a vague but menacing apprehension that subdued it and made it slink along at the man’s heels, and that made it question eagerly every unwonted* movement of the man as if expecting him to go into camp or to seek shelter somewhere and build a fire. The dog had learned fire, and it wanted fire, or else to burrow under the snow and cuddle its warmth away from the air.</p>
        <p>The frozen moisture of its breathing had settled on its fur in a fine powder of frost, and especially where its jowls, muzzle and eyelashes whitened by its crystalled breath. The man’s red beard and moustache were likewise frosted, but more solidly. Also, the man was chewing tobacco, and the muzzle of ice held his lips so rigidly that he was unable to clear his chin when he expelled the juice. The result was that a crystal beard of the colour and solidity of amber was increasing its length on his chin. If he fell down it would shatter itself, like glass, into brittle fragments.</p>
        <p>* <strong>unwonted</strong>: unusual or unaccustomed</p>

He plunged in among the big spruce trees. The trail was faint. A foot of snow had fallen since the last sled had passed over, and he was glad he was without a sled, travelling light. In fact, he carried nothing but the lunch wrapped in the handkerchief. He was surprised, however, at the cold. It certainly was cold, he concluded, as he rubbed his numbed nose and cheek–bones with his mittened hand. He was a warm–<br>
whiskered man, but the hair on his face did not protect the high cheek-bones and the eager nose that thrust itself aggressively into the frosty air.</p>
        <p>At the man’s heel trotted a dog, a big native husky, the proper wolf-dog, grey-coated and without any visible or temperamental difference from its brother, the wild wolf. The animal was depressed by the tremendous cold. It knew that it was no time for travelling. Its instinct told it a truer tale than was told to the man by the man’s judgment. In reality, it was not merely colder than fifty below zero; it was colder than sixty below, than seventy below. It was seventy-five below zero. Since the freezing point is thirty-two above zero, it meant that one hundred and seven degrees of frost obtained. The dog did not know anything about thermometers. Possibly in its brain there was no sharp consciousness of a condition of very cold such as was in the man’s brain. But the brute had its instinct. It experienced a vague but menacing apprehension that subdued it and made it slink along at the man’s heels, and that made it question eagerly every unwonted* movement of the man as if expecting him to go into camp or to seek shelter somewhere and build a fire. The dog had learned fire, and it wanted fire, or else to burrow under the snow and cuddle its warmth away from the air.</p>
        <p>The frozen moisture of its breathing had settled on its fur in a fine powder of frost, and especially where its jowls, muzzle and eyelashes whitened by its crystalled breath. The man’s red beard and moustache were likewise frosted, but more solidly. Also, the man was chewing tobacco, and the muzzle of ice held his lips so rigidly that he was unable to clear his chin when he expelled the juice. The result was that a crystal beard of the colour and solidity of amber was increasing its length on his chin. If he fell down it would shatter itself, like glass, into brittle fragments.</p>

          <strong>Extract from <em>To Build a Fire</em> by Jack London</strong>
        </p>
        <p><br>
He plunged in among the big spruce trees. The trail was faint. A foot of snow had fallen since the last sled had passed over, and he was glad he was without a sled, travelling light. In fact, he carried nothing but the lunch wrapped in the handkerchief. He was surprised, however, at the cold. It certainly was cold, he concluded, as he rubbed his numbed nose and cheek–bones with his mittened hand. He was a warm–<br>
whiskered man, but the hair on his face did not protect the high cheek-bones and the eager nose that thrust itself aggressively into the frosty air.</p>
        <p>At the man’s heel trotted a dog, a big native husky, the proper wolf-dog, grey-coated and without any visible or temperamental difference from its brother, the wild wolf. The animal was depressed by the tremendous cold. It knew that it was no time for travelling. Its instinct told it a truer tale than was told to the man by the man’s judgment. In reality, it was not merely colder than fifty below zero; it was colder than sixty below, than seventy below. It was seventy-five below zero. Since the freezing point is thirty-two above zero, it meant that one hundred and seven degrees of frost obtained. The dog did not know anything about thermometers. Possibly in its brain there was no sharp consciousness of a condition of very cold such as was in the man’s brain. But the brute had its instinct. It experienced a vague but menacing apprehension that subdued it and made it slink along at the man’s heels, and that made it question eagerly every unwonted* movement of the man as if expecting him to go into camp or to seek shelter somewhere and build a fire. The dog had learned fire, and it wanted fire, or else to burrow under the snow and cuddle its warmth away from the air.</p>
        <p>The frozen moisture of its breathing had settled on its fur in a fine powder of frost, and especially where its jowls, muzzle and eyelashes whitened by its crystalled breath. The man’s red beard and moustache were likewise frosted, but more solidly. Also, the man was chewing tobacco, and the muzzle of ice held his lips so rigidly that he was unable to clear his chin when he expelled the juice. The result was that a crystal beard of the colour and solidity of amber was increasing its length on his chin. If he fell down it would shatter itself, like glass, into brittle fragments.</p>

        <p>(Extract from)<strong> Saving Ms Fosdyke</strong> by Morris Gleitzman</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dad was flabbergasted when I told him the news. He nearly dropped the plate he was washing up. He stared at me, water dripping off his elbows. 'Fifty million?' he said. 'Your school is selling Ms Fosdyke to West Chirnside Primary for fifty million pounds?' I nodded sadly. 'That's crazy,' said Dad. 'They could get heaps more for a teacher like her. The primary school near the library just paid over seventy million for a year-four teacher with half her experience.'</p>
        <p>Mum nodded as she took the plate from him and dried it. 'And that was a bargain,' she said. 'Last week the high school paid a hundred million pounds for a maths teacher.'</p>
        <p>'Crazy,' said Dad. 'Giving away a top teacher like Ms Fosdyke for fifty million. You don't even get a good footballer for that these days.'</p>
        <p>I agreed. It was crazy. And it was all my fault.</p>
        <p>'Emmy, love, don't chew your pen,' said Mum. 'Those pens cost nearly a pound each. Have you finished your homework?'</p>
        <p>'Almost,' I said. 'I'm doing my creative writing task. I'm making up a story about some teachers who are badly paid and overworked and don't get much respect.'</p>
        <p>Mum frowned. 'Sounds a bit far-fetched,' she said.</p>
        <p>'It's a fantasy story,' I said. 'Ms Fosdyke encourages us to use our imagination.'</p>
        <p>Dad wiped his hands and picked up my exercise book and read a couple of sentences. He frowned and put the exercise book down again. 'Even fantasy stories need to be a little bit believable, Emmy,' he said. 'You can't just write totally impossible crazy stuff.'</p>
        <p>Mum sat down next to me at the kitchen table and put her arm round me. 'You must be feeling sad,' she said. 'About Ms Fosdyke being transferred.'</p>
        <p>I nodded. Mum and Dad both looked sympathetic. Suddenly I knew I had to risk it and tell them. So they'd see why it was so important that Ms Fosdyke didn't leave. ‘Ms Fosdyke thinks that one day . . .' I hesitated for a sec. Was this going to sound dopey? '. . . that one day I could be a teacher.'</p>
        <p>Mum and Dad just stared at me. They were both flabbergasted. 'A teacher?' said Mum.</p>
        <p>'Are you sure?' said Dad.</p>
        <p>I nodded. 'Oh, love,' said Mum. 'That might be pushing it a bit. Why don't you lower your sights just a little. What about being a doctor? Or a lawyer?'</p>
        <p>'I want to be a teacher,' I said quietly. 'I want to help people's minds blossom like Ms Fosdyke does.'</p>
        <p>Mum sighed. 'Emmy,' she said. 'Only the smartest, cleverest, most brilliant people get to be teachers. You know that. It's good to be ambitious, but it's not good to set yourself up for disappointment.'</p>
        <p>'Airline pilot,' said Dad. 'Why not give that a try? That's more sensible, eh?'</p>
        <p>I didn't reply. Mum and Dad meant well, but the trouble was they didn't really believe in me. Not really. Not like Ms Fosdyke. That's why I had to stop her going.</p>

        <p>(Extract from)<strong> Saving Ms Fosdyke</strong> by Morris Gleitzman</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dad was flabbergasted when I told him the news. He nearly dropped the plate he was washing up. He stared at me, water dripping off his elbows. 'Fifty million?' he said. 'Your school is selling Ms Fosdyke to West Chirnside Primary for fifty million pounds?' I nodded sadly. 'That's crazy,' said Dad. 'They could get heaps more for a teacher like her. The primary school near the library just paid over seventy million for a year-four teacher with half her experience.'</p>
        <p>Mum nodded as she took the plate from him and dried it. 'And that was a bargain,' she said. 'Last week the high school paid a hundred million pounds for a maths teacher.'</p>
        <p>'Crazy,' said Dad. 'Giving away a top teacher like Ms Fosdyke for fifty million. You don't even get a good footballer for that these days.'</p>
        <p>I agreed. It was crazy. And it was all my fault.</p>
        <p>'Emmy, love, don't chew your pen,' said Mum. 'Those pens cost nearly a pound each. Have you finished your homework?'</p>
        <p>'Almost,' I said. 'I'm doing my creative writing task. I'm making up a story about some teachers who are badly paid and overworked and don't get much respect.'</p>
        <p>Mum frowned. 'Sounds a bit far-fetched,' she said.</p>
        <p>'It's a fantasy story,' I said. 'Ms Fosdyke encourages us to use our imagination.'</p>
        <p>Dad wiped his hands and picked up my exercise book and read a couple of sentences. He frowned and put the exercise book down again. 'Even fantasy stories need to be a little bit believable, Emmy,' he said. 'You can't just write totally impossible crazy stuff.'</p>
        <p>Mum sat down next to me at the kitchen table and put her arm round me. 'You must be feeling sad,' she said. 'About Ms Fosdyke being transferred.'</p>
        <p>I nodded. Mum and Dad both looked sympathetic. Suddenly I knew I had to risk it and tell them. So they'd see why it was so important that Ms Fosdyke didn't leave. ‘Ms Fosdyke thinks that one day . . .' I hesitated for a sec. Was this going to sound dopey? '. . . that one day I could be a teacher.'</p>
        <p>Mum and Dad just stared at me. They were both flabbergasted. 'A teacher?' said Mum.</p>
        <p>'Are you sure?' said Dad.</p>
        <p>I nodded. 'Oh, love,' said Mum. 'That might be pushing it a bit. Why don't you lower your sights just a little. What about being a doctor? Or a lawyer?'</p>
        <p>'I want to be a teacher,' I said quietly. 'I want to help people's minds blossom like Ms Fosdyke does.'</p>
        <p>Mum sighed. 'Emmy,' she said. 'Only the smartest, cleverest, most brilliant people get to be teachers. You know that. It's good to be ambitious, but it's not good to set yourself up for disappointment.'</p>
        <p>'Airline pilot,' said Dad. 'Why not give that a try? That's more sensible, eh?'</p>
        <p>I didn't reply. Mum and Dad meant well, but the trouble was they didn't really believe in me. Not really. Not like Ms Fosdyke. That's why I had to stop her going.</p>

        <p>(Extract from)<strong> Saving Ms Fosdyke</strong> by Morris Gleitzman</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dad was flabbergasted when I told him the news. He nearly dropped the plate he was washing up. He stared at me, water dripping off his elbows. 'Fifty million?' he said. 'Your school is selling Ms Fosdyke to West Chirnside Primary for fifty million pounds?' I nodded sadly. 'That's crazy,' said Dad. 'They could get heaps more for a teacher like her. The primary school near the library just paid over seventy million for a year-four teacher with half her experience.'</p>
        <p>Mum nodded as she took the plate from him and dried it. 'And that was a bargain,' she said. 'Last week the high school paid a hundred million pounds for a maths teacher.'</p>
        <p>'Crazy,' said Dad. 'Giving away a top teacher like Ms Fosdyke for fifty million. You don't even get a good footballer for that these days.'</p>
        <p>I agreed. It was crazy. And it was all my fault.</p>
        <p>'Emmy, love, don't chew your pen,' said Mum. 'Those pens cost nearly a pound each. Have you finished your homework?'</p>
        <p>'Almost,' I said. 'I'm doing my creative writing task. I'm making up a story about some teachers who are badly paid and overworked and don't get much respect.'</p>
        <p>Mum frowned. 'Sounds a bit far-fetched,' she said.</p>
        <p>'It's a fantasy story,' I said. 'Ms Fosdyke encourages us to use our imagination.'</p>
        <p>Dad wiped his hands and picked up my exercise book and read a couple of sentences. He frowned and put the exercise book down again. 'Even fantasy stories need to be a little bit believable, Emmy,' he said. 'You can't just write totally impossible crazy stuff.'</p>
        <p>Mum sat down next to me at the kitchen table and put her arm round me. 'You must be feeling sad,' she said. 'About Ms Fosdyke being transferred.'</p>
        <p>I nodded. Mum and Dad both looked sympathetic. Suddenly I knew I had to risk it and tell them. So they'd see why it was so important that Ms Fosdyke didn't leave. ‘Ms Fosdyke thinks that one day . . .' I hesitated for a sec. Was this going to sound dopey? '. . . that one day I could be a teacher.'</p>
        <p>Mum and Dad just stared at me. They were both flabbergasted. 'A teacher?' said Mum.</p>
        <p>'Are you sure?' said Dad.</p>
        <p>I nodded. 'Oh, love,' said Mum. 'That might be pushing it a bit. Why don't you lower your sights just a little. What about being a doctor? Or a lawyer?'</p>
        <p>'I want to be a teacher,' I said quietly. 'I want to help people's minds blossom like Ms Fosdyke does.'</p>
        <p>Mum sighed. 'Emmy,' she said. 'Only the smartest, cleverest, most brilliant people get to be teachers. You know that. It's good to be ambitious, but it's not good to set yourself up for disappointment.'</p>
        <p>'Airline pilot,' said Dad. 'Why not give that a try? That's more sensible, eh?'</p>
        <p>I didn't reply. Mum and Dad meant well, but the trouble was they didn't really believe in me. Not really. Not like Ms Fosdyke. That's why I had to stop her going.</p>

        <p>(excerpt) <strong>How They Broke Away to Go to the Rootabaga Country</strong></p>
        <p>Gimme the Ax lived in a house where everything is the same as it always was.</p>
        <p>“The chimney sits on top of the house and lets the smoke out,” said Gimme the Ax. “The doorknobs open the doors. The windows are always either open or shut. We are always either upstairs or downstairs in this house. Everything is the same as it always was.”</p>
        <p>So he decided to let his children name themselves.</p>
        <p>“The first words they speak as soon as they learn to make words shall be their names,” he said. “They shall name themselves.”</p>
        <p>When the first boy came to the house of Gimme the Ax, he was named Please Gimme. When the first girl came she was named Ax Me No Questions.</p>
        <p>… And they kept on living in the house where everything is the same as it always was. They learned to say just as their father said, “The chimney sits on top of the house and lets the smoke out, the doorknobs open the doors, the windows are always either open or shut, we are always either upstairs or downstairs—everything is the same as it always was.”…</p>
        <p>… So they sold everything they had, pigs, pastures, 6 pepper pickers, pitchforks, everything except their ragbags and a few extras.</p>
        <p>When their neighbors saw them selling everything they had, the different neighbors said, “They are going to Kansas, to Kokomo, to Canada, to Kankakee, to Kalamazoo, to Kamchatka, to the Chattahoochee.”</p>
        <p>…Then [the father] took Please Gimme, his oldest and youngest and only son, and Ax Me No Questions, his oldest and youngest and only daughter, and went to the railroad station.</p>
        <p>The ticket agent was sitting at the window selling railroad tickets the same as always.</p>
        <p>“Do you wish a ticket to go away and come back or do you wish a ticket to go away and never come back?” the ticket agent asked wiping sleep out of his eyes.</p>
        <p>“We wish a ticket to ride where the railroad tracks run off into the sky and never come back—send us far as the railroad rails go and then forty ways farther yet,” was the reply of Gimme the Ax.</p>
        <p>“Then I will give you a new ticket. It blew in. It is a long slick yellow leather slab ticket with a blue spanch across it.”</p>

          <strong>Rootabaga Stories</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>Rootabaga Stories</em> is a collection of fanciful tales that Carl Sandburg originally told as bedtime stories for his three daughters. Some of his interests as a poet, folksinger, and social activist find their way into the stories, but in lighthearted ways. The stories are primarily intended as <strong>whimsical</strong> entertainment, not as social commentary or moral inspiration.</p>

        <p>(excerpt) <strong>How They Broke Away to Go to the Rootabaga Country</strong></p>
        <p>Gimme the Ax lived in a house where everything is the same as it always was.</p>
        <p>“The chimney sits on top of the house and lets the smoke out,” said Gimme the Ax. “The doorknobs open the doors. The windows are always either open or shut. We are always either upstairs or downstairs in this house. Everything is the same as it always was.”</p>
        <p>So he decided to let his children name themselves.</p>
        <p>“The first words they speak as soon as they learn to make words shall be their names,” he said. “They shall name themselves.”</p>
        <p>When the first boy came to the house of Gimme the Ax, he was named Please Gimme. When the first girl came she was named Ax Me No Questions.</p>
        <p>… And they kept on living in the house where everything is the same as it always was. They learned to say just as their father said, “The chimney sits on top of the house and lets the smoke out, the doorknobs open the doors, the windows are always either open or shut, we are always either upstairs or downstairs—everything is the same as it always was.”…</p>
        <p>… So they sold everything they had, pigs, pastures, 6 pepper pickers, pitchforks, everything except their ragbags and a few extras.</p>
        <p>When their neighbors saw them selling everything they had, the different neighbors said, “They are going to Kansas, to Kokomo, to Canada, to Kankakee, to Kalamazoo, to Kamchatka, to the Chattahoochee.”</p>
        <p>…Then [the father] took Please Gimme, his oldest and youngest and only son, and Ax Me No Questions, his oldest and youngest and only daughter, and went to the railroad station.</p>
        <p>The ticket agent was sitting at the window selling railroad tickets the same as always.</p>
        <p>“Do you wish a ticket to go away and come back or do you wish a ticket to go away and never come back?” the ticket agent asked wiping sleep out of his eyes.</p>
        <p>“We wish a ticket to ride where the railroad tracks run off into the sky and never come back—send us far as the railroad rails go and then forty ways farther yet,” was the reply of Gimme the Ax.</p>
        <p>“Then I will give you a new ticket. It blew in. It is a long slick yellow leather slab ticket with a blue spanch across it.”</p>

        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>Rootabaga Stories</em> is a collection of fanciful tales that Carl Sandburg originally told as bedtime stories for his three daughters. Some of his interests as a poet, folksinger, and social activist find their way into the stories, but in lighthearted ways. The stories are primarily intended as <strong>whimsical</strong> entertainment, not as social commentary or moral inspiration.</p>

        <p>(excerpt) <strong>How They Broke Away to Go to the Rootabaga Country</strong></p>
        <p>Gimme the Ax lived in a house where everything is the same as it always was.</p>
        <p>“The chimney sits on top of the house and lets the smoke out,” said Gimme the Ax. “The doorknobs open the doors. The windows are always either open or shut. We are always either upstairs or downstairs in this house. Everything is the same as it always was.”</p>
        <p>So he decided to let his children name themselves.</p>
        <p>“The first words they speak as soon as they learn to make words shall be their names,” he said. “They shall name themselves.”</p>
        <p>When the first boy came to the house of Gimme the Ax, he was named Please Gimme. When the first girl came she was named Ax Me No Questions.</p>
        <p>… And they kept on living in the house where everything is the same as it always was. They learned to say just as their father said, “The chimney sits on top of the house and lets the smoke out, the doorknobs open the doors, the windows are always either open or shut, we are always either upstairs or downstairs—everything is the same as it always was.”…</p>
        <p>… So they sold everything they had, pigs, pastures, 6 pepper pickers, pitchforks, everything except their ragbags and a few extras.</p>
        <p>When their neighbors saw them selling everything they had, the different neighbors said, “They are going to Kansas, to Kokomo, to Canada, to Kankakee, to Kalamazoo, to Kamchatka, to the Chattahoochee.”</p>
        <p>…Then [the father] took Please Gimme, his oldest and youngest and only son, and Ax Me No Questions, his oldest and youngest and only daughter, and went to the railroad station.</p>
        <p>The ticket agent was sitting at the window selling railroad tickets the same as always.</p>
        <p>“Do you wish a ticket to go away and come back or do you wish a ticket to go away and never come back?” the ticket agent asked wiping sleep out of his eyes.</p>
        <p>“We wish a ticket to ride where the railroad tracks run off into the sky and never come back—send us far as the railroad rails go and then forty ways farther yet,” was the reply of Gimme the Ax.</p>
        <p>“Then I will give you a new ticket. It blew in. It is a long slick yellow leather slab ticket with a blue spanch across it.”</p>

          <strong>Read the following passage to answer the next five questions (Question 37 – 41)&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Christmas, the holiday commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, is celebrated by a majority of Christians on December 25 in the Gregorian calendar. But early Christians did not celebrate his birth, and no one knows on which date Jesus was actually born (some scholars believe that the actual date was in the early spring, placing it closer to Easter, the holiday commemorating his Resurrection).</p>
        <p>The origins of the holiday and its December date lie in the ancient Greco-Roman world, as commemorations probably began sometime in the 2nd century. <strong>There are at least three possible origins for the December date</strong>. The Roman Christian historian Sextus Julius Africanus dated Jesus’ conception to March 25 (the same date upon which he held that the world was created), which, after nine months in his mother’s womb, would result in a December 25 birth.</p>
        <p>In the 3rd century, the Roman Empire, which at the time had not adopted Christianity, celebrated the rebirth of the Unconquered Sun (Sol Invictus) on December 25th. This holiday not only marked the return of longer days after the winter solstice but also followed the popular Roman festival called the Saturnalia (during which people feasted and exchanged gifts). It was also the birthday of the Indo-European deity Mithra, a god of light and loyalty whose cult was at the time growing popular among Roman soldiers.</p>
        <p>The church in Rome began formally celebrating Christmas on December 25 in 336, during the reign of the emperor Constantine. As Constantine had made Christianity the effective religion of the empire, some have speculated that choosing this date had the political motive of weakening the established pagan celebrations. The date was not widely accepted in the Eastern Empire, where January 6 had been <strong>favoured</strong>, for another half-century, and Christmas did not become a major Christian festival until the 9th century.</p>
