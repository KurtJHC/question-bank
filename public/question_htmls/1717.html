        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Christmas is my favourite time of the year. However, recently I’ve been finding the frenzy of shopping and wrapping gifts very stressful. Worse, I’ve begun to notice my children lose their passion and excitement after opening their 10th gift and I’m left alone under the Christmas tree, surrounded by wrapping paper and ribbons, to finish the task. At such moments I feel Christmas has become far too commercial.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Christmas is a time to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ. It’s a time of God showing his great love for us. It’s also a time for us to be with family and show our love. I’m not saying we should abandon the gift-giving tradition. But Christmas could be less about finding the right present and be as simple as cooking a festive meal for the family, or even making handmade paper snowflakes with the kids. In my group of friends, we no longer exchange Christmas gifts. My kids are allowed to keep five gifts and we donate the rest to orphanages and other charities. I want to teach them to be grateful for what they have and to show compassion to the less privileged. This is the true meaning of Christmas.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Many have argued Christmas has become too commercial—just a time for toy, card and lighting companies to boost sales. To them I say: “No!”, Christmas remains the season of joy and love. There is nothing more enjoyable than finding the perfect gift for my loved ones. The very quest for these presents encapsulates the caring spirit of Christmas, for these gifts represent my love and thoughts. Nothing fills my heart with more joy than gifting that perfect present to a happy child, and nothing breaks my heart more than a parent who gives those gifts away or tries to teach their kids kindness by depriving them. What is the point? Let them enjoy Christmas and teach them to be charitable all year round and generous by nature. It does not need to become a competition at Christmas about who is least selfish or entitled.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
My family’s tradition is the perfect example of how the meaning of Christmas is alive and well. As a boy, my son would always ask me to deposit his red money packets from Chinese New Year. One year he asked to keep the money, which I allowed, and he kept it in a small box, which I checked periodically. One day in December I discovered it was gone. When I questioned him, he pulled out a small box containing a tiny charm bracelet that he’d spent the money on and wished me a Merry Christmas. I’ll never forget his huge smile and I’ve kept that bracelet to this day. So, to the cynics out there, stop worrying about the “meaning” of Christmas and just give a little something—for it is in the giving that we share our love and show that we care.<br>

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Overpopulation. It is a word that makes politicians wince and is often described as the "elephant in the room" in discussions about the future of the planet. You often hear people citing overpopulation as the single biggest threat to the Earth. But can we really single out population growth in this way? Are there really too many people on our planet? It is clear to all of us that the planet is not expanding. There is only so much space on Earth, not to mention only so many resources – food, water and energy – that can support a human population. So, a growing human population must pose some kind of a threat to the wellbeing of planet Earth, mustn't it? Not necessarily.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
"It is not the number of people on the planet that is the issue – but the number of consumers and the scale and nature of their consumption," says&nbsp;David Satterthwaite, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Environment and Development in London. He quotes Gandhi: "The world has enough for everyone's need, but not enough for everyone's greed." The number of "modern human beings" (Homo&nbsp;sapiens) on Earth has been comparatively small until very recently. Just 10,000 years ago there might have been no more than a few million people on the planet. The one billion mark was not passed until the early 1800s; the two billion mark not until the 1920s. As it stands now, though, the world's population is over 7.3 billion.&nbsp;According to United Nations predictions&nbsp;it could reach 9.7 billion people by 2050, and over 11 billion by 2100.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Population growth has been so rapid that there is no real precedent we can turn to for clues about the possible consequences. In other words, while the planet might hold over 11 billion people by the end of the century, our current level of knowledge does not allow us to predict whether such a large population is sustainable, simply because it has never happened before. We can get clues, though, by considering where population growth is expected to be strongest in the years ahead. Satterthwaite says that most of the growth over the next two decades is predicted to be in urban centres in what are currently low and middle-income countries. On the face of it, the global impact of adding several billion people to these urban centres might be surprisingly small. This is because urbanites in low- and middle-income countries have historically consumed little. The emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases give us a good indication of how high consumption is in a city. "We know of cities in low-income nations that emit less than one tonne CO2-equivalent per person per year," says Satterthwaite. "Cities in high-income nations [can] have six to 30 tonnes CO2-equivalent per person per year."<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Citizens of more affluent nations leave a much greater footprint on our planet than people living in poorer countries – although there are exceptions. Copenhagen is the capital of a high-income nation – Denmark – while Porto Alegre is in upper-middle-income Brazil. Living standards are high in both cities, yet per capita emissions are relatively low. Satterthwaite goes on to say that if we look at an individual's lifestyle, the differences between wealthy and non-wealthy groups are even more dramatic. There are many low-income urban dwellers whose consumption is so low that they contribute almost nothing to greenhouse gas emissions. So, a world with a human population of 11 billion might put comparatively little extra strain on our planet's resources. But the world is changing. Low-income urban centres may not continue on low-carbon development trajectories. The real concern would be if the people living in these areas decided to demand the lifestyles and consumption rates currently considered normal in high-income nations; something many would argue is only fair. If they do, the impact of urban population growth could be much larger.</p>

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Overpopulation. It is a word that makes politicians wince and is often described as the "elephant in the room" in discussions about the future of the planet. You often hear people citing overpopulation as the single biggest threat to the Earth. But can we really single out population growth in this way? Are there really too many people on our planet? It is clear to all of us that the planet is not expanding. There is only so much space on Earth, not to mention only so many resources – food, water and energy – that can support a human population. So, a growing human population must pose some kind of a threat to the wellbeing of planet Earth, mustn't it? Not necessarily.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
"It is not the number of people on the planet that is the issue – but the number of consumers and the scale and nature of their consumption," says&nbsp;David Satterthwaite, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Environment and Development in London. He quotes Gandhi: "The world has enough for everyone's need, but not enough for everyone's greed." The number of "modern human beings" (Homo&nbsp;sapiens) on Earth has been comparatively small until very recently. Just 10,000 years ago there might have been no more than a few million people on the planet. The one billion mark was not passed until the early 1800s; the two billion mark not until the 1920s. As it stands now, though, the world's population is over 7.3 billion.&nbsp;According to United Nations predictions&nbsp;it could reach 9.7 billion people by 2050, and over 11 billion by 2100.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Population growth has been so rapid that there is no real precedent we can turn to for clues about the possible consequences. In other words, while the planet might hold over 11 billion people by the end of the century, our current level of knowledge does not allow us to predict whether such a large population is sustainable, simply because it has never happened before. We can get clues, though, by considering where population growth is expected to be strongest in the years ahead. Satterthwaite says that most of the growth over the next two decades is predicted to be in urban centres in what are currently low and middle-income countries. On the face of it, the global impact of adding several billion people to these urban centres might be surprisingly small. This is because urbanites in low- and middle-income countries have historically consumed little. The emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases give us a good indication of how high consumption is in a city. "We know of cities in low-income nations that emit less than one tonne CO2-equivalent per person per year," says Satterthwaite. "Cities in high-income nations [can] have six to 30 tonnes CO2-equivalent per person per year."<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Citizens of more affluent nations leave a much greater footprint on our planet than people living in poorer countries – although there are exceptions. Copenhagen is the capital of a high-income nation – Denmark – while Porto Alegre is in upper-middle-income Brazil. Living standards are high in both cities, yet per capita emissions are relatively low. Satterthwaite goes on to say that if we look at an individual's lifestyle, the differences between wealthy and non-wealthy groups are even more dramatic. There are many low-income urban dwellers whose consumption is so low that they contribute almost nothing to greenhouse gas emissions. So, a world with a human population of 11 billion might put comparatively little extra strain on our planet's resources. But the world is changing. Low-income urban centres may not continue on low-carbon development trajectories. The real concern would be if the people living in these areas decided to demand the lifestyles and consumption rates currently considered normal in high-income nations; something many would argue is only fair. If they do, the impact of urban population growth could be much larger.</p>

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Overpopulation. It is a word that makes politicians wince and is often described as the "elephant in the room" in discussions about the future of the planet. You often hear people citing overpopulation as the single biggest threat to the Earth. But can we really single out population growth in this way? Are there really too many people on our planet? It is clear to all of us that the planet is not expanding. There is only so much space on Earth, not to mention only so many resources – food, water and energy – that can support a human population. So, a growing human population must pose some kind of a threat to the wellbeing of planet Earth, mustn't it? Not necessarily.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
"It is not the number of people on the planet that is the issue – but the number of consumers and the scale and nature of their consumption," says&nbsp;David Satterthwaite, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Environment and Development in London. He quotes Gandhi: "The world has enough for everyone's need, but not enough for everyone's greed." The number of "modern human beings" (Homo&nbsp;sapiens) on Earth has been comparatively small until very recently. Just 10,000 years ago there might have been no more than a few million people on the planet. The one billion mark was not passed until the early 1800s; the two billion mark not until the 1920s. As it stands now, though, the world's population is over 7.3 billion.&nbsp;According to United Nations predictions&nbsp;it could reach 9.7 billion people by 2050, and over 11 billion by 2100.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Population growth has been so rapid that there is no real precedent we can turn to for clues about the possible consequences. In other words, while the planet might hold over 11 billion people by the end of the century, our current level of knowledge does not allow us to predict whether such a large population is sustainable, simply because it has never happened before. We can get clues, though, by considering where population growth is expected to be strongest in the years ahead. Satterthwaite says that most of the growth over the next two decades is predicted to be in urban centres in what are currently low and middle-income countries. On the face of it, the global impact of adding several billion people to these urban centres might be surprisingly small. This is because urbanites in low- and middle-income countries have historically consumed little. The emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases give us a good indication of how high consumption is in a city. "We know of cities in low-income nations that emit less than one tonne CO2-equivalent per person per year," says Satterthwaite. "Cities in high-income nations [can] have six to 30 tonnes CO2-equivalent per person per year."<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Citizens of more affluent nations leave a much greater footprint on our planet than people living in poorer countries – although there are exceptions. Copenhagen is the capital of a high-income nation – Denmark – while Porto Alegre is in upper-middle-income Brazil. Living standards are high in both cities, yet per capita emissions are relatively low. Satterthwaite goes on to say that if we look at an individual's lifestyle, the differences between wealthy and non-wealthy groups are even more dramatic. There are many low-income urban dwellers whose consumption is so low that they contribute almost nothing to greenhouse gas emissions. So, a world with a human population of 11 billion might put comparatively little extra strain on our planet's resources. But the world is changing. Low-income urban centres may not continue on low-carbon development trajectories. The real concern would be if the people living in these areas decided to demand the lifestyles and consumption rates currently considered normal in high-income nations; something many would argue is only fair. If they do, the impact of urban population growth could be much larger.</p>

          <strong>The Swagman</strong>
        </p>
        <p><br>
Old Bluey was a swaggie who<br>
had travelled on the road,<br>
with his worldly goods all bundled.<br>
He had no fixed <span class="txt-underline"><strong>abode</strong></span>.</p>
        <p><br>
Possessions swung across his back&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;5</em><br>
secure in calico,<br>
a waterproof sheet and blanket<br>
in his swag were set to go.</p>
        <p><br>
Dark blue it was to hide the dirt<br>
with clothes, needle and thread,&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>10</em><br>
a dog-eared photograph or two<br>
and memories in his head.</p>
        <p><br>
He carried one old tattered book,<br>
a small essential <span class="txt-underline"><strong>ration</strong></span>:<br>
An old tin mug swung near his chest&nbsp; <em>15</em><br>
in a carefree fashion.</p>
        <p><br>
In his hand there was a billy<br>
or water in a can.<br>
An axe was tucked in by the side<br>
of Bluey, near his pan.&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>20</em></p>
        <p><br>
Sometimes he would walk forty miles<br>
in just a single day<br>
searching for some casual work,<br>
supplies and food his pay.</p>
        <p><br>
He’d drive the cattle, drive the sheep,&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>25</em><br>
or maybe just chop wood,<br>
and do odd jobs to earn his crust.<br>
He lived best as he could.</p>
        <p><br>
But woe betide a squatter who<br>
denied the swaggie food,&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>30</em><br>
he’d <span class="txt-underline"><strong>find his land was set alight,<br>
his fence to be renewed.</strong></span></p>
        <p><br>
Old Bluey was a battler who<br>
had often found it tough,<br>
but he’d never swap his lifestyle&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>35</em><br>
as freedom was enough.</p>

          <strong>The Swagman</strong>
        </p>
        <p><br>
Old Bluey was a swaggie who<br>
had travelled on the road,<br>
with his worldly goods all bundled.<br>
He had no fixed <span class="txt-underline"><strong>abode</strong></span>.</p>
        <p><br>
Possessions swung across his back&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;5</em><br>
secure in calico,<br>
a waterproof sheet and blanket<br>
in his swag were set to go.</p>
        <p><br>
Dark blue it was to hide the dirt<br>
with clothes, needle and thread,&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>10</em><br>
a dog-eared photograph or two<br>
and memories in his head.</p>
        <p><br>
He carried one old tattered book,<br>
a small essential <span class="txt-underline"><strong>ration</strong></span>:<br>
An old tin mug swung near his chest&nbsp; <em>15</em><br>
in a carefree fashion.</p>
        <p><br>
In his hand there was a billy<br>
or water in a can.<br>
An axe was tucked in by the side<br>
of Bluey, near his pan.&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>20</em></p>
        <p><br>
Sometimes he would walk forty miles<br>
in just a single day<br>
searching for some casual work,<br>
supplies and food his pay.</p>
        <p><br>
He’d drive the cattle, drive the sheep,&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>25</em><br>
or maybe just chop wood,<br>
and do odd jobs to earn his crust.<br>
He lived best as he could.</p>
        <p><br>
But woe betide a squatter who<br>
denied the swaggie food,&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>30</em><br>
he’d <span class="txt-underline"><strong>find his land was set alight,<br>
his fence to be renewed.</strong></span></p>
        <p><br>
Old Bluey was a battler who<br>
had often found it tough,<br>
but he’d never swap his lifestyle&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>35</em><br>
as freedom was enough.</p>
