Miscommunication happens often enough face to face. But it happens far more frequently over text messages.<br>

Alice was texting back and forth with her friend when suddenly she went silent after a simple question. In the middle of a meeting, John received a three-page text message from his wife. Sandy accidently sent a personal text message to the wrong person causing a series of awkward responses. All of these misunderstandings could be avoided by following a few simple guidelines.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Here are the top texting rules: Know your audience. Double check everything. Text alone. Texting is casual conversation only, not serious. Always respond, but don’t open a text message unless you intend to respond immediately. Know the difference between useful and non-useful texting. Remember that pictures are not secure and don’t presume that texting is confidential.<br>

In 2021, buying the best phone means looking for something that should last you a few years. Smartphones’ upgrade cycles are slowing down for a reason. Even at lower prices, it’s getting harder and harder to buy a lemon. In other words, you don’t have to spend a huge amount to get something great, as a bunch of great smartphones are available for around $800.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
It’s harder than ever to decide between everything in that range, but for most people, our pick for the best phone is the Apple iPhone 12. Luckily, if you’re looking for a nocompromise smartphone at any price, the choices over a thousand dollars are much clearer. If you like Android, the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra is incredibly good. And if you want to get the best smartphone on a budget, you can find something really good for under $500 or even under $400.<br>

By texting less and calling more, I was reminded that people are always nicer on the phone than on text. Face to face they are even nicer than that. Arguments are resolved more quickly. But talking on the phone scares people. Technology has created a new rigidity when it comes to conversation. Calling is usually planned and scheduled. I still text all the time. But I am calling more too. I am back in the habit, and for me, it is infinitely more satisfying to have a conversation that is two sided and flexible and unpredictable. No device will be ever able to replace personal conversation.&nbsp;<br>

Should a young child have a mobile? Most mobiles offer almost complete access to the internet and are much harder to filter and control than your home computer. A mobile also gives the outside world, including undesirables, another way to communicate with a child.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Mobiles also put your child at risk for getting in trouble if limits aren’t in place. Or a child might make prank calls or be blamed for them if a classmate takes their phone and uses it to make inappropriate calls.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Whether or not your child is ready for or needs a mobile is something you will have to decide for yourself. Make sure that your child can handle the responsibility for a mobile before you buy one. When getting your younger child, a mobile, consider putting some limits in place.&nbsp;<br>

By texting less and calling more, I was reminded that people are always nicer on the phone than on text. Face to face they are even nicer than that. Arguments are resolved more quickly. But talking on the phone scares people. Technology has created a new rigidity when it comes to conversation. Calling is usually planned and scheduled. I still text all the time. But I am calling more too. I am back in the habit, and for me, it is infinitely more satisfying to have a conversation that is two sided and flexible and unpredictable. No device will be ever able to replace personal conversation.&nbsp;<br>

Should a young child have a mobile? Most mobiles offer almost complete access to the internet and are much harder to filter and control than your home computer. A mobile also gives the outside world, including undesirables, another way to communicate with a child.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Mobiles also put your child at risk for getting in trouble if limits aren’t in place. Or a child might make prank calls or be blamed for them if a classmate takes their phone and uses it to make inappropriate calls.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Whether or not your child is ready for or needs a mobile is something you will have to decide for yourself. Make sure that your child can handle the responsibility for a mobile before you buy one. When getting your younger child, a mobile, consider putting some limits in place.&nbsp;<br>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&nbsp;</strong><br><em>by C. S. Lewis&nbsp;</em><br><br>
"I see you are an idiot, whatever else you may be," said the Queen. "Answer me, once and for all, or I shall lose my patience. Are you human?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Yes, your Majesty," said Edmund.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"And how, pray, did you come to enter my dominions?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Please, your Majesty, I came in through a wardrobe."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"A wardrobe? What do you mean?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"I − I opened a door and just found myself here, your Majesty," said Edmund.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Ha!" said the Queen, speaking more to herself than to him. "A door. A door from the world of men! I have heard of such things. This may wreck all. But he is only one, and he is easily dealt with." As she spoke these words she rose from her seat and looked Edmund full in the face, her eyes flaming; at the same moment she raised her wand. Edmund felt sure that she was going to do something dreadful, but he seemed unable to move. Then, just as he gave himself up for lost, she appeared to change her mind.</p>
        <p>"<span class="txt-underline"><strong>My poor child</strong></span>," she said in quite a different voice, "how cold you look! Come and sit with me here on the sledge and I will put my mantle around you and we will talk."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Edmund did not like this arrangement at all but he dared not disobey; he stepped on to the sledge and sat at her feet, and she put a fold of her fur mantle around him and tucked it well in.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Perhaps something hot to drink?" said the Queen. "Should you like that?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Yes please, your Majesty," said Edmund, whose teeth were chattering.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Edmund felt much better as he began to sip the hot drink he was given. It was something he had never tasted before, very sweet and foamy and creamy, and it warmed him right down to his toes.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"It is dull, Son of Adam, to drink without eating," said the Queen presently. "What would you like best to eat?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Turkish Delight, please, your Majesty," said Edmund.</p>
        <p>The Queen let a drop fall from her bottle on to the snow, and instantly there appeared a round box, tied with green silk ribbon, which, when opened, turned out to contain several pounds of the best Turkish Delight. Each piece was sweet and light to the very centre and Edmund had never tasted anything more delicious. He was quite warm now, and very comfortable.</p>
        <p>While he was eating the Queen kept asking him questions. At first Edmund tried to remember that it is rude to speak with one's mouth full, but soon he forgot about this and thought only of trying to shovel down as much Turkish Delight as he could, and the more he ate the more he wanted to eat, and he never asked himself why the Queen should be so inquisitive. She got him to tell her that he had one brother and two sisters, and that one of his sisters had already been in Narnia and had met a Faun there, and that no one except himself and his brother and his sisters knew anything about Narnia. She seemed especially interested in the fact that there were four of them and kept on coming back to it. "You are sure there are just four of you?" she asked. "Two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve, neither more nor less?" and Edmund, with his mouth full of Turkish Delight, kept on saying, "Yes, I told you that before."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At last, the Turkish Delight was all finished and Edmund was looking very hard at the empty box and wishing that she would ask him whether he would like some more. Probably the Queen knew quite well what he was thinking; for she knew, though Edmund did not, that this was enchanted Turkish Delight and that anyone who had once tasted it would want more and more of it, and would even, if they were allowed, go on eating it till they killed themselves. But she did not offer him anymore. Instead, she said to him,</p>
        <p>"Son of Adam, I should so much like to see your brother and your two sisters. Will you bring them to see me?"</p>
        <p>"I'll try," said Edmund, still looking at the empty box.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&nbsp;</strong><br><em>by C. S. Lewis&nbsp;</em><br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"I see you are an idiot, whatever else you may be," said the Queen. "Answer me, once and for all, or I shall lose my patience. Are you human?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Yes, your Majesty," said Edmund.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"And how, pray, did you come to enter my dominions?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Please, your Majesty, I came in through a wardrobe."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"A wardrobe? What do you mean?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"I − I opened a door and just found myself here, your Majesty," said Edmund.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Ha!" said the Queen, speaking more to herself than to him. "A door. A door from the world of men! I have heard of such things. This may wreck all. But he is only one, and he is easily dealt with." As she spoke these words she rose from her seat and looked Edmund full in the face, her eyes flaming; at the same moment she raised her wand. Edmund felt sure that she was going to do something dreadful, but he seemed unable to move. Then, just as he gave himself up for lost, she appeared to change her mind.</p>
        <p>"<span class="txt-underline"><strong>My poor child,</strong></span>" she said in quite a different voice, "how cold you look! Come and sit with me here on the sledge and I will put my mantle around you and we will talk."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Edmund did not like this arrangement at all but he dared not disobey; he stepped on to the sledge and sat at her feet, and she put a fold of her fur mantle around him and tucked it well in.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Perhaps something hot to drink?" said the Queen. "Should you like that?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Yes please, your Majesty," said Edmund, whose teeth were chattering.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Edmund felt much better as he began to sip the hot drink he was given. It was something he had never tasted before, very sweet and foamy and creamy, and it warmed him right down to his toes.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"It is dull, Son of Adam, to drink without eating," said the Queen presently. "What would you like best to eat?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Turkish Delight, please, your Majesty," said Edmund.</p>
        <p>The Queen let a drop fall from her bottle on to the snow, and instantly there appeared a round box, tied with green silk ribbon, which, when opened, turned out to contain several pounds of the best Turkish Delight. Each piece was sweet and light to the very centre and Edmund had never tasted anything more delicious. He was quite warm now, and very comfortable.</p>
        <p>While he was eating the Queen kept asking him questions. At first Edmund tried to remember that it is rude to speak with one's mouth full, but soon he forgot about this and thought only of trying to shovel down as much Turkish Delight as he could, and the more he ate the more he wanted to eat, and he never asked himself why the Queen should be so inquisitive. She got him to tell her that he had one brother and two sisters, and that one of his sisters had already been in Narnia and had met a Faun there, and that no one except himself and his brother and his sisters knew anything about Narnia. She seemed especially interested in the fact that there were four of them and kept on coming back to it. "You are sure there are just four of you?" she asked. "Two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve, neither more nor less?" and Edmund, with his mouth full of Turkish Delight, kept on saying, "Yes, I told you that before."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At last, the Turkish Delight was all finished and Edmund was looking very hard at the empty box and wishing that she would ask him whether he would like some more. Probably the Queen knew quite well what he was thinking; for she knew, though Edmund did not, that this was enchanted Turkish Delight and that anyone who had once tasted it would want more and more of it, and would even, if they were allowed, go on eating it till they killed themselves. But she did not offer him anymore. Instead, she said to him,</p>
        <p>"Son of Adam, I should so much like to see your brother and your two sisters. Will you bring them to see me?"</p>
        <p>"I'll try," said Edmund, still looking at the empty box.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by C. S. Lewis&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>"I see you are an idiot, whatever else you may be," said the Queen. "Answer me, once and for all, or I shall lose my patience. Are you human?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Yes, your Majesty," said Edmund.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"And how, pray, did you come to enter my dominions?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Please, your Majesty, I came in through a wardrobe."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"A wardrobe? What do you mean?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"I − I opened a door and just found myself here, your Majesty," said Edmund.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Ha!" said the Queen, speaking more to herself than to him. "A door. A door from the world of men! I have heard of such things. This may wreck all. But he is only one, and he is easily dealt with." As she spoke these words she rose from her seat and looked Edmund full in the face, her eyes flaming; at the same moment she raised her wand. Edmund felt sure that she was going to do something dreadful, but he seemed unable to move. Then, just as he gave himself up for lost, she appeared to change her mind.</p>
        <p>"<span class="txt-underline"><strong>My poor child,</strong></span>" she said in quite a different voice, "how cold you look! Come and sit with me here on the sledge and I will put my mantle around you and we will talk."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Edmund did not like this arrangement at all but he dared not disobey; he stepped on to the sledge and sat at her feet, and she put a fold of her fur mantle around him and tucked it well in.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Perhaps something hot to drink?" said the Queen. "Should you like that?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Yes please, your Majesty," said Edmund, whose teeth were chattering.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Edmund felt much better as he began to sip the hot drink he was given. It was something he had never tasted before, very sweet and foamy and creamy, and it warmed him right down to his toes.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"It is dull, Son of Adam, to drink without eating," said the Queen presently. "What would you like best to eat?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Turkish Delight, please, your Majesty," said Edmund.</p>
        <p>The Queen let a drop fall from her bottle on to the snow, and instantly there appeared a round box, tied with green silk ribbon, which, when opened, turned out to contain several pounds of the best Turkish Delight. Each piece was sweet and light to the very centre and Edmund had never tasted anything more delicious. He was quite warm now, and very comfortable.</p>
        <p>While he was eating the Queen kept asking him questions. At first Edmund tried to remember that it is rude to speak with one's mouth full, but soon he forgot about this and thought only of trying to shovel down as much Turkish Delight as he could, and the more he ate the more he wanted to eat, and he never asked himself why the Queen should be so inquisitive. She got him to tell her that he had one brother and two sisters, and that one of his sisters had already been in Narnia and had met a Faun there, and that no one except himself and his brother and his sisters knew anything about Narnia. She seemed especially interested in the fact that there were four of them and kept on coming back to it. "You are sure there are just four of you?" she asked. "Two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve, neither more nor less?" and Edmund, with his mouth full of Turkish Delight, kept on saying, "Yes, I told you that before."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At last, the Turkish Delight was all finished and Edmund was looking very hard at the empty box and wishing that she would ask him whether he would like some more. Probably the Queen knew quite well what he was thinking; for she knew, though Edmund did not, that this was enchanted Turkish Delight and that anyone who had once tasted it would want more and more of it, and would even, if they were allowed, go on eating it till they killed themselves. But she did not offer him anymore. Instead, she said to him,</p>
        <p>"Son of Adam, I should so much like to see your brother and your two sisters. Will you bring them to see me?"</p>
        <p>"I'll try," said Edmund, still looking at the empty box.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by C. S. Lewis&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>"I see you are an idiot, whatever else you may be," said the Queen. "Answer me, once and for all, or I shall lose my patience. Are you human?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Yes, your Majesty," said Edmund.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"And how, pray, did you come to enter my dominions?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Please, your Majesty, I came in through a wardrobe."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"A wardrobe? What do you mean?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"I − I opened a door and just found myself here, your Majesty," said Edmund.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Ha!" said the Queen, speaking more to herself than to him. "A door. A door from the world of men! I have heard of such things. This may wreck all. But he is only one, and he is easily dealt with." As she spoke these words she rose from her seat and looked Edmund full in the face, her eyes flaming; at the same moment she raised her wand. Edmund felt sure that she was going to do something dreadful, but he seemed unable to move. Then, just as he gave himself up for lost, she appeared to change her mind.</p>
        <p>"<span class="txt-underline"><strong>My poor child,</strong></span>" she said in quite a different voice, "how cold you look! Come and sit with me here on the sledge and I will put my mantle around you and we will talk."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Edmund did not like this arrangement at all but he dared not disobey; he stepped on to the sledge and sat at her feet, and she put a fold of her fur mantle around him and tucked it well in.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Perhaps something hot to drink?" said the Queen. "Should you like that?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Yes please, your Majesty," said Edmund, whose teeth were chattering.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Edmund felt much better as he began to sip the hot drink he was given. It was something he had never tasted before, very sweet and foamy and creamy, and it warmed him right down to his toes.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"It is dull, Son of Adam, to drink without eating," said the Queen presently. "What would you like best to eat?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Turkish Delight, please, your Majesty," said Edmund.</p>
        <p>The Queen let a drop fall from her bottle on to the snow, and instantly there appeared a round box, tied with green silk ribbon, which, when opened, turned out to contain several pounds of the best Turkish Delight. Each piece was sweet and light to the very centre and Edmund had never tasted anything more delicious. He was quite warm now, and very comfortable.</p>
        <p>While he was eating the Queen kept asking him questions. At first Edmund tried to remember that it is rude to speak with one's mouth full, but soon he forgot about this and thought only of trying to shovel down as much Turkish Delight as he could, and the more he ate the more he wanted to eat, and he never asked himself why the Queen should be so inquisitive. She got him to tell her that he had one brother and two sisters, and that one of his sisters had already been in Narnia and had met a Faun there, and that no one except himself and his brother and his sisters knew anything about Narnia. She seemed especially interested in the fact that there were four of them and kept on coming back to it. "You are sure there are just four of you?" she asked. "Two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve, neither more nor less?" and Edmund, with his mouth full of Turkish Delight, kept on saying, "Yes, I told you that before."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At last, the Turkish Delight was all finished and Edmund was looking very hard at the empty box and wishing that she would ask him whether he would like some more. Probably the Queen knew quite well what he was thinking; for she knew, though Edmund did not, that this was enchanted Turkish Delight and that anyone who had once tasted it would want more and more of it, and would even, if they were allowed, go on eating it till they killed themselves. But she did not offer him anymore. Instead, she said to him,</p>
        <p>"Son of Adam, I should so much like to see your brother and your two sisters. Will you bring them to see me?"</p>
        <p>"I'll try," said Edmund, still looking at the empty box.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Edmund did not like this arrangement at all but he dared not disobey; he stepped on to the sledge and sat at her feet, and she put a fold of her fur mantle around him and tucked it well in.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Perhaps something hot to drink?" said the Queen. "Should you like that?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Yes please, your Majesty," said Edmund, whose teeth were chattering.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Edmund felt much better as he began to sip the hot drink he was given. It was something he had never tasted before, very sweet and foamy and creamy, and it warmed him right down to his toes.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"It is dull, Son of Adam, to drink without eating," said the Queen presently. "What would you like best to eat?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Turkish Delight, please, your Majesty," said Edmund.</p>
        <p>The Queen let a drop fall from her bottle on to the snow, and instantly there appeared a round box, tied with green silk ribbon, which, when opened, turned out to contain several pounds of the best Turkish Delight. Each piece was sweet and light to the very centre and Edmund had never tasted anything more delicious. He was quite warm now, and very comfortable.</p>
        <p>While he was eating the Queen kept asking him questions. At first Edmund tried to remember that it is rude to speak with one's mouth full, but soon he forgot about this and thought only of trying to shovel down as much Turkish Delight as he could, and the more he ate the more he wanted to eat, and he never asked himself why the Queen should be so inquisitive. She got him to tell her that he had one brother and two sisters, and that one of his sisters had already been in Narnia and had met a Faun there, and that no one except himself and his brother and his sisters knew anything about Narnia. She seemed especially interested in the fact that there were four of them and kept on coming back to it. "You are sure there are just four of you?" she asked. "Two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve, neither more nor less?" and Edmund, with his mouth full of Turkish Delight, kept on saying, "Yes, I told you that before."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At last, the Turkish Delight was all finished and Edmund was looking very hard at the empty box and wishing that she would ask him whether he would like some more. Probably the Queen knew quite well what he was thinking; for she knew, though Edmund did not, that this was enchanted Turkish Delight and that anyone who had once tasted it would want more and more of it, and would even, if they were allowed, go on eating it till they killed themselves. But she did not offer him anymore. Instead, she said to him,</p>
        <p>"Son of Adam, I should so much like to see your brother and your two sisters. Will you bring them to see me?"</p>
        <p>"I'll try," said Edmund, still looking at the empty box.&nbsp;</p>

Oh! I have slipped the surly bonds of Earth<br>
And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings;<br>
Sunward I’ve climbed, and joined the tumbling mirth<br>
Of sun-split clouds, – and done a hundred things<br>
You have not dreamed of – wheeled and soared and swung<br>
High in the sunlit silence. Hov’ring there,<br>
I’ve chased the shouting wind along, and flung<br>
My eager craft through footless halls of air…<br>
<br>
Up, up the long, delirious burning blue<br>
I’ve topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace<br>
Where never lark, or ever eagle flew –<br>
And, while with silent, lifting mind I’ve trod<br>
The high untrespassed sanctity of space,<br>
Put out my hand, and touched the face of God.</p>

Oh! I have slipped the surly bonds of Earth<br>
And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings;<br>
Sunward I’ve climbed, and joined the tumbling mirth<br>
Of sun-split clouds, – and done a hundred things<br>
You have not dreamed of – wheeled and soared and swung<br>
High in the sunlit silence. Hov’ring there,<br>
I’ve chased the shouting wind along, and flung<br>
My eager craft through footless halls of air…<br>
<br>
Up, up the long, delirious burning blue<br>
I’ve topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace<br>
Where never lark, or ever eagle flew –<br>
And, while with silent, lifting mind I’ve trod<br>
The high untrespassed sanctity of space,<br>
​Put out my hand, and touched the face of God.</p>

Oh! I have slipped the surly bonds of Earth<br>
And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings;<br>
Sunward I’ve climbed, and joined the tumbling mirth<br>
Of sun-split clouds, – and done a hundred things<br>
You have not dreamed of – wheeled and soared and swung<br>
High in the sunlit silence. Hov’ring there,<br>
I’ve chased the shouting wind along, and flung<br>
My eager craft through footless halls of air…<br>
<br>
Up, up the long, delirious burning blue<br>
I’ve topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace<br>
Where never lark, or ever eagle flew –<br>
And, while with silent, lifting mind I’ve trod<br>
The high untrespassed sanctity of space,<br>
​Put out my hand, and touched the face of God.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Dolphins and Porpoises&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Dolphins and porpoises delight us with their playful antics and warm our hearts with their friendly faces. Marine species are the most well-known, but there are several species that live in freshwater rivers. All are air-breathing, warm-blooded mammals that nurse their young.<strong> 15 ……….</strong> Dolphins have longer snouts, bigger mouths, more curved dorsal fins, and longer, leaner bodies than porpoises.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>People use the terms dolphins, porpoises, and whales to describe marine mammals belonging to the order Cetacea (from the Greek work ketos, “large sea creature”). <strong>16 ……</strong> The orca, or killer whale, for example, is actually the largest member of the dolphin family. Dolphins and porpoises are at the top of the food chain and have an important role in the overall balance of the marine environment. They can tell us a lot about the health of the ocean. This includes the presence of pollution or the decline in fish. They are also very popular with tourists.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dolphins are by far more prevalent than porpoises. Most scientists agree that there are 32 dolphin species (plus five closely related species of river dolphin) and only six porpoise species. The harbour porpoise, for example, has small, pointed flippers and no beak. The dorsal fin is small and triangular-shaped.<strong> 17 ……….</strong> Both have large, complex brains and a structure in their foreheads, called the melon. With this they generate sonar (sound waves) to navigate their underwater world.</p>
        <p><strong>18 ……….</strong> Dolphins and porpoises differ in their faces, fins, and body shapes. Dolphins have longer noses, bigger mouths, more curved dorsal fins, and longer, leaner bodies than porpoises. The Northeastern Spotted Dolphin has a falcate, or sickle-shaped dorsal fin and light spotting on the belly.</p>
        <p>Other differences also include their faces (who can forget Flipper’s famous “grin”?), their fins, and their figures. Dolphins tend to have prominent, elongated “beaks”, while porpoises have smaller mouths. But the central distinguishing feature is actually their teeth. Dolphins all have cone-shaped teeth, whereas porpoises have flat, spade- shaped teeth. While this distinction may be apparent on a skull in a museum, it’s a tricky one to make in the field. <strong>19 ……….</strong> The dolphin’s hooked or curved dorsal fin (the one in the middle of the animal’s back) also differs from the porpoise’s triangular dorsal fin. Generally speaking, dolphin bodies are leaner, and porpoises’ bodies are portly.</p>
        <p>Dolphins are also more talkative than porpoises. Dolphins make whistling sounds through their blowholes to communicate with one another underwater. Scientists are pretty sure that porpoises do not do this. <strong>20 ……….</strong> It is likely that more (or fewer) differences&nbsp;between dolphins and porpoises will be revealed as researchers continue to investigate these intriguing sentinels of the sea.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Dolphins and Porpoises&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Dolphins and porpoises delight us with their playful antics and warm our hearts with their friendly faces. Marine species are the most well-known, but there are several species that live in freshwater rivers. All are air-breathing, warm-blooded mammals that nurse their young.<strong> 15 ……….</strong> Dolphins have longer snouts, bigger mouths, more curved dorsal fins, and longer, leaner bodies than porpoises.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>People use the terms dolphins, porpoises, and whales to describe marine mammals belonging to the order Cetacea (from the Greek work ketos, “large sea creature”). <strong>16 ……</strong> The orca, or killer whale, for example, is actually the largest member of the dolphin family. Dolphins and porpoises are at the top of the food chain and have an important role in the overall balance of the marine environment. They can tell us a lot about the health of the ocean. This includes the presence of pollution or the decline in fish. They are also very popular with tourists.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dolphins are by far more prevalent than porpoises. Most scientists agree that there are 32 dolphin species (plus five closely related species of river dolphin) and only six porpoise species. The harbour porpoise, for example, has small, pointed flippers and no beak. The dorsal fin is small and triangular-shaped.<strong> 17 ……….</strong> Both have large, complex brains and a structure in their foreheads, called the melon. With this they generate sonar (sound waves) to navigate their underwater world.</p>
        <p><strong>18 ……….</strong> Dolphins and porpoises differ in their faces, fins, and body shapes. Dolphins have longer noses, bigger mouths, more curved dorsal fins, and longer, leaner bodies than porpoises. The Northeastern Spotted Dolphin has a falcate, or sickle-shaped dorsal fin and light spotting on the belly.</p>
        <p>Other differences also include their faces (who can forget Flipper’s famous “grin”?), their fins, and their figures. Dolphins tend to have prominent, elongated “beaks”, while porpoises have smaller mouths. But the central distinguishing feature is actually their teeth. Dolphins all have cone-shaped teeth, whereas porpoises have flat, spade- shaped teeth. While this distinction may be apparent on a skull in a museum, it’s a tricky one to make in the field. <strong>19 ……….</strong> The dolphin’s hooked or curved dorsal fin (the one in the middle of the animal’s back) also differs from the porpoise’s triangular dorsal fin. Generally speaking, dolphin bodies are leaner, and porpoises’ bodies are portly.</p>
        <p>Dolphins are also more talkative than porpoises. Dolphins make whistling sounds through their blowholes to communicate with one another underwater. Scientists are pretty sure that porpoises do not do this. <strong>20 ……….</strong> It is likely that more (or fewer) differences&nbsp;between dolphins and porpoises will be revealed as researchers continue to investigate these intriguing sentinels of the sea.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Dolphins and Porpoises&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Dolphins and porpoises delight us with their playful antics and warm our hearts with their friendly faces. Marine species are the most well-known, but there are several species that live in freshwater rivers. All are air-breathing, warm-blooded mammals that nurse their young.&nbsp;<strong>15 ……….</strong>&nbsp;Dolphins have longer snouts, bigger mouths, more curved dorsal fins, and longer, leaner bodies than porpoises.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>People use the terms dolphins, porpoises, and whales to describe marine mammals belonging to the order Cetacea (from the Greek work ketos, “large sea creature”).&nbsp;<strong>16 ……</strong>&nbsp;The orca, or killer whale, for example, is actually the largest member of the dolphin family. Dolphins and porpoises are at the top of the food chain and have an important role in the overall balance of the marine environment. They can tell us a lot about the health of the ocean. This includes the presence of pollution or the decline in fish. They are also very popular with tourists.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dolphins are by far more prevalent than porpoises. Most scientists agree that there are 32 dolphin species (plus five closely related species of river dolphin) and only six porpoise species. The harbour porpoise, for example, has small, pointed flippers and no beak. The dorsal fin is small and triangular-shaped.<strong>&nbsp;17 ……….</strong>&nbsp;Both have large, complex brains and a structure in their foreheads, called the melon. With this they generate sonar (sound waves) to navigate their underwater world.</p>
        <p><strong>18 ……….</strong>&nbsp;Dolphins and porpoises differ in their faces, fins, and body shapes. Dolphins have longer noses, bigger mouths, more curved dorsal fins, and longer, leaner bodies than porpoises. The Northeastern Spotted Dolphin has a falcate, or sickle-shaped dorsal fin and light spotting on the belly.</p>
        <p>Other differences also include their faces (who can forget Flipper’s famous “grin”?), their fins, and their figures. Dolphins tend to have prominent, elongated “beaks”, while porpoises have smaller mouths. But the central distinguishing feature is actually their teeth. Dolphins all have cone-shaped teeth, whereas porpoises have flat, spade- shaped teeth. While this distinction may be apparent on a skull in a museum, it’s a tricky one to make in the field.&nbsp;<strong>19 ……….</strong>&nbsp;The dolphin’s hooked or curved dorsal fin (the one in the middle of the animal’s back) also differs from the porpoise’s triangular dorsal fin. Generally speaking, dolphin bodies are leaner, and porpoises’ bodies are portly.</p>
        <p>Dolphins are also more talkative than porpoises. Dolphins make whistling sounds through their blowholes to communicate with one another underwater. Scientists are pretty sure that porpoises do not do this.&nbsp;<strong>20 ……….</strong>&nbsp;It is likely that more (or fewer) differences&nbsp;between dolphins and porpoises will be revealed as researchers continue to investigate these intriguing sentinels of the sea.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Dolphins and Porpoises&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Dolphins and porpoises delight us with their playful antics and warm our hearts with their friendly faces. Marine species are the most well-known, but there are several species that live in freshwater rivers. All are air-breathing, warm-blooded mammals that nurse their young.<strong> 15 ……….</strong> Dolphins have longer snouts, bigger mouths, more curved dorsal fins, and longer, leaner bodies than porpoises.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>People use the terms dolphins, porpoises, and whales to describe marine mammals belonging to the order Cetacea (from the Greek work ketos, “large sea creature”). <strong>16 ……</strong> The orca, or killer whale, for example, is actually the largest member of the dolphin family. Dolphins and porpoises are at the top of the food chain and have an important role in the overall balance of the marine environment. They can tell us a lot about the health of the ocean. This includes the presence of pollution or the decline in fish. They are also very popular with tourists.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dolphins are by far more prevalent than porpoises. Most scientists agree that there are 32 dolphin species (plus five closely related species of river dolphin) and only six porpoise species. The harbour porpoise, for example, has small, pointed flippers and no beak. The dorsal fin is small and triangular-shaped.<strong> 17 ……….</strong> Both have large, complex brains and a structure in their foreheads, called the melon. With this they generate sonar (sound waves) to navigate their underwater world.</p>
        <p><strong>18 ……….</strong> Dolphins and porpoises differ in their faces, fins, and body shapes. Dolphins have longer noses, bigger mouths, more curved dorsal fins, and longer, leaner bodies than porpoises. The Northeastern Spotted Dolphin has a falcate, or sickle-shaped dorsal fin and light spotting on the belly.</p>
        <p>Other differences also include their faces (who can forget Flipper’s famous “grin”?), their fins, and their figures. Dolphins tend to have prominent, elongated “beaks”, while porpoises have smaller mouths. But the central distinguishing feature is actually their teeth. Dolphins all have cone-shaped teeth, whereas porpoises have flat, spade- shaped teeth. While this distinction may be apparent on a skull in a museum, it’s a tricky one to make in the field. <strong>19 ……….</strong> The dolphin’s hooked or curved dorsal fin (the one in the middle of the animal’s back) also differs from the porpoise’s triangular dorsal fin. Generally speaking, dolphin bodies are leaner, and porpoises’ bodies are portly.</p>
        <p>Dolphins are also more talkative than porpoises. Dolphins make whistling sounds through their blowholes to communicate with one another underwater. Scientists are pretty sure that porpoises do not do this. <strong>20 ……….</strong> It is likely that more (or fewer) differences&nbsp;between dolphins and porpoises will be revealed as researchers continue to investigate these intriguing sentinels of the sea.</p>
