I’m surprised you got here so early!” Director Cha says again, swinging the door shut and consulting the wall clock. It’s 10:48, and she told me to stop by at 11:00. “I didn’t want to wear Fran out. He looked exhausted,” I say, my eyes falling on a lone medical glove lying on the otherwise pristine hardwood floor. Noticing me noticing it, Director Cha snatches it up and nudges me toward the dining room. “Let’s go,” she says. In the dining room, she wants to know what I’d like to drink. I tell her water’s fine, but she insists I choose something more exciting, since she’s about to have red wine. “It has been a day,” she says. I settle on a tall glass of iced plum tea for its purported digestive benefits. The back-to-back rides in the mirror have me feeling a bit woozy. Between sips of tea, I tell Director Cha about my visit with Fran, whose quiet strength and commitment make me feel emotional all over again. “You don’t grow old in Snowglobe for nothing,” sighs Director Cha, twirling the wineglass in her hand and watching its contents swirl. “If young actors these days were only half as dedicated as Fran …” If that remark was a dig at Haeri, it didn’t escape me. I tip the glass back and let an ice cube slide out into my mouth. Rolling it around against the inside of my cheek, I notice for the first time how tired the director looks. Cha will pay for what she did. It’s a promise. Am I obligated to let her know that Bonwhe is watching her? That Haeri’s secret friend might throw a wrench into her plan—our plan? But then Bonwhe’s face comes to mind again, his eyes full of warm affection for me, for Haeri, and I can’t imagine saying a word. Don’t use the portals again. Had it been someone other than Bonwhe on the other side of the mirror, I would have found myself in some serious trouble. So I need to keep my promise not to tell anyone anything about the secret elevator or encountering Bonwhe tonight. “Haeri.” Director Cha’s voice brings me back. “Enough about Fran. I want to hear about you now. Have you thought about my proposal?” Bonwhe’s voice echoes in my ear again: Leave it all behind … The way she abused you all these years …&nbsp;</p>
        <p>What does that mean to me? And no one’s put more loving care and effort into the construction of Haeri’s life than Director Cha. Should she be punished for that? I know what I’ve decided. “I’d like to become Haeri,” I say. A smile of gratification blooms across her face. “Then Haeri you will be,” she says, gazing at me proudly. “Your life will be the life against which everyone measures theirs. I’ll make sure of it.” A pause. “You just have to keep doing what you’ve been doing. Smile, laugh, be lovely, be confident. Keep being yourself. Keep being the girl who can’t be intimidated even in a packed stadium, and whose response had the biathlon champ and spectators teetering on the brink, you know what I mean?” Then, pitching her voice low as if sharing a secret, she adds, “You do that, and before you know it, we’ll have entered the castle.” Castle? What castle? Puzzled, I ask what she means and, a sly grin forming on her lips, she asks me instead, “Bonwhe … what was he like in person? Be honest. Have you seen anyone better looking?” I don’t know what to say. What is she after? Still, her question has me imagining us holding hands, and my heart starts to skip. Because you’re you. “Tall, handsome, smart, rich, and with impeccable manners to boot. What girl your age wouldn’t melt at the sight of him?” She’s watching me carefully, trying to get a read. I drop my eyes to the cold glass in my hand and wipe at the beads of condensation with my thumb. “How would you like him to be your man?” I lift my face and give her a blank look, not understanding. She smiles and continues, holding me with her eyes. “The heir of the world’s finest family, poised to inherit power and money? I happen to think he satisfies all the qualifications for being Goh Haeri’s partner. What do you think?” “I—I thought the Yibonns tend to marry their children to equals.” This is true. It’s unthinkable for a Yibonn heir to marry a common actor instead of someone of a fine lineage, like a director or something. “They tend to,” she says, stressing the tend. “But I’m sure you can recall an exception, what with your encyclopedic knowledge of Snowglobe.” There has been an exception, yes, and it involves none other than Bonshim, Bonwhe’s mother and the vice-president of the Yibonn group. She married an actor, Bonwhe’s father. The thing is, this exception had only been allowed because Bonil, the eldest son, had been next in the line of succession, not Bonshim. And when he shocked the world by formally opting out of the title in his midtwenties, it pushed Bonshim up in the bracket, making her the dynasty’s new heiress. By that time, she’d already married the commoner and given birth to Bonwhe. Some years later, news broke that Bonil had ended his engagement to his longtime fiancée. And that tragic fiancée happens to be Director Cha.&nbsp;<br>

I’ll make sure of it.” A pause. “You just have to keep doing what you’ve been doing. Smile, laugh, be lovely, be confident. Keep being yourself. Keep being the girl who can’t be intimidated even in a packed stadium, and whose response had the biathlon champ and spectators teetering on the brink, you know what I mean?” Then, pitching her voice low as if sharing a secret, she adds, “You do that, and before you know it, we’ll have entered the castle.” Castle? What castle? Puzzled, I ask what she means and, a sly grin forming on her lips, she asks me instead, “Bonwhe … what was he like in person? Be honest. Have you seen anyone better looking?” I don’t know what to say. What is she after? Still, her question has me imagining us holding hands, and my heart starts to skip. Because you’re you. “Tall, handsome, smart, rich, and with impeccable manners to boot. What girl your age wouldn’t melt at the sight of him?” She’s watching me carefully, trying to get a read. I drop my eyes to the cold glass in my hand and wipe at the beads of condensation with my thumb. “How would you like him to be your man?” I lift my face and give her a blank look, not understanding. She smiles and continues, holding me with her eyes. “The heir of the world’s finest family, poised to inherit power and money? I happen to think he satisfies all the qualifications for being Goh Haeri’s partner. What do you think?” “I—I thought the Yibonns tend to marry their children to equals.” This is true. It’s unthinkable for a Yibonn heir to marry a common actor instead of someone of a fine lineage, like a director or something. “They tend to,” she says, stressing the tend. “But I’m sure you can recall an exception, what with your encyclopedic knowledge of Snowglobe.” There has been an exception, yes, and it involves none other than Bonshim, Bonwhe’s mother and the vice-president of the Yibonn group. She married an actor, Bonwhe’s father. The thing is, this exception had only been allowed because Bonil, the eldest son, had been next in the line of succession, not Bonshim. And when he shocked the world by formally opting out of the title in his midtwenties, it pushed Bonshim up in the bracket, making her the dynasty’s new heiress. By that time, she’d already married the commoner and given birth to Bonwhe. Some years later, news broke that Bonil had ended his engagement to his longtime fiancée. And that tragic fiancée happens to be Director Cha.&nbsp;<br>

I’m surprised you got here so early!” Director Cha says again, swinging the door shut and consulting the wall clock. It’s 10:48, and she told me to stop by at 11:00. “I didn’t want to wear Fran out. He looked exhausted,” I say, my eyes falling on a lone medical glove lying on the otherwise pristine hardwood floor. Noticing me noticing it, Director Cha snatches it up and nudges me toward the dining room. “Let’s go,” she says. In the dining room, she wants to know what I’d like to drink. I tell her water’s fine, but she insists I choose something more exciting, since she’s about to have red wine. “It has been a day,” she says. I settle on a tall glass of iced plum tea for its purported digestive benefits. The back-to-back rides in the mirror have me feeling a bit woozy. Between sips of tea, I tell Director Cha about my visit with Fran, whose quiet strength and commitment make me feel emotional all over again. “You don’t grow old in Snowglobe for nothing,” sighs Director Cha, twirling the wineglass in her hand and watching its contents swirl. “If young actors these days were only half as dedicated as Fran …” If that remark was a dig at Haeri, it didn’t escape me. I tip the glass back and let an ice cube slide out into my mouth. Rolling it around against the inside of my cheek, I notice for the first time how tired the director looks. Cha will pay for what she did. It’s a promise. Am I obligated to let her know that Bonwhe is watching her? That Haeri’s secret friend might throw a wrench into her plan—our plan? But then Bonwhe’s face comes to mind again, his eyes full of warm affection for me, for Haeri, and I can’t imagine saying a word. Don’t use the portals again. Had it been someone other than Bonwhe on the other side of the mirror, I would have found myself in some serious trouble. So I need to keep my promise not to tell anyone anything about the secret elevator or encountering Bonwhe tonight. “Haeri.” Director Cha’s voice brings me back. “Enough about Fran. I want to hear about you now. Have you thought about my proposal?” Bonwhe’s voice echoes in my ear again: Leave it all behind … The way she abused you all these years …&nbsp;</p>
        <p>What does that mean to me? And no one’s put more loving care and effort into the construction of Haeri’s life than Director Cha. Should she be punished for that? I know what I’ve decided. “I’d like to become Haeri,” I say. A smile of gratification blooms across her face. “Then Haeri you will be,” she says, gazing at me proudly. “Your life will be the life against which everyone measures theirs.

I’m surprised you got here so early!” Director Cha says again, swinging the door shut and consulting the wall clock. It’s 10:48, and she told me to stop by at 11:00. “I didn’t want to wear Fran out. He looked exhausted,” I say, my eyes falling on a lone medical glove lying on the otherwise pristine hardwood floor. Noticing me noticing it, Director Cha snatches it up and nudges me toward the dining room. “Let’s go,” she says. In the dining room, she wants to know what I’d like to drink. I tell her water’s fine, but she insists I choose something more exciting, since she’s about to have red wine. “It has been a day,” she says. I settle on a tall glass of iced plum tea for its purported digestive benefits. The back-to-back rides in the mirror have me feeling a bit woozy. Between sips of tea, I tell Director Cha about my visit with Fran, whose quiet strength and commitment make me feel emotional all over again. “You don’t grow old in Snowglobe for nothing,” sighs Director Cha, twirling the wineglass in her hand and watching its contents swirl. “If young actors these days were only half as dedicated as Fran …” If that remark was a dig at Haeri, it didn’t escape me. I tip the glass back and let an ice cube slide out into my mouth. Rolling it around against the inside of my cheek, I notice for the first time how tired the director looks. Cha will pay for what she did. It’s a promise. Am I obligated to let her know that Bonwhe is watching her? That Haeri’s secret friend might throw a wrench into her plan—our plan? But then Bonwhe’s face comes to mind again, his eyes full of warm affection for me, for Haeri, and I can’t imagine saying a word. Don’t use the portals again. Had it been someone other than Bonwhe on the other side of the mirror, I would have found myself in some serious trouble. So I need to keep my promise not to tell anyone anything about the secret elevator or encountering Bonwhe tonight. “Haeri.” Director Cha’s voice brings me back. “Enough about Fran. I want to hear about you now. Have you thought about my proposal?” Bonwhe’s voice echoes in my ear again: Leave it all behind … The way she abused you all these years …&nbsp;</p>
        <p>What does that mean to me? And no one’s put more loving care and effort into the construction of Haeri’s life than Director Cha. Should she be punished for that? I know what I’ve decided. “I’d like to become Haeri,” I say. A smile of gratification blooms across her face. “Then Haeri you will be,” she says, gazing at me proudly. “Your life will be the life against which everyone measures theirs. I’ll make sure of it.” A pause. “You just have to keep doing what you’ve been doing. Smile, laugh, be lovely, be confident. Keep being yourself. Keep being the girl who can’t be intimidated even in a packed stadium, and whose response had the biathlon champ and spectators teetering on the brink, you know what I mean?” Then, pitching her voice low as if sharing a secret, she adds, “You do that, and before you know it, we’ll have entered the castle.” Castle? What castle? Puzzled, I ask what she means and, a sly grin forming on her lips, she asks me instead, “Bonwhe … what was he like in person? Be honest. Have you seen anyone better looking?” I don’t know what to say. What is she after? Still, her question has me imagining us holding hands, and my heart starts to skip. Because you’re you. “Tall, handsome, smart, rich, and with impeccable manners to boot. What girl your age wouldn’t melt at the sight of him?” She’s watching me carefully, trying to get a read. I drop my eyes to the cold glass in my hand and wipe at the beads of condensation with my thumb. “How would you like him to be your man?” I lift my face and give her a blank look, not understanding. She smiles and continues, holding me with her eyes. “The heir of the world’s finest family, poised to inherit power and money? I happen to think he satisfies all the qualifications for being Goh Haeri’s partner. What do you think?” “I—I thought the Yibonns tend to marry their children to equals.” This is true. It’s unthinkable for a Yibonn heir to marry a common actor instead of someone of a fine lineage, like a director or something. “They tend to,” she says, stressing the tend. “But I’m sure you can recall an exception, what with your encyclopedic knowledge of Snowglobe.” There has been an exception, yes, and it involves none other than Bonshim, Bonwhe’s mother and the vice-president of the Yibonn group. She married an actor, Bonwhe’s father. The thing is, this exception had only been allowed because Bonil, the eldest son, had been next in the line of succession, not Bonshim. And when he shocked the world by formally opting out of the title in his midtwenties, it pushed Bonshim up in the bracket, making her the dynasty’s new heiress. By that time, she’d already married the commoner and given birth to Bonwhe. Some years later, news broke that Bonil had ended his engagement to his longtime fiancée. And that tragic fiancée happens to be Director Cha.&nbsp;<br>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br>
“Don’t worry,” she assures me. “Dr. Cha is with us. I’m calling from her office right now.” Dr. Cha. Did she supply her sister with the vaccines and frostbite cream, too? Even more confused, I push back: “Why would she help us instead of her sister?” In a stark voice, Haeri replies, “Someone has to stop the director. People can’t even grasp what she has done.” I think of Bonwhe, and how much he hates her. Before I can stop myself, I’m blurting out, “I know another person who might help—” But Haeri cuts me off. “We don’t have much time. I have to be back in my room before the slate.” Okay. I’ll talk to her about Bonwhe when I see her later. “Meet you out on the deck,” she says. “Make sure Fran’s with you so Director Cha doesn’t get suspicious. Dr. Cha will take care of Fran after that.” I feel my heart drop, just thinking about the cameras capturing me and Haeri side by side. Director Cha would be furious. Does Haeri know what kind of danger this exposes us to? And what about my family?</p>
        <p>“We’ll get caught,” I insist, my voice a pathetic bleat in my ears. “We won’t,” Haeri counters calmly. “There’s a blind spot, the only one on the seventy-third floor. I’ll see you tonight.” I gaze numbly at my dark silhouette in the mirror as Haeri gives me a quick set of instructions about the blind spot, then breaks the connection. I hurry back to bed and close my eyes. A few seconds later, the slate goes off and everything resumes. I want to thank her. I want to tell her that I’m sorry, again and again. I want to summon the strength to admit that I’m no victim here, that I was all too happy to steal what’s hers. But the truth is, I can’t. I spend the day trying my best to pretend that everything is fine and go about Haeri’s life as though nothing has changed. When night falls, I return to the 73rd floor and greet Fran with a hug and hand him the kale juice I brought—a little surprise from his favorite juice bar and the perfect excuse to stop by. He takes a sip of the juice and smiles widely. His buoyant mood makes me feel extra guilty about dragging him into today’s mission as a prop, but there was no other option. After some time chatting, I suggest going outside to enjoy the night air, and he happily agrees. When we walk out onto the deck, the doctor is sitting on the bench, and Fran heads straight for her, singing out warmly, “Hello, Dr. Cha!” The doctor looks up and returns the greeting and Fran continues, “Isn’t that your patient over there?” He’s referring to Haeri, sitting in a wheelchair at the far end of the deck. She’s partially obscured by a protruding column, which I can only guess is on purpose for the cameras. “Yes,” Dr. Cha replies with a sigh. “She needs to stay inside during the day. She’s being treated for facial burns, but thankfully, she’s nearly all healed.” Then, in a darker tone, she adds, “It’s depression she’s fighting now.” Fran nods, a knowing expression on his face. The doctor makes as though she’s going to head back in, but then she turns to Fran. “You haven’t had your vitals checked this evening, have you? How about we do it now before I clock out?” Fran looks to me, and I nod enthusiastically. A few moments later, Fran and Dr. Cha disappear into the building, and as if on cue, wet drops begin to splatter on my head and shoulders. It’s the rain Bonwhe and I drew together yesterday. Whirrrr— I look up at the sound and see that the automatic awning is sliding out, activated by the precipitation. By the time it extends over the whole of the deck, the erratic tapping of the raindrops has turned into a steady pitter-patter. “Rain was in the forecast,” I chirp for the cameras. Then, stretching my arms over my head, I sneak a concerned look at the depressed burn patient—also for the cameras—before heading to the blind spot on the opposite end of the deck, as if in deference to the patient’s need for privacy and quiet. By the rules of architectural symmetry, the other end of the deck is also half obscured by a protruding column. The blind spot is tiny, and anyone bigger than us would have a hard time disappearing behind it. Sucking in my stomach, I wedge myself into the narrow space behind the column and begin edging sideways, my hair standing on end at the thought of the rain stopping, and the awning retracting to expose me to the cameras above in my crab walk. When I emerge from the other end, Haeri greets me from her wheelchair, her eyes soft and smiling above the blue surgical mask. Met with those eyes again, all I want to do is pour my heart out, tell her how happy I am to find out that her suicide was just a nasty lie—the worst story anyone could ever come up with. But all I’m able to manage is a stupid grimace before she lifts a hand and pulls the mask down to her chin, showing me her flawless face. Is it makeup? There’s no trace of the burn I saw on the Polaroid. Slowly, she pushes herself out of the wheelchair and stands before me. We stare at each other, transfixed. Is this what it feels like to have an out-of-body experience? A raindrop splashes on my nose, waking me from my trance. “Haeri—” I begin, but she puts a finger to her lips and I’m reminded that we’re in a blind spot, not a deaf spot. If we can’t talk, though, what are we to do? It’s then that Haeri lunges for me and seizes my arm. Then a sharp sting in my neck flashes me back to the flu shot Director Cha gave me. The next thing I know, Haeri is taking a small step back, her eyes hard and mouth clamped tight, a strange-looking syringe clutched in her pale, trembling hand. I find myself slumping limply into her, my eyes falling shut. I feel as heavy as a lead brick sinking to the bottom of the sea.<br>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br>
“Don’t worry,” she assures me. “Dr. Cha is with us. I’m calling from her office right now.” Dr. Cha. Did she supply her sister with the vaccines and frostbite cream, too? Even more confused, I push back: “Why would she help us instead of her sister?” In a stark voice, Haeri replies, “Someone has to stop the director. People can’t even grasp what she has done.” I think of Bonwhe, and how much he hates her. Before I can stop myself, I’m blurting out, “I know another person who might help—” But Haeri cuts me off. “We don’t have much time. I have to be back in my room before the slate.” Okay. I’ll talk to her about Bonwhe when I see her later. “Meet you out on the deck,” she says. “Make sure Fran’s with you so Director Cha doesn’t get suspicious. Dr. Cha will take care of Fran after that.” I feel my heart drop, just thinking about the cameras capturing me and Haeri side by side. Director Cha would be furious. Does Haeri know what kind of danger this exposes us to? And what about my family?</p>
        <p>“We’ll get caught,” I insist, my voice a pathetic bleat in my ears. “We won’t,” Haeri counters calmly. “There’s a blind spot, the only one on the seventy-third floor. I’ll see you tonight.” I gaze numbly at my dark silhouette in the mirror as Haeri gives me a quick set of instructions about the blind spot, then breaks the connection. I hurry back to bed and close my eyes. A few seconds later, the slate goes off and everything resumes. I want to thank her. I want to tell her that I’m sorry, again and again. I want to summon the strength to admit that I’m no victim here, that I was all too happy to steal what’s hers. But the truth is, I can’t. I spend the day trying my best to pretend that everything is fine and go about Haeri’s life as though nothing has changed. When night falls, I return to the 73rd floor and greet Fran with a hug and hand him the kale juice I brought—a little surprise from his favorite juice bar and the perfect excuse to stop by. He takes a sip of the juice and smiles widely. His buoyant mood makes me feel extra guilty about dragging him into today’s mission as a prop, but there was no other option. After some time chatting, I suggest going outside to enjoy the night air, and he happily agrees. When we walk out onto the deck, the doctor is sitting on the bench, and Fran heads straight for her, singing out warmly, “Hello, Dr. Cha!” The doctor looks up and returns the greeting and Fran continues, “Isn’t that your patient over there?” He’s referring to Haeri, sitting in a wheelchair at the far end of the deck. She’s partially obscured by a protruding column, which I can only guess is on purpose for the cameras. “Yes,” Dr. Cha replies with a sigh. “She needs to stay inside during the day. She’s being treated for facial burns, but thankfully, she’s nearly all healed.” Then, in a darker tone, she adds, “It’s depression she’s fighting now.” Fran nods, a knowing expression on his face. The doctor makes as though she’s going to head back in, but then she turns to Fran. “You haven’t had your vitals checked this evening, have you? How about we do it now before I clock out?” Fran looks to me, and I nod enthusiastically. A few moments later, Fran and Dr. Cha disappear into the building, and as if on cue, wet drops begin to splatter on my head and shoulders. It’s the rain Bonwhe and I drew together yesterday. Whirrrr— I look up at the sound and see that the automatic awning is sliding out, activated by the precipitation. By the time it extends over the whole of the deck, the erratic tapping of the raindrops has turned into a steady pitter-patter. “Rain was in the forecast,” I chirp for the cameras. Then, stretching my arms over my head, I sneak a concerned look at the depressed burn patient—also for the cameras—before heading to the blind spot on the opposite end of the deck, as if in deference to the patient’s need for privacy and quiet. By the rules of architectural symmetry, the other end of the deck is also half obscured by a protruding column. The blind spot is tiny, and anyone bigger than us would have a hard time disappearing behind it. Sucking in my stomach, I wedge myself into the narrow space behind the column and begin edging sideways, my hair standing on end at the thought of the rain stopping, and the awning retracting to expose me to the cameras above in my crab walk. When I emerge from the other end, Haeri greets me from her wheelchair, her eyes soft and smiling above the blue surgical mask. Met with those eyes again, all I want to do is pour my heart out, tell her how happy I am to find out that her suicide was just a nasty lie—the worst story anyone could ever come up with. But all I’m able to manage is a stupid grimace before she lifts a hand and pulls the mask down to her chin, showing me her flawless face. Is it makeup? There’s no trace of the burn I saw on the Polaroid. Slowly, she pushes herself out of the wheelchair and stands before me. We stare at each other, transfixed. Is this what it feels like to have an out-of-body experience? A raindrop splashes on my nose, waking me from my trance. “Haeri—” I begin, but she puts a finger to her lips and I’m reminded that we’re in a blind spot, not a deaf spot. If we can’t talk, though, what are we to do? It’s then that Haeri lunges for me and seizes my arm. Then a sharp sting in my neck flashes me back to the flu shot Director Cha gave me. The next thing I know, Haeri is taking a small step back, her eyes hard and mouth clamped tight, a strange-looking syringe clutched in her pale, trembling hand. I find myself slumping limply into her, my eyes falling shut. I feel as heavy as a lead brick sinking to the bottom of the sea.<br>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br>
“Don’t worry,” she assures me. “Dr. Cha is with us. I’m calling from her office right now.” Dr. Cha. Did she supply her sister with the vaccines and frostbite cream, too? Even more confused, I push back: “Why would she help us instead of her sister?” In a stark voice, Haeri replies, “Someone has to stop the director. People can’t even grasp what she has done.” I think of Bonwhe, and how much he hates her. Before I can stop myself, I’m blurting out, “I know another person who might help—” But Haeri cuts me off. “We don’t have much time. I have to be back in my room before the slate.” Okay. I’ll talk to her about Bonwhe when I see her later. “Meet you out on the deck,” she says. “Make sure Fran’s with you so Director Cha doesn’t get suspicious. Dr. Cha will take care of Fran after that.” I feel my heart drop, just thinking about the cameras capturing me and Haeri side by side. Director Cha would be furious. Does Haeri know what kind of danger this exposes us to? And what about my family?</p>
        <p>“We’ll get caught,” I insist, my voice a pathetic bleat in my ears. “We won’t,” Haeri counters calmly. “There’s a blind spot, the only one on the seventy-third floor. I’ll see you tonight.” I gaze numbly at my dark silhouette in the mirror as Haeri gives me a quick set of instructions about the blind spot, then breaks the connection. I hurry back to bed and close my eyes. A few seconds later, the slate goes off and everything resumes. I want to thank her. I want to tell her that I’m sorry, again and again. I want to summon the strength to admit that I’m no victim here, that I was all too happy to steal what’s hers. But the truth is, I can’t. I spend the day trying my best to pretend that everything is fine and go about Haeri’s life as though nothing has changed. When night falls, I return to the 73rd floor and greet Fran with a hug and hand him the kale juice I brought—a little surprise from his favorite juice bar and the perfect excuse to stop by. He takes a sip of the juice and smiles widely. His buoyant mood makes me feel extra guilty about dragging him into today’s mission as a prop, but there was no other option. After some time chatting, I suggest going outside to enjoy the night air, and he happily agrees. When we walk out onto the deck, the doctor is sitting on the bench, and Fran heads straight for her, singing out warmly, “Hello, Dr. Cha!” The doctor looks up and returns the greeting and Fran continues, “Isn’t that your patient over there?” He’s referring to Haeri, sitting in a wheelchair at the far end of the deck. She’s partially obscured by a protruding column, which I can only guess is on purpose for the cameras. “Yes,” Dr. Cha replies with a sigh. “She needs to stay inside during the day. She’s being treated for facial burns, but thankfully, she’s nearly all healed.” Then, in a darker tone, she adds, “It’s depression she’s fighting now.” Fran nods, a knowing expression on his face. The doctor makes as though she’s going to head back in, but then she turns to Fran. “You haven’t had your vitals checked this evening, have you? How about we do it now before I clock out?” Fran looks to me, and I nod enthusiastically. A few moments later, Fran and Dr. Cha disappear into the building, and as if on cue, wet drops begin to splatter on my head and shoulders. It’s the rain Bonwhe and I drew together yesterday. Whirrrr— I look up at the sound and see that the automatic awning is sliding out, activated by the precipitation. By the time it extends over the whole of the deck, the erratic tapping of the raindrops has turned into a steady pitter-patter. “Rain was in the forecast,” I chirp for the cameras. Then, stretching my arms over my head, I sneak a concerned look at the depressed burn patient—also for the cameras—before heading to the blind spot on the opposite end of the deck, as if in deference to the patient’s need for privacy and quiet. By the rules of architectural symmetry, the other end of the deck is also half obscured by a protruding column. The blind spot is tiny, and anyone bigger than us would have a hard time disappearing behind it. Sucking in my stomach, I wedge myself into the narrow space behind the column and begin edging sideways, my hair standing on end at the thought of the rain stopping, and the awning retracting to expose me to the cameras above in my crab walk. When I emerge from the other end, Haeri greets me from her wheelchair, her eyes soft and smiling above the blue surgical mask. Met with those eyes again, all I want to do is pour my heart out, tell her how happy I am to find out that her suicide was just a nasty lie—the worst story anyone could ever come up with. But all I’m able to manage is a stupid grimace before she lifts a hand and pulls the mask down to her chin, showing me her flawless face. Is it makeup? There’s no trace of the burn I saw on the Polaroid. Slowly, she pushes herself out of the wheelchair and stands before me. We stare at each other, transfixed. Is this what it feels like to have an out-of-body experience? A raindrop splashes on my nose, waking me from my trance. “Haeri—” I begin, but she puts a finger to her lips and I’m reminded that we’re in a blind spot, not a deaf spot. If we can’t talk, though, what are we to do? It’s then that Haeri lunges for me and seizes my arm. Then a sharp sting in my neck flashes me back to the flu shot Director Cha gave me. The next thing I know, Haeri is taking a small step back, her eyes hard and mouth clamped tight, a strange-looking syringe clutched in her pale, trembling hand. I find myself slumping limply into her, my eyes falling shut. I feel as heavy as a lead brick sinking to the bottom of the sea.<br>

“Don’t worry,” she assures me. “Dr. Cha is with us. I’m calling from her office right now.” Dr. Cha. Did she supply her sister with the vaccines and frostbite cream, too? Even more confused, I push back: “Why would she help us instead of her sister?” In a stark voice, Haeri replies, “Someone has to stop the director. People can’t even grasp what she has done.” I think of Bonwhe, and how much he hates her. Before I can stop myself, I’m blurting out, “I know another person who might help—” But Haeri cuts me off. “We don’t have much time. I have to be back in my room before the slate.” Okay. I’ll talk to her about Bonwhe when I see her later. “Meet you out on the deck,” she says. “Make sure Fran’s with you so Director Cha doesn’t get suspicious. Dr. Cha will take care of Fran after that.” I feel my heart drop, just thinking about the cameras capturing me and Haeri side by side. Director Cha would be furious. Does Haeri know what kind of danger this exposes us to? And what about my family?</p>
        <p>“We’ll get caught,” I insist, my voice a pathetic bleat in my ears. “We won’t,” Haeri counters calmly. “There’s a blind spot, the only one on the seventy-third floor. I’ll see you tonight.” I gaze numbly at my dark silhouette in the mirror as Haeri gives me a quick set of instructions about the blind spot, then breaks the connection. I hurry back to bed and close my eyes. A few seconds later, the slate goes off and everything resumes. I want to thank her. I want to tell her that I’m sorry, again and again. I want to summon the strength to admit that I’m no victim here, that I was all too happy to steal what’s hers. But the truth is, I can’t. I spend the day trying my best to pretend that everything is fine and go about Haeri’s life as though nothing has changed. When night falls, I return to the 73rd floor and greet Fran with a hug and hand him the kale juice I brought—a little surprise from his favorite juice bar and the perfect excuse to stop by. He takes a sip of the juice and smiles widely. His buoyant mood makes me feel extra guilty about dragging him into today’s mission as a prop, but there was no other option. After some time chatting, I suggest going outside to enjoy the night air, and he happily agrees. When we walk out onto the deck, the doctor is sitting on the bench, and Fran heads straight for her, singing out warmly, “Hello, Dr. Cha!” The doctor looks up and returns the greeting and Fran continues, “Isn’t that your patient over there?” He’s referring to Haeri, sitting in a wheelchair at the far end of the deck. She’s partially obscured by a protruding column, which I can only guess is on purpose for the cameras. “Yes,” Dr. Cha replies with a sigh. “She needs to stay inside during the day. She’s being treated for facial burns, but thankfully, she’s nearly all healed.” Then, in a darker tone, she adds, “It’s depression she’s fighting now.” Fran nods, a knowing expression on his face. The doctor makes as though she’s going to head back in, but then she turns to Fran. “You haven’t had your vitals checked this evening, have you? How about we do it now before I clock out?” Fran looks to me, and I nod enthusiastically. A few moments later, Fran and Dr. Cha disappear into the building, and as if on cue, wet drops begin to splatter on my head and shoulders. It’s the rain Bonwhe and I drew together yesterday. Whirrrr— I look up at the sound and see that the automatic awning is sliding out, activated by the precipitation. By the time it extends over the whole of the deck, the erratic tapping of the raindrops has turned into a steady pitter-patter. “Rain was in the forecast,” I chirp for the cameras. Then, stretching my arms over my head, I sneak a concerned look at the depressed burn patient—also for the cameras—before heading to the blind spot on the opposite end of the deck, as if in deference to the patient’s need for privacy and quiet. By the rules of architectural symmetry, the other end of the deck is also half obscured by a protruding column. The blind spot is tiny, and anyone bigger than us would have a hard time disappearing behind it. Sucking in my stomach, I wedge myself into the narrow space behind the column and begin edging sideways, my hair standing on end at the thought of the rain stopping, and the awning retracting to expose me to the cameras above in my crab walk. When I emerge from the other end, Haeri greets me from her wheelchair, her eyes soft and smiling above the blue surgical mask. Met with those eyes again, all I want to do is pour my heart out, tell her how happy I am to find out that her suicide was just a nasty lie—the worst story anyone could ever come up with. But all I’m able to manage is a stupid grimace before she lifts a hand and pulls the mask down to her chin, showing me her flawless face. Is it makeup? There’s no trace of the burn I saw on the Polaroid. Slowly, she pushes herself out of the wheelchair and stands before me. We stare at each other, transfixed. Is this what it feels like to have an out-of-body experience? A raindrop splashes on my nose, waking me from my trance. “Haeri—” I begin, but she puts a finger to her lips and I’m reminded that we’re in a blind spot, not a deaf spot. If we can’t talk, though, what are we to do? It’s then that Haeri lunges for me and seizes my arm. Then a sharp sting in my neck flashes me back to the flu shot Director Cha gave me. The next thing I know, Haeri is taking a small step back, her eyes hard and mouth clamped tight, a strange-looking syringe clutched in her pale, trembling hand. I find myself slumping limply into her, my eyes falling shut. I feel as heavy as a lead brick sinking to the bottom of the sea.<br>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br>
Safe and gradually defrosting inside the train, I lean back in my seat. We boarded only minutes before the doors slid closed, and the engineer seems to appear immediately, making his rounds. “What’s the purpose of your visit?” he says, and through the mirrored lens of my oversized goggles, I see Hyang plaster on a fake smile. “We’re scientists measuring geothermal energy,” she says. He seems happy with her answer, and after a few more perfunctory questions, the engineer takes his leave. Hyang pulls off her fox-skin hat and coat, giddy with the warmth of the passenger car. I take the moment to remove my layers, too, then realize that the black suits and ties we put on when we left her house make us look more like private security guards than climate scientists. When I express this concern to Hyang, she assures me that it’s more important for our clothes to say that we’re from Snowglobe than to say precisely what we do there. What feels like only minutes later, the engineer reappears, this time with hot tea on a tray. Hyang reaches for a cup, stretching her arm extra far so the diamond-studded wristwatch peeks out from under her suit cuff.</p>
        <p>Its extravagance screams Snowglobe and reminds me of when Cooper first showed up at the clinic looking for me. One glance at those buffed leather wingtips, and I knew he was from Snowglobe. Hyang sits up straighter in her seat and sticks her chest out proudly. She takes an elegant sip of her red tea, then explains to the engineer, “Recent studies have probed the possibility of geothermal energy outside Snowglobe. The Yibonn Corporation is full of pioneers; they took an interest in the studies and hired us to take samples along the rail routes.” The small-town engineer regards us with naked awe and admiration. “Wow,” he sighs. “You’re doing such meaningful work.” Still hiding behind my goggles, I snatch another look at his earnest smile. “Is there anything I can do to make you feel more at home?” he asks. His eyes are on my goggles; no doubt he’s wondering why I’m wearing them on the train. Once again, I let Hyang respond for me. “Oh, my research partner just had an eye procedure done. You know, to correct her vision?” Hyang tells him. “It makes her extremely photosensitive, so she has to wear the goggles over the next few days. For protection.” I nod in affirmation and press the teacup to my lips, the steam clearing the frozen crust of ice on the outside of my goggles. I can’t let him hear my voice. Not this engineer. This bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, overly earnest engineer of the Ja-line is none other than my own twin brother, Ongi. Apparently, his persistence at the plant paid off. But what about the kid’s faintheartedness and high need for socializing? “A vision-correcting procedure!” he cries in amazement. “Wow!” In fairness, he looks good—better than good, in fact, almost as if he were born for the role, and it makes me smile. Privately. A few quick raps sound against the metal body of the train then, and someone calls from outside, “We’re all set. You guys are good to go.” It’s the supervisor of the Ja-A-1 plant letting him know that they’re through unloading cargo. “Got it! Thanks!” Ongi calls. Then, turning back to us with that open smile, he wishes us a pleasant trip before crossing the narrow door into the engineer’s cab. The muffled sound of his voice communicating with traffic control flows out briefly. A few moments later, there’s a mighty hiss from the tracks, and with a jerk forward, the train is finally in motion. Hyang and I are the only passengers in the passenger car, and I finally breathe out as the train begins to accelerate. Though, like the cargo cars, the passenger car is windowless, I picture us cutting through the white plains that make up the outside world as I take in the space my twin brother now calls home. The passenger car might be that in name only, as it seems to function more or less as Ongi’s living quarters. Aside from the handful of passenger seats, there’s a wall-mounted table with two wall-mounted chairs, across from which are a wall-mounted cot and a camper-style bathroom.<br>

Safe and gradually defrosting inside the train, I lean back in my seat. We boarded only minutes before the doors slid closed, and the engineer seems to appear immediately, making his rounds. “What’s the purpose of your visit?” he says, and through the mirrored lens of my oversized goggles, I see Hyang plaster on a fake smile. “We’re scientists measuring geothermal energy,” she says. He seems happy with her answer, and after a few more perfunctory questions, the engineer takes his leave. Hyang pulls off her fox-skin hat and coat, giddy with the warmth of the passenger car. I take the moment to remove my layers, too, then realize that the black suits and ties we put on when we left her house make us look more like private security guards than climate scientists. When I express this concern to Hyang, she assures me that it’s more important for our clothes to say that we’re from Snowglobe than to say precisely what we do there. What feels like only minutes later, the engineer reappears, this time with hot tea on a tray. Hyang reaches for a cup, stretching her arm extra far so the diamond-studded wristwatch peeks out from under her suit cuff.</p>
        <p>Its extravagance screams Snowglobe and reminds me of when Cooper first showed up at the clinic looking for me. One glance at those buffed leather wingtips, and I knew he was from Snowglobe. Hyang sits up straighter in her seat and sticks her chest out proudly. She takes an elegant sip of her red tea, then explains to the engineer, “Recent studies have probed the possibility of geothermal energy outside Snowglobe. The Yibonn Corporation is full of pioneers; they took an interest in the studies and hired us to take samples along the rail routes.” The small-town engineer regards us with naked awe and admiration. “Wow,” he sighs. “You’re doing such meaningful work.” Still hiding behind my goggles, I snatch another look at his earnest smile. “Is there anything I can do to make you feel more at home?” he asks. His eyes are on my goggles; no doubt he’s wondering why I’m wearing them on the train. Once again, I let Hyang respond for me. “Oh, my research partner just had an eye procedure done. You know, to correct her vision?” Hyang tells him. “It makes her extremely photosensitive, so she has to wear the goggles over the next few days. For protection.” I nod in affirmation and press the teacup to my lips, the steam clearing the frozen crust of ice on the outside of my goggles. I can’t let him hear my voice. Not this engineer. This bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, overly earnest engineer of the Ja-line is none other than my own twin brother, Ongi. Apparently, his persistence at the plant paid off. But what about the kid’s faintheartedness and high need for socializing? “A vision-correcting procedure!” he cries in amazement. “Wow!” In fairness, he looks good—better than good, in fact, almost as if he were born for the role, and it makes me smile. Privately. A few quick raps sound against the metal body of the train then, and someone calls from outside, “We’re all set. You guys are good to go.” It’s the supervisor of the Ja-A-1 plant letting him know that they’re through unloading cargo. “Got it! Thanks!” Ongi calls. Then, turning back to us with that open smile, he wishes us a pleasant trip before crossing the narrow door into the engineer’s cab. The muffled sound of his voice communicating with traffic control flows out briefly. A few moments later, there’s a mighty hiss from the tracks, and with a jerk forward, the train is finally in motion. Hyang and I are the only passengers in the passenger car, and I finally breathe out as the train begins to accelerate. Though, like the cargo cars, the passenger car is windowless, I picture us cutting through the white plains that make up the outside world as I take in the space my twin brother now calls home. The passenger car might be that in name only, as it seems to function more or less as Ongi’s living quarters. Aside from the handful of passenger seats, there’s a wall-mounted table with two wall-mounted chairs, across from which are a wall-mounted cot and a camper-style bathroom.<br>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br>
Safe and gradually defrosting inside the train, I lean back in my seat. We boarded only minutes before the doors slid closed, and the engineer seems to appear immediately, making his rounds. “What’s the purpose of your visit?” he says, and through the mirrored lens of my oversized goggles, I see Hyang plaster on a fake smile. “We’re scientists measuring geothermal energy,” she says. He seems happy with her answer, and after a few more perfunctory questions, the engineer takes his leave. Hyang pulls off her fox-skin hat and coat, giddy with the warmth of the passenger car. I take the moment to remove my layers, too, then realize that the black suits and ties we put on when we left her house make us look more like private security guards than climate scientists. When I express this concern to Hyang, she assures me that it’s more important for our clothes to say that we’re from Snowglobe than to say precisely what we do there. What feels like only minutes later, the engineer reappears, this time with hot tea on a tray. Hyang reaches for a cup, stretching her arm extra far so the diamond-studded wristwatch peeks out from under her suit cuff.</p>
        <p>Its extravagance screams Snowglobe and reminds me of when Cooper first showed up at the clinic looking for me. One glance at those buffed leather wingtips, and I knew he was from Snowglobe. Hyang sits up straighter in her seat and sticks her chest out proudly. She takes an elegant sip of her red tea, then explains to the engineer, “Recent studies have probed the possibility of geothermal energy outside Snowglobe. The Yibonn Corporation is full of pioneers; they took an interest in the studies and hired us to take samples along the rail routes.” The small-town engineer regards us with naked awe and admiration. “Wow,” he sighs. “You’re doing such meaningful work.” Still hiding behind my goggles, I snatch another look at his earnest smile. “Is there anything I can do to make you feel more at home?” he asks. His eyes are on my goggles; no doubt he’s wondering why I’m wearing them on the train. Once again, I let Hyang respond for me. “Oh, my research partner just had an eye procedure done. You know, to correct her vision?” Hyang tells him. “It makes her extremely photosensitive, so she has to wear the goggles over the next few days. For protection.” I nod in affirmation and press the teacup to my lips, the steam clearing the frozen crust of ice on the outside of my goggles. I can’t let him hear my voice. Not this engineer. This bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, overly earnest engineer of the Ja-line is none other than my own twin brother, Ongi. Apparently, his persistence at the plant paid off. But what about the kid’s faintheartedness and high need for socializing? “A vision-correcting procedure!” he cries in amazement. “Wow!” In fairness, he looks good—better than good, in fact, almost as if he were born for the role, and it makes me smile. Privately. A few quick raps sound against the metal body of the train then, and someone calls from outside, “We’re all set. You guys are good to go.” It’s the supervisor of the Ja-A-1 plant letting him know that they’re through unloading cargo. “Got it! Thanks!” Ongi calls. Then, turning back to us with that open smile, he wishes us a pleasant trip before crossing the narrow door into the engineer’s cab. The muffled sound of his voice communicating with traffic control flows out briefly. A few moments later, there’s a mighty hiss from the tracks, and with a jerk forward, the train is finally in motion. Hyang and I are the only passengers in the passenger car, and I finally breathe out as the train begins to accelerate. Though, like the cargo cars, the passenger car is windowless, I picture us cutting through the white plains that make up the outside world as I take in the space my twin brother now calls home. The passenger car might be that in name only, as it seems to function more or less as Ongi’s living quarters. Aside from the handful of passenger seats, there’s a wall-mounted table with two wall-mounted chairs, across from which are a wall-mounted cot and a camper-style bathroom.<br>

Safe and gradually defrosting inside the train, I lean back in my seat. We boarded only minutes before the doors slid closed, and the engineer seems to appear immediately, making his rounds. “What’s the purpose of your visit?” he says, and through the mirrored lens of my oversized goggles, I see Hyang plaster on a fake smile. “We’re scientists measuring geothermal energy,” she says. He seems happy with her answer, and after a few more perfunctory questions, the engineer takes his leave. Hyang pulls off her fox-skin hat and coat, giddy with the warmth of the passenger car. I take the moment to remove my layers, too, then realize that the black suits and ties we put on when we left her house make us look more like private security guards than climate scientists. When I express this concern to Hyang, she assures me that it’s more important for our clothes to say that we’re from Snowglobe than to say precisely what we do there. What feels like only minutes later, the engineer reappears, this time with hot tea on a tray. Hyang reaches for a cup, stretching her arm extra far so the diamond-studded wristwatch peeks out from under her suit cuff.</p>
        <p>Its extravagance screams Snowglobe and reminds me of when Cooper first showed up at the clinic looking for me. One glance at those buffed leather wingtips, and I knew he was from Snowglobe. Hyang sits up straighter in her seat and sticks her chest out proudly.

His eyes are on my goggles; no doubt he’s wondering why I’m wearing them on the train. Once again, I let Hyang respond for me. “Oh, my research partner just had an eye procedure done. You know, to correct her vision?” Hyang tells him. “It makes her extremely photosensitive, so she has to wear the goggles over the next few days. For protection.” I nod in affirmation and press the teacup to my lips, the steam clearing the frozen crust of ice on the outside of my goggles. I can’t let him hear my voice. Not this engineer. This bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, overly earnest engineer of the Ja-line is none other than my own twin brother, Ongi. Apparently, his persistence at the plant paid off.

Privately. A few quick raps sound against the metal body of the train then, and someone calls from outside, “We’re all set. You guys are good to go.” It’s the supervisor of the Ja-A-1 plant letting him know that they’re through unloading cargo. “Got it! Thanks!” Ongi calls. Then, turning back to us with that open smile, he wishes us a pleasant trip before crossing the narrow door into the engineer’s cab. The muffled sound of his voice communicating with traffic control flows out briefly. A few moments later, there’s a mighty hiss from the tracks, and with a jerk forward, the train is finally in motion. Hyang and I are the only passengers in the passenger car, and I finally breathe out as the train begins to accelerate. Though, like the cargo cars, the passenger car is windowless, I picture us cutting through the white plains that make up the outside world as I take in the space my twin brother now calls home. The passenger car might be that in name only, as it seems to function more or less as Ongi’s living quarters. Aside from the handful of passenger seats, there’s a wall-mounted table with two wall-mounted chairs, across from which are a wall-mounted cot and a camper-style bathroom.<br>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br>
“What the hell,” I hear myself say, and the next thing I know, I’ve snatched Somyung’s pistol from the table and I’m leveling it at Hyang with a quaking hand. My vision closes in. I feel my pulse jumping in my right index finger. “What?” I say, my voice shot through with rage. “Genetically engineered clones? Cha Seol picks the winner?” I’m screaming now. “What is wrong with you people?” The tip of Somyung’s pistol dances wildly before Hyang’s face, but she isn’t fazed. “I have no answer for you,” she says miserably. “I only wish I didn’t know what depraved stock I come from.” “What stock?” Somyung says now, looking from me to Hyang, her voice caught low in her throat. “Who the hell are you?” “I am Cha Seol’s sister. Cha Guibahng’s granddaughter,” Hyang says sadly. “I only learned what they’d done a few years ago. That’s when I decided to leave Snowglobe for good. My sister wouldn’t accept my decision, though. She insisted that she needed me as a directing partner and as a best friend. Then our grandfather had the stroke that’s kept him in the hospital to this day.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I found out all the details then,” Hyang explains, tears coming to her eyes again. She confesses to her complicity, and the fear that allowed her to distance herself from her family instead of doing something to help us.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“You make me sick,” Somyung spits. “My mom almost died giving birth to someone else’s child.</p>
        <p>“Hell,” Somyung breathes, pressing her palms against her inflamed eyes.</p>
        <p>“Some of us just have all the luck.”</p>
        <p>Then she turns to me and smirks. “And look at you with the pistol in your hand. Do you even know how to use it?” She laughs. “So what’s your story?”</p>
        <p>I say nothing, all the strength leaving me. I drop the hand holding the pistol, and Somyung moves in to gently pry it away as Hyang volunteers a brief summary of my backstory, pausing occasionally to compose herself.</p>
        <p>“You’re kidding,” Somyung mutters under her breath as she inspects the pistol. “She didn’t even undo the safety.”<br>
Then, turning to Hyang, who’s drying her eyes with the backs of her hands, she says, “Can I call you Ajumma, too?”</p>
        <p>Hyang nods.</p>
        <p>“Ajumma,” Somyung says, “you’ve done nothing with what you knew about the Goh Haeri project. I’m not here to condemn you for your pathetic weakness, though. Heck, I can almost appreciate how conflicted you must have felt about standing up to your sister and grandfather.” She pauses for a moment before she continues, “What I want to know is, why now? Why do you stir the pot now, going through all the hassle of tracking me down and disturbing the peace?”</p>
        <p>Her eyes red and puffy, Hyang wets her parched lips. “This is embarrassing,” she says, “but I’ll tell you why.<br>
“My friend Miryu loathed her role as a serial killer. It was something she was conned into long before she was thrown out of Snowglobe when the show ran out of fresh murder ideas.</p>
        <p>“The assassination of my friend’s soul. That was the first murder I ever witnessed,” Hyang says, her voice faltering again.</p>
        <p>“Growing up in a family of directors, I’d been blind to the wrongs that were being committed in the name of ratings. I truly believed that editorial or directorial decisions, however incomprehensible, were consented to by the actors whose sole priority was to remain in Snowglobe. It was only after I saw what happened to Miryu that I understood what was really going on.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Alas. Never having stood up for anyone or anything my whole life, the only thing I knew how to do was run away.</p>
        <p>“Then Seol ratcheted up her effort to draw me back into the project. She did everything she could to trigger a sense of sibling loyalty. Each passing day was hell. I never said yes, but I also couldn’t say no. She was my big sister-she’d always been my hero.”</p>
        <p>Hyang sucks in a deep breath. “So I turned to alcohol,” she continues. “It was the only thing that could dull the edge of my agony. The moment I could feel my senses sharpening, I’d dull them again with more alcohol.</p>
        <p>“Eventually, I managed to flee to the retirees’ village, and I realized that I couldn’t stand the residents—they are all former directors. That’s when hopelessness took over completely and I closed myself off from the world. Time passed, and eventually Seol sent a letter informing me of Haeri’s suicide. “I was devastated and furious, so I began going through the documents I’d smuggled out of Snowglobe when I left. I was finally ready to use the evidence I had to bury my family for what they’d done, but I had no idea where to start.” Hyang pauses for a moment and looks at me. “That’s when Jeon Chobahm was shipped to me in an oversized package of apples. Chobahm told me about Miryu’s cursed existence back home, and of the girl who would rather fight to the death than surrender to injustice. This girl, who had come from nothing, had more attitude than she had any right to, and it gave me pause—made me reflect on my own attitude. I knew I couldn’t change the fact that I’d been a coward, but I hated the thought of continuing to live my life in shame.” The room falls into silence. Through my tears, I’m finally beginning to see this woman for what she is, another casualty with all the tragic scars her heart bears. Somyung gives a somber nod. “So what’s our plan?” she says.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br>
“What the hell,” I hear myself say, and the next thing I know, I’ve snatched Somyung’s pistol from the table and I’m leveling it at Hyang with a quaking hand. My vision closes in. I feel my pulse jumping in my right index finger. “What?” I say, my voice shot through with rage. “Genetically engineered clones? Cha Seol picks the winner?” I’m screaming now. “What is wrong with you people?” The tip of Somyung’s pistol dances wildly before Hyang’s face, but she isn’t fazed. “I have no answer for you,” she says miserably. “I only wish I didn’t know what depraved stock I come from.” “What stock?” Somyung says now, looking from me to Hyang, her voice caught low in her throat. “Who the hell are you?” “I am Cha Seol’s sister. Cha Guibahng’s granddaughter,” Hyang says sadly. “I only learned what they’d done a few years ago. That’s when I decided to leave Snowglobe for good. My sister wouldn’t accept my decision, though. She insisted that she needed me as a directing partner and as a best friend. Then our grandfather had the stroke that’s kept him in the hospital to this day.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I found out all the details then,” Hyang explains, tears coming to her eyes again. She confesses to her complicity, and the fear that allowed her to distance herself from her family instead of doing something to help us.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“You make me sick,” Somyung spits. “My mom almost died giving birth to someone else’s child.</p>
        <p>“Hell,” Somyung breathes, pressing her palms against her inflamed eyes.</p>
        <p>“Some of us just have all the luck.”</p>
        <p>Then she turns to me and smirks. “And look at you with the pistol in your hand. Do you even know how to use it?” She laughs. “So what’s your story?”</p>
        <p>I say nothing, all the strength leaving me. I drop the hand holding the pistol, and Somyung moves in to gently pry it away as Hyang volunteers a brief summary of my backstory, pausing occasionally to compose herself.</p>
        <p>“You’re kidding,” Somyung mutters under her breath as she inspects the pistol. “She didn’t even undo the safety.”<br>
Then, turning to Hyang, who’s drying her eyes with the backs of her hands, she says, “Can I call you Ajumma, too?”</p>
        <p>Hyang nods.</p>
        <p>“Ajumma,” Somyung says, “you’ve done nothing with what you knew about the Goh Haeri project. I’m not here to condemn you for your pathetic weakness, though. Heck, I can almost appreciate how conflicted you must have felt about standing up to your sister and grandfather.” She pauses for a moment before she continues, “What I want to know is, why now? Why do you stir the pot now, going through all the hassle of tracking me down and disturbing the peace?”</p>
        <p>Her eyes red and puffy, Hyang wets her parched lips. “This is embarrassing,” she says, “but I’ll tell you why.<br>
“My friend Miryu loathed her role as a serial killer. It was something she was conned into long before she was thrown out of Snowglobe when the show ran out of fresh murder ideas.</p>
        <p>“The assassination of my friend’s soul. That was the first murder I ever witnessed,” Hyang says, her voice faltering again.</p>
        <p>“Growing up in a family of directors, I’d been blind to the wrongs that were being committed in the name of ratings. I truly believed that editorial or directorial decisions, however incomprehensible, were consented to by the actors whose sole priority was to remain in Snowglobe. It was only after I saw what happened to Miryu that I understood what was really going on.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Alas. Never having stood up for anyone or anything my whole life, the only thing I knew how to do was run away.</p>
        <p>“Then Seol ratcheted up her effort to draw me back into the project. She did everything she could to trigger a sense of sibling loyalty. Each passing day was hell. I never said yes, but I also couldn’t say no. She was my big sister-she’d always been my hero.”</p>
        <p>Hyang sucks in a deep breath. “So I turned to alcohol,” she continues. “It was the only thing that could dull the edge of my agony. The moment I could feel my senses sharpening, I’d dull them again with more alcohol.</p>
        <p>“Eventually, I managed to flee to the retirees’ village, and I realized that I couldn’t stand the residents—they are all former directors. That’s when hopelessness took over completely and I closed myself off from the world. Time passed, and eventually Seol sent a letter informing me of Haeri’s suicide. “I was devastated and furious, so I began going through the documents I’d smuggled out of Snowglobe when I left. I was finally ready to use the evidence I had to bury my family for what they’d done, but I had no idea where to start.” Hyang pauses for a moment and looks at me. “That’s when Jeon Chobahm was shipped to me in an oversized package of apples. Chobahm told me about Miryu’s cursed existence back home, and of the girl who would rather fight to the death than surrender to injustice. This girl, who had come from nothing, had more attitude than she had any right to, and it gave me pause—made me reflect on my own attitude. I knew I couldn’t change the fact that I’d been a coward, but I hated the thought of continuing to live my life in shame.” The room falls into silence. Through my tears, I’m finally beginning to see this woman for what she is, another casualty with all the tragic scars her heart bears. Somyung gives a somber nod. “So what’s our plan?” she says.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br>
“What the hell,” I hear myself say, and the next thing I know, I’ve snatched Somyung’s pistol from the table and I’m leveling it at Hyang with a quaking hand. My vision closes in. I feel my pulse jumping in my right index finger. “What?” I say, my voice shot through with rage. “Genetically engineered clones? Cha Seol picks the winner?” I’m screaming now. “What is wrong with you people?” The tip of Somyung’s pistol dances wildly before Hyang’s face, but she isn’t fazed. “I have no answer for you,” she says miserably. “I only wish I didn’t know what depraved stock I come from.” “What stock?” Somyung says now, looking from me to Hyang, her voice caught low in her throat. “Who the hell are you?” “I am Cha Seol’s sister. Cha Guibahng’s granddaughter,” Hyang says sadly. “I only learned what they’d done a few years ago. That’s when I decided to leave Snowglobe for good. My sister wouldn’t accept my decision, though. She insisted that she needed me as a directing partner and as a best friend. Then our grandfather had the stroke that’s kept him in the hospital to this day.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I found out all the details then,” Hyang explains, tears coming to her eyes again. She confesses to her complicity, and the fear that allowed her to distance herself from her family instead of doing something to help us.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“You make me sick,” Somyung spits. “My mom almost died giving birth to someone else’s child.</p>
        <p>“Hell,” Somyung breathes, pressing her palms against her inflamed eyes.</p>
        <p>“Some of us just have all the luck.”</p>
        <p>Then she turns to me and smirks. “And look at you with the pistol in your hand. Do you even know how to use it?” She laughs. “So what’s your story?”</p>
        <p>I say nothing, all the strength leaving me. I drop the hand holding the pistol, and Somyung moves in to gently pry it away as Hyang volunteers a brief summary of my backstory, pausing occasionally to compose herself.</p>
        <p>“You’re kidding,” Somyung mutters under her breath as she inspects the pistol. “She didn’t even undo the safety.”<br>
Then, turning to Hyang, who’s drying her eyes with the backs of her hands, she says, “Can I call you Ajumma, too?”</p>
        <p>Hyang nods.</p>
        <p>“Ajumma,” Somyung says, “you’ve done nothing with what you knew about the Goh Haeri project. I’m not here to condemn you for your pathetic weakness, though. Heck, I can almost appreciate how conflicted you must have felt about standing up to your sister and grandfather.” She pauses for a moment before she continues, “What I want to know is, why now? Why do you stir the pot now, going through all the hassle of tracking me down and disturbing the peace?”</p>
        <p>Her eyes red and puffy, Hyang wets her parched lips. “This is embarrassing,” she says, “but I’ll tell you why.<br>
“My friend Miryu loathed her role as a serial killer. It was something she was conned into long before she was thrown out of Snowglobe when the show ran out of fresh murder ideas.</p>
        <p>“The assassination of my friend’s soul. That was the first murder I ever witnessed,” Hyang says, her voice faltering again.</p>
        <p>“Growing up in a family of directors, I’d been blind to the wrongs that were being committed in the name of ratings. I truly believed that editorial or directorial decisions, however incomprehensible, were consented to by the actors whose sole priority was to remain in Snowglobe. It was only after I saw what happened to Miryu that I understood what was really going on.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Alas. Never having stood up for anyone or anything my whole life, the only thing I knew how to do was run away.</p>
        <p>“Then Seol ratcheted up her effort to draw me back into the project. She did everything she could to trigger a sense of sibling loyalty. Each passing day was hell. I never said yes, but I also couldn’t say no. She was my big sister-she’d always been my hero.”</p>
        <p>Hyang sucks in a deep breath. “So I turned to alcohol,” she continues. “It was the only thing that could dull the edge of my agony. The moment I could feel my senses sharpening, I’d dull them again with more alcohol.</p>
        <p>“Eventually, I managed to flee to the retirees’ village, and I realized that I couldn’t stand the residents—they are all former directors. That’s when hopelessness took over completely and I closed myself off from the world. Time passed, and eventually Seol sent a letter informing me of Haeri’s suicide. “I was devastated and furious, so I began going through the documents I’d smuggled out of Snowglobe when I left. I was finally ready to use the evidence I had to bury my family for what they’d done, but I had no idea where to start.” Hyang pauses for a moment and looks at me. “That’s when Jeon Chobahm was shipped to me in an oversized package of apples. Chobahm told me about Miryu’s cursed existence back home, and of the girl who would rather fight to the death than surrender to injustice. This girl, who had come from nothing, had more attitude than she had any right to, and it gave me pause—made me reflect on my own attitude. I knew I couldn’t change the fact that I’d been a coward, but I hated the thought of continuing to live my life in shame.” The room falls into silence. Through my tears, I’m finally beginning to see this woman for what she is, another casualty with all the tragic scars her heart bears. Somyung gives a somber nod. “So what’s our plan?” she says.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br>
“What the hell,” I hear myself say, and the next thing I know, I’ve snatched Somyung’s pistol from the table and I’m leveling it at Hyang with a quaking hand. My vision closes in. I feel my pulse jumping in my right index finger. “What?” I say, my voice shot through with rage. “Genetically engineered clones? Cha Seol picks the winner?” I’m screaming now. “What is wrong with you people?” The tip of Somyung’s pistol dances wildly before Hyang’s face, but she isn’t fazed. “I have no answer for you,” she says miserably. “I only wish I didn’t know what depraved stock I come from.” “What stock?” Somyung says now, looking from me to Hyang, her voice caught low in her throat. “Who the hell are you?” “I am Cha Seol’s sister. Cha Guibahng’s granddaughter,” Hyang says sadly. “I only learned what they’d done a few years ago. That’s when I decided to leave Snowglobe for good. My sister wouldn’t accept my decision, though. She insisted that she needed me as a directing partner and as a best friend. Then our grandfather had the stroke that’s kept him in the hospital to this day.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I found out all the details then,” Hyang explains, tears coming to her eyes again. She confesses to her complicity, and the fear that allowed her to distance herself from her family instead of doing something to help us.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“You make me sick,” Somyung spits. “My mom almost died giving birth to someone else’s child.</p>
        <p>“Hell,” Somyung breathes, pressing her palms against her inflamed eyes.</p>
        <p>“Some of us just have all the luck.”</p>
        <p>Then she turns to me and smirks. “And look at you with the pistol in your hand. Do you even know how to use it?” She laughs. “So what’s your story?”</p>
        <p>I say nothing, all the strength leaving me. I drop the hand holding the pistol, and Somyung moves in to gently pry it away as Hyang volunteers a brief summary of my backstory, pausing occasionally to compose herself.</p>
        <p>“You’re kidding,” Somyung mutters under her breath as she inspects the pistol. “She didn’t even undo the safety.”<br>
Then, turning to Hyang, who’s drying her eyes with the backs of her hands, she says, “Can I call you Ajumma, too?”</p>
        <p>Hyang nods.</p>
        <p>“Ajumma,” Somyung says, “you’ve done nothing with what you knew about the Goh Haeri project. I’m not here to condemn you for your pathetic weakness, though. Heck, I can almost appreciate how conflicted you must have felt about standing up to your sister and grandfather.” She pauses for a moment before she continues, “What I want to know is, why now? Why do you stir the pot now, going through all the hassle of tracking me down and disturbing the peace?”</p>
        <p>Her eyes red and puffy, Hyang wets her parched lips. “This is embarrassing,” she says, “but I’ll tell you why.<br>
“My friend Miryu loathed her role as a serial killer. It was something she was conned into long before she was thrown out of Snowglobe when the show ran out of fresh murder ideas.</p>
        <p>“The assassination of my friend’s soul. That was the first murder I ever witnessed,” Hyang says, her voice faltering again.</p>
        <p>“Growing up in a family of directors, I’d been blind to the wrongs that were being committed in the name of ratings. I truly believed that editorial or directorial decisions, however incomprehensible, were consented to by the actors whose sole priority was to remain in Snowglobe. It was only after I saw what happened to Miryu that I understood what was really going on.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Alas. Never having stood up for anyone or anything my whole life, the only thing I knew how to do was run away.</p>
        <p>“Then Seol ratcheted up her effort to draw me back into the project. She did everything she could to trigger a sense of sibling loyalty. Each passing day was hell. I never said yes, but I also couldn’t say no. She was my big sister-she’d always been my hero.”</p>
        <p>Hyang sucks in a deep breath. “So I turned to alcohol,” she continues. “It was the only thing that could dull the edge of my agony. The moment I could feel my senses sharpening, I’d dull them again with more alcohol.</p>
        <p>“Eventually, I managed to flee to the retirees’ village, and I realized that I couldn’t stand the residents—they are all former directors. That’s when hopelessness took over completely and I closed myself off from the world. Time passed, and eventually Seol sent a letter informing me of Haeri’s suicide. “I was devastated and furious, so I began going through the documents I’d smuggled out of Snowglobe when I left. I was finally ready to use the evidence I had to bury my family for what they’d done, but I had no idea where to start.” Hyang pauses for a moment and looks at me. “That’s when Jeon Chobahm was shipped to me in an oversized package of apples. Chobahm told me about Miryu’s cursed existence back home, and of the girl who would rather fight to the death than surrender to injustice. This girl, who had come from nothing, had more attitude than she had any right to, and it gave me pause—made me reflect on my own attitude. I knew I couldn’t change the fact that I’d been a coward, but I hated the thought of continuing to live my life in shame.” The room falls into silence. Through my tears, I’m finally beginning to see this woman for what she is, another casualty with all the tragic scars her heart bears. Somyung gives a somber nod. “So what’s our plan?” she says.</p>
