        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This object (shown in the sketch below) was found in 1898 in a tomb at Saqquara, Egypt and was later dated as having been created near 200 B.C. As airplanes were unknown in the days when it was found, it was thrown into a box marked "wooden bird model" and then stored in the basement of the Cairo museum.</p>

        <p>As a result of their findings, a special exhibit was set up in the centre hall of the Cairo museum, with the little model as its centrepiece. It was even labelled as a model airplane.</p>
        <p>To elucidate the reasons for the decision of the committee, almost unprecedented in the field of archaeology, let's consider some aspects of the model. The model has the exact proportions of a very advanced form of "pusher-glider" that is still having "some bugs ironed out".</p>
        <p>This type of glider will stay in the air almost by itself — even a very small engine will keep it going at low speeds, as low as 45 to 65 mph, while it can carry an enormous payload. This ability is dependent on the curious shape of the wings and their proportions.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The tipping of wings downward, a reversedihedral wing as it is called, is the feature behind this capability. A similar type of curving wings is implemented on the Concorde airplane, giving the plane a maximum lift without detracting from its speed.</p>
        <p>In that context, it seems rather incredible that someone, more than 2,000 years ago, for any reason, devised a model of a flying device with such advanced features, requiring quite extensive knowledge of aerodynamics. We are told by archaeologists and historians that there were no such things as airplanes in these times. But this case seems to be an exception, living in the midst of the rather unimaginative and rigid paradigm of contemporary science. It is also necessary to point out that Egyptians are known to have nearly always made scale-models of projects and objects which they planned to create or build.</p>

          <strong>Airplane Models</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This object (shown in the sketch below) was found in 1898 in a tomb at Saqquara, Egypt and was later dated as having been created near 200 B.C. As airplanes were unknown in the days when it was found, it was thrown into a box marked "wooden bird model" and then stored in the basement of the Cairo museum.</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="21%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766029583/hmowc9dp9vex3zrk05gj.png" alt="NAP_Y5_D2_RC_Q24">


        </p>
        <p>It was rediscovered by Dr. Khalil Messiha, who studied models made by ancients. The "discovery" was considered so important by the Egyptian government that a special committee of leading scientists was established to study the object.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="30%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766029584/vm7ij0licshjy6vujwjk.png" alt="NAP_Y5_D2_RC_Q24_2">


        </p>
        <p>As a result of their findings, a special exhibit was set up in the centre hall of the Cairo museum, with the little model as its centrepiece. It was even labelled as a model airplane.</p>
        <p>To elucidate the reasons for the decision of the committee, almost unprecedented in the field of archaeology, let's consider some aspects of the model. The model has the exact proportions of a very advanced form of "pusher-glider" that is still having "some bugs ironed out".</p>
        <p>This type of glider will stay in the air almost by itself — even a very small engine will keep it going at low speeds, as low as 45 to 65 mph, while it can carry an enormous payload. This ability is dependent on the curious shape of the wings and their proportions.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The tipping of wings downward, a reversedihedral wing as it is called, is the feature behind this capability. A similar type of curving wings is implemented on the Concorde airplane, giving the plane a maximum lift without detracting from its speed.</p>
        <p>In that context, it seems rather incredible that someone, more than 2,000 years ago, for any reason, devised a model of a flying device with such advanced features, requiring quite extensive knowledge of aerodynamics. We are told by archaeologists and historians that there were no such things as airplanes in these times. But this case seems to be an exception, living in the midst of the rather unimaginative and rigid paradigm of contemporary science. It is also necessary to point out that Egyptians are known to have nearly always made scale-models of projects and objects which they planned to create or build.</p>

        <p>As a result of their findings, a special exhibit was set up in the centre hall of the Cairo museum, with the little model as its centrepiece. It was even labelled as a model airplane.</p>
        <p>To elucidate the reasons for the decision of the committee, almost unprecedented in the field of archaeology, let's consider some aspects of the model. The model has the exact proportions of a very advanced form of "pusher-glider" that is still having "some bugs ironed out".</p>
        <p>This type of glider will stay in the air almost by itself — even a very small engine will keep it going at low speeds, as low as 45 to 65 mph, while it can carry an enormous payload. This ability is dependent on the curious shape of the wings and their proportions.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The tipping of wings downward, a reversedihedral wing as it is called, is the feature behind this capability. A similar type of curving wings is implemented on the Concorde airplane, giving the plane a maximum lift without detracting from its speed.</p>
        <p>In that context, it seems rather incredible that someone, more than 2,000 years ago, for any reason, devised a model of a flying device with such advanced features, requiring quite extensive knowledge of aerodynamics. We are told by archaeologists and historians that there were no such things as airplanes in these times. But this case seems to be an exception, living in the midst of the rather unimaginative and rigid paradigm of contemporary science. It is also necessary to point out that Egyptians are known to have nearly always made scale-models of projects and objects which they planned to create or build.</p>

          <strong>Miss Potter</strong>

        <p>It is a Wonder, really – one of the great Wonders, as William Heelis used to say – how the course of a person's life can be altered, utterly and completely, by a moment so innocent one may not even notice that it has happened.</p>
        <p>For Miss Potter, the moment came with a remark of such casualness that it seemed at the time nothing more than a passing politeness. Over the years, Miss Potter had taken to sending the children of some of her family's friends and relatives, or the children of a former governess, a story she had made up, about an animal or some such, which she illustrated in a letter with a few drawings or watercolours. They were 'little' stories, and they usually didn't have any particular point, no moral or anything dull like that. They were intended to make children smile. If the children were sick, the story might make them feel better. If it were their birthday, the story was a special present that would help to make them remember that they had a maiden aunt Beatrix, and that she was fond of them.</p>
        <p>On this particular day, Miss Potter showed one of her stories to an old family friend, Canon Rawnsley, vicar in the Lake District village where the Potter family often spent their summers. It was the 'Tale' of a naughty rabbit who trespassed into a garden he was forbidden to visit. Beatrix had had the story printed, privately, as a gift for friends. Canon Rawnsley was quite taken by it. In fact (since nothing Canon Rawnsley ever did was subtle), his laughter boomed through the house. He asked if Beatrix had written any more. As it happened, Beatrix had sketches of several of her 'letter' stories. 'These are delightful,' Canon Rawnsley announced to the entire universe when he had finished them. Then came the sentence that was to change Miss Potter's life. 'You should publish them,' he said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;Miss Potter brushed aside the compliment. The stories had no ‘importance'. They were gifts for friends – for children at that. They hadn't been worked over or edited – although of course, Canon Rawnsley was very kind to have said he enjoyed them.</p>
        <p>Canon Rawnsley stopped and had, for him, a very uncharacteristic moment of silence. 'It happens that I know a book publisher. Why don't I make an inquiry?' And there it was. The moment had come, and passed, and no one in the room had noticed.</p>

          <strong>Miss Potter</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Richard Maltby</em>
        </p>
        <p>It is a Wonder, really – one of the great Wonders, as William Heelis used to say – how the course of a person's life can be altered, utterly and completely, by a moment so innocent one may not even notice that it has happened.</p>
        <p>For Miss Potter, the moment came with a remark of such casualness that it seemed at the time nothing more than a passing politeness. Over the years, Miss Potter had taken to sending the children of some of her family's friends and relatives, or the children of a former governess, a story she had made up, about an animal or some such, which she illustrated in a letter with a few drawings or watercolours. They were 'little' stories, and they usually didn't have any particular point, no moral or anything dull like that. They were intended to make children smile. If the children were sick, the story might make them feel better. If it were their birthday, the story was a special present that would help to make them remember that they had a maiden aunt Beatrix, and that she was fond of them.</p>
        <p>On this particular day, Miss Potter showed one of her stories to an old family friend, Canon Rawnsley, vicar in the Lake District village where the Potter family often spent their summers. It was the 'Tale' of a naughty rabbit who trespassed into a garden he was forbidden to visit. Beatrix had had the story printed, privately, as a gift for friends. Canon Rawnsley was quite taken by it. In fact (since nothing Canon Rawnsley ever did was subtle), his laughter boomed through the house. He asked if Beatrix had written any more. As it happened, Beatrix had sketches of several of her 'letter' stories. 'These are delightful,' Canon Rawnsley announced to the entire universe when he had finished them. Then came the sentence that was to change Miss Potter's life. 'You should publish them,' he said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;Miss Potter brushed aside the compliment. The stories had no ‘importance'. They were gifts for friends – for children at that. They hadn't been worked over or edited – although of course, Canon Rawnsley was very kind to have said he enjoyed them.</p>
        <p>Canon Rawnsley stopped and had, for him, a very uncharacteristic moment of silence. 'It happens that I know a book publisher. Why don't I make an inquiry?' And there it was. The moment had come, and passed, and no one in the room had noticed.</p>

          <strong>Miss Potter</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Richard Maltby</em>
        </p>
        <p>It is a Wonder, really – one of the great Wonders, as William Heelis used to say – how the course of a person's life can be altered, utterly and completely, by a moment so innocent one may not even notice that it has happened.</p>
        <p>For Miss Potter, the moment came with a remark of such casualness that it seemed at the time nothing more than a passing politeness. Over the years, Miss Potter had taken to sending the children of some of her family's friends and relatives, or the children of a former governess, a story she had made up, about an animal or some such, which she illustrated in a letter with a few drawings or watercolours. They were 'little' stories, and they usually didn't have any particular point, no moral or anything dull like that. They were intended to make children smile. If the children were sick, the story might make them feel better. If it were their birthday, the story was a special present that would help to make them remember that they had a maiden aunt Beatrix, and that she was fond of them.</p>
        <p>On this particular day, Miss Potter showed one of her stories to an old family friend, Canon Rawnsley, vicar in the Lake District village where the Potter family often spent their summers. It was the 'Tale' of a naughty rabbit who trespassed into a garden he was forbidden to visit. Beatrix had had the story printed, privately, as a gift for friends. Canon Rawnsley was quite taken by it. In fact (since nothing Canon Rawnsley ever did was subtle), his laughter boomed through the house. He asked if Beatrix had written any more. As it happened, Beatrix had sketches of several of her 'letter' stories. 'These are delightful,' Canon Rawnsley announced to the entire universe when he had finished them. Then came the sentence that was to change Miss Potter's life. 'You should publish them,' he said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;Miss Potter brushed aside the compliment. The stories had no ‘importance'. They were gifts for friends – for children at that. They hadn't been worked over or edited – although of course, Canon Rawnsley was very kind to have said he enjoyed them.</p>
        <p>Canon Rawnsley stopped and had, for him, a very uncharacteristic moment of silence. 'It happens that I know a book publisher. Why don't I make an inquiry?' And there it was. The moment had come, and passed, and no one in the room had noticed.</p>

          <strong>Scarlett</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>By Cathy Cassidy&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Hello?' I say.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Scarlett! Where are you?'</p>
        <p>'Hi, Mum,' I reply. 'Nice to speak to you too.'</p>
        <p>'Scarlett, don't get clever with me,' she snaps. 'Your dad's just been on the phone. What d'you think you're playing at?'</p>
        <p>I sit down on a tree stump, cradling the phone. 'I'm not playing, Mum,' I tell her. 'I'm coming home.'</p>
        <p>'Scarlett, that just isn't on,' Mum says. 'We agreed this was the best solution, and you won't even give it a fair trial!'</p>
        <p>We agreed?&nbsp; 'I've sent you six text messages,' I tell her. 'And a picture, today. How come you only reply when Dad calls you?'</p>
        <p>‘I had an important presentation yesterday, and then dinner with the clients,' Mum says icily. 'I'd have called tonight, obviously.'</p>
        <p>'Well, thanks,' I quip. 'It's great you can fit me into your busy schedule.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I can hear Mum fizzing with anger. 'Actually, Scarlett, I was in the middle of a meeting when your dad called. I could do without having to deal with this kind of stunt on your very first full day in Ireland. You can't just walk out of school!'</p>
        <p>'I did,' I point out. 'It'll save them the trouble of expelling me.'</p>
        <p>'You're going back,' Mum says.</p>
        <p>'I'm coming home,' I reply. 'Please, Mum. I hate it here. Nobody wants me. It's a dump. Don't make me stay.'</p>
        <p>'Scarlett, don't be ridiculous. Where are you exactly?' Mum asks. 'Are you still in Kilimoor? Chris is out of his mind with worry. Promise me you'll stay put. Just stay still, wait for Chris. He'll sort things out.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Mum?' the word comes out kind of mangled. I close my eyes, press my fist against my mouth.</p>
        <p>'Scarlett?' she says shrilly. 'Are you still there? Listen to me. It's time you stopped acting like a kid with a tantrum and started to make the best of things. Just grow up and get on with it.'</p>
        <p>I snap the phone shut, run down to the water's edge and throw the mobile in one perfect, curving arc right out into the lough. It glints silver as it breaks the surface with a splash, then sinks without trace.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I turn away, furious, marching along the shore, but within minutes I trip, scrambling over a knot of gnarled tree roots, falling heavily. I've torn one of the ribbon ties on my sandal, and a hot, burning pain shoots through my left ankle. My eyes prickle with tears of anger, but I won't cry. I never cry - not since Dad left, anyhow. It'd be like letting him see how much he hurt me. Crying is for kids. I scream instead, a bloodcurdling yell that startles the birds and shakes the treetops before tailing off to a whimper.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I pull off my wedge heels and fling them away into the trees ahead of me, because they've ripped my feet to shreds and I don't care if I never see them again as long as I live. &nbsp;</p>

        <p>
          <em>By Cathy Cassidy&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Hello?' I say.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Scarlett! Where are you?'</p>
        <p>'Hi, Mum,' I reply. 'Nice to speak to you too.'</p>
        <p>'Scarlett, don't get clever with me,' she snaps. 'Your dad's just been on the phone. What d'you think you're playing at?'</p>
        <p>I sit down on a tree stump, cradling the phone. 'I'm not playing, Mum,' I tell her. 'I'm coming home.'</p>
        <p>'Scarlett, that just isn't on,' Mum says. 'We agreed this was the best solution, and you won't even give it a fair trial!'</p>
        <p>We agreed?&nbsp; 'I've sent you six text messages,' I tell her. 'And a picture, today. How come you only reply when Dad calls you?'</p>
        <p>‘I had an important presentation yesterday, and then dinner with the clients,' Mum says icily. 'I'd have called tonight, obviously.'</p>
        <p>'Well, thanks,' I quip. 'It's great you can fit me into your busy schedule.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I can hear Mum fizzing with anger. 'Actually, Scarlett, I was in the middle of a meeting when your dad called. I could do without having to deal with this kind of stunt on your very first full day in Ireland. You can't just walk out of school!'</p>
        <p>'I did,' I point out. 'It'll save them the trouble of expelling me.'</p>
        <p>'You're going back,' Mum says.</p>
        <p>'I'm coming home,' I reply. 'Please, Mum. I hate it here. Nobody wants me. It's a dump. Don't make me stay.'</p>
        <p>'Scarlett, don't be ridiculous. Where are you exactly?' Mum asks. 'Are you still in Kilimoor? Chris is out of his mind with worry. Promise me you'll stay put. Just stay still, wait for Chris. He'll sort things out.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Mum?' the word comes out kind of mangled. I close my eyes, press my fist against my mouth.</p>
        <p>'Scarlett?' she says shrilly. 'Are you still there? Listen to me. It's time you stopped acting like a kid with a tantrum and started to make the best of things. Just grow up and get on with it.'</p>
        <p>I snap the phone shut, run down to the water's edge and throw the mobile in one perfect, curving arc right out into the lough. It glints silver as it breaks the surface with a splash, then sinks without trace.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I turn away, furious, marching along the shore, but within minutes I trip, scrambling over a knot of gnarled tree roots, falling heavily. I've torn one of the ribbon ties on my sandal, and a hot, burning pain shoots through my left ankle. My eyes prickle with tears of anger, but I won't cry. I never cry - not since Dad left, anyhow. It'd be like letting him see how much he hurt me. Crying is for kids. I scream instead, a bloodcurdling yell that startles the birds and shakes the treetops before tailing off to a whimper.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I pull off my wedge heels and fling them away into the trees ahead of me, because they've ripped my feet to shreds and I don't care if I never see them again as long as I live. &nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Scarlett</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>By Cathy Cassidy&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Hello?' I say.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Scarlett! Where are you?'</p>
        <p>'Hi, Mum,' I reply. 'Nice to speak to you too.'</p>
        <p>'Scarlett, don't get clever with me,' she snaps. 'Your dad's just been on the phone. What d'you think you're playing at?'</p>
        <p>I sit down on a tree stump, cradling the phone. 'I'm not playing, Mum,' I tell her. 'I'm coming home.'</p>
        <p>'Scarlett, that just isn't on,' Mum says. 'We agreed this was the best solution, and you won't even give it a fair trial!'</p>
        <p>We agreed?&nbsp; 'I've sent you six text messages,' I tell her. 'And a picture, today. How come you only reply when Dad calls you?'</p>
        <p>‘I had an important presentation yesterday, and then dinner with the clients,' Mum says icily. 'I'd have called tonight, obviously.'</p>
        <p>'Well, thanks,' I quip. 'It's great you can fit me into your busy schedule.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I can hear Mum fizzing with anger. 'Actually, Scarlett, I was in the middle of a meeting when your dad called. I could do without having to deal with this kind of stunt on your very first full day in Ireland. You can't just walk out of school!'</p>
        <p>'I did,' I point out. 'It'll save them the trouble of expelling me.'</p>
        <p>'You're going back,' Mum says.</p>
        <p>'I'm coming home,' I reply. 'Please, Mum. I hate it here. Nobody wants me. It's a dump. Don't make me stay.'</p>
        <p>'Scarlett, don't be ridiculous. Where are you exactly?' Mum asks. 'Are you still in Kilimoor? Chris is out of his mind with worry. Promise me you'll stay put. Just stay still, wait for Chris. He'll sort things out.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Mum?' the word comes out kind of mangled. I close my eyes, press my fist against my mouth.</p>
        <p>'Scarlett?' she says shrilly. 'Are you still there? Listen to me. It's time you stopped acting like a kid with a tantrum and started to make the best of things. Just grow up and get on with it.'</p>
        <p>I snap the phone shut, run down to the water's edge and throw the mobile in one perfect, curving arc right out into the lough. It glints silver as it breaks the surface with a splash, then sinks without trace.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I turn away, furious, marching along the shore, but within minutes I trip, scrambling over a knot of gnarled tree roots, falling heavily. I've torn one of the ribbon ties on my sandal, and a hot, burning pain shoots through my left ankle. My eyes prickle with tears of anger, but I won't cry. I never cry - not since Dad left, anyhow. It'd be like letting him see how much he hurt me. Crying is for kids. I scream instead, a bloodcurdling yell that startles the birds and shakes the treetops before tailing off to a whimper.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I pull off my wedge heels and fling them away into the trees ahead of me, because they've ripped my feet to shreds and I don't care if I never see them again as long as I live. &nbsp;</p>

        <p>'I'm coming home,' I reply. 'Please, Mum. I hate it here. Nobody wants me. It's a dump. Don't make me stay.'</p>
        <p>'Scarlett, don't be ridiculous. Where are you exactly?' Mum asks. 'Are you still in Kilimoor? Chris is out of his mind with worry. Promise me you'll stay put. Just stay still, wait for Chris. He'll sort things out.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Mum?' the word comes out kind of mangled. I close my eyes, press my fist against my mouth.</p>
        <p>'Scarlett?' she says shrilly. 'Are you still there? Listen to me. It's time you stopped acting like a kid with a tantrum and started to make the best of things. Just grow up and get on with it.'</p>
        <p>I snap the phone shut, run down to the water's edge and throw the mobile in one perfect, curving arc right out into the lough. It glints silver as it breaks the surface with a splash, then sinks without trace.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I turn away, furious, marching along the shore, but within minutes I trip, scrambling over a knot of gnarled tree roots, falling heavily. I've torn one of the ribbon ties on my sandal, and a hot, burning pain shoots through my left ankle. My eyes prickle with tears of anger, but I won't cry. I never cry - not since Dad left, anyhow. It'd be like letting him see how much he hurt me. Crying is for kids. I scream instead, a bloodcurdling yell that startles the birds and shakes the treetops before tailing off to a whimper.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I pull off my wedge heels and fling them away into the trees ahead of me, because they've ripped my feet to shreds and I don't care if I never see them again as long as I live. &nbsp;</p>

        <p>“Bridge to Terabithia” is a fantasy/adventure story of friendship, family and the power of imagination. Jess Aarons is an outsider at school and even in his own family. Jess has trained all summer to become the fastest kid in his middle school class but his goal is unexpectedly thwarted by the new girl in school, Leslie Burke who competes in the "boys only" race and wins. Despite their awkward introduction, the two outsiders quickly become best friends. Leslie loves to tell stories of fantasy and magic. Jess loves to draw, but until he met Leslie, it was something he kept to himself. Leslie opens a new world of imagination for Jess. Together they create the secret kingdom of Terabithia, a magical place only accessible by swinging on an old rope over a stream in the woods near their homes. There, the friends rule the kingdom, fight the Dark Master and his creatures and plot against the school bullies. Thanks to his friendship with Leslie, Jess is changed for good. Brimming with fantastical creatures, palaces and beautiful forests, the world of Terabithia is brought to life.</p>

        </p>
        <p>This big-screen adaptation of Katherine Paterson’s award-winning 1977 children’s book (preceded by a serviceable 1985 television movie) isn’t likely to displace anyone’s memory of the popular tome, but its winning cast and generally faithful script are more than earnest enough to capture the powerful and bittersweet spirit that has, for decades, continued to make the story a favourite of children and adults alike.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Following their monumentally successful teaming on The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Walden Media and Walt Disney Pictures went looking for comparably revered subject matter with which to forge a follow-up. Bridge to Terabithia is unquestionably comparably revered, but it’s hardly the same class of story, an intimate and oftentimes challenging story of outcast rural teenagers, Jesse and Leslie (Josh Hutcherson) and Anna (Sophia Robb) who find refuge from the pain of reality in the creation of an elaborate imaginary world in the woods.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Contrary to the film’s elaborate ad campaign, which suggests a fully realised CGI re-creation of the world of Terabithia, the movie contains surprisingly little CGI, instead focusing on the kids, their unique bond and the powerful life lessons that come as a result of their adventures. Director Gabor Csupo, cofounder of famed Rugrats animation house Klasky-Csupo, makes an auspicious feature directorial debut here, careful to avoid any stylistic indulgences that might undercut character or theme.</p>
        <p>One can imagine, however, that the reigns from the Paterson estate were fairly rigid as Paterson’s son David, whose own childhood experiences inspired the original book, is credited as both a producer and co-screenwriter along with Jeff Stockwell (2002’s The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys). Still, it’s hard to imagine that Paterson herself could have imagined two more suitable stars than Hutcherson and the absolutely&nbsp;dazzling Robb, two immensely talented performers who capture the essence of teenage angst and joy so completely that the film’s handful of minor shortcomings almost seem to evaporate.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Robert Patrick and Zooey Deschanel topline the fine supporting cast, while solid scoring and cinematography by Aaron Zigman and Michael Chapman, respectively, anchor the technical contributions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <p>“Bridge to Terabithia” is a fantasy/adventure story of friendship, family and the power of imagination. Jess Aarons is an outsider at school and even in his own family. Jess has trained all summer to become the fastest kid in his middle school class but his goal is unexpectedly thwarted by the new girl in school, Leslie Burke who competes in the "boys only" race and wins. Despite their awkward introduction, the two outsiders quickly become best friends. Leslie loves to tell stories of fantasy and magic. Jess loves to draw, but until he met Leslie, it was something he kept to himself. Leslie opens a new world of imagination for Jess. Together they create the secret kingdom of Terabithia, a magical place only accessible by swinging on an old rope over a stream in the woods near their homes. There, the friends rule the kingdom, fight the Dark Master and his creatures and plot against the school bullies. Thanks to his friendship with Leslie, Jess is changed for good. Brimming with fantastical creatures, palaces and beautiful forests, the world of Terabithia is brought to life.</p>

            <strong>Review Two</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>This big-screen adaptation of Katherine Paterson’s award-winning 1977 children’s book (preceded by a serviceable 1985 television movie) isn’t likely to displace anyone’s memory of the popular tome, but its winning cast and generally faithful script are more than earnest enough to capture the powerful and bittersweet spirit that has, for decades, continued to make the story a favourite of children and adults alike.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Following their monumentally successful teaming on The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Walden Media and Walt Disney Pictures went looking for comparably revered subject matter with which to forge a follow-up. Bridge to Terabithia is unquestionably comparably revered, but it’s hardly the same class of story, an intimate and oftentimes challenging story of outcast rural teenagers, Jesse and Leslie (Josh Hutcherson) and Anna (Sophia Robb) who find refuge from the pain of reality in the creation of an elaborate imaginary world in the woods.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Contrary to the film’s elaborate ad campaign, which suggests a fully realised CGI re-creation of the world of Terabithia, the movie contains surprisingly little CGI, instead focusing on the kids, their unique bond and the powerful life lessons that come as a result of their adventures. Director Gabor Csupo, cofounder of famed Rugrats animation house Klasky-Csupo, makes an auspicious feature directorial debut here, careful to avoid any stylistic indulgences that might undercut character or theme.</p>
        <p>One can imagine, however, that the reigns from the Paterson estate were fairly rigid as Paterson’s son David, whose own childhood experiences inspired the original book, is credited as both a producer and co-screenwriter along with Jeff Stockwell (2002’s The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys). Still, it’s hard to imagine that Paterson herself could have imagined two more suitable stars than Hutcherson and the absolutely&nbsp;dazzling Robb, two immensely talented performers who capture the essence of teenage angst and joy so completely that the film’s handful of minor shortcomings almost seem to evaporate.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Robert Patrick and Zooey Deschanel topline the fine supporting cast, while solid scoring and cinematography by Aaron Zigman and Michael Chapman, respectively, anchor the technical contributions.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>“Bridge to Terabithia” is a fantasy/adventure story of friendship, family and the power of imagination. Jess Aarons is an outsider at school and even in his own family. Jess has trained all summer to become the fastest kid in his middle school class but his goal is unexpectedly thwarted by the new girl in school, Leslie Burke who competes in the "boys only" race and wins. Despite their awkward introduction, the two outsiders quickly become best friends. Leslie loves to tell stories of fantasy and magic. Jess loves to draw, but until he met Leslie, it was something he kept to himself. Leslie opens a new world of imagination for Jess. Together they create the secret kingdom of Terabithia, a magical place only accessible by swinging on an old rope over a stream in the woods near their homes. There, the friends rule the kingdom, fight the Dark Master and his creatures and plot against the school bullies. Thanks to his friendship with Leslie, Jess is changed for good. Brimming with fantastical creatures, palaces and beautiful forests, the world of Terabithia is brought to life.</p>

            <strong>Review Two</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>This big-screen adaptation of Katherine Paterson’s award-winning 1977 children’s book (preceded by a serviceable 1985 television movie) isn’t likely to displace anyone’s memory of the popular tome, but its winning cast and generally faithful script are more than earnest enough to capture the powerful and bittersweet spirit that has, for decades, continued to make the story a favourite of children and adults alike.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Following their monumentally successful teaming on The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Walden Media and Walt Disney Pictures went looking for comparably revered subject matter with which to forge a follow-up. Bridge to Terabithia is unquestionably comparably revered, but it’s hardly the same class of story, an intimate and oftentimes challenging story of outcast rural teenagers, Jesse and Leslie (Josh Hutcherson) and Anna (Sophia Robb) who find refuge from the pain of reality in the creation of an elaborate imaginary world in the woods.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Contrary to the film’s elaborate ad campaign, which suggests a fully realised CGI re-creation of the world of Terabithia, the movie contains surprisingly little CGI, instead focusing on the kids, their unique bond and the powerful life lessons that come as a result of their adventures. Director Gabor Csupo, cofounder of famed Rugrats animation house Klasky-Csupo, makes an auspicious feature directorial debut here, careful to avoid any stylistic indulgences that might undercut character or theme.</p>
        <p>One can imagine, however, that the reigns from the Paterson estate were fairly rigid as Paterson’s son David, whose own childhood experiences inspired the original book, is credited as both a producer and co-screenwriter along with Jeff Stockwell (2002’s The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys). Still, it’s hard to imagine that Paterson herself could have imagined two more suitable stars than Hutcherson and the absolutely&nbsp;dazzling Robb, two immensely talented performers who capture the essence of teenage angst and joy so completely that the film’s handful of minor shortcomings almost seem to evaporate.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Robert Patrick and Zooey Deschanel topline the fine supporting cast, while solid scoring and cinematography by Aaron Zigman and Michael Chapman, respectively, anchor the technical contributions.&nbsp;</p>
