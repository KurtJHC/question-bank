<strong>India &amp; Japan</strong>: Birthdays in India are a celebration of togetherness and indulgence. Children ditch their school threads in favour of new clothes, often brightly coloured and being worn for the first time on their birthday. You start with your dessert, before dinner! After a happy birthday song has been sung, the birthday boy or girl slices the cake, takes a small slice and then feeds it to their guests. The guests will, in turn, return the favour and feed the birthday celebrator back.<br>
<br>
Prior to the 50s, Japan had one day that was dedicated to the celebration of birthdays. New Year’s Day. Everyone’s birthday would be celebrated then, as according to the ancient beliefs, that was the day everyone got older. As time has gone on, this has changed and birthdays are celebrated individually, on each person’s true birthday. The only time you’d organise your own party is as a child. Once older anything that is arranged is done so a few days before your actual birthday – and a cake is a must. It is very common in Japan to save your actual birthday for spending time with your partner, alone.<br>
<br>
{^ <strong>Extract B</strong> ^}<br>
Mexico: The traditions start with mariachis singing a song called ‘Las Mañanitas’ to serenade you as the sun rises. This song can be sung throughout the day as well. It is sung when the candles on the cake are lit, and it translates to ‘Little Mornings’.<br>
<br>
Speaking of cake, another Mexican birthday tradition is the good ol’ faceplant. The face of the birthday boy or girl is pushed into a creamy cake in this tradition known as ‘la mordida’, while everyone chants Mordida! Of course, we can’t forget the traditional piñata, as no Mexican birthday is complete without one!<br>
<br>
One of my favourites is the traditional tres leches cake (just in case you’re wondering – that’s a multicoloured mega cake). The more cream and the more layers, the better (couldn’t agree more). This cake is usually adorned with the things you love, similarly to in Western cultures, but in a multicoloured-mega-form. Another incredibly adorable tradition is the covering of your car. This sees your car absolutely covered in an array of brightly coloured post-its, each with a special something written on it. How sweet!<br>
<br>
{^ <strong>Extract C</strong> ^}<br>
China: In China, being born automatically gives you a birthday. While in Western cultures you are born and then you live a year before celebrating your first birthday, in China you are born as a one-year-old. Additionally in some Chinese traditions, although less common now, you will have a further year added to your age on your first Luna New Year’s Day. By the time you reach what would be considered your “first birthday” in other cultures, you could be three years old with “East Asian age reckoning”.<br>
<br>
There are some ages which are considered unlucky too, for women the main ones would be 30, 33 or 60. To avoid bad luck, a Chinese woman would remain 29 until she turned 31. Similarly, men dodge back by not acknowledging being 40.<br>
&nbsp;
<p>As far as Chinese celebrations and traditions go, all birthdays need to be celebrated before or on someone’s birthday. Never late. Birthday cakes have made their way into traditions, but most importantly a longevity noodle would be eaten. This is an unbroken egg noodle that would fill an entire bowl. It would be slurped up in one continuous strand, so to not cut your life short. Other traditional birthday banquet foods would include red- dyed hard-boiled eggs (cultural symbol for happiness) and dumplings (cultural symbol for good fortune).<br>
<br>
{^ <strong>Extract D</strong> ^}<br>
Judaism (Jewish culture): There are a lot of Jewish holidays which can last days at a time throughout the calendar, however, typically Judaism doesn’t make too much of a fuss about birthdays. That being said, there are certainly no objections to celebrating either a birthday when it occurs on either the Jewish or Gregorian calendar.<br>
<br>
As far as celebrations go, there are a few special birthdays where specific things would be celebrated, for example, the second or third, when the child’s weaning would be celebrated. Another is the third birthday, which is when traditional Jews would cut a son’s hair for the first time, or 12th/13th (depending on gender) when the Bar/Bat Mitzvah is celebrated. Outside of these specific milestone celebrations, there is not a traditional way to celebrate a birthday.<br>
