          <strong>The Call of the Wild</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by Jack London</em>
        </p>
        <p>Buck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley. Judge Miller’s place, it was called. It stood back from the road, half hidden among the trees, through which glimpses could be caught of the wide cool verandah that ran around its four sides. The house was approached by gravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns and under the interlacing trees of tall poplars. At the rear things were on even a more spacious scale than at the front. There were great stables, where a dozen grooms and boys held forth, rows of vine-covered servants’ cottages an endless and orderly array of outhouses, long grape plantations, green pastures, orchards, and berry patches. Then there was the pumping plant for the artesian well and the big cement tank, where Judge Miller’s boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot afternoon.</p>
        <p>And over this great domain Buck ruled. Here he was born, and here he had lived the four years of his life. It was true, there were other dogs. There could not but be other dogs on so vast a place, but they did not count. They came and went, resided in the many kennels, or lived obscurely in the recesses of the house after the fashion of Toots, the Japanese pug, or Ysabel, the Mexican hairless, — strange creatures that rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground. On the other hand, there were the fox terriers, a score of them at least, who yelped fearful threats at Toots and Ysabel looking out of the windows at them and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with brooms and mops.</p>
        <p>But Buck was neither house-dog nor kennel-dog. The whole realm was his. He plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the Judge’s sons; he escorted Mollie and Alice, the Judge’s daughters, on long twilight or early morning rambles; on wintry nights he lay at the Judge’s feet before the roaring library fire; he carried the Judge’s grandsons on his back, or rolled them in the grass, and guarded their footsteps through wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable yard, and even beyond, where the paddocks were, and the berry patches. Among the terriers he stalked imperiously, and Toots and Ysabel he utterly ignored, for he was king, — king over all creeping, crawling, flying things of Judge Miller’s place, humans included.</p>
        <p>His father, Elmo, a huge St. Bernard, had been the Judge’s inseparable companion, and Buck attempted to follow in the way of his father. He was not so large, — he weighed only one hundred and forty pounds, — for his mother, Shep, had been a Scotch shepherd dog. Nevertheless, one hundred and forty pounds, to which was added the dignity that comes of good living and universal respect, enabled him to carry himself in right royal fashion. During the four years since his puppyhood he had lived the life of an aristocrat; he had a fine pride in himself, was even a trifle egotistical, as country gentlemen sometimes become because of their insular situation. But he had saved himself by not becoming a&nbsp;mere pampered house-dog. Hunting and kindred outdoor delights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles; and to him, the love of water had been a tonic and a health preserver.</p>

Snow is falling, as quiet as a mouse;<br>
On people and on dogs and on our house.<br>
A fluffy blanket now covers&nbsp;the&nbsp;street -&nbsp;<br>
The cars are white, and that is neat.</p>
        <p>Quickly I dress and run a comb through my hair.<br>
No time to lose, there’s&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline"><strong>magic</strong></span>&nbsp;in the air.&nbsp;<br>
School’s off, so I’ve got all day -<br>
To go on adventures, to roam and to play.</p>
        <p>Mama is in the kitchen, baking pancakes -<br>
But I’m not hungry, I want to catch snowflakes.<br>
And just when I have so much to do;<br>
She’s got scrambled eggs and bacon too.</p>
        <p><span class="txt-underline"><strong>With a sigh I sit down</strong></span>, and empty my plate.<br>
To venture outside I can hardly wait.<br>
The garden looks pristine, and oh so inviting;<br>
My very own wonderland, how exciting!</p>
        <p>Mama has a pair of furry snow boots for me;<br>
To make my footsteps extra crunchy.<br>
The moment has come, I step through the door -<br>
I’m going where no man has gone before.</p>
        <p>I’m an astronaut, my space rocket has just landed.<br>
It ran out of fuel and now I’m stranded.<br>
How will I survive in this alien, white place?<br>
There’re so many dangers I bravely must face.</p>
        <p>The temperatures here are far below zero -<br>
If I make it out alive, I’ll be a superhero!<br>
All my courage I gather, and set out to explore;<br>
Until I’m so cold I can’t go on anymore.</p>
        <p>It’s slowly getting dark, and the wind is howling.<br>
My nose has frostbite, my stomach is growling.<br>
Then mama calls, on Earth it’s time for dinner -<br>

        <p><em>Read the poem below by Bettina Van Vaerenbergh then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>SNOW DAY</strong><br><br>
Snow is falling, as quiet as a mouse;<br>
On people and on dogs and on our house.<br>
A fluffy blanket now covers&nbsp;the&nbsp;street -&nbsp;<br>
The cars are white, and that is neat.</p>
        <p>Quickly I dress and run a comb through my hair.<br>
No time to lose, there’s&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline"><strong>magic</strong></span>&nbsp;in the air.&nbsp;<br>
School’s off, so I’ve got all day -<br>
To go on adventures, to roam and to play.</p>
        <p>Mama is in the kitchen, baking pancakes -<br>
But I’m not hungry, I want to catch snowflakes.<br>
And just when I have so much to do;<br>
She’s got scrambled eggs and bacon too.</p>
        <p><span class="txt-underline"><strong>With a sigh I sit down</strong></span>, and empty my plate.<br>
To venture outside I can hardly wait.<br>
The garden looks pristine, and oh so inviting;<br>
My very own wonderland, how exciting!</p>
        <p>Mama has a pair of furry snow boots for me;<br>
To make my footsteps extra crunchy.<br>
The moment has come, I step through the door -<br>
I’m going where no man has gone before.</p>
        <p>I’m an astronaut, my space rocket has just landed.<br>
It ran out of fuel and now I’m stranded.<br>
How will I survive in this alien, white place?<br>
There’re so many dangers I bravely must face.</p>
        <p>The temperatures here are far below zero -<br>
If I make it out alive, I’ll be a superhero!<br>
All my courage I gather, and set out to explore;<br>
Until I’m so cold I can’t go on anymore.</p>
        <p>It’s slowly getting dark, and the wind is howling.<br>
My nose has frostbite, my stomach is growling.<br>
Then mama calls, on Earth it’s time for dinner -<br>
And I hurry back to&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline"><strong>base camp</strong></span>, feeling like a winner.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>The Hubble Space Telescope</strong><br><br>
The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is the first big optical space observatory telescope. Being above the atmosphere means it can see the sky more clearly than a telescope on the ground.&nbsp;<strong>15</strong>&nbsp;………. Named after the astronomer Edwin Hubble, the Hubble Space Telescope can observe 24 hours a day. The main mirror is 94.5 inches (2.4 meters) across. The telescope can take pictures of things so far away it would be nearly impossible to see them from anywhere else.</p>
        <p>It was made by both NASA and the ESA (European Space Agency) working together. It is 600 km in space and was launched on April 24, 1990.&nbsp;<strong>16</strong>&nbsp;………. If you were going this speed on Earth, you would be able to get from New York to San Francisco in 10 minutes. This speed creates difficulty in scheduling observations.</p>
        <p>The Hubble itself is the size of a large school bus, but still small enough to fit inside the cargo bay of a Space Shuttle. It was repaired in 1993 due to problems in the picture quality. The telescope was launched in 1990 by a space shuttle. When it entered orbit, everything seemed fine.&nbsp;<strong>17</strong>&nbsp;………. When the HST took its first pictures, astronomers were happy to see the images, but they were not as sharp and as crisp as expected. Telescopes in space can take better pictures than telescopes on Earth, but for some reason, the pictures were not better than the pictures taken on Earth. They found a problem with the telescope's mirror. The mirror was not curved right.&nbsp;<strong>18</strong>&nbsp;………. Still, this was enough to cause the images to be blurred. Some said that Hubble was near-sighted.</p>
        <p>Another space shuttle was soon sent up to repair the space telescope. The repair was not easy. The astronauts had to install some small mirrors to correct the light from the big mirror. The big mirror could still be used.&nbsp;<strong>19</strong>&nbsp;………. When an astronaut opened one of the doors on Hubble to install a new camera, the door would not close. The astronauts had to think of a creative way to get around the problem. Eventually, Hubble was fixed. Repairs and servicing missions have been made to the Hubble Space Telescope five times to keep it in orbit and make it even better as technology improved. The space shuttle program was kept going longer than planned to send an extra trip up to the Hubble Space Telescope for a final fix.</p>
        <p>Early on, in 1994, Hubble stared at what was thought to be an empty area of space for ten days. It found there were actually many galaxies even there, but very faint and very far away. No other telescope could have seen that.&nbsp;<strong>20</strong>&nbsp;………. It was able to help settle the age of the universe at about 13.7 billion years. Before the Hubble, scientists only knew it was between 10 and 20 billion years old. It took the first picture of a planet outside our solar system and was able to find what type of atmosphere other planets might have.<br>
Hubble will be replaced by the James Webb Space Telescope which will be located even further from Earth. There are now other telescopes in orbit, like the Herschel Space Observatory and the Kepler Spacecraft, which was specially made for finding Earth-like planets around other stars.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>The Hubble Space Telescope</strong><br><br>
The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is the first big optical space observatory telescope. Being above the atmosphere means it can see the sky more clearly than a telescope on the ground.&nbsp;<strong>15&nbsp;</strong>………. Named after the astronomer Edwin Hubble, the Hubble Space Telescope can observe 24 hours a day. The main mirror is 94.5 inches (2.4 meters) across. The telescope can take pictures of things so far away it would be nearly impossible to see them from anywhere else.</p>
        <p>It was made by both NASA and the ESA (European Space Agency) working together. It is 600 km in space and was launched on April 24, 1990.&nbsp;<strong>16&nbsp;</strong>………. If you were going this speed on Earth, you would be able to get from New York to San Francisco in 10 minutes. This speed creates difficulty in scheduling observations.</p>
        <p>The Hubble itself is the size of a large school bus, but still small enough to fit inside the cargo bay of a Space Shuttle. It was repaired in 1993 due to problems in the picture quality. The telescope was launched in 1990 by a space shuttle. When it entered orbit, everything seemed fine.&nbsp;<strong>17&nbsp;</strong>………. When the HST took its first pictures, astronomers were happy to see the images, but they were not as sharp and as crisp as expected. Telescopes in space can take better pictures than telescopes on Earth, but for some reason, the pictures were not better than the pictures taken on Earth. They found a problem with the telescope's mirror. The mirror was not curved right.&nbsp;<strong>18</strong>&nbsp;………. Still, this was enough to cause the images to be blurred. Some said that Hubble was near-sighted.</p>
        <p>Another space shuttle was soon sent up to repair the space telescope. The repair was not easy. The astronauts had to install some small mirrors to correct the light from the big mirror. The big mirror could still be used.&nbsp;<strong>19&nbsp;</strong>………. When an astronaut opened one of the doors on Hubble to install a new camera, the door would not close. The astronauts had to think of a creative way to get around the problem. Eventually, Hubble was fixed. Repairs and servicing missions have been made to the Hubble Space Telescope five times to keep it in orbit and make it even better as technology improved. The space shuttle program was kept going longer than planned to send an extra trip up to the Hubble Space Telescope for a final fix.</p>
        <p>Early on, in 1994, Hubble stared at what was thought to be an empty area of space for ten days. It found there were actually many galaxies even there, but very faint and very far away. No other telescope could have seen that.&nbsp;<strong>20&nbsp;</strong>………. It was able to help settle the age of the universe at about 13.7 billion years. Before the Hubble, scientists only knew it was between 10 and 20 billion years old. It took the first picture of a planet outside our solar system and was able to find what type of atmosphere other planets might have.<br>
Hubble will be replaced by the James Webb Space Telescope which will be located even further from Earth. There are now other telescopes in orbit, like the Herschel Space Observatory and the Kepler Spacecraft, which was specially made for finding Earth-like planets around other stars.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>The Hubble Space Telescope</strong><br><br>
The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is the first big optical space observatory telescope. Being above the atmosphere means it can see the sky more clearly than a telescope on the ground.&nbsp;<strong>15&nbsp;</strong>………. Named after the astronomer Edwin Hubble, the Hubble Space Telescope can observe 24 hours a day. The main mirror is 94.5 inches (2.4 meters) across. The telescope can take pictures of things so far away it would be nearly impossible to see them from anywhere else.</p>
        <p>It was made by both NASA and the ESA (European Space Agency) working together. It is 600 km in space and was launched on April 24, 1990.&nbsp;<strong>16&nbsp;</strong>………. If you were going this speed on Earth, you would be able to get from New York to San Francisco in 10 minutes. This speed creates difficulty in scheduling observations.</p>
        <p>The Hubble itself is the size of a large school bus, but still small enough to fit inside the cargo bay of a Space Shuttle. It was repaired in 1993 due to problems in the picture quality. The telescope was launched in 1990 by a space shuttle. When it entered orbit, everything seemed fine.&nbsp;<strong>17</strong>&nbsp;………. When the HST took its first pictures, astronomers were happy to see the images, but they were not as sharp and as crisp as expected. Telescopes in space can take better pictures than telescopes on Earth, but for some reason, the pictures were not better than the pictures taken on Earth. They found a problem with the telescope's mirror. The mirror was not curved right.&nbsp;<strong>18</strong>&nbsp;………. Still, this was enough to cause the images to be blurred. Some said that Hubble was near-sighted.</p>
        <p>Another space shuttle was soon sent up to repair the space telescope. The repair was not easy. The astronauts had to install some small mirrors to correct the light from the big mirror. The big mirror could still be used.&nbsp;<strong>19&nbsp;</strong>………. When an astronaut opened one of the doors on Hubble to install a new camera, the door would not close. The astronauts had to think of a creative way to get around the problem. Eventually, Hubble was fixed. Repairs and servicing missions have been made to the Hubble Space Telescope five times to keep it in orbit and make it even better as technology improved. The space shuttle program was kept going longer than planned to send an extra trip up to the Hubble Space Telescope for a final fix.</p>
        <p>Early on, in 1994, Hubble stared at what was thought to be an empty area of space for ten days. It found there were actually many galaxies even there, but very faint and very far away. No other telescope could have seen that.&nbsp;<strong>20&nbsp;</strong>………. It was able to help settle the age of the universe at about 13.7 billion years. Before the Hubble, scientists only knew it was between 10 and 20 billion years old. It took the first picture of a planet outside our solar system and was able to find what type of atmosphere other planets might have.<br>
Hubble will be replaced by the James Webb Space Telescope which will be located even further from Earth. There are now other telescopes in orbit, like the Herschel Space Observatory and the Kepler Spacecraft, which was specially made for finding Earth-like planets around other stars.</p>

The astronauts had to think of a creative way to get around the problem. Eventually, Hubble was fixed. Repairs and servicing missions have been made to the Hubble Space Telescope five times to keep it in orbit and make it even better as technology improved. The space shuttle program was kept going longer than planned to send an extra trip up to the Hubble Space Telescope for a final fix.</p>
        <p>Early on, in 1994, Hubble stared at what was thought to be an empty area of space for ten days. It found there were actually many galaxies even there, but very faint and very far away. No other telescope could have seen that.&nbsp;<strong>20&nbsp;</strong>………. It was able to help settle the age of the universe at about 13.7 billion years. Before the Hubble, scientists only knew it was between 10 and 20 billion years old. It took the first picture of a planet outside our solar system and was able to find what type of atmosphere other planets might have.<br>
Hubble will be replaced by the James Webb Space Telescope which will be located even further from Earth. There are now other telescopes in orbit, like the Herschel Space Observatory and the Kepler Spacecraft, which was specially made for finding Earth-like planets around other stars.</p>

<p>There was once a boy who was so obsessed with watching TV that wherever he went, he would arrive late. He was so keen to return to the telly that he never finished his breakfast or anything.<br>
<br>
One day, in his post-box, was a mysterious parcel. Inside the parcel were some special spectacles, along with a piece of paper saying, "With these you'll be able to see time".<br>
<br>
The boy didn't understand. He put the glasses on, looked at his brother and saw an enormous pile of flowers on top of his head. The flowers were falling down to the ground, one by one. And it wasn't just his brother. Whenever he looked at anyone through those glasses, exactly the same was happening. The only difference was that the older the person was, the smaller was the pile of flowers on their head. And according to how that person behaved, the pile gained or lost flowers.<br>
<br>
The next morning, while having his breakfast, the boy remembered his glasses. Putting them on, he was horrified to see that, coming from his own pile, was a constant stream of flowers going in the direction of the television. Not only that, but the television now had an enormous mouth, and was ferociously gobbling up all the flowers. And everywhere he went he would see wild-looking televisions devouring flowers.<br>
<br>
Finally, after realising what televisions actually are, the boy decided he would never again allow them to eat up all his time.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
“Hey! Couch potato! Stop watching so much television or you'll rot your brain!”<br>
<br>
Have you ever had someone say something along those lines to you? If you watch as much television as most people do, then a concerned friend or family member may have tried to unglue you from the set and get you outside to play instead.<br>
<br>
Watching television is fun. There's no use in denying it. The entertainment industry makes billions of dollars by producing television programs that delight and entertain us. Whether it's a funny comedy, an action-packed crime drama, a sporting event, or a musical reality show, television programs offer a little something for everyone. Of course, television programs can be educational. You're sure to find interesting programming that can teach you a lot. Many other cable channels also feature fascinating educational content, from biographies and nature shows to historical features and game shows.<br>
<br>
But watching too much television might also actually change your brain in negative ways. Some fear that the brain will change in ways that lead to a shorter attention span that can affect learning.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Since the days of “Howdy Doody”, children have been drawn to their television sets to watch shows made especially for them. While grown-ups get into medical dramas and courtroom hijinks, kids just want to watch characters they love dealing with hilarious problems while learning important lessons in the process.<br>
<br>
Kids’ TV is a genre all its own; with brighter colours, smaller stories, and an element of silliness rarely found during primetime. From animated sponges to a boy named Beaver, the best children’s television shows of all time have been best friends for kids all over the world.<br>
<br>
We organised them into the 100 best programs to ever grace the small screen, here is number #1. Avatar: The Last Airbender [IMDb user rating: 9.2 - Years on air: 2005–2008] It’s an animated show set in an alternate world where people can manipulate the elements. A 12-year-old named Aang and his friends are tasked with bringing peace to the world by ending the Fire Lord’s century-long war. While the series was successful with 61 episodes over three seasons, the live-action adaptation, directed by M. Shyamalan, was universally shown.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
There's a perception that books are good, while TV is bad. Spend a day curled up with a book and you're an intellectual; spend a day watching your favorite show and you're a couch potato.<br>
<br>
But why is that? Why can't watching TV be just as educational as reading a book? In 2013 a team led by Hiraku Takeuchi at Tohoku University in Japan examined the effects of television on the brains of 276 children. He found that the more TV the kids watched, parts of their brain associated with higher arousal and aggression levels became thicker. Also, the more hours of television the kids watched, the lower their verbal test results became.<br>
<br>
In the same year, a study was done on how reading a novel affected the brain. College students were asked to read Pompeii by Robert Harris, a thriller. After reading the novel, the students had increased connectivity in parts of the brain that were related to language. There was also increased activity in the brain, that suggested readers experienced similar sensations to the characters in the book.<br>
<br>
There are also long-term effects from reading books. Reading keeps your mind alert and delays cognitive decline in elders. Research even found that Alzheimer's is 2.5 times less likely to appear in elderly people who read regularly, while TV was presented as a risk factor. Six minutes of reading can reduce stress levels by 68%.&nbsp;<br>

<p>There was once a boy who was so obsessed with watching TV that wherever he went, he would arrive late. He was so keen to return to the telly that he never finished his breakfast or anything.<br>
<br>
One day, in his post-box, was a mysterious parcel. Inside the parcel were some special spectacles, along with a piece of paper saying, "With these you'll be able to see time".<br>
<br>
The boy didn't understand. He put the glasses on, looked at his brother and saw an enormous pile of flowers on top of his head. The flowers were falling down to the ground, one by one. And it wasn't just his brother. Whenever he looked at anyone through those glasses, exactly the same was happening. The only difference was that the older the person was, the smaller was the pile of flowers on their head. And according to how that person behaved, the pile gained or lost flowers.<br>
<br>
The next morning, while having his breakfast, the boy remembered his glasses. Putting them on, he was horrified to see that, coming from his own pile, was a constant stream of flowers going in the direction of the television. Not only that, but the television now had an enormous mouth, and was ferociously gobbling up all the flowers. And everywhere he went he would see wild-looking televisions devouring flowers.<br>
<br>
Finally, after realising what televisions actually are, the boy decided he would never again allow them to eat up all his time.<br>

“Hey! Couch potato! Stop watching so much television or you'll rot your brain!”<br>
<br>
Have you ever had someone say something along those lines to you? If you watch as much television as most people do, then a concerned friend or family member may have tried to unglue you from the set and get you outside to play instead.<br>
<br>
Watching television is fun. There's no use in denying it. The entertainment industry makes billions of dollars by producing television programs that delight and entertain us. Whether it's a funny comedy, an action-packed crime drama, a sporting event, or a musical reality show, television programs offer a little something for everyone. Of course, television programs can be educational. You're sure to find interesting programming that can teach you a lot. Many other cable channels also feature fascinating educational content, from biographies and nature shows to historical features and game shows.<br>
<br>
But watching too much television might also actually change your brain in negative ways. Some fear that the brain will change in ways that lead to a shorter attention span that can affect learning.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Since the days of “Howdy Doody”, children have been drawn to their television sets to watch shows made especially for them. While grown-ups get into medical dramas and courtroom hijinks, kids just want to watch characters they love dealing with hilarious problems while learning important lessons in the process.<br>
<br>
Kids’ TV is a genre all its own; with brighter colours, smaller stories, and an element of silliness rarely found during primetime. From animated sponges to a boy named Beaver, the best children’s television shows of all time have been best friends for kids all over the world.<br>
<br>
We organised them into the 100 best programs to ever grace the small screen, here is number #1. Avatar: The Last Airbender [IMDb user rating: 9.2 - Years on air: 2005–2008] It’s an animated show set in an alternate world where people can manipulate the elements. A 12-year-old named Aang and his friends are tasked with bringing peace to the world by ending the Fire Lord’s century-long war. While the series was successful with 61 episodes over three seasons, the live-action adaptation, directed by M. Shyamalan, was universally shown.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
There's a perception that books are good, while TV is bad. Spend a day curled up with a book and you're an intellectual; spend a day watching your favorite show and you're a couch potato.<br>
<br>
But why is that? Why can't watching TV be just as educational as reading a book? In 2013 a team led by Hiraku Takeuchi at Tohoku University in Japan examined the effects of television on the brains of 276 children. He found that the more TV the kids watched, parts of their brain associated with higher arousal and aggression levels became thicker. Also, the more hours of television the kids watched, the lower their verbal test results became.<br>
<br>
In the same year, a study was done on how reading a novel affected the brain. College students were asked to read Pompeii by Robert Harris, a thriller. After reading the novel, the students had increased connectivity in parts of the brain that were related to language. There was also increased activity in the brain, that suggested readers experienced similar sensations to the characters in the book.<br>
<br>
There are also long-term effects from reading books. Reading keeps your mind alert and delays cognitive decline in elders. Research even found that Alzheimer's is 2.5 times less likely to appear in elderly people who read regularly, while TV was presented as a risk factor. Six minutes of reading can reduce stress levels by 68%.&nbsp;<br>

<br>
The boy didn't understand. He put the glasses on, looked at his brother and saw an enormous pile of flowers on top of his head. The flowers were falling down to the ground, one by one. And it wasn't just his brother. Whenever he looked at anyone through those glasses, exactly the same was happening. The only difference was that the older the person was, the smaller was the pile of flowers on their head. And according to how that person behaved, the pile gained or lost flowers.<br>
<br>
The next morning, while having his breakfast, the boy remembered his glasses. Putting them on, he was horrified to see that, coming from his own pile, was a constant stream of flowers going in the direction of the television. Not only that, but the television now had an enormous mouth, and was ferociously gobbling up all the flowers. And everywhere he went he would see wild-looking televisions devouring flowers.<br>
<br>
Finally, after realising what televisions actually are, the boy decided he would never again allow them to eat up all his time.<br>

“Hey! Couch potato! Stop watching so much television or you'll rot your brain!”<br>
<br>
Have you ever had someone say something along those lines to you? If you watch as much television as most people do, then a concerned friend or family member may have tried to unglue you from the set and get you outside to play instead.<br>
<br>
Watching television is fun. There's no use in denying it. The entertainment industry makes billions of dollars by producing television programs that delight and entertain us. Whether it's a funny comedy, an action-packed crime drama, a sporting event, or a musical reality show, television programs offer a little something for everyone. Of course, television programs can be educational. You're sure to find interesting programming that can teach you a lot. Many other cable channels also feature fascinating educational content, from biographies and nature shows to historical features and game shows.<br>
<br>
But watching too much television might also actually change your brain in negative ways. Some fear that the brain will change in ways that lead to a shorter attention span that can affect learning.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Since the days of “Howdy Doody”, children have been drawn to their television sets to watch shows made especially for them. While grown-ups get into medical dramas and courtroom hijinks, kids just want to watch characters they love dealing with hilarious problems while learning important lessons in the process.<br>
<br>
Kids’ TV is a genre all its own; with brighter colours, smaller stories, and an element of silliness rarely found during primetime. From animated sponges to a boy named Beaver, the best children’s television shows of all time have been best friends for kids all over the world.<br>
<br>
We organised them into the 100 best programs to ever grace the small screen, here is number #1. Avatar: The Last Airbender [IMDb user rating: 9.2 - Years on air: 2005–2008] It’s an animated show set in an alternate world where people can manipulate the elements. A 12-year-old named Aang and his friends are tasked with bringing peace to the world by ending the Fire Lord’s century-long war. While the series was successful with 61 episodes over three seasons, the live-action adaptation, directed by M. Shyamalan, was universally shown.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
There's a perception that books are good, while TV is bad. Spend a day curled up with a book and you're an intellectual; spend a day watching your favorite show and you're a couch potato.<br>
<br>
But why is that? Why can't watching TV be just as educational as reading a book? In 2013 a team led by Hiraku Takeuchi at Tohoku University in Japan examined the effects of television on the brains of 276 children. He found that the more TV the kids watched, parts of their brain associated with higher arousal and aggression levels became thicker. Also, the more hours of television the kids watched, the lower their verbal test results became.<br>
<br>
In the same year, a study was done on how reading a novel affected the brain. College students were asked to read Pompeii by Robert Harris, a thriller. After reading the novel, the students had increased connectivity in parts of the brain that were related to language. There was also increased activity in the brain, that suggested readers experienced similar sensations to the characters in the book.<br>
<br>
There are also long-term effects from reading books. Reading keeps your mind alert and delays cognitive decline in elders. Research even found that Alzheimer's is 2.5 times less likely to appear in elderly people who read regularly, while TV was presented as a risk factor. Six minutes of reading can reduce stress levels by 68%.&nbsp;<br>

        <p>Nobody knew for sure what the A-Z meant. Perhaps it referred to the fact that all sorts of strange things—everything from A to Z—were sold in the store. Or perhaps it had something to do with the owner’s name. However, no one seemed to know for sure what his name actually was. It was all part of a mysterious uncertainty about even the smallest item of public information about the old man. Nobody seemed certain, for instance, just why he was known as the Professor.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The neighbourhood surrounding the Professor’s store was made up of inexpensive apartment houses, little family-owned shops, and small, aging homes. The people of the area, many of whom had some connection with the university, could trace their ancestors to every continent, and just about every country in the world.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There were dozens of children in the neighbourhood; boys and girls of every size and style and colour, some of whom could speak more than one language when they wanted to. But in their schools and on the streets they all seemed to speak the same language and to have a number of things in common. And one of the things they had in common, at that time, was a vague and mysterious fear of the old man called the Professor.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Just what was so dangerous about the Professor was uncertain, like everything else about him, but his appearance undoubtedly had something to do with the rumors. He was tall and bent and his thin beard straggled up his cheeks like dry moss on gray rocks. His eyes were dark and expressionless, and set so deep under heavy brows that from a distance they looked like dark empty holes. And, from a distance was the only way that most of the children of Orchard Avenue cared to see them. The Professor lived somewhere at the back of his dingy store, and when he came out to stand in the sun in his doorway, smaller children would cross the street if they had to walk by.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now and then, older and braver boys, inspired by the old man’s strangeness, would dare each other into an attempt to tease or torment him—but not for long. Their absolute failure to get any sort of a reaction from their victim was not only discouraging, it was weird enough to spoil the fun for even the bravest of bullies.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Since there were several antique stores in the area to draw the buyers, the Professor seemed to do a fairly good business with out-of-town collectors; but his local trade was very small. It was said that he sold items that were used, but not antique, very cheaply, but even for grown-ups the prospect of a bargain was often not enough to offset the discomfort of the old man’s stony stare.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was one day early in a recent September that the Professor happened to be the only witness to the very beginning of the Egypt Game. He had been looking for something in a seldom used storeroom at the back of his shop, when a slight noise drew him to a window. He lifted a gunnysack curtain, rubbed a peephole in the thick coating of dirt, and peered through. Outside that particular window was a small storage yard surrounded by a high board fence. It had been years since the Professor had made any use of the area, and the weedgrown yard and open lean-to shed were empty except for a few pieces of forgotten junk. But as the old man peered through his dirty window, two girls were pulling a much smaller boy through a hole in the fence.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>NOT LONG AGO IN A LARGE UNIVERSITY TOWN IN California, on a street called Orchard Avenue, a strange old man ran a dusty shabby store. Above the dirty show windows a faded peeling sign said:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A-Z ANTIQUES</p>
        <p>CURIOS</p>
        <p>USED MERCHANDISE</p>

          <strong>The Egypt Game&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Zilpha Keatley Snyder&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>NOT LONG AGO IN A LARGE UNIVERSITY TOWN IN California, on a street called Orchard Avenue, a strange old man ran a dusty shabby store. Above the dirty show windows a faded peeling sign said:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A-Z ANTIQUES</p>
        <p>CURIOS</p>
        <p>USED MERCHANDISE</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Nobody knew for sure what the A-Z meant. Perhaps it referred to the fact that all sorts of strange things—everything from A to Z—were sold in the store. Or perhaps it had something to do with the owner’s name. However, no one seemed to know for sure what his name actually was. It was all part of a mysterious uncertainty about even the smallest item of public information about the old man. Nobody seemed certain, for instance, just why he was known as the Professor.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The neighbourhood surrounding the Professor’s store was made up of inexpensive apartment houses, little family-owned shops, and small, aging homes. The people of the area, many of whom had some connection with the university, could trace their ancestors to every continent, and just about every country in the world.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There were dozens of children in the neighbourhood; boys and girls of every size and style and colour, some of whom could speak more than one language when they wanted to. But in their schools and on the streets they all seemed to speak the same language and to have a number of things in common. And one of the things they had in common, at that time, was a vague and mysterious fear of the old man called the Professor.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Just what was so dangerous about the Professor was uncertain, like everything else about him, but his appearance undoubtedly had something to do with the rumors. He was tall and bent and his thin beard straggled up his cheeks like dry moss on gray rocks. His eyes were dark and expressionless, and set so deep under heavy brows that from a distance they looked like dark empty holes. And, from a distance was the only way that most of the children of Orchard Avenue cared to see them. The Professor lived somewhere at the back of his dingy store, and when he came out to stand in the sun in his doorway, smaller children would cross the street if they had to walk by.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now and then, older and braver boys, inspired by the old man’s strangeness, would dare each other into an attempt to tease or torment him—but not for long. Their absolute failure to get any sort of a reaction from their victim was not only discouraging, it was weird enough to spoil the fun for even the bravest of bullies.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Since there were several antique stores in the area to draw the buyers, the Professor seemed to do a fairly good business with out-of-town collectors; but his local trade was very small. It was said that he sold items that were used, but not antique, very cheaply, but even for grown-ups the prospect of a bargain was often not enough to offset the discomfort of the old man’s stony stare.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was one day early in a recent September that the Professor happened to be the only witness to the very beginning of the Egypt Game. He had been looking for something in a seldom used storeroom at the back of his shop, when a slight noise drew him to a window. He lifted a gunnysack curtain, rubbed a peephole in the thick coating of dirt, and peered through. Outside that particular window was a small storage yard surrounded by a high board fence. It had been years since the Professor had made any use of the area, and the weedgrown yard and open lean-to shed were empty except for a few pieces of forgotten junk. But as the old man peered through his dirty window, two girls were pulling a much smaller boy through a hole in the fence.</p>

          <strong>The Egypt Game&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Zilpha Keatley Snyder&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>NOT LONG AGO IN A LARGE UNIVERSITY TOWN IN California, on a street called Orchard Avenue, a strange old man ran a dusty shabby store. Above the dirty show windows a faded peeling sign said:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A-Z ANTIQUES</p>
        <p>CURIOS</p>
        <p>USED MERCHANDISE</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Nobody knew for sure what the A-Z meant. Perhaps it referred to the fact that all sorts of strange things—everything from A to Z—were sold in the store. Or perhaps it had something to do with the owner’s name. However, no one seemed to know for sure what his name actually was. It was all part of a mysterious uncertainty about even the smallest item of public information about the old man. Nobody seemed certain, for instance, just why he was known as the Professor.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The neighbourhood surrounding the Professor’s store was made up of inexpensive apartment houses, little family-owned shops, and small, aging homes. The people of the area, many of whom had some connection with the university, could trace their ancestors to every continent, and just about every country in the world.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There were dozens of children in the neighbourhood; boys and girls of every size and style and colour, some of whom could speak more than one language when they wanted to. But in their schools and on the streets they all seemed to speak the same language and to have a number of things in common. And one of the things they had in common, at that time, was a vague and mysterious fear of the old man called the Professor.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Just what was so dangerous about the Professor was uncertain, like everything else about him, but his appearance undoubtedly had something to do with the rumors. He was tall and bent and his thin beard straggled up his cheeks like dry moss on gray rocks. His eyes were dark and expressionless, and set so deep under heavy brows that from a distance they looked like dark empty holes. And, from a distance was the only way that most of the children of Orchard Avenue cared to see them. The Professor lived somewhere at the back of his dingy store, and when he came out to stand in the sun in his doorway, smaller children would cross the street if they had to walk by.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now and then, older and braver boys, inspired by the old man’s strangeness, would dare each other into an attempt to tease or torment him—but not for long. Their absolute failure to get any sort of a reaction from their victim was not only discouraging, it was weird enough to spoil the fun for even the bravest of bullies.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Since there were several antique stores in the area to draw the buyers, the Professor seemed to do a fairly good business with out-of-town collectors; but his local trade was very small. It was said that he sold items that were used, but not antique, very cheaply, but even for grown-ups the prospect of a bargain was often not enough to offset the discomfort of the old man’s stony stare.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was one day early in a recent September that the Professor happened to be the only witness to the very beginning of the Egypt Game. He had been looking for something in a seldom used storeroom at the back of his shop, when a slight noise drew him to a window. He lifted a gunnysack curtain, rubbed a peephole in the thick coating of dirt, and peered through. Outside that particular window was a small storage yard surrounded by a high board fence. It had been years since the Professor had made any use of the area, and the weedgrown yard and open lean-to shed were empty except for a few pieces of forgotten junk.

          <strong>The Egypt Game&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Zilpha Keatley Snyder&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>NOT LONG AGO IN A LARGE UNIVERSITY TOWN IN California, on a street called Orchard Avenue, a strange old man ran a dusty shabby store. Above the dirty show windows a faded peeling sign said:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A-Z ANTIQUES</p>
        <p>CURIOS</p>
        <p>USED MERCHANDISE</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Nobody knew for sure what the A-Z meant. Perhaps it referred to the fact that all sorts of strange things—everything from A to Z—were sold in the store. Or perhaps it had something to do with the owner’s name. However, no one seemed to know for sure what his name actually was. It was all part of a mysterious uncertainty about even the smallest item of public information about the old man. Nobody seemed certain, for instance, just why he was known as the Professor.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The neighbourhood surrounding the Professor’s store was made up of inexpensive apartment houses, little family-owned shops, and small, aging homes. The people of the area, many of whom had some connection with the university, could trace their ancestors to every continent, and just about every country in the world.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There were dozens of children in the neighbourhood; boys and girls of every size and style and colour, some of whom could speak more than one language when they wanted to. But in their schools and on the streets they all seemed to speak the same language and to have a number of things in common. And one of the things they had in common, at that time, was a vague and mysterious fear of the old man called the Professor.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Just what was so dangerous about the Professor was uncertain, like everything else about him, but his appearance undoubtedly had something to do with the rumors. He was tall and bent and his thin beard straggled up his cheeks like dry moss on gray rocks. His eyes were dark and expressionless, and set so deep under heavy brows that from a distance they looked like dark empty holes. And, from a distance was the only way that most of the children of Orchard Avenue cared to see them. The Professor lived somewhere at the back of his dingy store, and when he came out to stand in the sun in his doorway, smaller children would cross the street if they had to walk by.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now and then, older and braver boys, inspired by the old man’s strangeness, would dare each other into an attempt to tease or torment him—but not for long. Their absolute failure to get any sort of a reaction from their victim was not only discouraging, it was weird enough to spoil the fun for even the bravest of bullies.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Since there were several antique stores in the area to draw the buyers, the Professor seemed to do a fairly good business with out-of-town collectors; but his local trade was very small. It was said that he sold items that were used, but not antique, very cheaply, but even for grown-ups the prospect of a bargain was often not enough to offset the discomfort of the old man’s stony stare.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was one day early in a recent September that the Professor happened to be the only witness to the very beginning of the Egypt Game. He had been looking for something in a seldom used storeroom at the back of his shop, when a slight noise drew him to a window. He lifted a gunnysack curtain, rubbed a peephole in the thick coating of dirt, and peered through. Outside that particular window was a small storage yard surrounded by a high board fence. It had been years since the Professor had made any use of the area, and the weedgrown yard and open lean-to shed were empty except for a few pieces of forgotten junk. But as the old man peered through his dirty window, two girls were pulling a much smaller boy through a hole in the fence.</p>
