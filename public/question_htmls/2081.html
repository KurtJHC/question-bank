        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> The woodpecker finch is a bird that eats insects that live deep in the cracks of tree bark. The bird uses a small stick or a cactus thorn as a tool to reach the insects. It holds the stick or thorn in its beak and pushes out bugs to eat for supper.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> The Egyptian vulture uses stones to help it eat ostrich eggs. The eggshells are too hard for the bird to open with its beak. When the vulture finds an egg, it looks for a stone. Then the bird uses its beak to throw the stone at the egg. The vulture will throw the stone again and again until the egg cracks open. It would be hard for the Egyptian vulture to eat ostrich eggs without the aid of stones.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4 </strong></em>Stones are essential tools for other animals, too. Sea otters like to eat clams, which live inside hard shells. However, it would be difficult for sea otters to eat clams without the help of stones. First a sea otter dives into the water for a clam. Then it dives again for a stone. As the otter floats on its back in the water, it puts the stone on its chest. Then it bangs the clam against the stone until the shell cracks open. Finally the otter digs out the meat inside with its paws and eats it.</p>

        <p><em><strong>5 </strong></em>Some insects use leaves to help them get food. Scientists have studied a kind of ant that uses leaves as a shopping bag. The ants put pieces of fruit on the leaves. They use the leaves to help them carry the pieces of fruit back to their nest. The leaves soak up the juice from the fruit. Then the ants eat the fruit and the leaves, too.</p>

        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> The heat in Africa can cause an elephant’s skin to itch. Elephants have learned that sticks and branches are good for scratching. If an elephant has an itch, it picks up a stick with its trunk. Then it stretches its trunk over its head to scratch itself.</p>

Finally the otter digs out the meat inside with its paws and eats it.</p>

        <p><strong>Tools for Animals and Insects</strong><br><br><em><strong>1</strong></em> Have &nbsp;you &nbsp;ever &nbsp;seen &nbsp;an &nbsp;ant’s shopping bag? How about an elephant’s back scratcher? Scientists have learned that some animals use things they find in nature as tools. These tools help them with many jobs.</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>Mealtime Helpers</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> The woodpecker finch is a bird that eats insects that live deep in the cracks of tree bark. The bird uses a small stick or a cactus thorn as a tool to reach the insects. It holds the stick or thorn in its beak and pushes out bugs to eat for supper.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> The Egyptian vulture uses stones to help it eat ostrich eggs. The eggshells are too hard for the bird to open with its beak. When the vulture finds an egg, it looks for a stone. Then the bird uses its beak to throw the stone at the egg. The vulture will throw the stone again and again until the egg cracks open. It would be hard for the Egyptian vulture to eat ostrich eggs without the aid of stones.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4 </strong></em>Stones are essential tools for other animals, too. Sea otters like to eat clams, which live inside hard shells. However, it would be difficult for sea otters to eat clams without the help of stones. First a sea otter dives into the water for a clam. Then it dives again for a stone. As the otter floats on its back in the water, it puts the stone on its chest. Then it bangs the clam against the stone until the shell cracks open. Finally the otter digs out the meat inside with its paws and eats it.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>5 </strong></em>Some insects use leaves to help them get food. Scientists have studied a kind of ant that uses leaves as a shopping bag. The ants put pieces of fruit on the leaves. They use the leaves to help them carry the pieces of fruit back to their nest. The leaves soak up the juice from the fruit. Then the ants eat the fruit and the leaves, too.</p>

          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>Scratching and Washing</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em>&nbsp;Mealtime isn’t the only time that&nbsp;animals use tools. Many animals use things around them to help solve problems throughout the day.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> The heat in Africa can cause an elephant’s skin to itch. Elephants have learned that sticks and branches are good for scratching. If an elephant has an itch, it picks up a stick with its trunk. Then it stretches its trunk over its head to scratch itself.</p>
        <p>

        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> Chimpanzees&nbsp; &nbsp;have&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;found&nbsp; &nbsp;an unusual &nbsp; &nbsp;way to stay clean. A chimpanzee makes a sponge out of leaves. The leaves &nbsp;are like paper towels and soak up water. The chimpanzee uses the damp leaves like a wet washcloth. It &nbsp;wipes off mud or sticky fruit juice from its body.</p>

          <strong>Fossil Find</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> The rain had finally slowed down. “It’s about time,” Clay Reyna thought. This place was not like sunny California at all. He had lived on this ranch for only a few weeks, but already he didn’t like it. He hadn’t made any friends at school. All it seemed to do here was rain.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> It was Saturday afternoon, and Clay was bored. When the rain finally stopped, he decided to go outside and walk around. It had rained so hard for so long. Clay could see that water had washed away a <span class="txt-underline"><strong>layer</strong></span> of dirt. Rocks that had been covered with dirt now poked out. The top part of the ground had been washed away.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> As Clay walked along, he saw a rock with an unusual shape. He carefully dug the rock out of the ground. He had to use both hands to pick it up. It was shaped like a cone. “This looks like a shell or a giant snail,” Clay thought, “except that it’s rock.” Puzzled, he decided to take it to school on Monday. His teacher Miss Shaw could probably tell him more about it.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> “Where did you find this?” Miss Shaw asked excitedly when Clay showed her the rock at school. When he told her where he had found it, Miss Shaw’s face lit up. “May I keep this for a day or two?” she asked. “I promise to give it back.” Clay agreed.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> That night at home, the phone rang. After a few minutes Clay’s mother came into his room.</p>
        <p><strong><em>6</em></strong> “That was Miss Shaw. She wanted to know whether we would let her bring your class to our ranch on Friday,” Clay’s mother said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> “Really?” Clay asked, a little excited. It would be neat to have a field trip at his house.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “Miss Shaw said she took your rock to the college in town. She found out that the rock is really a fossil of a shell. She wants your &nbsp;class to look for more fossils. I told her we would love to have your class here,” Clay’s mother said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> The next day at school, Miss Shaw announced to the class, “I’m going to change our science lessons for this week. We’re going on a fossil hunt. Clay’s parents are going to let us look around their ranch. We’re going to look for fossils like the one Clay found. I asked the principal, and she has <span class="txt-underline"><strong>approved</strong></span> our field trip for this Friday. But before we go, I want all of you to learn more about fossils.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, Clay and his classmates studied fossils. They learned that fossils are signs of life from long ago. Fossils can be a deep print of a leaf, branch, or an animal’s foot in a rock. Fossils can also be bones or shells that have turned into rock over the years. By studying fossils, people can learn about the plants and animals that once lived on Earth. They also can learn about the changes that have occurred in weather, water, and land. These changes have taken place over many years.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> Finally it was Friday morning. Clay’s class, Miss Shaw, and several parents rode a school bus to the Reynas’ ranch. Miss Shaw picked up a stone as soon as she got off the bus. “This might have been a clam once,” she said, holding up a fat heart-shaped rock.</p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> Several students gathered around her to look at the rock. Knowing what to look for, they found three more just like it. All the students started talking and walking around together. After about an hour of searching, Clay found a piece of flat, smooth stone with what looked like a leaf printed on it. One of the other students found a gray stone with the perfect fan shape of a seashell on it.</p>
        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> Miss Shaw finally announced it was time to go. Disappointed, the students got back onto the bus. A few students approached Clay when they arrived back at school.</p>
        <p><em><strong>14</strong></em> “Do you think it would be O.K. if we came back to your ranch tomorrow?” one of the girls from Clay’s class asked. “We could look for more fossils.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>15</strong></em> Clay thought that it would be great. He nodded his head thoughtfully. Maybe this place wasn’t so bad after all.</p>

          <strong>Fossil Find</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> The rain had finally slowed down. “It’s about time,” Clay Reyna thought. This place was not like sunny California at all. He had lived on this ranch for only a few weeks, but already he didn’t like it. He hadn’t made any friends at school. All it seemed to do here was rain.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> It was Saturday afternoon, and Clay was bored. When the rain finally stopped, he decided to go outside and walk around. It had rained so hard for so long. Clay could see that water had washed away a <span class="txt-underline"><strong>layer</strong></span> of dirt. Rocks that had been covered with dirt now poked out. The top part of the ground had been washed away.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> As Clay walked along, he saw a rock with an unusual shape. He carefully dug the rock out of the ground. He had to use both hands to pick it up. It was shaped like a cone. “This looks like a shell or a giant snail,” Clay thought, “except that it’s rock.” Puzzled, he decided to take it to school on Monday. His teacher Miss Shaw could probably tell him more about it.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> “Where did you find this?” Miss Shaw asked excitedly when Clay showed her the rock at school. When he told her where he had found it, Miss Shaw’s face lit up. “May I keep this for a day or two?” she asked. “I promise to give it back.” Clay agreed.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> That night at home, the phone rang. After a few minutes Clay’s mother came into his room.</p>
        <p><strong><em>6</em></strong> “That was Miss Shaw. She wanted to know whether we would let her bring your class to our ranch on Friday,” Clay’s mother said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> “Really?” Clay asked, a little excited. It would be neat to have a field trip at his house.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “Miss Shaw said she took your rock to the college in town. She found out that the rock is really a fossil of a shell. She wants your &nbsp;class to look for more fossils. I told her we would love to have your class here,” Clay’s mother said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> The next day at school, Miss Shaw announced to the class, “I’m going to change our science lessons for this week. We’re going on a fossil hunt. Clay’s parents are going to let us look around their ranch. We’re going to look for fossils like the one Clay found. I asked the principal, and she has <span class="txt-underline"><strong>approved</strong></span> our field trip for this Friday. But before we go, I want all of you to learn more about fossils.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, Clay and his classmates studied fossils. They learned that fossils are signs of life from long ago. Fossils can be a deep print of a leaf, branch, or an animal’s foot in a rock. Fossils can also be bones or shells that have turned into rock over the years. By studying fossils, people can learn about the plants and animals that once lived on Earth. They also can learn about the changes that have occurred in weather, water, and land. These changes have taken place over many years.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> Finally it was Friday morning. Clay’s class, Miss Shaw, and several parents rode a school bus to the Reynas’ ranch. Miss Shaw picked up a stone as soon as she got off the bus. “This might have been a clam once,” she said, holding up a fat heart-shaped rock.</p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> Several students gathered around her to look at the rock. Knowing what to look for, they found three more just like it. All the students started talking and walking around together. After about an hour of searching, Clay found a piece of flat, smooth stone with what looked like a leaf printed on it. One of the other students found a gray stone with the perfect fan shape of a seashell on it.</p>
        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> Miss Shaw finally announced it was time to go. Disappointed, the students got back onto the bus. A few students approached Clay when they arrived back at school.</p>
        <p><em><strong>14</strong></em> “Do you think it would be O.K. if we came back to your ranch tomorrow?” one of the girls from Clay’s class asked. “We could look for more fossils.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>15</strong></em> Clay thought that it would be great. He nodded his head thoughtfully. Maybe this place wasn’t so bad after all.</p>

          <strong>Fossil Find</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> The rain had finally slowed down. “It’s about time,” Clay Reyna thought. This place was not like sunny California at all. He had lived on this ranch for only a few weeks, but already he didn’t like it. He hadn’t made any friends at school. All it seemed to do here was rain.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> It was Saturday afternoon, and Clay was bored. When the rain finally stopped, he decided to go outside and walk around. It had rained so hard for so long. Clay could see that water had washed away a <span class="txt-underline"><strong>layer</strong></span> of dirt. Rocks that had been covered with dirt now poked out. The top part of the ground had been washed away.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> As Clay walked along, he saw a rock with an unusual shape. He carefully dug the rock out of the ground. He had to use both hands to pick it up. It was shaped like a cone. “This looks like a shell or a giant snail,” Clay thought, “except that it’s rock.” Puzzled, he decided to take it to school on Monday. His teacher Miss Shaw could probably tell him more about it.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> “Where did you find this?” Miss Shaw asked excitedly when Clay showed her the rock at school. When he told her where he had found it, Miss Shaw’s face lit up. “May I keep this for a day or two?” she asked. “I promise to give it back.” Clay agreed.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> That night at home, the phone rang. After a few minutes Clay’s mother came into his room.</p>
        <p><strong><em>6</em></strong> “That was Miss Shaw. She wanted to know whether we would let her bring your class to our ranch on Friday,” Clay’s mother said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> “Really?” Clay asked, a little excited. It would be neat to have a field trip at his house.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “Miss Shaw said she took your rock to the college in town. She found out that the rock is really a fossil of a shell. She wants your &nbsp;class to look for more fossils. I told her we would love to have your class here,” Clay’s mother said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> The next day at school, Miss Shaw announced to the class, “I’m going to change our science lessons for this week. We’re going on a fossil hunt. Clay’s parents are going to let us look around their ranch. We’re going to look for fossils like the one Clay found. I asked the principal, and she has <span class="txt-underline"><strong>approved</strong></span> our field trip for this Friday. But before we go, I want all of you to learn more about fossils.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, Clay and his classmates studied fossils. They learned that fossils are signs of life from long ago. Fossils can be a deep print of a leaf, branch, or an animal’s foot in a rock. Fossils can also be bones or shells that have turned into rock over the years. By studying fossils, people can learn about the plants and animals that once lived on Earth. They also can learn about the changes that have occurred in weather, water, and land. These changes have taken place over many years.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> Finally it was Friday morning. Clay’s class, Miss Shaw, and several parents rode a school bus to the Reynas’ ranch. Miss Shaw picked up a stone as soon as she got off the bus. “This might have been a clam once,” she said, holding up a fat heart-shaped rock.</p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> Several students gathered around her to look at the rock. Knowing what to look for, they found three more just like it. All the students started talking and walking around together. After about an hour of searching, Clay found a piece of flat, smooth stone with what looked like a leaf printed on it. One of the other students found a gray stone with the perfect fan shape of a seashell on it.</p>
        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> Miss Shaw finally announced it was time to go. Disappointed, the students got back onto the bus. A few students approached Clay when they arrived back at school.</p>
        <p><em><strong>14</strong></em> “Do you think it would be O.K. if we came back to your ranch tomorrow?” one of the girls from Clay’s class asked. “We could look for more fossils.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>15</strong></em> Clay thought that it would be great. He nodded his head thoughtfully. Maybe this place wasn’t so bad after all.</p>

          <strong>Fossil Find</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> The rain had finally slowed down. “It’s about time,” Clay Reyna thought. This place was not like sunny California at all. He had lived on this ranch for only a few weeks, but already he didn’t like it. He hadn’t made any friends at school. All it seemed to do here was rain.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> It was Saturday afternoon, and Clay was bored. When the rain finally stopped, he decided to go outside and walk around. It had rained so hard for so long. Clay could see that water had washed away a <span class="txt-underline"><strong>layer</strong></span> of dirt. Rocks that had been covered with dirt now poked out. The top part of the ground had been washed away.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> As Clay walked along, he saw a rock with an unusual shape. He carefully dug the rock out of the ground. He had to use both hands to pick it up. It was shaped like a cone. “This looks like a shell or a giant snail,” Clay thought, “except that it’s rock.” Puzzled, he decided to take it to school on Monday. His teacher Miss Shaw could probably tell him more about it.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> “Where did you find this?” Miss Shaw asked excitedly when Clay showed her the rock at school. When he told her where he had found it, Miss Shaw’s face lit up. “May I keep this for a day or two?” she asked. “I promise to give it back.” Clay agreed.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> That night at home, the phone rang. After a few minutes Clay’s mother came into his room.</p>
        <p><strong><em>6</em></strong> “That was Miss Shaw. She wanted to know whether we would let her bring your class to our ranch on Friday,” Clay’s mother said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> “Really?” Clay asked, a little excited. It would be neat to have a field trip at his house.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “Miss Shaw said she took your rock to the college in town. She found out that the rock is really a fossil of a shell. She wants your &nbsp;class to look for more fossils. I told her we would love to have your class here,” Clay’s mother said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> The next day at school, Miss Shaw announced to the class, “I’m going to change our science lessons for this week. We’re going on a fossil hunt. Clay’s parents are going to let us look around their ranch. We’re going to look for fossils like the one Clay found. I asked the principal, and she has <span class="txt-underline"><strong>approved</strong></span> our field trip for this Friday. But before we go, I want all of you to learn more about fossils.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, Clay and his classmates studied fossils. They learned that fossils are signs of life from long ago. Fossils can be a deep print of a leaf, branch, or an animal’s foot in a rock. Fossils can also be bones or shells that have turned into rock over the years. By studying fossils, people can learn about the plants and animals that once lived on Earth. They also can learn about the changes that have occurred in weather, water, and land. These changes have taken place over many years.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> Finally it was Friday morning. Clay’s class, Miss Shaw, and several parents rode a school bus to the Reynas’ ranch. Miss Shaw picked up a stone as soon as she got off the bus. “This might have been a clam once,” she said, holding up a fat heart-shaped rock.</p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> Several students gathered around her to look at the rock. Knowing what to look for, they found three more just like it. All the students started talking and walking around together. After about an hour of searching, Clay found a piece of flat, smooth stone with what looked like a leaf printed on it. One of the other students found a gray stone with the perfect fan shape of a seashell on it.</p>
        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> Miss Shaw finally announced it was time to go. Disappointed, the students got back onto the bus. A few students approached Clay when they arrived back at school.</p>
        <p><em><strong>14</strong></em> “Do you think it would be O.K. if we came back to your ranch tomorrow?” one of the girls from Clay’s class asked. “We could look for more fossils.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>15</strong></em> Clay thought that it would be great. He nodded his head thoughtfully. Maybe this place wasn’t so bad after all.</p>

          <strong>Fossil Find</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> The rain had finally slowed down. “It’s about time,” Clay Reyna thought. This place was not like sunny California at all. He had lived on this ranch for only a few weeks, but already he didn’t like it. He hadn’t made any friends at school. All it seemed to do here was rain.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> It was Saturday afternoon, and Clay was bored. When the rain finally stopped, he decided to go outside and walk around. It had rained so hard for so long. Clay could see that water had washed away a <span class="txt-underline"><strong>layer</strong></span> of dirt. Rocks that had been covered with dirt now poked out. The top part of the ground had been washed away.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> As Clay walked along, he saw a rock with an unusual shape. He carefully dug the rock out of the ground. He had to use both hands to pick it up. It was shaped like a cone. “This looks like a shell or a giant snail,” Clay thought, “except that it’s rock.” Puzzled, he decided to take it to school on Monday. His teacher Miss Shaw could probably tell him more about it.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> “Where did you find this?” Miss Shaw asked excitedly when Clay showed her the rock at school. When he told her where he had found it, Miss Shaw’s face lit up. “May I keep this for a day or two?” she asked. “I promise to give it back.” Clay agreed.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> That night at home, the phone rang. After a few minutes Clay’s mother came into his room.</p>
        <p><strong><em>6</em></strong> “That was Miss Shaw. She wanted to know whether we would let her bring your class to our ranch on Friday,” Clay’s mother said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> “Really?” Clay asked, a little excited. It would be neat to have a field trip at his house.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “Miss Shaw said she took your rock to the college in town. She found out that the rock is really a fossil of a shell. She wants your &nbsp;class to look for more fossils. I told her we would love to have your class here,” Clay’s mother said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> The next day at school, Miss Shaw announced to the class, “I’m going to change our science lessons for this week. We’re going on a fossil hunt. Clay’s parents are going to let us look around their ranch. We’re going to look for fossils like the one Clay found. I asked the principal, and she has <span class="txt-underline"><strong>approved</strong></span> our field trip for this Friday. But before we go, I want all of you to learn more about fossils.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, Clay and his classmates studied fossils. They learned that fossils are signs of life from long ago. Fossils can be a deep print of a leaf, branch, or an animal’s foot in a rock. Fossils can also be bones or shells that have turned into rock over the years. By studying fossils, people can learn about the plants and animals that once lived on Earth. They also can learn about the changes that have occurred in weather, water, and land. These changes have taken place over many years.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> Finally it was Friday morning. Clay’s class, Miss Shaw, and several parents rode a school bus to the Reynas’ ranch. Miss Shaw picked up a stone as soon as she got off the bus. “This might have been a clam once,” she said, holding up a fat heart-shaped rock.</p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> Several students gathered around her to look at the rock. Knowing what to look for, they found three more just like it. All the students started talking and walking around together. After about an hour of searching, Clay found a piece of flat, smooth stone with what looked like a leaf printed on it. One of the other students found a gray stone with the perfect fan shape of a seashell on it.</p>
        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> Miss Shaw finally announced it was time to go. Disappointed, the students got back onto the bus. A few students approached Clay when they arrived back at school.</p>
        <p><em><strong>14</strong></em> “Do you think it would be O.K. if we came back to your ranch tomorrow?” one of the girls from Clay’s class asked. “We could look for more fossils.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>15</strong></em> Clay thought that it would be great. He nodded his head thoughtfully. Maybe this place wasn’t so bad after all.</p>

        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> The rain had finally slowed down. “It’s about time,” Clay Reyna thought. This place was not like sunny California at all. He had lived on this ranch for only a few weeks, but already he didn’t like it. He hadn’t made any friends at school. All it seemed to do here was rain.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> It was Saturday afternoon, and Clay was bored. When the rain finally stopped, he decided to go outside and walk around. It had rained so hard for so long. Clay could see that water had washed away a <span class="txt-underline"><strong>layer</strong></span> of dirt. Rocks that had been covered with dirt now poked out. The top part of the ground had been washed away.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> As Clay walked along, he saw a rock with an unusual shape. He carefully dug the rock out of the ground. He had to use both hands to pick it up. It was shaped like a cone. “This looks like a shell or a giant snail,” Clay thought, “except that it’s rock.” Puzzled, he decided to take it to school on Monday. His teacher Miss Shaw could probably tell him more about it.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> “Where did you find this?” Miss Shaw asked excitedly when Clay showed her the rock at school. When he told her where he had found it, Miss Shaw’s face lit up. “May I keep this for a day or two?” she asked. “I promise to give it back.” Clay agreed.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> That night at home, the phone rang. After a few minutes Clay’s mother came into his room.</p>
        <p><strong><em>6</em></strong> “That was Miss Shaw. She wanted to know whether we would let her bring your class to our ranch on Friday,” Clay’s mother said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> “Really?” Clay asked, a little excited. It would be neat to have a field trip at his house.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “Miss Shaw said she took your rock to the college in town. She found out that the rock is really a fossil of a shell. She wants your &nbsp;class to look for more fossils. I told her we would love to have your class here,” Clay’s mother said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> The next day at school, Miss Shaw announced to the class, “I’m going to change our science lessons for this week. We’re going on a fossil hunt. Clay’s parents are going to let us look around their ranch. We’re going to look for fossils like the one Clay found. I asked the principal, and she has <span class="txt-underline"><strong>approved</strong></span> our field trip for this Friday. But before we go, I want all of you to learn more about fossils.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, Clay and his classmates studied fossils. They learned that fossils are signs of life from long ago. Fossils can be a deep print of a leaf, branch, or an animal’s foot in a rock. Fossils can also be bones or shells that have turned into rock over the years. By studying fossils, people can learn about the plants and animals that once lived on Earth. They also can learn about the changes that have occurred in weather, water, and land. These changes have taken place over many years.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> Finally it was Friday morning. Clay’s class, Miss Shaw, and several parents rode a school bus to the Reynas’ ranch. Miss Shaw picked up a stone as soon as she got off the bus. “This might have been a clam once,” she said, holding up a fat heart-shaped rock.</p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> Several students gathered around her to look at the rock. Knowing what to look for, they found three more just like it. All the students started talking and walking around together. After about an hour of searching, Clay found a piece of flat, smooth stone with what looked like a leaf printed on it. One of the other students found a gray stone with the perfect fan shape of a seashell on it.</p>
        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> Miss Shaw finally announced it was time to go. Disappointed, the students got back onto the bus. A few students approached Clay when they arrived back at school.</p>
        <p><em><strong>14</strong></em> “Do you think it would be O.K. if we came back to your ranch tomorrow?” one of the girls from Clay’s class asked. “We could look for more fossils.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>15</strong></em> Clay thought that it would be great. He nodded his head thoughtfully. Maybe this place wasn’t so bad after all.</p>

        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “Miss Shaw said she took your rock to the college in town. She found out that the rock is really a fossil of a shell. She wants your &nbsp;class to look for more fossils. I told her we would love to have your class here,” Clay’s mother said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> The next day at school, Miss Shaw announced to the class, “I’m going to change our science lessons for this week. We’re going on a fossil hunt. Clay’s parents are going to let us look around their ranch. We’re going to look for fossils like the one Clay found. I asked the principal, and she has <span class="txt-underline"><strong>approved</strong></span> our field trip for this Friday. But before we go, I want all of you to learn more about fossils.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, Clay and his classmates studied fossils. They learned that fossils are signs of life from long ago. Fossils can be a deep print of a leaf, branch, or an animal’s foot in a rock. Fossils can also be bones or shells that have turned into rock over the years. By studying fossils, people can learn about the plants and animals that once lived on Earth. They also can learn about the changes that have occurred in weather, water, and land. These changes have taken place over many years.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> Finally it was Friday morning. Clay’s class, Miss Shaw, and several parents rode a school bus to the Reynas’ ranch. Miss Shaw picked up a stone as soon as she got off the bus. “This might have been a clam once,” she said, holding up a fat heart-shaped rock.</p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> Several students gathered around her to look at the rock. Knowing what to look for, they found three more just like it. All the students started talking and walking around together. After about an hour of searching, Clay found a piece of flat, smooth stone with what looked like a leaf printed on it. One of the other students found a gray stone with the perfect fan shape of a seashell on it.</p>
        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> Miss Shaw finally announced it was time to go. Disappointed, the students got back onto the bus. A few students approached Clay when they arrived back at school.</p>
        <p><em><strong>14</strong></em> “Do you think it would be O.K. if we came back to your ranch tomorrow?” one of the girls from Clay’s class asked. “We could look for more fossils.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>15</strong></em> Clay thought that it would be great. He nodded his head thoughtfully. Maybe this place wasn’t so bad after all.</p>

          <strong>Fossil Find</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> The rain had finally slowed down. “It’s about time,” Clay Reyna thought. This place was not like sunny California at all. He had lived on this ranch for only a few weeks, but already he didn’t like it. He hadn’t made any friends at school. All it seemed to do here was rain.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> It was Saturday afternoon, and Clay was bored. When the rain finally stopped, he decided to go outside and walk around. It had rained so hard for so long. Clay could see that water had washed away a <span class="txt-underline"><strong>layer</strong></span> of dirt. Rocks that had been covered with dirt now poked out. The top part of the ground had been washed away.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> As Clay walked along, he saw a rock with an unusual shape. He carefully dug the rock out of the ground. He had to use both hands to pick it up. It was shaped like a cone. “This looks like a shell or a giant snail,” Clay thought, “except that it’s rock.” Puzzled, he decided to take it to school on Monday. His teacher Miss Shaw could probably tell him more about it.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> “Where did you find this?” Miss Shaw asked excitedly when Clay showed her the rock at school. When he told her where he had found it, Miss Shaw’s face lit up. “May I keep this for a day or two?” she asked. “I promise to give it back.” Clay agreed.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> That night at home, the phone rang. After a few minutes Clay’s mother came into his room.</p>
        <p><strong><em>6</em></strong> “That was Miss Shaw. She wanted to know whether we would let her bring your class to our ranch on Friday,” Clay’s mother said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> “Really?” Clay asked, a little excited. It would be neat to have a field trip at his house.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “Miss Shaw said she took your rock to the college in town. She found out that the rock is really a fossil of a shell. She wants your &nbsp;class to look for more fossils. I told her we would love to have your class here,” Clay’s mother said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> The next day at school, Miss Shaw announced to the class, “I’m going to change our science lessons for this week. We’re going on a fossil hunt. Clay’s parents are going to let us look around their ranch. We’re going to look for fossils like the one Clay found. I asked the principal, and she has <span class="txt-underline"><strong>approved</strong></span> our field trip for this Friday. But before we go, I want all of you to learn more about fossils.”</p>

      <div class="col-6"><strong>Read this selection. Then answer the questions that follow it.</strong><br><br><strong>The Charro</strong><br><br><em>1</em> “I have bad news,” announced Mrs. Carrillo, the<br>
Spanish club’s sponsor. “ We’re nearly $ 1,000 short of the amount we need to take our trip to Mexico City next month.”<br>
<br>
<em>2</em> The club members groaned. Since the idea of going to Mexico had been brought up back in September, it had been an incentive to raise as much money as possible. They had hoped that their last fund-raiser, a dinner featuring enchiladas and other t raditional Mexican dishes, would provide the rest of the funds they needed. However, it had not brought in as much money as they had expected.<br>
<br>
<em>3</em> “How depressing,” Adrian said gloomily. “All year we’ve practiced our Spanish, and now there’s no way we’ll get to Mexico City.”<br>
<br>
<em>4</em> Marisol refused to give up so easily. “Look at us! We’re already thinking it’s hopeless. Don’t be so pessimistic! There has to b e a way to raise the money!” she said. “Everybody go home and think. Ask your parents, friends, and neighbors. Let’s meet again in two days to see whether anyone has a suggestion.”<br>
<br>
<em>5</em> After school Marisol decided to visit Grandpa Delgado at his ranch. Talking with him always made her problems seem smaller. Just being at the ranch made her feel better, so she went whenever she was <span class="txt-underline">agitated</span> about something. She knew she could rely on the land’s unchanging beauty.<br>
<br>
<em>6</em> Marisol found her grandfather in his old barn. “I guess we’ll need to pull this shabby old barn down pretty soon,” he said when he saw her. “It’s falling apart. It seems as if it <span class="txt-underline">deteriorated</span> overnight. Now that we’ve built a new barn, it’s just taking up space around here—like me, I suppose.” He sighed and looked around. “I built it right after I came to this country. It looks as though we’ve both just about outlived our usefulness.”<br>
<br>
<em>7</em> As Marisol watched him l ooking around the barn, s he got an idea. “ Grandpa, w asn’t there a theater group near here that used to perform in a barn?”<br>
<br>
<em>8</em> “Why, yes,” Grandpa Delgado said. “The Red Barn<br>
Players. They’re n ot around anymore. It was a good idea, performing in a barn. We don’t have fancy theaters around here like those you would find in a big city.”<br>
<br>
<em>9</em> “How many folding chairs do you think could fit in this barn?” Marisol asked.<br>
<br>
10 He wrinkled his brow and thought a moment. “Probably a hundred or so. Why?”<br>
<br>
<em>11</em> Marisol’s words came out in a rush. “I have an idea for how to earn money for my Spanish club. We could put on a play right here in your barn! If we gave two performances and if a hundred people came to each one and if tickets cost five dollars each . . .” She tapped her feet as she did the math in her head. “That’s $1,000!” she said triumphantly.<br>
<br>
<em>12</em> At their next meeting, Marisol’s f ellow club members liked the idea. Mrs. Carrillo said, “Marisol, why don’t you and Carlota find a play for us to perform. We need to decide on the play right away so we’ll have time to rehearse, build sets, make costumes, a nd advertise. In the meantime we can work on turning the barn into a temporary theater.”<br>
<br>
<em>13</em> Marisol and Carlota spent hours at the library looking for a play, but nothing seemed right. “ Here’s one about a zookeeper who discovers his gorilla can talk,” Carlota said.<br>
<br>
<em>14</em> Marisol shook her head. “None of these will work.<br>
They’re too short, and none of them has more than three roles,” she said.<br>
<br>
<em>15</em> “Besides,” added Carlota, “we should do a play that has something to do with Mexican culture.”<br>
<br>
<em>16</em> Marisol paused for a moment as an idea came to her. “I wrote a play for English class a few months ago about my grandpa when h e was a young charro, a Mexican cowboy. Would you like to see it?”<br>
<br>
<em>17</em> Carlota went home with Marisol and read the play.<br>
When Carlota finished reading, she turned to Marisol and said, “It’s perfect!”<br>
<br>
<em>18</em> The other club members liked it, too. P arts w ere<br>
assigned, and rehearsals began. Marisol didn’t have a part, but she helped with sets and costumes. Her whole family got involved to make sure the play was a success because they were proud of her. Marisol’s father put up posters on every telephone pole for miles around. Her older brother Ray, who attended college in a nearby town, promised t o bring a group of friends on opening night.<br>
<br>
<em>19</em> Before the play Mrs. Carrillo explained the purpose of the event and thanked the audience f or attending. Then the performance began. Marisol watched nervously from backstage. At one point Adrian, who was playing Marisol’s grandfather, had to sing an old Mexican folk song. He had a good voice, but he must have forgotten the words. Marisol listened in horror as his voice faded away, and the barn went silent.<br>
<br>
<em>20</em> Then another voice, deep and rich, took u p the song. Marisol peeked out at the audience and saw Grandpa Delgado. He had risen to his feet and was singing the song as she had heard him sing it many times. He turned to the rest of the crowd. “Sing along,” he invited them. “You know the words.” To Marisol’s amazement many of the older men and women joined in. Their voices swelled, reaching into every corner of the dark, dusty barn and transforming it into a place of wonder.<br>
<br>
<em>21</em> After t he p lay was over, Marisol helped count the profits. They had made more than $500. She felt sure that they would be able to reach their goal after the next day’s performance.<br>
<br>
<em>22</em> Grandpa Delgado came over to congratulate her. “I guess this old thing still has some life i n it after a ll,” he said with a wink.<br>
<br>
<em>23</em> “I always knew that it did, Grandpa,” Marisol said,<br>
winking back. The trip to Mexico City would be great, but nothing could ever replace Marisol’s happiness w hen she heard her grandfather’s strong voice ringing throughout the barn.<br>

<em>19</em> Before the play Mrs. Carrillo explained the purpose of the event and thanked the audience f or attending. Then the performance began. Marisol watched nervously from backstage. At one point Adrian, who was playing Marisol’s grandfather, had to sing an old Mexican folk song. He had a good voice, but he must have forgotten the words. Marisol listened in horror as his voice faded away, and the barn went silent.<br>
<br>
<em>20</em> Then another voice, deep and rich, took u p the song. Marisol peeked out at the audience and saw Grandpa Delgado. He had risen to his feet and was singing the song as she had heard him sing it many times. He turned to the rest of the crowd. “Sing along,” he invited them. “You know the words.” To Marisol’s amazement many of the older men and women joined in. Their voices swelled, reaching into every corner of the dark, dusty barn and transforming it into a place of wonder.<br>
<br>
<em>21</em> After t he p lay was over, Marisol helped count the profits. They had made more than $500. She felt sure that they would be able to reach their goal after the next day’s performance.<br>
<br>
<em>22</em> Grandpa Delgado came over to congratulate her. “I guess this old thing still has some life i n it after a ll,” he said with a wink.<br>
<br>
<em>23</em> “I always knew that it did, Grandpa,” Marisol said,<br>
winking back. The trip to Mexico City would be great, but nothing could ever replace Marisol’s happiness w hen she heard her grandfather’s strong voice ringing throughout the barn.<br>

Spanish club’s sponsor. “ We’re nearly $ 1,000 short of the amount we need to take our trip to Mexico City next month.”<br>
<br>
<em>2</em> The club members groaned. Since the idea of going to Mexico had been brought up back in September, it had been an incentive to raise as much money as possible. They had hoped that their last fund-raiser, a dinner featuring enchiladas and other t raditional Mexican dishes, would provide the rest of the funds they needed. However, it had not brought in as much money as they had expected.<br>
<br>
<em>3</em> “How depressing,” Adrian said gloomily. “All year we’ve practiced our Spanish, and now there’s no way we’ll get to Mexico City.”<br>
<br>
<em>4</em> Marisol refused to give up so easily. “Look at us! We’re already thinking it’s hopeless. Don’t be so pessimistic! There has to b e a way to raise the money!” she said. “Everybody go home and think. Ask your parents, friends, and neighbors. Let’s meet again in two days to see whether anyone has a suggestion.”<br>
<br>
<em>5</em> After school Marisol decided to visit Grandpa Delgado at his ranch. Talking with him always made her problems seem smaller. Just being at the ranch made her feel better, so she went whenever she was <span class="txt-underline">agitated</span> about something. She knew she could rely on the land’s unchanging beauty.<br>
<br>
<em>6</em> Marisol found her grandfather in his old barn. “I guess we’ll need to pull this shabby old barn down pretty soon,” he said when he saw her. “It’s falling apart. It seems as if it <span class="txt-underline">deteriorated</span> overnight. Now that we’ve built a new barn, it’s just taking up space around here—like me, I suppose.” He sighed and looked around. “I built it right after I came to this country. It looks as though we’ve both just about outlived our usefulness.”<br>
<br>
<em>7</em> As Marisol watched him l ooking around the barn, s he got an idea. “ Grandpa, w asn’t there a theater group near here that used to perform in a barn?”<br>
<br>
<em>8</em> “Why, yes,” Grandpa Delgado said. “The Red Barn<br>
Players. They’re n ot around anymore. It was a good idea, performing in a barn. We don’t have fancy theaters around here like those you would find in a big city.”<br>
<br>
<em>9</em> “How many folding chairs do you think could fit in this barn?” Marisol asked.<br>
<br>
<em>10</em> He wrinkled his brow and thought a moment. “Probably a hundred or so. Why?”<br>
<br>
<em>11</em> Marisol’s words came out in a rush. “I have an idea for how to earn money for my Spanish club. We could put on a play right here in your barn! If we gave two performances and if a hundred people came to each one and if tickets cost five dollars each . . .” She tapped her feet as she did the math in her head. “That’s $1,000!” she said triumphantly.<br>
<br>
<em>12</em> At their next meeting, Marisol’s f ellow club members liked the idea. Mrs. Carrillo said, “Marisol, why don’t you and Carlota find a play for us to perform. We need to decide on the play right away so we’ll have time to rehearse, build sets, make costumes, a nd advertise. In the meantime we can work on turning the barn into a temporary theater.”<br>
<br>
<em>13</em> Marisol and Carlota spent hours at the library looking for a play, but nothing seemed right. “ Here’s one about a zookeeper who discovers his gorilla can talk,” Carlota said.<br>
<br>
<em>14</em> Marisol shook her head. “None of these will work.<br>
They’re too short, and none of them has more than three roles,” she said.<br>
<br>
<em>15</em> “Besides,” added Carlota, “we should do a play that has something to do with Mexican culture.”<br>
<br>
<em>16</em> Marisol paused for a moment as an idea came to her. “I wrote a play for English class a few months ago about my grandpa when h e was a young charro, a Mexican cowboy. Would you like to see it?”<br>
<br>
<em>17</em> Carlota went home with Marisol and read the play.<br>
When Carlota finished reading, she turned to Marisol and said, “It’s perfect!”<br>
<br>
<em>18</em> The other club members liked it, too. P arts w ere<br>
assigned, and rehearsals began. Marisol didn’t have a part, but she helped with sets and costumes. Her whole family got involved to make sure the play was a success because they were proud of her. Marisol’s father put up posters on every telephone pole for miles around. Her older brother Ray, who attended college in a nearby town, promised t o bring a group of friends on opening night.<br>

Marisol’s father put up posters on every telephone pole for miles around. Her older brother Ray, who attended college in a nearby town, promised t o bring a group of friends on opening night.<br>
<br>
<em>19</em> Before the play Mrs. Carrillo explained the purpose of the event and thanked the audience f or attending. Then the performance began. Marisol watched nervously from backstage. At one point Adrian, who was playing Marisol’s grandfather, had to sing an old Mexican folk song. He had a good voice, but he must have forgotten the words. Marisol listened in horror as his voice faded away, and the barn went silent.<br>
<br>
<em>20</em> Then another voice, deep and rich, took u p the song. Marisol peeked out at the audience and saw Grandpa Delgado. He had risen to his feet and was singing the song as she had heard him sing it many times. He turned to the rest of the crowd. “Sing along,” he invited them. “You know the words.” To Marisol’s amazement many of the older men and women joined in. Their voices swelled, reaching into every corner of the dark, dusty barn and transforming it into a place of wonder.<br>
<br>
<em>21</em> After t he p lay was over, Marisol helped count the profits. They had made more than $500. She felt sure that they would be able to reach their goal after the next day’s performance.<br>
<br>
<em>22</em> Grandpa Delgado came over to congratulate her. “I guess this old thing still has some life i n it after a ll,” he said with a wink.<br>
<br>
<em>23</em> “I always knew that it did, Grandpa,” Marisol said,<br>
winking back. The trip to Mexico City would be great, but nothing could ever replace Marisol’s happiness w hen she heard her grandfather’s strong voice ringing throughout the barn.<br>

      <div class="col-6"><strong>Read this selection. Then answer the questions that follow it.</strong><br><br><strong>The Charro</strong><br><br><em>1</em> “I have bad news,” announced Mrs. Carrillo, the<br>
Spanish club’s sponsor. “ We’re nearly $ 1,000 short of the amount we need to take our trip to Mexico City next month.”<br>
<br>
<em>2</em> The club members groaned. Since the idea of going to Mexico had been brought up back in September, it had been an incentive to raise as much money as possible. They had hoped that their last fund-raiser, a dinner featuring enchiladas and other t raditional Mexican dishes, would provide the rest of the funds they needed. However, it had not brought in as much money as they had expected.<br>
<br>
<em>3</em> “How depressing,” Adrian said gloomily. “All year we’ve practiced our Spanish, and now there’s no way we’ll get to Mexico City.”<br>
<br>
<em>4</em> Marisol refused to give up so easily. “Look at us! We’re already thinking it’s hopeless. Don’t be so pessimistic! There has to b e a way to raise the money!” she said. “Everybody go home and think. Ask your parents, friends, and neighbors. Let’s meet again in two days to see whether anyone has a suggestion.”<br>
<br>
<em>5</em> After school Marisol decided to visit Grandpa Delgado at his ranch. Talking with him always made her problems seem smaller. Just being at the ranch made her feel better, so she went whenever she was <span class="txt-underline">agitated</span> about something. She knew she could rely on the land’s unchanging beauty.<br>
<br>
<em>6</em> Marisol found her grandfather in his old barn. “I guess we’ll need to pull this shabby old barn down pretty soon,” he said when he saw her. “It’s falling apart. It seems as if it <span class="txt-underline">deteriorated</span> overnight. Now that we’ve built a new barn, it’s just taking up space around here—like me, I suppose.” He sighed and looked around. “I built it right after I came to this country. It looks as though we’ve both just about outlived our usefulness.”<br>
<br>
<em>7</em> As Marisol watched him l ooking around the barn, s he got an idea. “ Grandpa, w asn’t there a theater group near here that used to perform in a barn?”<br>
<br>
<em>8</em> “Why, yes,” Grandpa Delgado said. “The Red Barn<br>
Players. They’re n ot around anymore. It was a good idea, performing in a barn. We don’t have fancy theaters around here like those you would find in a big city.”<br>
<br>
<em>9</em> “How many folding chairs do you think could fit in this barn?” Marisol asked.<br>
<br>
<em>10</em> He wrinkled his brow and thought a moment. “Probably a hundred or so. Why?”<br>
<br>
<em>11</em> Marisol’s words came out in a rush. “I have an idea for how to earn money for my Spanish club. We could put on a play right here in your barn! If we gave two performances and if a hundred people came to each one and if tickets cost five dollars each . . .” She tapped her feet as she did the math in her head. “That’s $1,000!” she said triumphantly.<br>
<br>
<em>12</em> At their next meeting, Marisol’s f ellow club members liked the idea. Mrs. Carrillo said, “Marisol, why don’t you and Carlota find a play for us to perform. We need to decide on the play right away so we’ll have time to rehearse, build sets, make costumes, a nd advertise. In the meantime we can work on turning the barn into a temporary theater.”<br>
<br>
<em>13</em> Marisol and Carlota spent hours at the library looking for a play, but nothing seemed right. “ Here’s one about a zookeeper who discovers his gorilla can talk,” Carlota said.<br>
<br>
<em>14</em> Marisol shook her head. “None of these will work.<br>
They’re too short, and none of them has more than three roles,” she said.<br>
<br>
<em>15</em> “Besides,” added Carlota, “we should do a play that has something to do with Mexican culture.”<br>
<br>
<em>16</em> Marisol paused for a moment as an idea came to her. “I wrote a play for English class a few months ago about my grandpa when h e was a young charro, a Mexican cowboy. Would you like to see it?”<br>
<br>
<em>17</em> Carlota went home with Marisol and read the play.<br>
When Carlota finished reading, she turned to Marisol and said, “It’s perfect!”<br>
<br>
<em>18</em> The other club members liked it, too. P arts w ere<br>
assigned, and rehearsals began. Marisol didn’t have a part, but she helped with sets and costumes. Her whole family got involved to make sure the play was a success because they were proud of her.

<em>19</em> Before the play Mrs. Carrillo explained the purpose of the event and thanked the audience f or attending. Then the performance began. Marisol watched nervously from backstage. At one point Adrian, who was playing Marisol’s grandfather, had to sing an old Mexican folk song. He had a good voice, but he must have forgotten the words. Marisol listened in horror as his voice faded away, and the barn went silent.<br>
<br>
<em>20</em> Then another voice, deep and rich, took u p the song. Marisol peeked out at the audience and saw Grandpa Delgado. He had risen to his feet and was singing the song as she had heard him sing it many times. He turned to the rest of the crowd. “Sing along,” he invited them. “You know the words.” To Marisol’s amazement many of the older men and women joined in. Their voices swelled, reaching into every corner of the dark, dusty barn and transforming it into a place of wonder.<br>
<br>
<em>21</em> After t he p lay was over, Marisol helped count the profits. They had made more than $500. She felt sure that they would be able to reach their goal after the next day’s performance.<br>
<br>
<em>22</em> Grandpa Delgado came over to congratulate her. “I guess this old thing still has some life i n it after a ll,” he said with a wink.<br>
<br>
<em>23</em> “I always knew that it did, Grandpa,” Marisol said,<br>
winking back. The trip to Mexico City would be great, but nothing could ever replace Marisol’s happiness w hen she heard her grandfather’s strong voice ringing throughout the barn.<br>

      <div class="col-6"><strong>Read this selection. Then answer the questions that follow it.</strong><br><br><strong>The Charro</strong><br><br><em>1</em> “I have bad news,” announced Mrs. Carrillo, the<br>
Spanish club’s sponsor. “ We’re nearly $ 1,000 short of the amount we need to take our trip to Mexico City next month.”<br>
<br>
<em>2</em> The club members groaned. Since the idea of going to Mexico had been brought up back in September, it had been an incentive to raise as much money as possible. They had hoped that their last fund-raiser, a dinner featuring enchiladas and other t raditional Mexican dishes, would provide the rest of the funds they needed. However, it had not brought in as much money as they had expected.<br>
<br>
<em>3 </em>“How depressing,” Adrian said gloomily. “All year we’ve practiced our Spanish, and now there’s no way we’ll get to Mexico City.”<br>
<br>
<em>4</em> Marisol refused to give up so easily. “Look at us! We’re already thinking it’s hopeless. Don’t be so pessimistic! There has to b e a way to raise the money!” she said. “Everybody go home and think. Ask your parents, friends, and neighbors. Let’s meet again in two days to see whether anyone has a suggestion.”<br>
<br>
5 After school Marisol decided to visit Grandpa Delgado at his ranch. Talking with him always made her problems seem smaller. Just being at the ranch made her feel better, so she went whenever she was <span class="txt-underline">agitated</span> about something. She knew she could rely on the land’s unchanging beauty.<br>
<br>
6 Marisol found her grandfather in his old barn. “I guess we’ll need to pull this shabby old barn down pretty soon,” he said when he saw her. “It’s falling apart. It seems as if it <span class="txt-underline">deteriorated</span> overnight. Now that we’ve built a new barn, it’s just taking up space around here—like me, I suppose.” He sighed and looked around. “I built it right after I came to this country. It looks as though we’ve both just about outlived our usefulness.”<br>
<br>
7 As Marisol watched him l ooking around the barn, s he got an idea. “ Grandpa, w asn’t there a theater group near here that used to perform in a barn?”<br>
<br>
8 “Why, yes,” Grandpa Delgado said. “The Red Barn<br>
Players. They’re n ot around anymore. It was a good idea, performing in a barn. We don’t have fancy theaters around here like those you would find in a big city.”<br>
<br>
9 “How many folding chairs do you think could fit in this barn?” Marisol asked.<br>
<br>
10 He wrinkled his brow and thought a moment. “Probably a hundred or so. Why?”<br>
<br>
11 Marisol’s words came out in a rush. “I have an idea for how to earn money for my Spanish club. We could put on a play right here in your barn! If we gave two performances and if a hundred people came to each one and if tickets cost five dollars each . . .” She tapped her feet as she did the math in her head. “That’s $1,000!” she said triumphantly.<br>
<br>
12 At their next meeting, Marisol’s f ellow club members liked the idea. Mrs. Carrillo said, “Marisol, why don’t you and Carlota find a play for us to perform. We need to decide on the play right away so we’ll have time to rehearse, build sets, make costumes, a nd advertise. In the meantime we can work on turning the barn into a temporary theater.”<br>
<br>
13 Marisol and Carlota spent hours at the library looking for a play, but nothing seemed right. “ Here’s one about a zookeeper who discovers his gorilla can talk,” Carlota said.<br>
<br>
14 Marisol shook her head. “None of these will work.<br>
They’re too short, and none of them has more than three roles,” she said.<br>
<br>
15 “Besides,” added Carlota, “we should do a play that has something to do with Mexican culture.”<br>
<br>
16 Marisol paused for a moment as an idea came to her. “I wrote a play for English class a few months ago about my grandpa when h e was a young charro, a Mexican cowboy. Would you like to see it?”<br>
<br>
17 Carlota went home with Marisol and read the play.<br>
When Carlota finished reading, she turned to Marisol and said, “It’s perfect!”<br>
<br>
18 The other club members liked it, too. P arts w ere<br>
assigned, and rehearsals began. Marisol didn’t have a part, but she helped with sets and costumes. Her whole family got involved to make sure the play was a success because they were proud of her. Marisol’s father put up posters on every telephone pole for miles around. Her older brother Ray, who attended college in a nearby town, promised t o bring a group of friends on opening night.<br>
<br>
19 Before the play Mrs. Carrillo explained the purpose of the event and thanked the audience f or attending. Then the performance began. Marisol watched nervously from backstage. At one point Adrian, who was playing Marisol’s grandfather, had to sing an old Mexican folk song. He had a good voice, but he must have forgotten the words.

<br>
21 After the play was over, Marisol helped count the profits. They had made more than $500. She felt sure that they would be able to reach their goal after the next day’s performance.<br>
<br>
22 Grandpa Delgado came over to congratulate her. “I guess this old thing still has some life i n it after a ll,” he said with a wink.<br>

winking back. The trip to Mexico City would be great, but nothing could ever replace Marisol’s happiness w hen she heard her grandfather’s strong voice ringing throughout the barn.<br>
