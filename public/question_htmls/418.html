          <strong>My Trip to Big Bend</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Andres Benavides</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I went on an incredible trip to Big Bend National Park last week. Mom and Dad and I planned the whole thing with my cousin Mike, who works as a guide there. We had an unbelievable trip, including rafting, rock climbing, and backpacking. Mike wanted to show me what Big Bend National Park is all about.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On the first day we put on our helmets and life jackets, climbed into our raft, and plunged into the muddy Rio Grande. Mike taught me a few tips on paddling. While I practiced, he explained that our trip would take us through Boquillas Canyon. The trip was 33 miles long, much longer than the rafting trips I had taken before. But I was so excited that I didn’t mind. Besides, the calm waters kept us from getting too tired.</p>

        </p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As Mike and I drifted through Boquillas Canyon, he told me a little about the area. Big Bend became a national park in 1944. It encompasses more than 800,000 acres. There are rugged mountains, a vast desert, deep canyons, and more than 100 miles of winding river. As we floated along in our raft, I looked up at towering cliffs as tall as skyscrapers. The huge rock walls made me feel very small. The only sound I could hear was the flowing river. Then suddenly I heard a low grunting. I looked up and saw a group of big hairy pigs passing by. I asked Mike whether there were farms in Big Bend. He laughed and told me that these creatures were actually javelinas, which look kind of like wild pigs.</p>

        </p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At the end of the day, we camped on the riverbank. At first I missed my soft bed back at home, but the stars overhead were so beautiful that I quickly forgot about being uncomfortable and fell asleep. The next morning my muscles ached from all the paddling the day before. Mike wasn’t sore at all. He was ready to go.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We spent three tiring but peaceful days floating through the canyon. After our tour of the canyon, we traded our raft and paddles for ropes and harnesses and started hiking through the desert to the Chisos Mountains. Although most of Big Bend is desert, there are forested mountains that reach a mile into the sky. Mike likes to call them the upside-down mountains. Most mountains have trees at the bottom and bare rocks at the top. The Chisos, however, have low, scrubby desert plants at the bottom and big trees at the top.</p>

        </p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Admiring the mountain cliffs from a distance is one thing, but climbing them is another. I have to admit that I was a little uneasy. Fortunately Mike knew that I had never been rock climbing, so he took me to a fairly easy climbing area called Basin Rock. As we started up the cliffs, the big cracks in the rocks helped me keep my footing. The more we climbed, the easier it became. When we had climbed for a few hours, we stopped on a large flat slab and admired the view. After all that work, I didn’t want to go right back down the mountain.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once we made camp and ate dinner at the base of the mountain, I was so exhausted that I fell right to sleep. The next morning the yapping of nearby coyotes woke me. I went to wash up and discovered fresh coyote tracks just 30 feet from my sleeping bag! After eating a quick breakfast, we put on our backpacks and began our hike in the desert. The land seemed to <span class="txt-underline">transform</span> from big trees to pink and white wildflowers and cacti blooming with yellow flowers. One plant looked like a bunch of dagger blades sticking out of the ground. Mike said it was called lechuguilla. We had to walk carefully because so many of these plants were on the narrow dirt&nbsp;path. One wrong move and the sharp plants could have jabbed our skin right through our pants.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Several miles farther, the path became wider and steeper. Soon the trail was shaded by shrubby oak trees and junipers, which gave welcome relief from the desert heat. We had reached an area where the desert became forest. Now, instead of graceful roadrunners crossing our path, we had creepy tarantulas crawling by. I wasn’t too happy about this change. As we stopped to eat under the feathery dark-green branches of some pine trees, I realized how much I had seen and done in just a few days. I could hardly believe how fast the days had gone by. Thinking about leaving Big Bend made me realize that it is a place like no other on Earth.</p>

        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I will never forget the precise moment that caused me to set aside my gift because I wanted the gift that my older sister Carla had.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My family was spending a week at the beach. One morning, Carla went to the beach early, but I stayed behind to finish a sketch of a seashell I’d found the day before.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After I finished the drawing, I put on my swimsuit and walked from the hotel to the beach to join Carla. I was about a hundred yards away from the ocean when I spotted Carla doing cartwheels in the wet sand. Lean and muscular, Carla was a champion gymnast. Her motions were slow and fluid, in perfect coordination, as she wheeled along the shore. The beauty of that sight froze me in awe, and I decided instantly that I too would become a gymnast.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is important at this point to mention that I had never been very athletic or particularly agile. Physical education was my least favorite subject in school. Nevertheless, I told my parents I wanted to take a gymnastics class. “O.K., Allison,” my mother said with surprise. The next week I enrolled in a beginners’ tumbling class.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If only my parents had talked me out of this misguided plan and spared me the agonies I went through! Five minutes into the first class, it was obvious that I didn’t have the makings of a gymnast. I couldn’t even master a somersault! But I kept at it.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;During this time drawing and painting—which had been my two passions—all but left my mind. I abandoned art to practice what, in my case, can only loosely be called tumbling. It must have been painful for my family to put on an encouraging face as they watched my dogged but fumbling efforts. I was blindly determined to be like Carla. I just would not give up.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At some point during this period, on the advice of Ms. Renquist, my art teacher, I hurriedly submitted my seashell sketch for an art contest in our town. One night as I was groaning my way through an attempted back bend in our living room, the phone rang.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I unbent myself gracelessly as Carla handed the phone to me. It was Ms. Renquist. “You won the contest!” she announced.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I blinked. “Really?” was all I managed to reply.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Yes,” Ms. Renquist said. “They’re going to give you an award at the annual banquet. And that’s not all, Allison. The winner is automatically accepted into Wildale’s Summer Fine Arts Institute.”</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Wow!” I shouted into the receiver. I couldn’t believe that I’d gotten into such an elite program. Only a handful of young artists were accepted each summer.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When I hung up, Carla made me recount every word of the conversation. “That’s fantastic, Allison!” she said. “Let’s go tell Mom and Dad.”</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That night I didn’t go back into the living room to continue practicing. And when my tumbling class ended the next week, I didn’t sign up for another session. Gymnastics was Carla’s gift, not mine. It had taken me a while, but I realized that I had a valuable gift of my own.</p>

        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;During this time drawing and painting—which had been my two passions—all but left my mind. I abandoned art to practice what, in my case, can only loosely be called tumbling. It must have been painful for my family to put on an encouraging face as they watched my dogged but fumbling efforts. I was blindly determined to be like Carla. I just would not give up.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At some point during this period, on the advice of Ms. Renquist, my art teacher, I hurriedly submitted my seashell sketch for an art contest in our town. One night as I was groaning my way through an attempted back bend in our living room, the phone rang.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I unbent myself gracelessly as Carla handed the phone to me. It was Ms. Renquist. “You won the contest!” she announced.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I blinked. “Really?” was all I managed to reply.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Yes,” Ms. Renquist said. “They’re going to give you an award at the annual banquet. And that’s not all, Allison. The winner is automatically accepted into Wildale’s Summer Fine Arts Institute.”</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Wow!” I shouted into the receiver. I couldn’t believe that I’d gotten into such an elite program. Only a handful of young artists were accepted each summer.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When I hung up, Carla made me recount every word of the conversation. “That’s fantastic, Allison!” she said. “Let’s go tell Mom and Dad.”</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That night I didn’t go back into the living room to continue practicing. And when my tumbling class ended the next week, I didn’t sign up for another session. Gymnastics was Carla’s gift, not mine. It had taken me a while, but I realized that I had a valuable gift of my own.</p>

        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <strong>Mikhail’s List</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; If you could hear me tell this story aloud, you would know from my accent that I’m not originally from the United States. My family is from Saint Petersburg, a large city in the far western part of Russia. We came to Boston three years ago because my father was invited to teach at a large university in this city.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately I already knew English fairly well before we got here. Still, my stomach became knotted up every time I thought about being in an unfamiliar place. For one thing, I would not have a single friend in the United States. For another, as the oldest of three children in my family, I thought I needed to set a good example for my brother and<br>
sister and make my parents proud.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;With this weight on my shoulders, I started my new life here. I sat at my desk and made a list of goals for myself.</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="100%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766047099/bq5pcfhjnjot8oqhga1f.png" alt="T3_Y6_CT_EN_06_1">


        </p>
        <p>I taped this list to my bathroom mirror and reread it before leaving for my first day of school in the United States.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At the time the list seemed entirely reasonable to me. My mother thought otherwise. After reading it, she exclaimed, “Mikhail, you cannot possibly believe that you must accomplish these things! Your father and I don’t expect you to be Superman.” Maybe they didn’t expect me to perform miracles, but I still wanted to excel in every possible way.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;How did I do with the goals on my list? Not so well. First, I did not make a new friend every day, because good&nbsp;friendships take time. You can’t collect friends the way you do baseball cards or marbles. Second, I worked hard but discovered that some subjects were easier for me than others. And that was O.K. Third, in my quest to be incomparable in all sports, I ended up spraining my wrist during a soccer game and breaking an ankle running track. And as for goal number four, I learned that my sister and my brother wanted to live their own life here in the United States, without their older brother’s intrusiveness. In fact, they’ve probably adjusted better than I have. They haven’t broken a single bone!</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="94%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766047100/xldzfb40svwvjtlhelmr.png" alt="T3_Y6_CT_EN_06_2">


        </p>
        <p>6 So I decided that I needed a new list.</p>

          <strong>Mikhail’s List</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; If you could hear me tell this story aloud, you would know from my accent that I’m not originally from the United States. My family is from Saint Petersburg, a large city in the far western part of Russia. We came to Boston three years ago because my father was invited to teach at a large university in this city.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately I already knew English fairly well before we got here. Still, my stomach became knotted up every time I thought about being in an unfamiliar place. For one thing, I would not have a single friend in the United States. For another, as the oldest of three children in my family, I thought I needed to set a good example for my brother and<br>
sister and make my parents proud.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;With this weight on my shoulders, I started my new life here. I sat at my desk and made a list of goals for myself.</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="100%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766039126/pgtt31er72otxnzbaf3x.png" alt="T3_Y6_CT_EN_06_1">


        </p>
        <p>I taped this list to my bathroom mirror and reread it before leaving for my first day of school in the United States.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At the time the list seemed entirely reasonable to me. My mother thought otherwise. After reading it, she exclaimed, “Mikhail, you cannot possibly believe that you must accomplish these things! Your father and I don’t expect you to be Superman.” Maybe they didn’t expect me to perform miracles, but I still wanted to excel in every possible way.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;How did I do with the goals on my list? Not so well. First, I did not make a new friend every day, because good&nbsp;friendships take time. You can’t collect friends the way you do baseball cards or marbles. Second, I worked hard but discovered that some subjects were easier for me than others. And that was O.K. Third, in my quest to be incomparable in all sports, I ended up spraining my wrist during a soccer game and breaking an ankle running track. And as for goal number four, I learned that my sister and my brother wanted to live their own life here in the United States, without their older brother’s intrusiveness. In fact, they’ve probably adjusted better than I have. They haven’t broken a single bone!</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>6 So I decided that I needed a new list.</p>

        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At the time the list seemed entirely reasonable to me. My mother thought otherwise. After reading it, she exclaimed, “Mikhail, you cannot possibly believe that you must accomplish these things! Your father and I don’t expect you to be Superman.” Maybe they didn’t expect me to perform miracles, but I still wanted to excel in every possible way.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;How did I do with the goals on my list? Not so well. First, I did not make a new friend every day, because good&nbsp;friendships take time. You can’t collect friends the way you do baseball cards or marbles. Second, I worked hard but discovered that some subjects were easier for me than others. And that was O.K. Third, in my quest to be incomparable in all sports, I ended up spraining my wrist during a soccer game and breaking an ankle running track. And as for goal number four, I learned that my sister and my brother wanted to live their own life here in the United States, without their older brother’s intrusiveness. In fact, they’ve probably adjusted better than I have. They haven’t broken a single bone!</p>

          <strong>Allison’s Gift</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I will never forget the precise moment that caused me to set aside my gift because I wanted the gift that my older sister Carla had.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My family was spending a week at the beach. One morning, Carla went to the beach early, but I stayed behind to finish a sketch of a seashell I’d found the day before.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After I finished the drawing, I put on my swimsuit and walked from the hotel to the beach to join Carla. I was about a hundred yards away from the ocean when I spotted Carla doing cartwheels in the wet sand. Lean and muscular, Carla was a champion gymnast. Her motions were slow and fluid, in perfect coordination, as she wheeled along the shore. The beauty of that sight froze me in awe, and I decided instantly that I too would become a gymnast.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
                  <img width="83%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766024832/l7cmu1397fxnx3h96vlz.png" alt="T3_Y6_CT_EN_01">


        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is important at this point to mention that I had never been very athletic or particularly agile. Physical education was my least favorite subject in school. Nevertheless, I told my parents I wanted to take a gymnastics class. “O.K., Allison,” my mother said with surprise. The next week I enrolled in a beginners’ tumbling class.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If only my parents had talked me out of this misguided plan and spared me the agonies I went through! Five minutes into the first class, it was obvious that I didn’t have the makings of a gymnast. I couldn’t even master a somersault! But I kept at it.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;During this time drawing and painting—which had been my two passions—all but left my mind. I abandoned art to practice what, in my case, can only loosely be called tumbling. It must have been painful for my family to put on an encouraging face as they watched my dogged but fumbling efforts. I was blindly determined to be like Carla. I just would not give up.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At some point during this period, on the advice of Ms. Renquist, my art teacher, I hurriedly submitted my seashell sketch for an art contest in our town. One night as I was groaning my way through an attempted back bend in our living room, the phone rang.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I unbent myself gracelessly as Carla handed the phone to me. It was Ms. Renquist. “You won the contest!” she announced.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I blinked. “Really?” was all I managed to reply.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Yes,” Ms. Renquist said. “They’re going to give you an award at the annual banquet. And that’s not all, Allison. The winner is automatically accepted into Wildale’s Summer Fine Arts Institute.”</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Wow!” I shouted into the receiver. I couldn’t believe that I’d gotten into such an elite program. Only a handful of young artists were accepted each summer.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When I hung up, Carla made me recount every word of the conversation. “That’s fantastic, Allison!” she said. “Let’s go tell Mom and Dad.”</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That night I didn’t go back into the living room to continue practicing. And when my tumbling class ended the next week, I didn’t sign up for another session. Gymnastics was Carla’s gift, not mine. It had taken me a while, but I realized that I had a valuable gift of my own.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <strong>Mikhail’s List</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; If you could hear me tell this story aloud, you would know from my accent that I’m not originally from the United States. My family is from Saint Petersburg, a large city in the far western part of Russia. We came to Boston three years ago because my father was invited to teach at a large university in this city.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately I already knew English fairly well before we got here. Still, my stomach became knotted up every time I thought about being in an unfamiliar place. For one thing, I would not have a single friend in the United States. For another, as the oldest of three children in my family, I thought I needed to set a good example for my brother and<br>
sister and make my parents proud.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;With this weight on my shoulders, I started my new life here. I sat at my desk and made a list of goals for myself.</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="100%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766024829/hdx8mdhaygas2zd4s91o.png" alt="T3_Y6_CT_EN_06_1">

        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is important at this point to mention that I had never been very athletic or particularly agile. Physical education was my least favorite subject in school. Nevertheless, I told my parents I wanted to take a gymnastics class. “O.K., Allison,” my mother said with surprise. The next week I enrolled in a beginners’ tumbling class.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If only my parents had talked me out of this misguided plan and spared me the agonies I went through! Five minutes into the first class, it was obvious that I didn’t have the makings of a gymnast. I couldn’t even master a somersault! But I kept at it.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;During this time drawing and painting—which had been my two passions—all but left my mind. I abandoned art to practice what, in my case, can only loosely be called tumbling. It must have been painful for my family to put on an encouraging face as they watched my dogged but fumbling efforts. I was blindly determined to be like Carla. I just would not give up.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At some point during this period, on the advice of Ms. Renquist, my art teacher, I hurriedly submitted my seashell sketch for an art contest in our town. One night as I was groaning my way through an attempted back bend in our living room, the phone rang.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I unbent myself gracelessly as Carla handed the phone to me. It was Ms. Renquist. “You won the contest!” she announced.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I blinked. “Really?” was all I managed to reply.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Yes,” Ms. Renquist said. “They’re going to give you an award at the annual banquet. And that’s not all, Allison. The winner is automatically accepted into Wildale’s Summer Fine Arts Institute.”</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Wow!” I shouted into the receiver. I couldn’t believe that I’d gotten into such an elite program. Only a handful of young artists were accepted each summer.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When I hung up, Carla made me recount every word of the conversation. “That’s fantastic, Allison!” she said. “Let’s go tell Mom and Dad.”</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That night I didn’t go back into the living room to continue practicing. And when my tumbling class ended the next week, I didn’t sign up for another session. Gymnastics was Carla’s gift, not mine. It had taken me a while, but I realized that I had a valuable gift of my own.</p>

          <strong>Mikhail’s List</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; If you could hear me tell this story aloud, you would know from my accent that I’m not originally from the United States. My family is from Saint Petersburg, a large city in the far western part of Russia. We came to Boston three years ago because my father was invited to teach at a large university in this city.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately I already knew English fairly well before we got here. Still, my stomach became knotted up every time I thought about being in an unfamiliar place. For one thing, I would not have a single friend in the United States. For another, as the oldest of three children in my family, I thought I needed to set a good example for my brother and<br>
sister and make my parents proud.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;With this weight on my shoulders, I started my new life here. I sat at my desk and made a list of goals for myself.</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="100%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766018835/wpufwrodxglbtzeehepd.png" alt="T3_Y6_CT_EN_06_1">


        </p>
        <p>I taped this list to my bathroom mirror and reread it before leaving for my first day of school in the United States.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At the time the list seemed entirely reasonable to me. My mother thought otherwise. After reading it, she exclaimed, “Mikhail, you cannot possibly believe that you must accomplish these things! Your father and I don’t expect you to be Superman.” Maybe they didn’t expect me to perform miracles, but I still wanted to excel in every possible way.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;How did I do with the goals on my list? Not so well. First, I did not make a new friend every day, because good&nbsp;friendships take time. You can’t collect friends the way you do baseball cards or marbles. Second, I worked hard but discovered that some subjects were easier for me than others. And that was O.K. Third, in my quest to be incomparable in all sports, I ended up spraining my wrist during a soccer game and breaking an ankle running track. And as for goal number four, I learned that my sister and my brother wanted to live their own life here in the United States, without their older brother’s intrusiveness. In fact, they’ve probably adjusted better than I have. They haven’t broken a single bone!</p>

          <strong>Allison’s Gift</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I will never forget the precise moment that caused me to set aside my gift because I wanted the gift that my older sister Carla had.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My family was spending a week at the beach. One morning, Carla went to the beach early, but I stayed behind to finish a sketch of a seashell I’d found the day before.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After I finished the drawing, I put on my swimsuit and walked from the hotel to the beach to join Carla. I was about a hundred yards away from the ocean when I spotted Carla doing cartwheels in the wet sand. Lean and muscular, Carla was a champion gymnast. Her motions were slow and fluid, in perfect coordination, as she wheeled along the shore. The beauty of that sight froze me in awe, and I decided instantly that I too would become a gymnast.</p>

          <strong>Allison’s Gift</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I will never forget the precise moment that caused me to set aside my gift because I wanted the gift that my older sister Carla had.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My family was spending a week at the beach. One morning, Carla went to the beach early, but I stayed behind to finish a sketch of a seashell I’d found the day before.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After I finished the drawing, I put on my swimsuit and walked from the hotel to the beach to join Carla. I was about a hundred yards away from the ocean when I spotted Carla doing cartwheels in the wet sand. Lean and muscular, Carla was a champion gymnast. Her motions were slow and fluid, in perfect coordination, as she wheeled along the shore. The beauty of that sight froze me in awe, and I decided instantly that I too would become a gymnast.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is important at this point to mention that I had never been very athletic or particularly agile. Physical education was my least favorite subject in school. Nevertheless, I told my parents I wanted to take a gymnastics class. “O.K., Allison,” my mother said with surprise. The next week I enrolled in a beginners’ tumbling class.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If only my parents had talked me out of this misguided plan and spared me the agonies I went through! Five minutes into the first class, it was obvious that I didn’t have the makings of a gymnast. I couldn’t even master a somersault! But I kept at it.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;During this time drawing and painting—which had been my two passions—all but left my mind. I abandoned art to practice what, in my case, can only loosely be called tumbling. It must have been painful for my family to put on an encouraging face as they watched my dogged but fumbling efforts. I was blindly determined to be like Carla. I just would not give up.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At some point during this period, on the advice of Ms. Renquist, my art teacher, I hurriedly submitted my seashell sketch for an art contest in our town. One night as I was groaning my way through an attempted back bend in our living room, the phone rang.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I unbent myself gracelessly as Carla handed the phone to me. It was Ms. Renquist. “You won the contest!” she announced.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I blinked. “Really?” was all I managed to reply.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Yes,” Ms. Renquist said. “They’re going to give you an award at the annual banquet. And that’s not all, Allison. The winner is automatically accepted into Wildale’s Summer Fine Arts Institute.”</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Wow!” I shouted into the receiver. I couldn’t believe that I’d gotten into such an elite program. Only a handful of young artists were accepted each summer.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When I hung up, Carla made me recount every word of the conversation. “That’s fantastic, Allison!” she said. “Let’s go tell Mom and Dad.”</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That night I didn’t go back into the living room to continue practicing. And when my tumbling class ended the next week, I didn’t sign up for another session. Gymnastics was Carla’s gift, not mine. It had taken me a while, but I realized that I had a valuable gift of my own.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <strong>Mikhail’s List</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; If you could hear me tell this story aloud, you would know from my accent that I’m not originally from the United States. My family is from Saint Petersburg, a large city in the far western part of Russia. We came to Boston three years ago because my father was invited to teach at a large university in this city.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately I already knew English fairly well before we got here. Still, my stomach became knotted up every time I thought about being in an unfamiliar place. For one thing, I would not have a single friend in the United States. For another, as the oldest of three children in my family, I thought I needed to set a good example for my brother and<br>
sister and make my parents proud.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;With this weight on my shoulders, I started my new life here. I sat at my desk and made a list of goals for myself.</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="100%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766024185/fe34raribhuwm8fwhlxo.png" alt="T3_Y6_CT_EN_06_1">


        </p>
        <p>I taped this list to my bathroom mirror and reread it before leaving for my first day of school in the United States.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At the time the list seemed entirely reasonable to me. My mother thought otherwise. After reading it, she exclaimed, “Mikhail, you cannot possibly believe that you must accomplish these things! Your father and I don’t expect you to be Superman.” Maybe they didn’t expect me to perform miracles, but I still wanted to excel in every possible way.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;How did I do with the goals on my list? Not so well. First, I did not make a new friend every day, because good&nbsp;friendships take time. You can’t collect friends the way you do baseball cards or marbles. Second, I worked hard but discovered that some subjects were easier for me than others. And that was O.K. Third, in my quest to be incomparable in all sports, I ended up spraining my wrist during a soccer game and breaking an ankle running track. And as for goal number four, I learned that my sister and my brother wanted to live their own life here in the United States, without their older brother’s intrusiveness. In fact, they’ve probably adjusted better than I have. They haven’t broken a single bone!</p>

          <strong>Gators Roam Downtown Plaza Again</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Wesley Schanen</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; EL PASO, Texas—After an absence of more than 20 years, alligators are again the center of attention downtown. But don’t worry—these gators are harmless. They are part of artist Luis Jiménez’s latest sculpture, titled <em>Plaza de los<br>
Lagartos</em>, which means “Plaza of the Alligators.”</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of residents gathered in San Jacinto Plaza to dedicate the large fiberglass statue and fountain. It is located near the area where live alligators once roamed the plaza’s pond. The statue brought back fond memories for many who attended the dedication. Some older El Pasoans related stories of childhood visits to the real gator pond in the 1950s and 1960s. Younger residents, however, found it hard to believe that gators actually lived in the park, hundreds of miles from the nearest swamp.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;According to legend, the whole thing started as a joke. Around 1883 an El Paso miner named Adolph Munsenberger received a package about the size of a shoe&nbsp;box from a friend in Louisiana. Inside he found six baby alligators along with a note from his friend. The note suggested that Munsenberger use the alligators to haul mining carts. By all accounts Munsenberger took the joke well. He put the little reptiles into a water barrel and began raising them as pets. However, he knew that this small home could be only temporary. Munsenberger went to the<br>
mayor and offered the gators as a gift to the city. The mayor accepted even though there wasn’t really a place to keep the animals. He finally decided to put the gators in the recently completed pond in San Jacinto Plaza.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;El Paso residents soon began to think of the gators as community pets. They gave each gator a name—Humpy, Sally, Ally, Don Porfirio, Mimmie, and Abercrombie. The gators quickly became local celebrities. El Paso newspapers reported their activities as though they were respected citizens. News accounts detailed the latest gator facts, and gossip columns included gator rumors. One local<br>
newspaper even ran a weekly column called “Alligators’ Tails.” The column&nbsp;related the “true” history of how alligators came to El Paso, as told by one of the alligators. People throughout the city shared tall tales and anecdotes about their unusual new neighbors. As these tales spread, each gator seemed to take on a unique personality. For example,<br>
witnesses claimed that Ally liked music. They said that he would wag his tail whenever a mariachi band performed in<br>
the park.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Alligators occupied the pond in San Jacinto Plaza for some 80 years. Over the years the original alligators died and were replaced with new ones. The alligators remained a popular local attraction and could be seen sunning themselves during the warmer months. Although El Paso is<br>
usually warm and sunny, its winters were cold for the gators. When temperatures dropped, usually in late October, the gators would retreat to the center of the pond. They would remain there in a type of hibernation until warmer days returned. Around March the gators would crawl back out of the water. Many El Pasoans came to view the alligators’ reappearance as a sure sign of spring.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the gators were by nature dangerous animals. On a few occasions park workers were attacked. Although most El Pasoans were fond of the alligators, people often involved the gators in risky pranks and practical jokes. On at least one occasion, a gator was placed in a hotel room to welcome an unsuspecting tourist. Once, students from a local college kidnapped one of the large reptiles and put it in the school swimming pool. Some of these exploits were even more harmful. There were incidents in which the alligators were mistreated and abused. In the 1960s two alligators were stoned to&nbsp;death, and another lost an eye. Park officials became worried about the gators’ safety and wisely decided to move them to<br>
the city zoo. Though the gators made a brief return to the pond in the 1970s, protected by a plastic enclosure, the zoo<br>
eventually became their permanent home.</p>

        </p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After they left San Jacinto Plaza, the gators gradually faded into El Paso’s past. Then in 1987 city officials asked Jiménez to create a work of art for downtown El Paso. An El Paso native, Jiménez remembered seeing the gators as a boy. He knew that they held special memories for many El Pasoans and chose to make them the subject of the statue. The statue took Jiménez eight years to complete. It depicts<br>
four alligators seeming to lunge out from the fountain, two with their mouths <span class="txt-underline">agape</span>, their sharp teeth bared as if ready to attack. Mist from the fountain keeps the gators looking moist and lifelike. Those in attendance at the dedication were happy that the park’s most famous citizens had finally returned—at least in spirit—to San Jacinto Plaza.</p>

          <strong>Gators Roam Downtown Plaza Again</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Wesley Schanen</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; EL PASO, Texas—After an absence of more than 20 years, alligators are again the center of attention downtown. But don’t worry—these gators are harmless. They are part of artist Luis Jiménez’s latest sculpture, titled <em>Plaza de los<br>
Lagartos</em>, which means “Plaza of the Alligators.”</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of residents gathered in San Jacinto Plaza to dedicate the large fiberglass statue and fountain. It is located near the area where live alligators once roamed the plaza’s pond. The statue brought back fond memories for many who attended the dedication. Some older El Pasoans related stories of childhood visits to the real gator pond in the 1950s and 1960s. Younger residents, however, found it hard to believe that gators actually lived in the park, hundreds of miles from the nearest swamp.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;According to legend, the whole thing started as a joke. Around 1883 an El Paso miner named Adolph Munsenberger received a package about the size of a shoe&nbsp;box from a friend in Louisiana. Inside he found six baby alligators along with a note from his friend. The note suggested that Munsenberger use the alligators to haul mining carts. By all accounts Munsenberger took the joke well. He put the little reptiles into a water barrel and began raising them as pets. However, he knew that this small home could be only temporary. Munsenberger went to the<br>
mayor and offered the gators as a gift to the city. The mayor accepted even though there wasn’t really a place to keep the animals. He finally decided to put the gators in the recently completed pond in San Jacinto Plaza.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;El Paso residents soon began to think of the gators as community pets. They gave each gator a name—Humpy, Sally, Ally, Don Porfirio, Mimmie, and Abercrombie. The gators quickly became local celebrities. El Paso newspapers reported their activities as though they were respected citizens. News accounts detailed the latest gator facts, and gossip columns included gator rumors. One local<br>
newspaper even ran a weekly column called “Alligators’ Tails.” The column&nbsp;related the “true” history of how alligators came to El Paso, as told by one of the alligators. People throughout the city shared tall tales and anecdotes about their unusual new neighbors. As these tales spread, each gator seemed to take on a unique personality. For example,<br>
witnesses claimed that Ally liked music. They said that he would wag his tail whenever a mariachi band performed in<br>
the park.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Alligators occupied the pond in San Jacinto Plaza for some 80 years. Over the years the original alligators died and were replaced with new ones. The alligators remained a popular local attraction and could be seen sunning themselves during the warmer months. Although El Paso is<br>
usually warm and sunny, its winters were cold for the gators. When temperatures dropped, usually in late October, the gators would retreat to the center of the pond. They would remain there in a type of hibernation until warmer days returned. Around March the gators would crawl back out of the water. Many El Pasoans came to view the alligators’ reappearance as a sure sign of spring.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the gators were by nature dangerous animals. On a few occasions park workers were attacked. Although most El Pasoans were fond of the alligators, people often involved the gators in risky pranks and practical jokes. On at least one occasion, a gator was placed in a hotel room to welcome an unsuspecting tourist. Once, students from a local college kidnapped one of the large reptiles and put it in the school swimming pool. Some of these exploits were even more harmful. There were incidents in which the alligators were mistreated and abused. In the 1960s two alligators were stoned to&nbsp;death, and another lost an eye. Park officials became worried about the gators’ safety and wisely decided to move them to<br>
the city zoo. Though the gators made a brief return to the pond in the 1970s, protected by a plastic enclosure, the zoo<br>
eventually became their permanent home.</p>

        </p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After they left San Jacinto Plaza, the gators gradually faded into El Paso’s past. Then in 1987 city officials asked Jiménez to create a work of art for downtown El Paso. An El Paso native, Jiménez remembered seeing the gators as a boy. He knew that they held special memories for many El Pasoans and chose to make them the subject of the statue. The statue took Jiménez eight years to complete. It depicts<br>
four alligators seeming to lunge out from the fountain, two with their mouths <span class="txt-underline">agape</span>, their sharp teeth bared as if ready to attack. Mist from the fountain keeps the gators looking moist and lifelike. Those in attendance at the dedication were happy that the park’s most famous citizens had finally returned—at least in spirit—to San Jacinto Plaza.</p>

          <strong>Gators Roam Downtown Plaza Again</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Wesley Schanen</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; EL PASO, Texas—After an absence of more than 20 years, alligators are again the center of attention downtown. But don’t worry—these gators are harmless. They are part of artist Luis Jiménez’s latest sculpture, titled <em>Plaza de los<br>
Lagartos</em>, which means “Plaza of the Alligators.”</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of residents gathered in San Jacinto Plaza to dedicate the large fiberglass statue and fountain. It is located near the area where live alligators once roamed the plaza’s pond. The statue brought back fond memories for many who attended the dedication. Some older El Pasoans related stories of childhood visits to the real gator pond in the 1950s and 1960s. Younger residents, however, found it hard to believe that gators actually lived in the park, hundreds of miles from the nearest swamp.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;According to legend, the whole thing started as a joke. Around 1883 an El Paso miner named Adolph Munsenberger received a package about the size of a shoe&nbsp;box from a friend in Louisiana. Inside he found six baby alligators along with a note from his friend. The note suggested that Munsenberger use the alligators to haul mining carts. By all accounts Munsenberger took the joke well. He put the little reptiles into a water barrel and began raising them as pets. However, he knew that this small home could be only temporary. Munsenberger went to the<br>
mayor and offered the gators as a gift to the city. The mayor accepted even though there wasn’t really a place to keep the animals. He finally decided to put the gators in the recently completed pond in San Jacinto Plaza.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;El Paso residents soon began to think of the gators as community pets. They gave each gator a name—Humpy, Sally, Ally, Don Porfirio, Mimmie, and Abercrombie. The gators quickly became local celebrities. El Paso newspapers reported their activities as though they were respected citizens. News accounts detailed the latest gator facts, and gossip columns included gator rumors. One local<br>
newspaper even ran a weekly column called “Alligators’ Tails.” The column&nbsp;related the “true” history of how alligators came to El Paso, as told by one of the alligators. People throughout the city shared tall tales and anecdotes about their unusual new neighbors. As these tales spread, each gator seemed to take on a unique personality. For example,<br>
witnesses claimed that Ally liked music. They said that he would wag his tail whenever a mariachi band performed in<br>
the park.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Alligators occupied the pond in San Jacinto Plaza for some 80 years. Over the years the original alligators died and were replaced with new ones. The alligators remained a popular local attraction and could be seen sunning themselves during the warmer months. Although El Paso is<br>
usually warm and sunny, its winters were cold for the gators. When temperatures dropped, usually in late October, the gators would retreat to the center of the pond. They would remain there in a type of hibernation until warmer days returned. Around March the gators would crawl back out of the water. Many El Pasoans came to view the alligators’ reappearance as a sure sign of spring.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the gators were by nature dangerous animals. On a few occasions park workers were attacked. Although most El Pasoans were fond of the alligators, people often involved the gators in risky pranks and practical jokes. On at least one occasion, a gator was placed in a hotel room to welcome an unsuspecting tourist. Once, students from a local college kidnapped one of the large reptiles and put it in the school swimming pool. Some of these exploits were even more harmful. There were incidents in which the alligators were mistreated and abused. In the 1960s two alligators were stoned to&nbsp;death, and another lost an eye. Park officials became worried about the gators’ safety and wisely decided to move them to<br>
the city zoo. Though the gators made a brief return to the pond in the 1970s, protected by a plastic enclosure, the zoo<br>
eventually became their permanent home.</p>

        </p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After they left San Jacinto Plaza, the gators gradually faded into El Paso’s past. Then in 1987 city officials asked Jiménez to create a work of art for downtown El Paso. An El Paso native, Jiménez remembered seeing the gators as a boy. He knew that they held special memories for many El Pasoans and chose to make them the subject of the statue. The statue took Jiménez eight years to complete. It depicts<br>
four alligators seeming to lunge out from the fountain, two with their mouths <span class="txt-underline">agape</span>, their sharp teeth bared as if ready to attack. Mist from the fountain keeps the gators looking moist and lifelike. Those in attendance at the dedication were happy that the park’s most famous citizens had finally returned—at least in spirit—to San Jacinto Plaza.</p>

          <strong>Gators Roam Downtown Plaza Again</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Wesley Schanen</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; EL PASO, Texas—After an absence of more than 20 years, alligators are again the center of attention downtown. But don’t worry—these gators are harmless. They are part of artist Luis Jiménez’s latest sculpture, titled <em>Plaza de los<br>
Lagartos</em>, which means “Plaza of the Alligators.”</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of residents gathered in San Jacinto Plaza to dedicate the large fiberglass statue and fountain. It is located near the area where live alligators once roamed the plaza’s pond. The statue brought back fond memories for many who attended the dedication. Some older El Pasoans related stories of childhood visits to the real gator pond in the 1950s and 1960s. Younger residents, however, found it hard to believe that gators actually lived in the park, hundreds of miles from the nearest swamp.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;According to legend, the whole thing started as a joke. Around 1883 an El Paso miner named Adolph Munsenberger received a package about the size of a shoe&nbsp;box from a friend in Louisiana. Inside he found six baby alligators along with a note from his friend. The note suggested that Munsenberger use the alligators to haul mining carts. By all accounts Munsenberger took the joke well. He put the little reptiles into a water barrel and began raising them as pets. However, he knew that this small home could be only temporary. Munsenberger went to the<br>
mayor and offered the gators as a gift to the city. The mayor accepted even though there wasn’t really a place to keep the animals. He finally decided to put the gators in the recently completed pond in San Jacinto Plaza.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;El Paso residents soon began to think of the gators as community pets. They gave each gator a name—Humpy, Sally, Ally, Don Porfirio, Mimmie, and Abercrombie. The gators quickly became local celebrities. El Paso newspapers reported their activities as though they were respected citizens. News accounts detailed the latest gator facts, and gossip columns included gator rumors. One local<br>
newspaper even ran a weekly column called “Alligators’ Tails.” The column&nbsp;related the “true” history of how alligators came to El Paso, as told by one of the alligators. People throughout the city shared tall tales and anecdotes about their unusual new neighbors. As these tales spread, each gator seemed to take on a unique personality. For example,<br>
witnesses claimed that Ally liked music. They said that he would wag his tail whenever a mariachi band performed in<br>
the park.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Alligators occupied the pond in San Jacinto Plaza for some 80 years. Over the years the original alligators died and were replaced with new ones. The alligators remained a popular local attraction and could be seen sunning themselves during the warmer months. Although El Paso is<br>
usually warm and sunny, its winters were cold for the gators. When temperatures dropped, usually in late October, the gators would retreat to the center of the pond. They would remain there in a type of hibernation until warmer days returned. Around March the gators would crawl back out of the water. Many El Pasoans came to view the alligators’ reappearance as a sure sign of spring.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the gators were by nature dangerous animals. On a few occasions park workers were attacked. Although most El Pasoans were fond of the alligators, people often involved the gators in risky pranks and practical jokes. On at least one occasion, a gator was placed in a hotel room to welcome an unsuspecting tourist. Once, students from a local college kidnapped one of the large reptiles and put it in the school swimming pool. Some of these exploits were even more harmful. There were incidents in which the alligators were mistreated and abused. In the 1960s two alligators were stoned to&nbsp;death, and another lost an eye. Park officials became worried about the gators’ safety and wisely decided to move them to<br>
the city zoo. Though the gators made a brief return to the pond in the 1970s, protected by a plastic enclosure, the zoo<br>
eventually became their permanent home.</p>

        </p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After they left San Jacinto Plaza, the gators gradually faded into El Paso’s past. Then in 1987 city officials asked Jiménez to create a work of art for downtown El Paso. An El Paso native, Jiménez remembered seeing the gators as a boy. He knew that they held special memories for many El Pasoans and chose to make them the subject of the statue. The statue took Jiménez eight years to complete. It depicts<br>
four alligators seeming to lunge out from the fountain, two with their mouths <span class="txt-underline">agape</span>, their sharp teeth bared as if ready to attack. Mist from the fountain keeps the gators looking moist and lifelike. Those in attendance at the dedication were happy that the park’s most famous citizens had finally returned—at least in spirit—to San Jacinto Plaza.</p>

          <strong>Gators Roam Downtown Plaza Again</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Wesley Schanen</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; EL PASO, Texas—After an absence of more than 20 years, alligators are again the center of attention downtown. But don’t worry—these gators are harmless. They are part of artist Luis Jiménez’s latest sculpture, titled <em>Plaza de los<br>
Lagartos</em>, which means “Plaza of the Alligators.”</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of residents gathered in San Jacinto Plaza to dedicate the large fiberglass statue and fountain. It is located near the area where live alligators once roamed the plaza’s pond. The statue brought back fond memories for many who attended the dedication. Some older El Pasoans related stories of childhood visits to the real gator pond in the 1950s and 1960s. Younger residents, however, found it hard to believe that gators actually lived in the park, hundreds of miles from the nearest swamp.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;According to legend, the whole thing started as a joke. Around 1883 an El Paso miner named Adolph Munsenberger received a package about the size of a shoe&nbsp;box from a friend in Louisiana. Inside he found six baby alligators along with a note from his friend. The note suggested that Munsenberger use the alligators to haul mining carts. By all accounts Munsenberger took the joke well. He put the little reptiles into a water barrel and began raising them as pets. However, he knew that this small home could be only temporary. Munsenberger went to the<br>
mayor and offered the gators as a gift to the city. The mayor accepted even though there wasn’t really a place to keep the animals. He finally decided to put the gators in the recently completed pond in San Jacinto Plaza.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;El Paso residents soon began to think of the gators as community pets. They gave each gator a name—Humpy, Sally, Ally, Don Porfirio, Mimmie, and Abercrombie. The gators quickly became local celebrities. El Paso newspapers reported their activities as though they were respected citizens. News accounts detailed the latest gator facts, and gossip columns included gator rumors. One local<br>
newspaper even ran a weekly column called “Alligators’ Tails.” The column&nbsp;related the “true” history of how alligators came to El Paso, as told by one of the alligators. People throughout the city shared tall tales and anecdotes about their unusual new neighbors. As these tales spread, each gator seemed to take on a unique personality. For example,<br>
witnesses claimed that Ally liked music. They said that he would wag his tail whenever a mariachi band performed in<br>
the park.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Alligators occupied the pond in San Jacinto Plaza for some 80 years. Over the years the original alligators died and were replaced with new ones. The alligators remained a popular local attraction and could be seen sunning themselves during the warmer months. Although El Paso is<br>
usually warm and sunny, its winters were cold for the gators. When temperatures dropped, usually in late October, the gators would retreat to the center of the pond. They would remain there in a type of hibernation until warmer days returned. Around March the gators would crawl back out of the water. Many El Pasoans came to view the alligators’ reappearance as a sure sign of spring.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the gators were by nature dangerous animals. On a few occasions park workers were attacked. Although most El Pasoans were fond of the alligators, people often involved the gators in risky pranks and practical jokes. On at least one occasion, a gator was placed in a hotel room to welcome an unsuspecting tourist. Once, students from a local college kidnapped one of the large reptiles and put it in the school swimming pool. Some of these exploits were even more harmful. There were incidents in which the alligators were mistreated and abused. In the 1960s two alligators were stoned to&nbsp;death, and another lost an eye. Park officials became worried about the gators’ safety and wisely decided to move them to<br>
the city zoo. Though the gators made a brief return to the pond in the 1970s, protected by a plastic enclosure, the zoo<br>
eventually became their permanent home.</p>

        </p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After they left San Jacinto Plaza, the gators gradually faded into El Paso’s past. Then in 1987 city officials asked Jiménez to create a work of art for downtown El Paso. An El Paso native, Jiménez remembered seeing the gators as a boy. He knew that they held special memories for many El Pasoans and chose to make them the subject of the statue. The statue took Jiménez eight years to complete. It depicts<br>
four alligators seeming to lunge out from the fountain, two with their mouths <span class="txt-underline">agape</span>, their sharp teeth bared as if ready to attack. Mist from the fountain keeps the gators looking moist and lifelike. Those in attendance at the dedication were happy that the park’s most famous citizens had finally returned—at least in spirit—to San Jacinto Plaza.</p>

          <strong>Gators Roam Downtown Plaza Again</strong>

          <strong>Gators Roam Downtown Plaza Again</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Wesley Schanen</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; EL PASO, Texas—After an absence of more than 20 years, alligators are again the center of attention downtown. But don’t worry—these gators are harmless. They are part of artist Luis Jiménez’s latest sculpture, titled <em>Plaza de los<br>
Lagartos</em>, which means “Plaza of the Alligators.”</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of residents gathered in San Jacinto Plaza to dedicate the large fiberglass statue and fountain. It is located near the area where live alligators once roamed the plaza’s pond. The statue brought back fond memories for many who attended the dedication. Some older El Pasoans related stories of childhood visits to the real gator pond in the 1950s and 1960s. Younger residents, however, found it hard to believe that gators actually lived in the park, hundreds of miles from the nearest swamp.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;According to legend, the whole thing started as a joke. Around 1883 an El Paso miner named Adolph Munsenberger received a package about the size of a shoe&nbsp;box from a friend in Louisiana. Inside he found six baby alligators along with a note from his friend. The note suggested that Munsenberger use the alligators to haul mining carts. By all accounts Munsenberger took the joke well. He put the little reptiles into a water barrel and began raising them as pets. However, he knew that this small home could be only temporary. Munsenberger went to the<br>
mayor and offered the gators as a gift to the city. The mayor accepted even though there wasn’t really a place to keep the animals. He finally decided to put the gators in the recently completed pond in San Jacinto Plaza.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;El Paso residents soon began to think of the gators as community pets. They gave each gator a name—Humpy, Sally, Ally, Don Porfirio, Mimmie, and Abercrombie. The gators quickly became local celebrities. El Paso newspapers reported their activities as though they were respected citizens. News accounts detailed the latest gator facts, and gossip columns included gator rumors. One local<br>
newspaper even ran a weekly column called “Alligators’ Tails.” The column&nbsp;related the “true” history of how alligators came to El Paso, as told by one of the alligators. People throughout the city shared tall tales and anecdotes about their unusual new neighbors. As these tales spread, each gator seemed to take on a unique personality. For example,<br>
witnesses claimed that Ally liked music. They said that he would wag his tail whenever a mariachi band performed in<br>
the park.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Alligators occupied the pond in San Jacinto Plaza for some 80 years. Over the years the original alligators died and were replaced with new ones. The alligators remained a popular local attraction and could be seen sunning themselves during the warmer months. Although El Paso is<br>
usually warm and sunny, its winters were cold for the gators. When temperatures dropped, usually in late October, the gators would retreat to the center of the pond. They would remain there in a type of hibernation until warmer days returned. Around March the gators would crawl back out of the water. Many El Pasoans came to view the alligators’ reappearance as a sure sign of spring.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the gators were by nature dangerous animals. On a few occasions park workers were attacked. Although most El Pasoans were fond of the alligators, people often involved the gators in risky pranks and practical jokes. On at least one occasion, a gator was placed in a hotel room to welcome an unsuspecting tourist. Once, students from a local college kidnapped one of the large reptiles and put it in the school swimming pool. Some of these exploits were even more harmful. There were incidents in which the alligators were mistreated and abused. In the 1960s two alligators were stoned to&nbsp;death, and another lost an eye. Park officials became worried about the gators’ safety and wisely decided to move them to<br>
the city zoo. Though the gators made a brief return to the pond in the 1970s, protected by a plastic enclosure, the zoo<br>
eventually became their permanent home.</p>

        </p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After they left San Jacinto Plaza, the gators gradually faded into El Paso’s past. Then in 1987 city officials asked Jiménez to create a work of art for downtown El Paso. An El Paso native, Jiménez remembered seeing the gators as a boy. He knew that they held special memories for many El Pasoans and chose to make them the subject of the statue. The statue took Jiménez eight years to complete. It depicts<br>
four alligators seeming to lunge out from the fountain, two with their mouths <span class="txt-underline">agape</span>, their sharp teeth bared as if ready to attack. Mist from the fountain keeps the gators looking moist and lifelike. Those in attendance at the dedication were happy that the park’s most famous citizens had finally returned—at least in spirit—to San Jacinto Plaza.</p>

          <strong>Home Sweet Catalog Home</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In 1925, the year I turned 13, a Sears catalog changed my life. Up until then my family had rented a tiny three-room apartment on Main Street. My three brothers slept in the bedroom with my parents. My younger sister and I slept on a foldaway sofa in the living room. Daddy didn’t make much money as a coal miner, so having our own house seemed like an impossible dream—that is, until the day the <em>Sears Modern Homes</em> catalog came in the mail. Daddy had ordered the catalog and paid a whole dollar for it. Mama wasn’t too happy about his spending so extravagantly on a catalog, but Daddy said it was worth every penny.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The catalog showed the different houses that could be built from a Sears do-it-yourself home kit. The kit came with everything a family needed to build its very own house. There were blueprints and a book of instructions that showed how to build the house, as well as all the wood, nails, paint, roofing, and so on. Each house had a different name, such as the Salem or the Woodland. Some of the houses were big and some small, but they were all beautiful. It didn’t seem possible that we could ever have a home like one of those.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mama thought Daddy was just dreaming. She looked at the catalog over his shoulder. “John, that house costs more than a thousand dollars!” Mama exclaimed. “We can’t afford that.”</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“There are cheaper houses in here,” Daddy said, flipping to a different page and contemplating the features of another house. “Look! Here’s one that starts around $600—the Estes.” He put the catalog down and looked at my mother. “Grace, you know no bank will give us a loan so we can get our own place. But we can do it if you get a job to help make the extra money.”</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">

        </p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mama still looked doubtful. It took a while, but Daddy finally wore down Mama’s resistance. Mama found a job as a seamstress, sewing clothes for people. She was able to work from home, so she could still take care of the little ones. I even started collecting soda bottles to make money. After several months we used our family’s small savings to buy a piece of land outside town. Then we all studied the catalog until we just about knew it by heart. We finally decided to order a house called the Solace. It had not one, not two, but <em>three </em>bedrooms—one for my parents, one for the boys, and one for us girls!</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally the big day came. Our kit arrived at the train station, and we had to go pick it up. Daddy borrowed a wagon and two horses to pull the kit. Then he, my older brother Peter, and I rode to the station together. I had read in the catalog that each home kit contained 30,000 pieces, but it didn’t really sink in until I saw how enormous our shipment was. Again and again we loaded the wagon with the pieces we would use to build our house. Again and again we made the trip between the train station and our land. How my arms ached from loading and unloading that wagon!</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;During the weeks before our house arrived, on Daddy’s days off, he and my oldest brother had dug and laid the foundation for the house. The day after our shipment came, we all started to build the frame. Daddy called this the bones of the house—the pieces of wood that would later be covered by the walls and the roof. It was hard work, but Daddy’s excitement was contagious. Even the little kids helped out by sorting the materials. Sears had told the truth—the kit contained everything we needed to build our dream house, including doorknobs, windowpanes, and flooring.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Every minute that Daddy wasn’t working in the mines was spent working on our house. Every day our dream was slowly becoming a reality. Mama was talking about where she would hang the curtains she was making with the material left over from her sewing jobs.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then disaster struck. Daddy became sick with a bad cold that turned into pneumonia. The doctor told us that Daddy had to stay in bed and that it could take him weeks, even months, to get better. Daddy was too sick to argue. The sound of his coughing filled our apartment. Meanwhile, five miles away, our house stood unfinished. It was September, and the days were getting shorter and colder. I knew how badly Daddy had wanted to finish the house before winter, but that seemed unlikely now. Our hopes of ever finishing it started to fade.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One afternoon when Daddy was sleeping, Mama gathered all of us together. There was an <span class="txt-underline">obstinate</span> look on her face. I had seen this look before, when Mama had her mind set on something, and I knew that nothing was going to stand in her way. “I’ve been reading the directions Sears sent,” she said in a firm voice, “and we are going to finish our house.” It was Mama’s turn to take over.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We were surprised, but we weren’t about to argue. Whenever she could, Mama would go to the house and work. She would tell Daddy she was running errands or taking the younger kids out to the park so that he could get his rest. As soon as school was out for the day, my older brother and I would go straight to the house. We built and painted walls. We laid down pine floors. We even put black tar paper on the roof to waterproof it and covered that with shingles. Sometimes Mama got a friend or neighbor to help, but she and my brothers and sister and I did most of the work. The best part was that Daddy didn’t know what we were up to. Several weeks later, when he was feeling much better, he got the surprise of his life. As we all stood inside our new home and looked around, Daddy’s face had the biggest smile I have ever seen.</p>

          <strong>Home Sweet Catalog Home</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In 1925, the year I turned 13, a Sears catalog changed my life. Up until then my family had rented a tiny three-room apartment on Main Street. My three brothers slept in the bedroom with my parents. My younger sister and I slept on a foldaway sofa in the living room. Daddy didn’t make much money as a coal miner, so having our own house seemed like an impossible dream—that is, until the day the <em>Sears Modern Homes</em> catalog came in the mail. Daddy had ordered the catalog and paid a whole dollar for it. Mama wasn’t too happy about his spending so extravagantly on a catalog, but Daddy said it was worth every penny.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The catalog showed the different houses that could be built from a Sears do-it-yourself home kit. The kit came with everything a family needed to build its very own house. There were blueprints and a book of instructions that showed how to build the house, as well as all the wood, nails, paint, roofing, and so on. Each house had a different name, such as the Salem or the Woodland. Some of the houses were big and some small, but they were all beautiful. It didn’t seem possible that we could ever have a home like one of those.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mama thought Daddy was just dreaming. She looked at the catalog over his shoulder. “John, that house costs more than a thousand dollars!” Mama exclaimed. “We can’t afford that.”</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“There are cheaper houses in here,” Daddy said, flipping to a different page and contemplating the features of another house. “Look! Here’s one that starts around $600—the Estes.” He put the catalog down and looked at my mother. “Grace, you know no bank will give us a loan so we can get our own place. But we can do it if you get a job to help make the extra money.”</p>

        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mama still looked doubtful. It took a while, but Daddy finally wore down Mama’s resistance. Mama found a job as a seamstress, sewing clothes for people. She was able to work from home, so she could still take care of the little ones. I even started collecting soda bottles to make money. After several months we used our family’s small savings to buy a piece of land outside town. Then we all studied the catalog until we just about knew it by heart. We finally decided to order a house called the Solace. It had not one, not two, but <em>three </em>bedrooms—one for my parents, one for the boys, and one for us girls!</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally the big day came. Our kit arrived at the train station, and we had to go pick it up. Daddy borrowed a wagon and two horses to pull the kit. Then he, my older brother Peter, and I rode to the station together. I had read in the catalog that each home kit contained 30,000 pieces, but it didn’t really sink in until I saw how enormous our shipment was. Again and again we loaded the wagon with the pieces we would use to build our house. Again and again we made the trip between the train station and our land. How my arms ached from loading and unloading that wagon!</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;During the weeks before our house arrived, on Daddy’s days off, he and my oldest brother had dug and laid the foundation for the house. The day after our shipment came, we all started to build the frame. Daddy called this the bones of the house—the pieces of wood that would later be covered by the walls and the roof. It was hard work, but Daddy’s excitement was contagious. Even the little kids helped out by sorting the materials. Sears had told the truth—the kit contained everything we needed to build our dream house, including doorknobs, windowpanes, and flooring.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Every minute that Daddy wasn’t working in the mines was spent working on our house. Every day our dream was slowly becoming a reality. Mama was talking about where she would hang the curtains she was making with the material left over from her sewing jobs.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then disaster struck. Daddy became sick with a bad cold that turned into pneumonia. The doctor told us that Daddy had to stay in bed and that it could take him weeks, even months, to get better. Daddy was too sick to argue. The sound of his coughing filled our apartment. Meanwhile, five miles away, our house stood unfinished. It was September, and the days were getting shorter and colder. I knew how badly Daddy had wanted to finish the house before winter, but that seemed unlikely now. Our hopes of ever finishing it started to fade.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One afternoon when Daddy was sleeping, Mama gathered all of us together. There was an <span class="txt-underline">obstinate</span> look on her face. I had seen this look before, when Mama had her mind set on something, and I knew that nothing was going to stand in her way. “I’ve been reading the directions Sears sent,” she said in a firm voice, “and we are going to finish our house.” It was Mama’s turn to take over.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We were surprised, but we weren’t about to argue. Whenever she could, Mama would go to the house and work. She would tell Daddy she was running errands or taking the younger kids out to the park so that he could get his rest. As soon as school was out for the day, my older brother and I would go straight to the house. We built and painted walls. We laid down pine floors. We even put black tar paper on the roof to waterproof it and covered that with shingles. Sometimes Mama got a friend or neighbor to help, but she and my brothers and sister and I did most of the work. The best part was that Daddy didn’t know what we were up to. Several weeks later, when he was feeling much better, he got the surprise of his life. As we all stood inside our new home and looked around, Daddy’s face had the biggest smile I have ever seen.</p>

          <strong>Home Sweet Catalog Home</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In 1925, the year I turned 13, a Sears catalog changed my life. Up until then my family had rented a tiny three-room apartment on Main Street. My three brothers slept in the bedroom with my parents. My younger sister and I slept on a foldaway sofa in the living room. Daddy didn’t make much money as a coal miner, so having our own house seemed like an impossible dream—that is, until the day the <em>Sears Modern Homes</em> catalog came in the mail. Daddy had ordered the catalog and paid a whole dollar for it. Mama wasn’t too happy about his spending so extravagantly on a catalog, but Daddy said it was worth every penny.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The catalog showed the different houses that could be built from a Sears do-it-yourself home kit. The kit came with everything a family needed to build its very own house. There were blueprints and a book of instructions that showed how to build the house, as well as all the wood, nails, paint, roofing, and so on. Each house had a different name, such as the Salem or the Woodland. Some of the houses were big and some small, but they were all beautiful. It didn’t seem possible that we could ever have a home like one of those.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mama thought Daddy was just dreaming. She looked at the catalog over his shoulder. “John, that house costs more than a thousand dollars!” Mama exclaimed. “We can’t afford that.”</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“There are cheaper houses in here,” Daddy said, flipping to a different page and contemplating the features of another house. “Look! Here’s one that starts around $600—the Estes.” He put the catalog down and looked at my mother. “Grace, you know no bank will give us a loan so we can get our own place. But we can do it if you get a job to help make the extra money.”</p>

        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mama still looked doubtful. It took a while, but Daddy finally wore down Mama’s resistance. Mama found a job as a seamstress, sewing clothes for people. She was able to work from home, so she could still take care of the little ones. I even started collecting soda bottles to make money. After several months we used our family’s small savings to buy a piece of land outside town. Then we all studied the catalog until we just about knew it by heart. We finally decided to order a house called the Solace. It had not one, not two, but <em>three </em>bedrooms—one for my parents, one for the boys, and one for us girls!</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally the big day came. Our kit arrived at the train station, and we had to go pick it up. Daddy borrowed a wagon and two horses to pull the kit. Then he, my older brother Peter, and I rode to the station together. I had read in the catalog that each home kit contained 30,000 pieces, but it didn’t really sink in until I saw how enormous our shipment was. Again and again we loaded the wagon with the pieces we would use to build our house. Again and again we made the trip between the train station and our land. How my arms ached from loading and unloading that wagon!</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;During the weeks before our house arrived, on Daddy’s days off, he and my oldest brother had dug and laid the foundation for the house. The day after our shipment came, we all started to build the frame. Daddy called this the bones of the house—the pieces of wood that would later be covered by the walls and the roof. It was hard work, but Daddy’s excitement was contagious. Even the little kids helped out by sorting the materials. Sears had told the truth—the kit contained everything we needed to build our dream house, including doorknobs, windowpanes, and flooring.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Every minute that Daddy wasn’t working in the mines was spent working on our house. Every day our dream was slowly becoming a reality. Mama was talking about where she would hang the curtains she was making with the material left over from her sewing jobs.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then disaster struck. Daddy became sick with a bad cold that turned into pneumonia. The doctor told us that Daddy had to stay in bed and that it could take him weeks, even months, to get better. Daddy was too sick to argue. The sound of his coughing filled our apartment. Meanwhile, five miles away, our house stood unfinished. It was September, and the days were getting shorter and colder. I knew how badly Daddy had wanted to finish the house before winter, but that seemed unlikely now. Our hopes of ever finishing it started to fade.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One afternoon when Daddy was sleeping, Mama gathered all of us together. There was an <span class="txt-underline">obstinate</span> look on her face. I had seen this look before, when Mama had her mind set on something, and I knew that nothing was going to stand in her way. “I’ve been reading the directions Sears sent,” she said in a firm voice, “and we are going to finish our house.” It was Mama’s turn to take over.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We were surprised, but we weren’t about to argue. Whenever she could, Mama would go to the house and work. She would tell Daddy she was running errands or taking the younger kids out to the park so that he could get his rest. As soon as school was out for the day, my older brother and I would go straight to the house. We built and painted walls. We laid down pine floors. We even put black tar paper on the roof to waterproof it and covered that with shingles. Sometimes Mama got a friend or neighbor to help, but she and my brothers and sister and I did most of the work. The best part was that Daddy didn’t know what we were up to. Several weeks later, when he was feeling much better, he got the surprise of his life. As we all stood inside our new home and looked around, Daddy’s face had the biggest smile I have ever seen.</p>
