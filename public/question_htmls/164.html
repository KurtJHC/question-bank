          <strong>Read the following passage and answer questions 36-40.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jacob hated finishing things almost as much as he loved starting them. As a result, he had gotten into a million hobbies and activities, but he never stuck with any of them long enough to get any good.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He begged his mother for months for a guitar so that he could play Black Eyed Peas songs to Angie, a girl he liked, but after he finally got one for Christmas, he found out that guitars don’t play themselves. He took a few lessons, but strumming the strings hurt his fingers and he didn’t like holding the pick, so now the five-hundred dollar guitar lives under his bed.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After reading an ad in the back of one of his comic books, Jacob decided that he wanted a Wonder Sweeper 5000 metal detector, so that he could find buried pirate treasure. So he mowed lawns all summer and didn’t spend his money on ice-cream like his younger brother, Alex. He saved it all in a shoe box in his closet. Then he shoveled driveways all winter, and he didn’t spend his money on candy and chips like his classmates. By the time spring came he had saved $200, and he purchased the Wonder-Sweeper 5000 metal detector. He beeped it around the park for a while, be he soon found out that no pirates had ever set sail in his neighborhood, and if they had they didn’t leave any treasure. Even though he found a key ring, forty-seven cents, and all the bottle caps he could throw, he buried the metal detector in his closest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Given Jacob’s history with hobbies, it was no surprise that Jacob’s father was reluctant to buy him a magician’s kit for his birthday. “Geez, Jacob… You sure you wouldn’t rather I got you more guitar lessons?” He suggested.&nbsp; Jacob was insistent. “Dad, you’ve got to get me the magician’s kit. This time I’ll stick with it for real. I promise! Come on, Dad,” Jacob begged.&nbsp; Jacob’s father sighed and then replied, “Oh, I don’t know, Jacob. Things are awfully tight right now.” But Jacob’s father was reminded of his own youth long ago, when he quit football and started karate practice before hardly getting his equipment dirty. So when Jacob’s birthday came around, Jacob was both surprised and pleased to find the magician’s kit that he had desired so badly with a big bright bow on it.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Read the following passage and answer questions 36-40.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jacob hated finishing things almost as much as he loved starting them. As a result, he had gotten into a million hobbies and activities, but he never stuck with any of them long enough to get any good.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He begged his mother for months for a guitar so that he could play Black Eyed Peas songs to Angie, a girl he liked, but after he finally got one for Christmas, he found out that guitars don’t play themselves. He took a few lessons, but strumming the strings hurt his fingers and he didn’t like holding the pick, so now the five-hundred dollar guitar lives under his bed.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After reading an ad in the back of one of his comic books, Jacob decided that he wanted a Wonder Sweeper 5000 metal detector, so that he could find buried pirate treasure. So he mowed lawns all summer and didn’t spend his money on ice-cream like his younger brother, Alex. He saved it all in a shoe box in his closet. Then he shoveled driveways all winter, and he didn’t spend his money on candy and chips like his classmates. By the time spring came he had saved $200, and he purchased the Wonder-Sweeper 5000 metal detector. He beeped it around the park for a while, be he soon found out that no pirates had ever set sail in his neighborhood, and if they had they didn’t leave any treasure. Even though he found a key ring, forty-seven cents, and all the bottle caps he could throw, he buried the metal detector in his closest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Given Jacob’s history with hobbies, it was no surprise that Jacob’s father was reluctant to buy him a magician’s kit for his birthday. “Geez, Jacob… You sure you wouldn’t rather I got you more guitar lessons?” He suggested.&nbsp; Jacob was insistent. “Dad, you’ve got to get me the magician’s kit. This time I’ll stick with it for real. I promise! Come on, Dad,” Jacob begged.&nbsp; Jacob’s father sighed and then replied, “Oh, I don’t know, Jacob. Things are awfully tight right now.” But Jacob’s father was reminded of his own youth long ago, when he quit football and started karate practice before hardly getting his equipment dirty. So when Jacob’s birthday came around, Jacob was both surprised and pleased to find the magician’s kit that he had desired so badly with a big bright bow on it.&nbsp;</p>

          <em>May 21</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is coming closer. Today it was almost on top of the ridge, though not quite, because when I looked with the binoculars, I could not see the flame, but still only the smoke — rising very fast, not far above the fire. I know where it is: at the crossroads. Just on the other side of the ridge, the east-west highway, the Dean Town Road, crosses our road. It is Route Number 9, a state highway, bigger than our road, which is County Road 793. He has stopped there and is deciding whether to follow Number 9 or come over the ridge. I say <em>he</em> because that is what I think of, though it could be <em>they</em> or even <em>she</em>. But I think it is he. If he decides to follow the highway, he will go away, and everything will be all right again. Why would he come back? But if he comes to the top of the ridge, he is sure to come down here, because he will see the green leaves. On the other side of the ridge, even on the other side of Burden Hill, there are no leaves; everything is dead.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are some things I need to explain. One is why I am afraid. Another is why I am writing in this composition book, which I got from Klein's store a mile up the road. I took the book and a supply of ball-point pens back in February. By then the last radio station, a very faint one that I could only hear at night had stopped broadcasting. It had been dead for about three or four months. I say <em>about</em>, and that is one reason I got the book: because I discovered I was forgetting when things happened, and sometimes even <em>whether</em> things happened or not. Another reason I got it is that I thought writing in it might be like having someone to talk to, and if I read it back later it would be&nbsp;like someone talking to me. But the truth is I haven't written in it much after all, because there isn't much to write about.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sometimes I would put in what the weather was like, if there was a storm or something unusual. I put in when I planted the garden because I thought that would be useful to know next year. But most of the time I didn't write, because one day was just like the day before, and sometimes I thought — what's the use of writing anyway, when nobody is ever going to read it? Then I would remind myself: sometime, years from now, <em>you’re</em> going to read it. I was pretty sure I was the only person left in the world. But now I have something to write about. I was wrong. I am not the only person left in the world. I am both excited and afraid.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At first when all the others went away, I hated being alone, and I watched the road all day and most of the night hoping that a car, <em>anybody</em>, would come over the hill from either direction. When I slept, I would dream that one came and drove on past without knowing I was here; then I would wake up and run to the road looking for the taillight disappearing. Then the weeks went by and the radio stations went off, one by one. When the last one went off and stayed off, it came to me, finally, that nobody, no car, was ever going to come. Of course I thought it was the batteries in my radio that had run down, so I got new batteries from the store. I tried them in the flashlight and it lit, so I knew it was really the station. Anyway, the man on the last radio station had said he was going to have to go off; there wasn't any more power. He kept repeating his latitude and longitude, though he was not on a ship, he was on land — somewhere near Boston, Massachusetts. He said some other things, too, that I did not like to hear. And that started me thinking. Suppose a car came over the hill, and I ran out, and whoever was in it got out — suppose he was crazy? Or suppose it was someone mean, or even cruel, and brutal? A murderer? What could I do? The fact is, the man on the radio, toward the end, sounded crazy. He was afraid; there were only a few people left where he was and not much food. He said that men should act with dignity even in the face of death, which no one was better off than any other. He pleaded on the radio, and I knew something terrible was happening there. Once he broke down and cried on the radio.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So I decided: if anyone does come, I want to see who it is before I show myself. It is one thing to hope for someone to come when things are civilised, when there are other people around, too. But when there is nobody else, then the whole idea changes. This is what I gradually realised. There are worse things than being alone. It was after I thought about that, that I began moving my things to the cave.</p>

          <strong>Almost a Dragon</strong>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cameron liked dragons. He thought about them all the time. When he rode the bus to school, he pretended he was a huge dragon flying down the street. When he played tag at recess, he pretended he was a fierce dragon chasing princes and princesses. When he drank from the water fountain, he pretended he was a thirsty dragon drinking hot melted rock from a volcano. But in school Cameron’s class never talked about dragons. So far this year they had looked at polar bears and plants and prairie dogs, but not dragons. This week they were learning about dinosaurs and everyone had chosen a favourite one to dress up as, for a dinosaur parade. Everyone, except Cameron. He liked dinosaurs well enough, but he’d much rather be a dragon.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the other kids cut and painted and pasted, Cameron walked around the classroom, pretending he was breathing fire. His friend Cherry showed him her Stegosaurus costume. “See these sharp spines at the end of my tail?” she asked Cameron. “Stegosauruses used these for self-defence.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cameron wasn’t impressed.<sup>1 </sup>“Dragons breathe fire for self-defence,” he told her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Look at me,” Amy said as she painted an old pair of cloth shoes to match the rest of her costume. “I’m Dromiceiomimus and I can run faster than any other dinosaur.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Dragons don’t have to run, they can fly!” Cameron answered.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Calvin was dressing up as Triceratops. “I’ve got three horns,” he bragged, “and I’m as long as this classroom!”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Dragons are as long as the whole school,” replied Cameron.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Well, what about Diplodocus?” asked Mike. “It was big, too, and it used its long tail like a whip.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cameron shrugged.<sup>2</sup> “Dragons don’t need any whips. They’re not afraid of anything.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“But dragons aren’t real,” said Calvin, fixing one of the horns on his costume. “And dinosaurs were. You’d better hurry up and choose which dinosaur you’re going to be.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cameron shoved his hands deep into his pockets and walked away talking to himself. “Grrrrrr!” he growled. “I’m a monster dragon and I eat dinosaurs for dinner.” He bumped right into his teacher.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Hey, Cameron,” she said. “I bet you didn’t know that not everyone thought dragons were monsters. Long ago in China, a dragon was the sign of a king.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Really?” Cameron was surprised.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Really,” said his teacher.</p>
        <p>Cameron suddenly had an idea. He remembered something about kings and dinosaurs. “I’ve got it!” he shouted. “I know what kind of dinosaur I can be.”</p>
        <p>And with the he busily set to work on his costume.</p>
        <p>The next day was the day of the dinosaur parade. The whole class lined up in their costumes. Stegosaurus came first, then Dromiceiomimus and Triceratops and Diplodocus. So many dinosaurs!</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At the end of the line stood Cameron. He didn’t have wings like a dragon and he didn’t breathe fire like a dragon, but he was as kingly as a dragon. He was … king of the dinosaurs.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mother is far and away the most important figure in the life of a young chimpanzee. Brothers and sisters can be good playmates, but since babies normally are born six years apart, by the time the new baby is three, the older <span class="txt-underline">offspring</span> often is on its own. . . .</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The baby is born in a tree, on a bed of twigs and leaves where Mother has been resting for a day. No one else knows about the arrival, not even the older sister or brother. The baby is very weak at first, barely able to hold on. Mother has to climb slowly, cradling it awkwardly. First-time mothers do not always know how to make a baby comfortable, and sometimes they hurt the baby by squeezing too hard when they are only trying to help.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A few hours after leaving the birth nest, the baby starts meeting other chimpanzees. Everyone is interested in the new arrival, but the mother is very cautious about letting anyone near. When she sees a big male, she crouches low with her baby beneath her, grunting softly at the male and bobbing her head. He gently reaches out to touch her, as if to say, “Don’t worry. I won’t bother you.”. . .</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the time, Mother keeps her little family away from the other chimpanzees. She carries her baby between food trees, sometimes followed by the next youngest offspring. . . .</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;For a young chimpanzee, being alone with Mother often is boring because she spends longer gathering food than the young one does. The offspring may sit staring into space or pick the wings off an unfortunate butterfly. Sometimes there are better playthings. A favourite game is to climb up a slender sapling until it starts to bend — then hold on tight as it comes crashing to the forest floor. Of course, the best times come when the group meets another family. All the youngsters like to play chase games: One will wave a stick temptingly just out of the other’s reach and then run off with it when the playmate tries to grab it. When the pursuer catches the tease, they wrestle and tickle each other, laughing madly. Young males tend to get carried away; they always seem to end up in a fight, and the mothers have to break it up.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Given the choice, young females prefer quieter games, such as carrying tiny babies about. Some girls are lucky enough to have an infant sister or brother. Others get to play with babies only when they meet another family. Still, if her mother doesn’t want to stay with the baby’s family, the young female might try to persuade her by following the baby herself.</p>
        <p>• • •</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Life isn’t always easy. For several weeks during the dry season, the infant may go to bed hungry every night. Mother’s milk is a comfort in the early years, but by the age of five or six, Mother will gently push away the young one’s face when he or she snuggles onto her lap to nurse. If the young one is repeatedly turned away, he or she will whimper, tug on Mother’s arm, scream, slap the ground, hit the bushes, and finally crash off in a rage. Mother and child always make it up, however, and at the end of the day, they crawl into a fresh leaf bed and lie side by side in comfort and peace.</p>

          <em>Louisiana Kitchen — Introduction</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Louisiana is a terrific setting for a cook because of its bountiful natural resources, including a variety of wildlife and a wealth of fresh seafood that is extraordinary because of the state’s diverse water resources: the brackish waters in the coastal wetlands and in many of the southernmost lakes, the salt water of the Gulf, and the freshwater lakes and streams throughout the state. Also, our subtropical climate produces a taste in fruits and vegetables that is unmatched — when the taste is there, it’s just really staggering.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It took me many years to understand that it was the use of local fresh products that was the single most important factor in good eating. One of my strongest memories of my mother’s cooking is her use of only fresh ingredients. We had no refrigeration, so we’d go out in the fields to get what we needed. When we dug up potatoes, within two hours they’d be in the pot, cooked and eaten. I couldn’t seem to get a potato to taste like my mother’s until I realised that it wasn’t anything that was done in the kitchen — it was just the freshness of the potato that made it completely different. This principle carries over to all foods.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The ingredients in Cajun food have always depended on what you could get, so it changed depending on where you were. If you lived near New Orleans or the coast, you used seafood. But where we lived, there was no salt water and no transportation to reach it, so we had crawfish, which live in sweet water; and we had an endless supply of game, and there was chicken, pork, beef and all kinds of vegetables.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cajuns still make use of the plentiful crawfish, as well as chicken and pork (which is frequently smoked) and seasonal game. Filé powder, parsley, bay leaves, cayenne and black peppers and a variety of other hot peppers are the primary seasonings. Rice, an abundant Louisiana crop, is a staple of Cajun cooking.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;People often ask me what’s the difference between Cajun and Creole cooking. Cajun and Creole cuisines share many similarities. Both are Louisiana born, with French roots. But Cajun is very old, French country cooking — simple, hearty fare. Cajun food began in southern France, moved on to Nova Scotia and then came to Louisiana. The Acadians adapted their dishes to use ingredients that grew wild in the area — bay leaves from the laurel tree, filé powder from the sassafras tree and an abundance of different peppers such as cayenne, Tabasco peppers, banana peppers and bird’s-eye peppers that grow wild in South Louisiana — learning their uses from the native Indians.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The evolution of Creole cooking, just like the Cajun, has depended heavily on whatever foods have been available. But Creole food, unlike Cajun, began in New Orleans&nbsp;and is a mixture of the traditions of Italian, French, Spanish, American Indian, African and other ethnic groups. Seven flags flew over New Orleans in the early days, and each time a new nation took over, many members of the deposed government would leave the city; most of their cooks and other servants stayed behind. The position of cook was highly esteemed and the best paid position in the household. Those cooks, most of whom were black, would be hired by other families, often of a different nationality. Of course, the cooks would have to change their style of cooking. Over a period of time, they learned how to cook for a variety of nationalities, and they incorporated their own spicy, home-style way of cooking into the different cuisines of their employers. This is the way Creole food was created. Creole cooking is more sophisticated and complex than Cajun cooking — it’s city cooking.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Today, in homes, there is still a distinction between Cajun and Creole cooking; in restaurants, little distinction remains. That’s why I’ve begun referring to the two together as one — Louisiana cooking.</p>

          <strong>Rootabaga Stories</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>Rootabaga Stories</em> is a collection of fanciful tales that Carl Sandburg originally told as bedtime stories for his three daughters. Some of his interests as a poet, folksinger, and social activist find their way into the stories, but in lighthearted ways. The stories are primarily intended as <strong>whimsical</strong> entertainment, not as social commentary or moral inspiration.</p>

        </p>
        <p>(excerpt) <strong>How They Broke Away to Go to the Rootabaga Country</strong></p>
        <p>Gimme the Ax lived in a house where everything is the same as it always was.</p>
        <p>“The chimney sits on top of the house and lets the smoke out,” said Gimme the Ax. “The doorknobs open the doors. The windows are always either open or shut. We are always either upstairs or downstairs in this house. Everything is the same as it always was.”</p>
        <p>So he decided to let his children name themselves.</p>
        <p>“The first words they speak as soon as they learn to make words shall be their names,” he said. “They shall name themselves.”</p>
        <p>When the first boy came to the house of Gimme the Ax, he was named Please Gimme. When the first girl came she was named Ax Me No Questions.</p>
        <p>… And they kept on living in the house where everything is the same as it always was. They learned to say just as their father said, “The chimney sits on top of the house and lets the smoke out, the doorknobs open the doors, the windows are always either open or shut, we are always either upstairs or downstairs—everything is the same as it always was.”…</p>
        <p>… So they sold everything they had, pigs, pastures, 6 pepper pickers, pitchforks, everything except their ragbags and a few extras.</p>
        <p>When their neighbors saw them selling everything they had, the different neighbors said, “They are going to Kansas, to Kokomo, to Canada, to Kankakee, to Kalamazoo, to Kamchatka, to the Chattahoochee.”</p>
        <p>…Then [the father] took Please Gimme, his oldest and youngest and only son, and Ax Me No Questions, his oldest and youngest and only daughter, and went to the railroad station.</p>
        <p>The ticket agent was sitting at the window selling railroad tickets the same as always.</p>
        <p>“Do you wish a ticket to go away and come back or do you wish a ticket to go away and never come back?” the ticket agent asked wiping sleep out of his eyes.</p>
        <p>“We wish a ticket to ride where the railroad tracks run off into the sky and never come back—send us far as the railroad rails go and then forty ways farther yet,” was the reply of Gimme the Ax.</p>
        <p>“Then I will give you a new ticket. It blew in. It is a long slick yellow leather slab ticket with a blue spanch across it.”</p>

          <strong>Rootabaga Stories</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>Rootabaga Stories</em> is a collection of fanciful tales that Carl Sandburg originally told as bedtime stories for his three daughters. Some of his interests as a poet, folksinger, and social activist find their way into the stories, but in lighthearted ways. The stories are primarily intended as <strong>whimsical</strong> entertainment, not as social commentary or moral inspiration.</p>

        </p>
        <p>(excerpt) <strong>How They Broke Away to Go to the Rootabaga Country</strong></p>
        <p>Gimme the Ax lived in a house where everything is the same as it always was.</p>
        <p>“The chimney sits on top of the house and lets the smoke out,” said Gimme the Ax. “The doorknobs open the doors. The windows are always either open or shut. We are always either upstairs or downstairs in this house. Everything is the same as it always was.”</p>
        <p>So he decided to let his children name themselves.</p>
        <p>“The first words they speak as soon as they learn to make words shall be their names,” he said. “They shall name themselves.”</p>
        <p>When the first boy came to the house of Gimme the Ax, he was named Please Gimme. When the first girl came she was named Ax Me No Questions.</p>
        <p>… And they kept on living in the house where everything is the same as it always was. They learned to say just as their father said, “The chimney sits on top of the house and lets the smoke out, the doorknobs open the doors, the windows are always either open or shut, we are always either upstairs or downstairs—everything is the same as it always was.”…</p>
        <p>… So they sold everything they had, pigs, pastures, 6 pepper pickers, pitchforks, everything except their ragbags and a few extras.</p>
        <p>When their neighbors saw them selling everything they had, the different neighbors said, “They are going to Kansas, to Kokomo, to Canada, to Kankakee, to Kalamazoo, to Kamchatka, to the Chattahoochee.”</p>
        <p>…Then [the father] took Please Gimme, his oldest and youngest and only son, and Ax Me No Questions, his oldest and youngest and only daughter, and went to the railroad station.</p>
        <p>The ticket agent was sitting at the window selling railroad tickets the same as always.</p>
        <p>“Do you wish a ticket to go away and come back or do you wish a ticket to go away and never come back?” the ticket agent asked wiping sleep out of his eyes.</p>
        <p>“We wish a ticket to ride where the railroad tracks run off into the sky and never come back—send us far as the railroad rails go and then forty ways farther yet,” was the reply of Gimme the Ax.</p>
        <p>“Then I will give you a new ticket. It blew in. It is a long slick yellow leather slab ticket with a blue spanch across it.”</p>
