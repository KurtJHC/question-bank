          <strong>The Importance of Music in My Life</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I believe music has the ability to convey all sorts of emotion. Whether the emotion is joy and happiness or sadness and despair through rhythms, harmonies and the lyrics music shows it. The song “A little bit longer” by Nick Jonas is such an emotional and inspiring song that when I hear it, I always come close to tears, especially when I watch it being played live. The effect that music can have on our emotions is tremendous, as it can bring people to floods of tears or bursts of laughter.<br>
The musical images that music and song are able to create are amazing. Music has the ability to transport me back in time just like a time machine. It lets me revisit lost and forgotten moments in life. Songs can paint a picture, for example in classical and country music where a story is being told. The music in classical music tells a story without lyrics which is an immensely powerful thing. I feel that this applies to the saying “music imitates life and life imitates music”.</p>

Recently song writing has wandered its way into my life. I believe there is no better way to express myself than through song. After a bad day, it’s nice to be able to sit down and write about it. It can make all your problems just disappear and float away. Listening to other musical artists that I like gives me inspiration. My guitar teacher also points me in the right direction and gives me guidance as I need it. I love to just sit with my guitar and make up random lyrics about past experiences or what I’m going through at the moment.</p>
        <p><br>
I started learning how to play the guitar last year and within the past few months I have fallen completely and utterly in love with it. Once I start playing, I find it extremely hard to put the guitar down again. It’s very addictive and can also be distracting sometimes. It distracts me from my homework since my guitar sits right next to my desk. Playing guitar is one of the only things in my life which I don’t feel pressured to do well in. I think this is because I have a great teacher and she doesn’t push me to do the music exams.</p>

This past summer my grandma taught me how to play the piano. I had always heard stories about how my great grandfather, her father, was brilliant at the piano.

          <strong>The Importance of Music in My Life</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I believe music has the ability to convey all sorts of emotion. Whether the emotion is joy and happiness or sadness and despair through rhythms, harmonies and the lyrics music shows it. The song “A little bit longer” by Nick Jonas is such an emotional and inspiring song that when I hear it, I always come close to tears, especially when I watch it being played live. The effect that music can have on our emotions is tremendous, as it can bring people to floods of tears or bursts of laughter.<br>
The musical images that music and song are able to create are amazing. Music has the ability to transport me back in time just like a time machine. It lets me revisit lost and forgotten moments in life. Songs can paint a picture, for example in classical and country music where a story is being told. The music in classical music tells a story without lyrics which is an immensely powerful thing. I feel that this applies to the saying “music imitates life and life imitates music”.</p>
        <p><br>
Recently song writing has wandered its way into my life. I believe there is no better way to express myself than through song. After a bad day, it’s nice to be able to sit down and write about it. It can make all your problems just disappear and float away. Listening to other musical artists that I like gives me inspiration. My guitar teacher also points me in the right direction and gives me guidance as I need it. I love to just sit with my guitar and make up random lyrics about past experiences or what I’m going through at the moment.</p>
        <p><br>
I started learning how to play the guitar last year and within the past few months I have fallen completely and utterly in love with it. Once I start playing, I find it extremely hard to put the guitar down again. It’s very addictive and can also be distracting sometimes. It distracts me from my homework since my guitar sits right next to my desk. Playing guitar is one of the only things in my life which I don’t feel pressured to do well in. I think this is because I have a great teacher and she doesn’t push me to do the music exams.</p>
        <p><br>
This past summer my grandma taught me how to play the piano. I had always heard stories about how my great grandfather, her father, was brilliant at the piano. He would sit at the piano for hours on end playing different well-known songs as well as making up his own little tunes. He had taught my grandma how to play and I felt it was about time that I learnt. So when I was staying with my grandma and grandpa during the summer, I asked her to teach me. She was delighted and now it’s something nice that we can both do together and bond over.</p>

            <strong>DUNG BEETLES ARE TOUGHER THAN YOU THINK</strong>
          </span>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>During the past decade or so researchers have noticed an invasive insect that has gone largely unstudied. The invasive insect in question is known as the “bigheaded ant.” Bigheaded ants have been observed invading territory that belongs to dung beetles, and to a lesser extent termites, and a few other insects that are attracted to faeces. Typically, bugs do not fare well when their environment is invaded by a notoriously invasive species of insect. So, the question is: how are dung beetles faring against their new invasive ant neighbours? Can the beetles still roll dung? Have they been forced to relocate?</p>
        <p>Unfortunately for the bigheaded ants, dung beetles are tough, and do not take kindly to uninvited guests as dung beetles are known for being territorial. The bigheaded ants, similar to the dung beetle, also seem attached to the various mounds of animal faeces littering the African savannah, but dung beetles carry on with their business as though the bigheaded ants are not even there.</p>
        <p>Dung beetles&nbsp;may adapt to the presence of the hostile invader ants&nbsp;by laying their eggs in burrows built into the pieces of dung that the beetles find and collect. By doing this, the dung beetle is able to protect its larvae from the bigheaded ants. This is impressive since bigheaded ants are known for their aggressive behaviour. For example, other aggressive and resilient bugs are quickly killed as soon as the bigheaded ant shows up. Fearsome insects such as safari ants and the stinging acacia ants cannot stand up to the aggression of the bigheaded ant like the dung beetle can, and this is probably as much respect as you will ever have for a bug that spends its days burrowing in faeces.</p>

The bigheaded ants, similar to the dung beetle, also seem attached to the various mounds of animal faeces littering the African savannah, but dung beetles carry on with their business as though the bigheaded ants are not even there.</p>
        <p>Dung beetles&nbsp;may adapt to the presence of the hostile invader ants&nbsp;by laying their eggs in burrows built into the pieces of dung that the beetles find and collect. By doing this, the dung beetle is able to protect its larvae from the bigheaded ants. This is impressive since bigheaded ants are known for their aggressive behaviour. For example, other aggressive and resilient bugs are quickly killed as soon as the bigheaded ant shows up. Fearsome insects such as safari ants and the stinging acacia ants cannot stand up to the aggression of the bigheaded ant like the dung beetle can, and this is probably as much respect as you will ever have for a bug that spends its days burrowing in faeces.</p>

        <p>During the past decade or so researchers have noticed an invasive insect that has gone largely unstudied. The invasive insect in question is known as the “bigheaded ant.” Bigheaded ants have been observed invading territory that belongs to dung beetles, and to a lesser extent termites, and a few other insects that are attracted to faeces. Typically, bugs do not fare well when their environment is invaded by a notoriously invasive species of insect. So, the question is: how are dung beetles faring against their new invasive ant neighbours? Can the beetles still roll dung? Have they been forced to relocate?</p>
        <p>Unfortunately for the bigheaded ants, dung beetles are tough, and do not take kindly to uninvited guests as dung beetles are known for being territorial.

            <strong>DUNG BEETLES ARE TOUGHER THAN YOU THINK</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>During the past decade or so researchers have noticed an invasive insect that has gone largely unstudied. The invasive insect in question is known as the “bigheaded ant.” Bigheaded ants have been observed invading territory that belongs to dung beetles, and to a lesser extent termites, and a few other insects that are attracted to faeces. Typically, bugs do not fare well when their environment is invaded by a notoriously invasive species of insect. So, the question is: how are dung beetles faring against their new invasive ant neighbours? Can the beetles still roll dung? Have they been forced to relocate?</p>
        <p>Unfortunately for the bigheaded ants, dung beetles are tough, and do not take kindly to uninvited guests as dung beetles are known for being territorial. The bigheaded ants, similar to the dung beetle, also seem attached to the various mounds of animal faeces littering the African savannah, but dung beetles carry on with their business as though the bigheaded ants are not even there.</p>
        <p>Dung beetles&nbsp;may adapt to the presence of the hostile invader ants&nbsp;by laying their eggs in burrows built into the pieces of dung that the beetles find and collect. By doing this, the dung beetle is able to protect its larvae from the bigheaded ants. This is impressive since bigheaded ants are known for their aggressive behaviour. For example, other aggressive and resilient bugs are quickly killed as soon as the bigheaded ant shows up. Fearsome insects such as safari ants and the stinging acacia ants cannot stand up to the aggression of the bigheaded ant like the dung beetle can, and this is probably as much respect as you will ever have for a bug that spends its days burrowing in faeces.</p>

        <p>I don’t believe in dissing books I used to love, and I always suspect the moral judgment of people who sneer at the taste of the reader they used to be: “I know thee not, old book.” Palgrave’s Golden Treasury accompanied me everywhere for two or three teenage years. It was the most popular British anthology of verse and the embodiment of traditional taste, which meant all the famous poems were there. I loved them, and I still do. But The New American Poetry, 1945-1960 knocked that all into exhilarating, intoxicating, inspiring, enthralling confusion and showed me new forms of delight.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>We moved to this house eight years ago, because we thought that at last we’d have room for all our books. No chance! Every time I go into town I accidentally buy two or three books. Foreign editions of my own books crowd in from all over the world like eels making for the river where they were spawned. When we first moved here, I paid my younger son to arrange the books in the downstairs “study”. He has a librarian’s mind, and his arrangement held good until so many more books arrived that they burst the banks of the subject headings. Now it’s just memory and guesswork that guide me to this pile or that shelf. I’m often delightfully surprised by a book I’d forgotten. Occasionally I get rid of some. It would be nice to keep one copy of the Thai edition of my fairy tales, but do I really need 10? So from time to time I go through and pick out everything I don’t want and take it to the charity shop. It’s only skimming the froth, though.</p>

Now it’s just memory and guesswork that guide me to this pile or that shelf. I’m often delightfully surprised by a book I’d forgotten. Occasionally I get rid of some. It would be nice to keep one copy of the Thai edition of my fairy tales, but do I really need 10? So from time to time I go through and pick out everything I don’t want and take it to the charity shop. It’s only skimming the froth, though.</p>
