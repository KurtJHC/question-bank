Gardenias are members of the madder, or Rubiaceae, family. Though not native to either North or South America, they were named for an eighteenth-century American physician and naturalist, Alexander Garden. Gardenias were originally found only in China and Japan, but today there are over 200 different species of gardenia, mostly hybrid, in existence throughout the world. Gardenias are most prevalent in China, Japan, tropical regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific islands, and South Africa. With proper conditions, gardenias grow into shrub-like bushes or small trees that can reach 5 ft (1.5 m) in height.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Gardenias love a well-drained, humus-rich, acidic soil in a sunny or partly shaded position. Although gardenias can tolerate dry conditions, you should be watering them weekly, and even more in extreme heat. Just be careful not to overwater them as this can cause other problems.</p>
        <p>Choose a fertiliser for acid-loving plants for your gardenias, and spread it in spring or summer for best results. If you want to spread mulch around your gardenias, go for a woodchip or sawdust variety. This will also add acid to your soil to help growth.</p>
        <p>There’s a range of garden pests that can affect gardenia blooms. Aphids can be a problem as they suck fluid from the plant and stunt its growth. If you can see them underneath the leaves, spray with an insecticide. You can also spray for mealybug and scale as well. If you notice that the buds are falling to the ground, this may be a sign of weevils or leaf hoppers, which can also be sprayed.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
I had once thought gardenias were the best flowers. They had a heavy perfume, creamy white petals, and thick glossy leaves. A wristlet of gardenias was the coveted flower of high school proms. But after my brother’s funeral, I no longer liked gardenias. Their beauty and scent belied their purpose as the messenger of grief. When gardenias arrived after my father died, the smell was nauseating.</p>
        <p>In my story Gardenias, I used the imagery of a room choked full of gardenias. The dark green leaves were viewed as stiff and sharp enough to cut tender skin. Their heads bowed as they died and the creamy white petals turned brown at the edges and curled like the fingers of corpses.<br>

The beloved debut novel from one of Australia’s foremost storytellers. Epic and passionate, White Gardenia will sweep you away ...</p>
        <p>‘Mama, Mama,’ I said to myself, ‘keep safe. You will survive, and I will survive, until we can find each other again.’</p>
        <p>In a district of the city of Harbin, a haven for White Russian families since Russia’s Communist revolution, Alina Kozlova must make a heartbreaking decision if her only child, Anya, is to survive the final days of World War II. White Gardenia sweeps across cultures and continents, from the glamorous nightclubs of Shanghai to the harshness of Cold War Soviet Russia in the 1960s, from a desolate island in the Pacific Ocean to a new life in post-war Australia. Both mother and daughter must make sacrifices, but is the price too high? Most importantly of all, will they ever find each other again?</p>

Gardenias are members of the madder, or Rubiaceae, family. Though not native to either North or South America, they were named for an eighteenth-century American physician and naturalist, Alexander Garden. Gardenias were originally found only in China and Japan, but today there are over 200 different species of gardenia, mostly hybrid, in existence throughout the world. Gardenias are most prevalent in China, Japan, tropical regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific islands, and South Africa. With proper conditions, gardenias grow into shrub-like bushes or small trees that can reach 5 ft (1.5 m) in height.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Gardenias love a well-drained, humus-rich, acidic soil in a sunny or partly shaded position. Although gardenias can tolerate dry conditions, you should be watering them weekly, and even more in extreme heat. Just be careful not to overwater them as this can cause other problems.</p>

Gardenias are members of the madder, or Rubiaceae, family. Though not native to either North or South America, they were named for an eighteenth-century American physician and naturalist, Alexander Garden. Gardenias were originally found only in China and Japan, but today there are over 200 different species of gardenia, mostly hybrid, in existence throughout the world. Gardenias are most prevalent in China, Japan, tropical regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific islands, and South Africa. With proper conditions, gardenias grow into shrub-like bushes or small trees that can reach 5 ft (1.5 m) in height.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Gardenias love a well-drained, humus-rich, acidic soil in a sunny or partly shaded position. Although gardenias can tolerate dry conditions, you should be watering them weekly, and even more in extreme heat. Just be careful not to overwater them as this can cause other problems.</p>
        <p>Choose a fertiliser for acid-loving plants for your gardenias, and spread it in spring or summer for best results. If you want to spread mulch around your gardenias, go for a woodchip or sawdust variety. This will also add acid to your soil to help growth.</p>
        <p>There’s a range of garden pests that can affect gardenia blooms. Aphids can be a problem as they suck fluid from the plant and stunt its growth. If you can see them underneath the leaves, spray with an insecticide. You can also spray for mealybug and scale as well. If you notice that the buds are falling to the ground, this may be a sign of weevils or leaf hoppers, which can also be sprayed.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
I had once thought gardenias were the best flowers. They had a heavy perfume, creamy white petals, and thick glossy leaves. A wristlet of gardenias was the coveted flower of high school proms. But after my brother’s funeral, I no longer liked gardenias. Their beauty and scent belied their purpose as the messenger of grief. When gardenias arrived after my father died, the smell was nauseating.</p>
        <p>In my story Gardenias, I used the imagery of a room choked full of gardenias. The dark green leaves were viewed as stiff and sharp enough to cut tender skin. Their heads bowed as they died and the creamy white petals turned brown at the edges and curled like the fingers of corpses.<br>

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Gardenias are members of the madder, or Rubiaceae, family. Though not native to either North or South America, they were named for an eighteenth-century American physician and naturalist, Alexander Garden. Gardenias were originally found only in China and Japan, but today there are over 200 different species of gardenia, mostly hybrid, in existence throughout the world. Gardenias are most prevalent in China, Japan, tropical regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific islands, and South Africa. With proper conditions, gardenias grow into shrub-like bushes or small trees that can reach 5 ft (1.5 m) in height.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Gardenias love a well-drained, humus-rich, acidic soil in a sunny or partly shaded position. Although gardenias can tolerate dry conditions, you should be watering them weekly, and even more in extreme heat. Just be careful not to overwater them as this can cause other problems.</p>
        <p>Choose a fertiliser for acid-loving plants for your gardenias, and spread it in spring or summer for best results. If you want to spread mulch around your gardenias, go for a woodchip or sawdust variety. This will also add acid to your soil to help growth.</p>
        <p>There’s a range of garden pests that can affect gardenia blooms. Aphids can be a problem as they suck fluid from the plant and stunt its growth. If you can see them underneath the leaves, spray with an insecticide. You can also spray for mealybug and scale as well. If you notice that the buds are falling to the ground, this may be a sign of weevils or leaf hoppers, which can also be sprayed.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
I had once thought gardenias were the best flowers. They had a heavy perfume, creamy white petals, and thick glossy leaves. A wristlet of gardenias was the coveted flower of high school proms. But after my brother’s funeral, I no longer liked gardenias. Their beauty and scent belied their purpose as the messenger of grief. When gardenias arrived after my father died, the smell was nauseating.</p>
        <p>In my story Gardenias, I used the imagery of a room choked full of gardenias. The dark green leaves were viewed as stiff and sharp enough to cut tender skin. Their heads bowed as they died and the creamy white petals turned brown at the edges and curled like the fingers of corpses.<br>

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Gardenias are members of the madder, or Rubiaceae, family. Though not native to either North or South America, they were named for an eighteenth-century American physician and naturalist, Alexander Garden. Gardenias were originally found only in China and Japan, but today there are over 200 different species of gardenia, mostly hybrid, in existence throughout the world.<br>
<br>
Gardenias are most prevalent in China, Japan, tropical regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific islands, and South Africa. With proper conditions, gardenias grow into shrub-like bushes or small trees that can reach 5 ft (1.5 m) in height.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Gardenias love a well-drained, humus-rich, acidic soil in a sunny or partly shaded position.<br>
<br>
Although gardenias can tolerate dry conditions, you should be watering them weekly, and even more in extreme heat. Just be careful not to overwater them as this can cause other problems.<br>
<br>
Choose a fertiliser for acid-loving plants for your gardenias, and spread it in spring or summer for best results. If you want to spread mulch around your gardenias, go for a woodchip or sawdust variety. This will also add acid to your soil to help growth.<br>
<br>
There’s a range of garden pests that can affect gardenia blooms. Aphids can be a problem as they suck fluid from the plant and stunt its growth. If you can see them underneath the leaves, spray with an insecticide. You can also spray for mealybug and scale as well. If you notice that the buds are falling to the ground, this may be a sign of weevils or leaf hoppers, which can also be sprayed.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
I had once thought gardenias were the best flowers. They had a heavy perfume, creamy white petals, and thick glossy leaves. A wristlet of gardenias was the coveted flower of high school proms. But after my brother’s funeral, I no longer liked gardenias. Their beauty and scent belied their purpose as the messenger of grief. When gardenias arrived after my father died, the smell was nauseating.<br>
<br>
In my story Gardenias, I used the imagery of a room choked full of gardenias. The dark green leaves were viewed as stiff and sharp enough to cut tender skin. Their heads bowed as they died and the creamy white petals turned brown at the edges and curled like the fingers of corpses.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D&nbsp;</strong>^}<br>
The beloved debut novel from one of Australia’s foremost storytellers. Epic and passionate, White Gardenia will sweep you away...<br>
<br>
‘Mama, Mama,’ I said to myself, ‘keep safe. You will survive, and I will survive, until we can find each other again.’<br>
<br>
In a district of the city of Harbin, a haven for White Russian families since Russia’s Communist revolution, Alina Kozlova must make a heartbreaking decision if her only child, Anya, is to survive the final days of World War II. White Gardenia sweeps across cultures and continents, from the glamorous nightclubs of Shanghai to the harshness of Cold War Soviet Russia in the 1960s, from a desolate island in the Pacific Ocean to a new life in post-war Australia. Both mother and daughter must make sacrifices, but is the price too high? Most importantly of all, will they ever find each other again?<br>
<br>
Rich in incident and historical detail, this is a compelling and beautifully written tale about yearning and forgiveness.<br>
