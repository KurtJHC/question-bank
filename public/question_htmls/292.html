          <strong>A Child's Christmas in Wales </strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <em>by Dylan Thomas (1914-1953)</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was on the afternoon of the Christmas Eve, and I was in Mrs. Prothero's garden, waiting for cats, with her son Jim. It was snowing. It was always snowing at Christmas. December, in my memory, is white as Lapland, though there were no reindeer. But there were cats. Patient, cold and callous, our hands wrapped in socks, we waited to snowball the cats. Sleek and long as jaguars and horrible-whiskered, spitting and snarling, they would slink and sidle over the white back-garden walls, and the lynx-eyed hunters, Jim and I, fur-capped and moccasined trappers from Hudson Bay, off Mumbles Road, would hurl our deadly snowballs at the green of their eyes. The wise cats never appeared.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We were so still, Eskimo-footed arctic marksmen in the muffling silence of the eternal snows - eternal, ever since Wednesday - that we never heard Mrs. Prothero's first cry from her igloo at the bottom of the garden. Or, if we heard it at all, it was, to us, like the far-off challenge of our enemy and prey, the neighbor's polar cat. But soon the voice grew louder.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Fire!" cried Mrs. Prothero, and she beat the dinner-gong.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And we ran down the garden, with the snowballs in our arms, toward the house; and smoke, indeed, was pouring out of the dining-room, and the gong was bombilating, and Mrs. Prothero was announcing ruin like a town crier in Pompeii. This was better than all the cats in Wales standing on the wall in a row. We bounded into the house, laden with snowballs, and stopped at the open door of the smoke-filled room.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Something was burning all right; perhaps it was Mr. Prothero, who always slept there after midday dinner with a newspaper over his face. But he was standing in the middle of the room, saying, "A fine Christmas!" and smacking at the smoke with a slipper.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Call the fire brigade," cried Mrs. Prothero as she beat the gong. "They won't be there," said Mr. Prothero, "it's Christmas." There was no fire to be seen, only clouds of smoke and Mr. Prothero standing in the middle of them, waving his slipper as though he were conducting.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Do something," he said. And we threw all our snowballs into the smoke - I think we missed Mr. Prothero - and ran out of the house to the telephone box.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Let's call the police as well," Jim said. "And the ambulance." "And Ernie Jenkins, he likes fires."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But we only called the fire brigade, and soon the fire engine came and three tall men in helmets brought a hose into the house and Mr. Prothero got out just in time before they turned it on. Nobody could have had a noisier Christmas Eve. And when the firemen turned off the hose and were standing in the wet, smoky room, Jim's Aunt, Miss. Prothero, came downstairs and peered in at them. Jim and I waited, very quietly, to hear what she would say to them. She said the right thing, always. She looked at the three tall firemen in their shining helmets, standing among the smoke and cinders and dissolving snowballs, and she said, "Would you like anything to read?"</p>

          <strong>A Child's Christmas in Wales </strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <em>by Dylan Thomas (1914-1953)</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was on the afternoon of the Christmas Eve, and I was in Mrs. Prothero's garden, waiting for cats, with her son Jim. It was snowing. It was always snowing at Christmas. December, in my memory, is white as Lapland, though there were no reindeer. But there were cats. Patient, cold and callous, our hands wrapped in socks, we waited to snowball the cats. Sleek and long as jaguars and horrible-whiskered, spitting and snarling, they would slink and sidle over the white back-garden walls, and the lynx-eyed hunters, Jim and I, fur-capped and moccasined trappers from Hudson Bay, off Mumbles Road, would hurl our deadly snowballs at the green of their eyes. The wise cats never appeared.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We were so still, Eskimo-footed arctic marksmen in the muffling silence of the eternal snows - eternal, ever since Wednesday - that we never heard Mrs. Prothero's first cry from her igloo at the bottom of the garden. Or, if we heard it at all, it was, to us, like the far-off challenge of our enemy and prey, the neighbor's polar cat. But soon the voice grew louder.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Fire!" cried Mrs. Prothero, and she beat the dinner-gong.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And we ran down the garden, with the snowballs in our arms, toward the house; and smoke, indeed, was pouring out of the dining-room, and the gong was bombilating, and Mrs. Prothero was announcing ruin like a town crier in Pompeii. This was better than all the cats in Wales standing on the wall in a row. We bounded into the house, laden with snowballs, and stopped at the open door of the smoke-filled room.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Something was burning all right; perhaps it was Mr. Prothero, who always slept there after midday dinner with a newspaper over his face. But he was standing in the middle of the room, saying, "A fine Christmas!" and smacking at the smoke with a slipper.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Call the fire brigade," cried Mrs. Prothero as she beat the gong. "They won't be there," said Mr. Prothero, "it's Christmas." There was no fire to be seen, only clouds of smoke and Mr. Prothero standing in the middle of them, waving his slipper as though he were conducting.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Do something," he said. And we threw all our snowballs into the smoke - I think we missed Mr. Prothero - and ran out of the house to the telephone box.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Let's call the police as well," Jim said. "And the ambulance." "And Ernie Jenkins, he likes fires."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But we only called the fire brigade, and soon the fire engine came and three tall men in helmets brought a hose into the house and Mr. Prothero got out just in time before they turned it on. Nobody could have had a noisier Christmas Eve. And when the firemen turned off the hose and were standing in the wet, smoky room, Jim's Aunt, Miss. Prothero, came downstairs and peered in at them. Jim and I waited, very quietly, to hear what she would say to them. She said the right thing, always. She looked at the three tall firemen in their shining helmets, standing among the smoke and cinders and dissolving snowballs, and she said, "Would you like anything to read?"</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was on the afternoon of the Christmas Eve, and I was in Mrs. Prothero's garden, waiting for cats, with her son Jim. It was snowing. It was always snowing at Christmas. December, in my memory, is white as Lapland, though there were no reindeer. But there were cats. Patient, cold and callous, our hands wrapped in socks, we waited to snowball the cats. Sleek and long as jaguars and horrible-whiskered, spitting and snarling, they would slink and sidle over the white back-garden walls, and the lynx-eyed hunters, Jim and I, fur-capped and moccasined trappers from Hudson Bay, off Mumbles Road, would hurl our deadly snowballs at the green of their eyes. The wise cats never appeared.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We were so still, Eskimo-footed arctic marksmen in the muffling silence of the eternal snows - eternal, ever since Wednesday - that we never heard Mrs. Prothero's first cry from her igloo at the bottom of the garden. Or, if we heard it at all, it was, to us, like the far-off challenge of our enemy and prey, the neighbor's polar cat. But soon the voice grew louder.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Fire!" cried Mrs. Prothero, and she beat the dinner-gong.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And we ran down the garden, with the snowballs in our arms, toward the house; and smoke, indeed, was pouring out of the dining-room, and the gong was bombilating, and Mrs. Prothero was announcing ruin like a town crier in Pompeii. This was better than all the cats in Wales standing on the wall in a row. We bounded into the house, laden with snowballs, and stopped at the open door of the smoke-filled room.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Something was burning all right; perhaps it was Mr. Prothero, who always slept there after midday dinner with a newspaper over his face. But he was standing in the middle of the room, saying, "A fine Christmas!" and smacking at the smoke with a slipper.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Call the fire brigade," cried Mrs. Prothero as she beat the gong. "They won't be there," said Mr. Prothero, "it's Christmas." There was no fire to be seen, only clouds of smoke and Mr. Prothero standing in the middle of them, waving his slipper as though he were conducting.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Do something," he said. And we threw all our snowballs into the smoke - I think we missed Mr. Prothero - and ran out of the house to the telephone box.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Let's call the police as well," Jim said. "And the ambulance." "And Ernie Jenkins, he likes fires."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But we only called the fire brigade, and soon the fire engine came and three tall men in helmets brought a hose into the house and Mr. Prothero got out just in time before they turned it on. Nobody could have had a noisier Christmas Eve. And when the firemen turned off the hose and were standing in the wet, smoky room, Jim's Aunt, Miss. Prothero, came downstairs and peered in at them. Jim and I waited, very quietly, to hear what she would say to them. She said the right thing, always. She looked at the three tall firemen in their shining helmets, standing among the smoke and cinders and dissolving snowballs, and she said, "Would you like anything to read?"</p>

          <strong>The Returning Cats</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">by David C. Knight</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1 &nbsp;&nbsp;In the autumn of 1968, a housewife in the suburbs of a large Midwestern city heard scratching sounds at her front door. Puzzled, she went to the door, opened it slowly, and after a few seconds exclaimed, “Jingles!”</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Jingles’ Story</strong>
        </p>
        <p>2 &nbsp;&nbsp;Jingles was the family’s black-and-white cat. The woman could scarcely believe her eyes because Jingles had been lost for over four weeks—ever since the family had missed the cat while on vacation at the lake resort nearly 300 miles away. When, at the end of the vacation, the cat had not shown up, they had to leave without him.</p>
        <p>3 &nbsp;&nbsp;At first the woman thought she must be mistaken. The cat <em>looked </em>like Jingles, but its fur was so matted and dirty that it was hard to tell. Also, one of its ears was torn and there were patches of dried blood on its back. But when the woman saw the grimy white star on the cat’s black chest, she knew it must be Jingles.</p>
        <p>4 &nbsp;&nbsp;The woman took Jingles into the bathroom and cleaned him up as best she could. Then she fed him. Except for his torn ear and a slight limp from a cut on one of his legs, Jingles seemed to be in reasonably good shape after his ordeal.</p>
        <p>5 &nbsp;&nbsp;Around the dinner table that night, the family talked about what poor Jingles must have gone through. How had the cat managed to stay alive for all those days and miles? How had it found food? How had the animal known in which direction the city lay and, once he had reached it, how had he made his way through the busy streets to the correct suburb and his home? The lake resort was so isolated, with twisting, confusing roads leading to it, that Jingles must have had to travel long miles through fields and woods on his way back. There were also several small rivers that the cat must have had to swim across.</p>
        <p>6 &nbsp;&nbsp;As the family shook their heads over these mysteries, Jingles purred happily on the sofa. Already he seemed to have forgotten his terrible experience and was content simply to be back with the people he loved.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Other Mystery Returns</strong>
        </p>
        <p>7 &nbsp;&nbsp;This story is not an unusual one. Cat owners all over the world have reported similar cases of their pets traveling long distances, overcoming tremendous obstacles, to find their way back to their homes. One cat, returning from New Jersey to Brooklyn, must have had to cross the Hudson and East Rivers. Whether it used bridges or swam, no one will ever know. Yet it reached home safely. Another cat, lost in the Arizona desert, somehow made its way across the sandy wasteland to its home in Phoenix—over 100 miles away.</p>
        <p>8 &nbsp;&nbsp;Some animal experts have compared this amazing ability of cats to that of homing pigeons. But there is one big difference. Pigeons must be trained by their owners to return. Each training period, they are taken farther and farther from their homes, until they have learned to fly back over great distances. But cats are given no such training. They just seem to <em>know </em>the way back.</p>
        <p>9 &nbsp;&nbsp;Does this “homing instinct” have something to do with cats’ keen sense of smell? It doesn’t seem likely. Even for cats, the smells of home would be too far off for them to sniff their way back. One scientist has suggested that homing pigeons—and perhaps cats as well—somehow use the earth’s magnetic field to guide them. But the scientist does not explain how this actually happens. There is also a theory that the cats’ strong sense of belonging to certain people and to a certain place somehow furnishes them with a special gift for knowing just how to return to those people and that place. It is still a mystery.</p>

        <p>1 &nbsp;&nbsp;In the autumn of 1968, a housewife in the suburbs of a large Midwestern city heard scratching sounds at her front door. Puzzled, she went to the door, opened it slowly, and after a few seconds exclaimed, “Jingles!”</p>

          <strong>Jingles’ Story</strong>
        </p>
        <p>2 &nbsp;&nbsp;Jingles was the family’s black-and-white cat. The woman could scarcely believe her eyes because Jingles had been lost for over four weeks—ever since the family had missed the cat while on vacation at the lake resort nearly 300 miles away. When, at the end of the vacation, the cat had not shown up, they had to leave without him.</p>
        <p>3 &nbsp;&nbsp;At first the woman thought she must be mistaken. The cat <em>looked </em>like Jingles, but its fur was so matted and dirty that it was hard to tell. Also, one of its ears was torn and there were patches of dried blood on its back. But when the woman saw the grimy white star on the cat’s black chest, she knew it must be Jingles.</p>
        <p>4 &nbsp;&nbsp;The woman took Jingles into the bathroom and cleaned him up as best she could. Then she fed him. Except for his torn ear and a slight limp from a cut on one of his legs, Jingles seemed to be in reasonably good shape after his ordeal.</p>
        <p>5 &nbsp;&nbsp;Around the dinner table that night, the family talked about what poor Jingles must have gone through. How had the cat managed to stay alive for all those days and miles? How had it found food? How had the animal known in which direction the city lay and, once he had reached it, how had he made his way through the busy streets to the correct suburb and his home? The lake resort was so isolated, with twisting, confusing roads leading to it, that Jingles must have had to travel long miles through fields and woods on his way back. There were also several small rivers that the cat must have had to swim across.</p>
        <p>6 &nbsp;&nbsp;As the family shook their heads over these mysteries, Jingles purred happily on the sofa. Already he seemed to have forgotten his terrible experience and was content simply to be back with the people he loved.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Other Mystery Returns</strong>
        </p>
        <p>7 &nbsp;&nbsp;This story is not an unusual one. Cat owners all over the world have reported similar cases of their pets traveling long distances, overcoming tremendous obstacles, to find their way back to their homes. One cat, returning from New Jersey to Brooklyn, must have had to cross the Hudson and East Rivers. Whether it used bridges or swam, no one will ever know. Yet it reached home safely. Another cat, lost in the Arizona desert, somehow made its way across the sandy wasteland to its home in Phoenix—over 100 miles away.</p>
        <p>8 &nbsp;&nbsp;Some animal experts have compared this amazing ability of cats to that of homing pigeons. But there is one big difference. Pigeons must be trained by their owners to return. Each training period, they are taken farther and farther from their homes, until they have learned to fly back over great distances. But cats are given no such training. They just seem to <em>know </em>the way back.</p>
        <p>9 &nbsp;&nbsp;Does this “homing instinct” have something to do with cats’ keen sense of smell? It doesn’t seem likely. Even for cats, the smells of home would be too far off for them to sniff their way back. One scientist has suggested that homing pigeons—and perhaps cats as well—somehow use the earth’s magnetic field to guide them. But the scientist does not explain how this actually happens. There is also a theory that the cats’ strong sense of belonging to certain people and to a certain place somehow furnishes them with a special gift for knowing just how to return to those people and that place. It is still a mystery.</p>

          <strong>Other Mystery Returns</strong>
        </p>
        <p>7 &nbsp;&nbsp;This story is not an unusual one. Cat owners all over the world have reported similar cases of their pets traveling long distances, overcoming tremendous obstacles, to find their way back to their homes. One cat, returning from New Jersey to Brooklyn, must have had to cross the Hudson and East Rivers. Whether it used bridges or swam, no one will ever know. Yet it reached home safely. Another cat, lost in the Arizona desert, somehow made its way across the sandy wasteland to its home in Phoenix—over 100 miles away.</p>
        <p>8 &nbsp;&nbsp;Some animal experts have compared this amazing ability of cats to that of homing pigeons. But there is one big difference. Pigeons must be trained by their owners to return. Each training period, they are taken farther and farther from their homes, until they have learned to fly back over great distances. But cats are given no such training. They just seem to <em>know </em>the way back.</p>
        <p>9 &nbsp;&nbsp;Does this “homing instinct” have something to do with cats’ keen sense of smell? It doesn’t seem likely. Even for cats, the smells of home would be too far off for them to sniff their way back. One scientist has suggested that homing pigeons—and perhaps cats as well—somehow use the earth’s magnetic field to guide them. But the scientist does not explain how this actually happens. There is also a theory that the cats’ strong sense of belonging to certain people and to a certain place somehow furnishes them with a special gift for knowing just how to return to those people and that place. It is still a mystery.</p>

          <strong>The Returning Cats</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">by David C. Knight</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1 &nbsp;&nbsp;In the autumn of 1968, a housewife in the suburbs of a large Midwestern city heard scratching sounds at her front door. Puzzled, she went to the door, opened it slowly, and after a few seconds exclaimed, “Jingles!”</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Jingles’ Story</strong>
        </p>
        <p>2 &nbsp;&nbsp;Jingles was the family’s black-and-white cat. The woman could scarcely believe her eyes because Jingles had been lost for over four weeks—ever since the family had missed the cat while on vacation at the lake resort nearly 300 miles away. When, at the end of the vacation, the cat had not shown up, they had to leave without him.</p>
        <p>3 &nbsp;&nbsp;At first the woman thought she must be mistaken. The cat <em>looked </em>like Jingles, but its fur was so matted and dirty that it was hard to tell. Also, one of its ears was torn and there were patches of dried blood on its back. But when the woman saw the grimy white star on the cat’s black chest, she knew it must be Jingles.</p>
        <p>4 &nbsp;&nbsp;The woman took Jingles into the bathroom and cleaned him up as best she could. Then she fed him. Except for his torn ear and a slight limp from a cut on one of his legs, Jingles seemed to be in reasonably good shape after his ordeal.</p>
        <p>5 &nbsp;&nbsp;Around the dinner table that night, the family talked about what poor Jingles must have gone through. How had the cat managed to stay alive for all those days and miles? How had it found food? How had the animal known in which direction the city lay and, once he had reached it, how had he made his way through the busy streets to the correct suburb and his home? The lake resort was so isolated, with twisting, confusing roads leading to it, that Jingles must have had to travel long miles through fields and woods on his way back. There were also several small rivers that the cat must have had to swim across.</p>
        <p>6 &nbsp;&nbsp;As the family shook their heads over these mysteries, Jingles purred happily on the sofa. Already he seemed to have forgotten his terrible experience and was content simply to be back with the people he loved.</p>
