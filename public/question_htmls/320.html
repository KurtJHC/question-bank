          <strong>many stones</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">by Carolyn Coman</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Our next stop on the bus tour is the limestone quarry where Mandela and the other prisoners had to work every day breaking rocks. Walls of white limestone spike up toward the sun, like some kind of gleaming, awful castle. Our guide tells us that the prisoners weren’t allowed to wear glasses, and a lot of them got eye problems from the glare—some condition that blocked their tear ducts and made it so they couldn’t cry. I never knew there was a condition like that. I thought you had to do it to yourself.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As we are leaving the quarry our guide points out a little tower of stones. He tells us that after the prison was shut down Mandela and a bunch of the former prisoners revisited the island. They walked to the quarry where they had spent years of their lives pounding rocks. Before they left, each man picked up a stone and set it down, in memory. That’s the tower we’re looking at, right out in the open, for everyone to see.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Inside the prison a man named Michael takes over as our tour guide. All the guides are former political prisoners. That really gets me. And it’s stupid, but I keep looking at Michael to see if he <em>looks </em>like a prisoner, the way I study pictures of murderers in the newspaper to see if they look like murderers. What do I expect, some little pitchfork above their heads, yellow eyes? There is so much that doesn’t show on the outside—which was probably Father Alan’s point.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But I keep looking at Michael, studying him. And what I see is a strong black man, standing in front of me, willing to show me the place where he was jailed for twenty years of his life.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;We make a semicircle around him so everyone can hear what he is saying, and then start to move through the prison section by section. This feels completely different from some stupid class trip, being dragged around the National Gallery by some blabby guide talking about symbolism. Michael points to a narrow staircase and tells us that up there was the most hated room on Robben Island. I think torture, interrogation.<sup>1</sup> I think of what Phillip<sup>2</sup> said about the bag over his brother’s head, how he is not walking anymore. I want Michael to say more, like I wanted Phillip to.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“That is the room where the guards read the letters that were sent to us—we could receive one letter a month, twelve letters a year—and they cut out any information they wanted to before they handed them over. Sometimes we would get a letter with only the signature of the person who wrote it.” He says what a hard thing it is to have news from the people you love taken away from you. “You have to have <em>stories</em>,” he says. He says it so fiercely I hold my breath. He shakes his tightened fist as if it holds all the stories that were taken out of all the letters, and then he doesn’t say any more. Finally he ushers us along: “Ladies and gentlemen, let us move forward.”</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">. . .</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Michael has moved our group along, moved us deeper into the prison building. I am still back at the bottom of the stairs, looking up to the most hated part of the prison, and thinking that what the guards did with the letters <em>was </em>torture.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;We sit on benches in a big room inside the prison where the prisoners did their studying, had classes, where some of them learned to read. Some of the guards learned to read in this room, too—the prisoners taught them, and kept watch so the other guards wouldn’t catch them getting taught by the prisoners. I think about telling Mom this story, how much she’ll love it. And I swear I can feel it, that people have learned to read here—as if patience and trying can get soaked up into the walls of places. Mom should be here. . . . And here I am!</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The best cells, Michael says, had a view of where the boat came in and departed from the island. Children of the guards came out, sometimes, to visit their fathers, and the prisoners in those cells could see them: the children. He says that having your family taken away from you makes you hungry for so much, so that if you can see a child running out from a boat, playing, “then you feel like the luckiest somebody.”</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;We have just come from seeing the cells, including #5, where Nelson Mandela lived for twenty-five years, with its bucket and folded blanket on the floor, his cage.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Michael tells us they fought for things that were worth fighting for: books, enough food so they didn’t get sick, hot water. Not about every little injustice. They picked the battles that made a difference between living and dying.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I feel small and smaller, sitting here, listening to him. It’s like big, important history drapes over everything here in South Africa—waiters and quarries and a president who had to live in a cage. Nothing I know comes close to being a matter of life and death, nothing I can think of. I remember how in third grade Mrs. Hogan had us make our own personal history books. We got to include all the stuff that marked what had happened in our lives so far. Almost everyone had learning to ride a bike, or moving, or a baby sister or brother being born. Grandparents dying, and dead animals, too—cats and dogs and gerbils. All the little stuff we thought was so important. But it was important to us! You can’t help how and where you are born, what family you get, what country you live in!</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When Michael invites us to ask questions, I want to, but I can’t. Someone asks about the size of the prison population. Someone else wants to know how the prisoners got news of what was going on in the outside world. Finally the man next to me asks, “Aren’t you bitter?” It is my father. “Why aren’t you bitter?” A good, real question. I’m glad he asked it, proud.</p>
        <p>14<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Michael sighs deeply. Then he says, heavily, “No.” It is a deep, final sound, his <em>no</em>. He says that being bitter will not help anything, will keep him from going forward. He says it is time to get on with other things, with reconciliation.<sup>3</sup></p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I believe him, but I don’t get it. I look hard at him again, the way I did earlier, to see if spending half his life in prison shows on him, only this time I am looking for whatever it is that lets him not be bitter, and it does not show either; it must be on the inside. He tells us that he and some of the former prisoners still live on the island, together with some of their former jailers.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Michael stands at the door as we file out to board the bus again and make our way back to the ferry. He shakes hands with each person in our group. I look him in the eye. I know this is stupid, but I try and put everything I think and feel into my handshake—my smallness, how I felt the reading in the walls of the classroom, how much I loved hearing him say “the luckiest somebody.” It occurs to me that maybe his history gave him the chance to get bigger, and he took it.</p>

          <strong>many stones</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">by Carolyn Coman</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Our next stop on the bus tour is the limestone quarry where Mandela and the other prisoners had to work every day breaking rocks. Walls of white limestone spike up toward the sun, like some kind of gleaming, awful castle. Our guide tells us that the prisoners weren’t allowed to wear glasses, and a lot of them got eye problems from the glare—some condition that blocked their tear ducts and made it so they couldn’t cry. I never knew there was a condition like that. I thought you had to do it to yourself.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As we are leaving the quarry our guide points out a little tower of stones.

And it’s stupid, but I keep looking at Michael to see if he <em>looks </em>like a prisoner, the way I study pictures of murderers in the newspaper to see if they look like murderers. What do I expect, some little pitchfork above their heads, yellow eyes? There is so much that doesn’t show on the outside—which was probably Father Alan’s point.</p>

          <strong>many stones</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">by Carolyn Coman</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Our next stop on the bus tour is the limestone quarry where Mandela and the other prisoners had to work every day breaking rocks. Walls of white limestone spike up toward the sun, like some kind of gleaming, awful castle. Our guide tells us that the prisoners weren’t allowed to wear glasses, and a lot of them got eye problems from the glare—some condition that blocked their tear ducts and made it so they couldn’t cry. I never knew there was a condition like that. I thought you had to do it to yourself.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As we are leaving the quarry our guide points out a little tower of stones. He tells us that after the prison was shut down Mandela and a bunch of the former prisoners revisited the island. They walked to the quarry where they had spent years of their lives pounding rocks. Before they left, each man picked up a stone and set it down, in memory. That’s the tower we’re looking at, right out in the open, for everyone to see.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Inside the prison a man named Michael takes over as our tour guide. All the guides are former political prisoners. That really gets me. And it’s stupid, but I keep looking at Michael to see if he <em>looks </em>like a prisoner, the way I study pictures of murderers in the newspaper to see if they look like murderers. What do I expect, some little pitchfork above their heads, yellow eyes? There is so much that doesn’t show on the outside—which was probably Father Alan’s point.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But I keep looking at Michael, studying him. And what I see is a strong black man, standing in front of me, willing to show me the place where he was jailed for twenty years of his life.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;We make a semicircle around him so everyone can hear what he is saying, and then start to move through the prison section by section. This feels completely different from some stupid class trip, being dragged around the National Gallery by some blabby guide talking about symbolism. Michael points to a narrow staircase and tells us that up there was the most hated room on Robben Island. I think torture, interrogation.<sup>1</sup> I think of what Phillip<sup>2</sup> said about the bag over his brother’s head, how he is not walking anymore. I want Michael to say more, like I wanted Phillip to.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“That is the room where the guards read the letters that were sent to us—we could receive one letter a month, twelve letters a year—and they cut out any information they wanted to before they handed them over. Sometimes we would get a letter with only the signature of the person who wrote it.” He says what a hard thing it is to have news from the people you love taken away from you. “You have to have <em>stories</em>,” he says. He says it so fiercely I hold my breath. He shakes his tightened fist as if it holds all the stories that were taken out of all the letters, and then he doesn’t say any more. Finally he ushers us along: “Ladies and gentlemen, let us move forward.”</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">. . .</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Michael has moved our group along, moved us deeper into the prison building. I am still back at the bottom of the stairs, looking up to the most hated part of the prison, and thinking that what the guards did with the letters <em>was </em>torture.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;We sit on benches in a big room inside the prison where the prisoners did their studying, had classes, where some of them learned to read. Some of the guards learned to read in this room, too—the prisoners taught them, and kept watch so the other guards wouldn’t catch them getting taught by the prisoners. I think about telling Mom this story, how much she’ll love it. And I swear I can feel it, that people have learned to read here—as if patience and trying can get soaked up into the walls of places. Mom should be here. . . . And here I am!</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The best cells, Michael says, had a view of where the boat came in and departed from the island. Children of the guards came out, sometimes, to visit their fathers, and the prisoners in those cells could see them: the children. He says that having your family taken away from you makes you hungry for so much, so that if you can see a child running out from a boat, playing, “then you feel like the luckiest somebody.”</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;We have just come from seeing the cells, including #5, where Nelson Mandela lived for twenty-five years, with its bucket and folded blanket on the floor, his cage.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Michael tells us they fought for things that were worth fighting for: books, enough food so they didn’t get sick, hot water. Not about every little injustice. They picked the battles that made a difference between living and dying.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I feel small and smaller, sitting here, listening to him. It’s like big, important history drapes over everything here in South Africa—waiters and quarries and a president who had to live in a cage. Nothing I know comes close to being a matter of life and death, nothing I can think of. I remember how in third grade Mrs. Hogan had us make our own personal history books. We got to include all the stuff that marked what had happened in our lives so far. Almost everyone had learning to ride a bike, or moving, or a baby sister or brother being born. Grandparents dying, and dead animals, too—cats and dogs and gerbils. All the little stuff we thought was so important. But it was important to us! You can’t help how and where you are born, what family you get, what country you live in!</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When Michael invites us to ask questions, I want to, but I can’t. Someone asks about the size of the prison population. Someone else wants to know how the prisoners got news of what was going on in the outside world. Finally the man next to me asks, “Aren’t you bitter?” It is my father. “Why aren’t you bitter?” A good, real question. I’m glad he asked it, proud.</p>
        <p>14<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Michael sighs deeply. Then he says, heavily, “No.” It is a deep, final sound, his <em>no</em>. He says that being bitter will not help anything, will keep him from going forward. He says it is time to get on with other things, with reconciliation.<sup>3</sup></p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I believe him, but I don’t get it. I look hard at him again, the way I did earlier, to see if spending half his life in prison shows on him, only this time I am looking for whatever it is that lets him not be bitter, and it does not show either; it must be on the inside. He tells us that he and some of the former prisoners still live on the island, together with some of their former jailers.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Michael stands at the door as we file out to board the bus again and make our way back to the ferry. He shakes hands with each person in our group. I look him in the eye. I know this is stupid, but I try and put everything I think and feel into my handshake—my smallness, how I felt the reading in the walls of the classroom, how much I loved hearing him say “the luckiest somebody.” It occurs to me that maybe his history gave him the chance to get bigger, and he took it.</p>
        <p><sup>1</sup><em>interrogation</em> — formal questioning</p>
        <p><sup>2</sup><em>Phillip</em> — a man the narrator met in Soweto, South Africa</p>
        <p><sup>3</sup><em>reconciliation</em> — settling differences</p>

          <strong>many stones</strong>

        <p class="txt-ctr">by Carolyn Coman</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Our next stop on the bus tour is the limestone quarry where Mandela and the other prisoners had to work every day breaking rocks. Walls of white limestone spike up toward the sun, like some kind of gleaming, awful castle. Our guide tells us that the prisoners weren’t allowed to wear glasses, and a lot of them got eye problems from the glare—some condition that blocked their tear ducts and made it so they couldn’t cry. I never knew there was a condition like that. I thought you had to do it to yourself.</p>

        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I believe him, but I don’t get it. I look hard at him again, the way I did earlier, to see if spending half his life in prison shows on him, only this time I am looking for whatever it is that lets him not be bitter, and it does not show either; it must be on the inside. He tells us that he and some of the former prisoners still live on the island, together with some of their former jailers.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Michael stands at the door as we file out to board the bus again and make our way back to the ferry. He shakes hands with each person in our group. I look him in the eye. I know this is stupid, but I try and put everything I think and feel into my handshake—my smallness, how I felt the reading in the walls of the classroom, how much I loved hearing him say “the luckiest somebody.” It occurs to me that maybe his history gave him the chance to get bigger, and he took it.</p>

          <strong>many stones</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">by Carolyn Coman</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Our next stop on the bus tour is the limestone quarry where Mandela and the other prisoners had to work every day breaking rocks. Walls of white limestone spike up toward the sun, like some kind of gleaming, awful castle. Our guide tells us that the prisoners weren’t allowed to wear glasses, and a lot of them got eye problems from the glare—some condition that blocked their tear ducts and made it so they couldn’t cry. I never knew there was a condition like that. I thought you had to do it to yourself.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As we are leaving the quarry our guide points out a little tower of stones. He tells us that after the prison was shut down Mandela and a bunch of the former prisoners revisited the island. They walked to the quarry where they had spent years of their lives pounding rocks. Before they left, each man picked up a stone and set it down, in memory. That’s the tower we’re looking at, right out in the open, for everyone to see.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Inside the prison a man named Michael takes over as our tour guide. All the guides are former political prisoners. That really gets me. And it’s stupid, but I keep looking at Michael to see if he <em>looks </em>like a prisoner, the way I study pictures of murderers in the newspaper to see if they look like murderers. What do I expect, some little pitchfork above their heads, yellow eyes? There is so much that doesn’t show on the outside—which was probably Father Alan’s point.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But I keep looking at Michael, studying him. And what I see is a strong black man, standing in front of me, willing to show me the place where he was jailed for twenty years of his life.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;We make a semicircle around him so everyone can hear what he is saying, and then start to move through the prison section by section. This feels completely different from some stupid class trip, being dragged around the National Gallery by some blabby guide talking about symbolism. Michael points to a narrow staircase and tells us that up there was the most hated room on Robben Island. I think torture, interrogation.<sup>1</sup> I think of what Phillip<sup>2</sup> said about the bag over his brother’s head, how he is not walking anymore. I want Michael to say more, like I wanted Phillip to.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“That is the room where the guards read the letters that were sent to us—we could receive one letter a month, twelve letters a year—and they cut out any information they wanted to before they handed them over. Sometimes we would get a letter with only the signature of the person who wrote it.” He says what a hard thing it is to have news from the people you love taken away from you. “You have to have <em>stories</em>,” he says. He says it so fiercely I hold my breath. He shakes his tightened fist as if it holds all the stories that were taken out of all the letters, and then he doesn’t say any more. Finally he ushers us along: “Ladies and gentlemen, let us move forward.”</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">. . .</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Michael has moved our group along, moved us deeper into the prison building. I am still back at the bottom of the stairs, looking up to the most hated part of the prison, and thinking that what the guards did with the letters <em>was </em>torture.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;We sit on benches in a big room inside the prison where the prisoners did their studying, had classes, where some of them learned to read. Some of the guards learned to read in this room, too—the prisoners taught them, and kept watch so the other guards wouldn’t catch them getting taught by the prisoners. I think about telling Mom this story, how much she’ll love it. And I swear I can feel it, that people have learned to read here—as if patience and trying can get soaked up into the walls of places. Mom should be here. . . . And here I am!</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The best cells, Michael says, had a view of where the boat came in and departed from the island. Children of the guards came out, sometimes, to visit their fathers, and the prisoners in those cells could see them: the children. He says that having your family taken away from you makes you hungry for so much, so that if you can see a child running out from a boat, playing, “then you feel like the luckiest somebody.”</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;We have just come from seeing the cells, including #5, where Nelson Mandela lived for twenty-five years, with its bucket and folded blanket on the floor, his cage.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Michael tells us they fought for things that were worth fighting for: books, enough food so they didn’t get sick, hot water. Not about every little injustice. They picked the battles that made a difference between living and dying.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I feel small and smaller, sitting here, listening to him. It’s like big, important history drapes over everything here in South Africa—waiters and quarries and a president who had to live in a cage. Nothing I know comes close to being a matter of life and death, nothing I can think of. I remember how in third grade Mrs. Hogan had us make our own personal history books. We got to include all the stuff that marked what had happened in our lives so far. Almost everyone had learning to ride a bike, or moving, or a baby sister or brother being born. Grandparents dying, and dead animals, too—cats and dogs and gerbils. All the little stuff we thought was so important. But it was important to us! You can’t help how and where you are born, what family you get, what country you live in!</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When Michael invites us to ask questions, I want to, but I can’t. Someone asks about the size of the prison population. Someone else wants to know how the prisoners got news of what was going on in the outside world. Finally the man next to me asks, “Aren’t you bitter?” It is my father. “Why aren’t you bitter?” A good, real question. I’m glad he asked it, proud.</p>
        <p>14<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Michael sighs deeply. Then he says, heavily, “No.” It is a deep, final sound, his <em>no</em>. He says that being bitter will not help anything, will keep him from going forward. He says it is time to get on with other things, with reconciliation.<sup>3</sup></p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I believe him, but I don’t get it. I look hard at him again, the way I did earlier, to see if spending half his life in prison shows on him, only this time I am looking for whatever it is that lets him not be bitter, and it does not show either; it must be on the inside. He tells us that he and some of the former prisoners still live on the island, together with some of their former jailers.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Michael stands at the door as we file out to board the bus again and make our way back to the ferry. He shakes hands with each person in our group. I look him in the eye. I know this is stupid, but I try and put everything I think and feel into my handshake—my smallness, how I felt the reading in the walls of the classroom, how much I loved hearing him say “the luckiest somebody.” It occurs to me that maybe his history gave him the chance to get bigger, and he took it.</p>

          <strong>many stones</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">by Carolyn Coman</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Our next stop on the bus tour is the limestone quarry where Mandela and the other prisoners had to work every day breaking rocks. Walls of white limestone spike up toward the sun, like some kind of gleaming, awful castle.

        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But I keep looking at Michael, studying him. And what I see is a strong black man, standing in front of me, willing to show me the place where he was jailed for twenty years of his life.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;We make a semicircle around him so everyone can hear what he is saying, and then start to move through the prison section by section. This feels completely different from some stupid class trip, being dragged around the National Gallery by some blabby guide talking about symbolism. Michael points to a narrow staircase and tells us that up there was the most hated room on Robben Island. I think torture, interrogation.<sup>1</sup> I think of what Phillip<sup>2</sup> said about the bag over his brother’s head, how he is not walking anymore. I want Michael to say more, like I wanted Phillip to.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“That is the room where the guards read the letters that were sent to us—we could receive one letter a month, twelve letters a year—and they cut out any information they wanted to before they handed them over. Sometimes we would get a letter with only the signature of the person who wrote it.” He says what a hard thing it is to have news from the people you love taken away from you. “You have to have <em>stories</em>,” he says. He says it so fiercely I hold my breath. He shakes his tightened fist as if it holds all the stories that were taken out of all the letters, and then he doesn’t say any more. Finally he ushers us along: “Ladies and gentlemen, let us move forward.”</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">. . .</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Michael has moved our group along, moved us deeper into the prison building. I am still back at the bottom of the stairs, looking up to the most hated part of the prison, and thinking that what the guards did with the letters <em>was </em>torture.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;We sit on benches in a big room inside the prison where the prisoners did their studying, had classes, where some of them learned to read. Some of the guards learned to read in this room, too—the prisoners taught them, and kept watch so the other guards wouldn’t catch them getting taught by the prisoners. I think about telling Mom this story, how much she’ll love it. And I swear I can feel it, that people have learned to read here—as if patience and trying can get soaked up into the walls of places. Mom should be here. . . . And here I am!</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The best cells, Michael says, had a view of where the boat came in and departed from the island. Children of the guards came out, sometimes, to visit their fathers, and the prisoners in those cells could see them: the children. He says that having your family taken away from you makes you hungry for so much, so that if you can see a child running out from a boat, playing, “then you feel like the luckiest somebody.”</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;We have just come from seeing the cells, including #5, where Nelson Mandela lived for twenty-five years, with its bucket and folded blanket on the floor, his cage.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Michael tells us they fought for things that were worth fighting for: books, enough food so they didn’t get sick, hot water. Not about every little injustice. They picked the battles that made a difference between living and dying.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I feel small and smaller, sitting here, listening to him. It’s like big, important history drapes over everything here in South Africa—waiters and quarries and a president who had to live in a cage. Nothing I know comes close to being a matter of life and death, nothing I can think of. I remember how in third grade Mrs. Hogan had us make our own personal history books. We got to include all the stuff that marked what had happened in our lives so far. Almost everyone had learning to ride a bike, or moving, or a baby sister or brother being born. Grandparents dying, and dead animals, too—cats and dogs and gerbils. All the little stuff we thought was so important. But it was important to us! You can’t help how and where you are born, what family you get, what country you live in!</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When Michael invites us to ask questions, I want to, but I can’t. Someone asks about the size of the prison population. Someone else wants to know how the prisoners got news of what was going on in the outside world. Finally the man next to me asks, “Aren’t you bitter?” It is my father. “Why aren’t you bitter?” A good, real question. I’m glad he asked it, proud.</p>
        <p>14<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Michael sighs deeply. Then he says, heavily, “No.” It is a deep, final sound, his <em>no</em>. He says that being bitter will not help anything, will keep him from going forward. He says it is time to get on with other things, with reconciliation.<sup>3</sup></p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I believe him, but I don’t get it. I look hard at him again, the way I did earlier, to see if spending half his life in prison shows on him, only this time I am looking for whatever it is that lets him not be bitter, and it does not show either; it must be on the inside. He tells us that he and some of the former prisoners still live on the island, together with some of their former jailers.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Michael stands at the door as we file out to board the bus again and make our way back to the ferry. He shakes hands with each person in our group. I look him in the eye. I know this is stupid, but I try and put everything I think and feel into my handshake—my smallness, how I felt the reading in the walls of the classroom, how much I loved hearing him say “the luckiest somebody.” It occurs to me that maybe his history gave him the chance to get bigger, and he took it.</p>

          <em>This excerpt is set on Robben Island, South Africa, in a former prison well known for its brutality. Nelson Mandela, who later became president of the country, was once a political prisoner there because he spoke out for the rights of black South Africans.

          <strong>many stones</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">by Carolyn Coman</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Our next stop on the bus tour is the limestone quarry where Mandela and the other prisoners had to work every day breaking rocks. Walls of white limestone spike up toward the sun, like some kind of gleaming, awful castle. Our guide tells us that the prisoners weren’t allowed to wear glasses, and a lot of them got eye problems from the glare—some condition that blocked their tear ducts and made it so they couldn’t cry. I never knew there was a condition like that. I thought you had to do it to yourself.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As we are leaving the quarry our guide points out a little tower of stones. He tells us that after the prison was shut down Mandela and a bunch of the former prisoners revisited the island. They walked to the quarry where they had spent years of their lives pounding rocks. Before they left, each man picked up a stone and set it down, in memory. That’s the tower we’re looking at, right out in the open, for everyone to see.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Inside the prison a man named Michael takes over as our tour guide. All the guides are former political prisoners. That really gets me. And it’s stupid, but I keep looking at Michael to see if he <em>looks </em>like a prisoner, the way I study pictures of murderers in the newspaper to see if they look like murderers. What do I expect, some little pitchfork above their heads, yellow eyes? There is so much that doesn’t show on the outside—which was probably Father Alan’s point.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But I keep looking at Michael, studying him. And what I see is a strong black man, standing in front of me, willing to show me the place where he was jailed for twenty years of his life.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;We make a semicircle around him so everyone can hear what he is saying, and then start to move through the prison section by section. This feels completely different from some stupid class trip, being dragged around the National Gallery by some blabby guide talking about symbolism. Michael points to a narrow staircase and tells us that up there was the most hated room on Robben Island. I think torture, interrogation.<sup>1</sup> I think of what Phillip<sup>2</sup> said about the bag over his brother’s head, how he is not walking anymore. I want Michael to say more, like I wanted Phillip to.</p>

Sometimes we would get a letter with only the signature of the person who wrote it.” He says what a hard thing it is to have news from the people you love taken away from you. “You have to have <em>stories</em>,” he says. He says it so fiercely I hold my breath. He shakes his tightened fist as if it holds all the stories that were taken out of all the letters, and then he doesn’t say any more.

          <em>This excerpt is set on Robben Island, South Africa, in a former prison well known for its brutality. Nelson Mandela, who later became president of the country, was once a political prisoner there because he spoke out for the rights of black South Africans. The narrator and her father, both from the United States, are just beginning their tour of the prison as the story begins. Read the excerpt to find out what she learns on her tour. Answer the questions that follow.</em>

          <strong>many stones</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">by Carolyn Coman</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Our next stop on the bus tour is the limestone quarry where Mandela and the other prisoners had to work every day breaking rocks. Walls of white limestone spike up toward the sun, like some kind of gleaming, awful castle. Our guide tells us that the prisoners weren’t allowed to wear glasses, and a lot of them got eye problems from the glare—some condition that blocked their tear ducts and made it so they couldn’t cry. I never knew there was a condition like that. I thought you had to do it to yourself.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As we are leaving the quarry our guide points out a little tower of stones. He tells us that after the prison was shut down Mandela and a bunch of the former prisoners revisited the island. They walked to the quarry where they had spent years of their lives pounding rocks. Before they left, each man picked up a stone and set it down, in memory. That’s the tower we’re looking at, right out in the open, for everyone to see.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Inside the prison a man named Michael takes over as our tour guide. All the guides are former political prisoners. That really gets me. And it’s stupid, but I keep looking at Michael to see if he <em>looks </em>like a prisoner, the way I study pictures of murderers in the newspaper to see if they look like murderers. What do I expect, some little pitchfork above their heads, yellow eyes? There is so much that doesn’t show on the outside—which was probably Father Alan’s point.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But I keep looking at Michael, studying him. And what I see is a strong black man, standing in front of me, willing to show me the place where he was jailed for twenty years of his life.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;We make a semicircle around him so everyone can hear what he is saying, and then start to move through the prison section by section. This feels completely different from some stupid class trip, being dragged around the National Gallery by some blabby guide talking about symbolism. Michael points to a narrow staircase and tells us that up there was the most hated room on Robben Island. I think torture, interrogation.<sup>1</sup> I think of what Phillip<sup>2</sup> said about the bag over his brother’s head, how he is not walking anymore. I want Michael to say more, like I wanted Phillip to.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“That is the room where the guards read the letters that were sent to us—we could receive one letter a month, twelve letters a year—and they cut out any information they wanted to before they handed them over. Sometimes we would get a letter with only the signature of the person who wrote it.” He says what a hard thing it is to have news from the people you love taken away from you. “You have to have <em>stories</em>,” he says. He says it so fiercely I hold my breath. He shakes his tightened fist as if it holds all the stories that were taken out of all the letters, and then he doesn’t say any more. Finally he ushers us along: “Ladies and gentlemen, let us move forward.”</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">. . .</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Michael has moved our group along, moved us deeper into the prison building. I am still back at the bottom of the stairs, looking up to the most hated part of the prison, and thinking that what the guards did with the letters <em>was </em>torture.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;We sit on benches in a big room inside the prison where the prisoners did their studying, had classes, where some of them learned to read. Some of the guards learned to read in this room, too—the prisoners taught them, and kept watch so the other guards wouldn’t catch them getting taught by the prisoners. I think about telling Mom this story, how much she’ll love it. And I swear I can feel it, that people have learned to read here—as if patience and trying can get soaked up into the walls of places. Mom should be here. . . . And here I am!</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The best cells, Michael says, had a view of where the boat came in and departed from the island. Children of the guards came out, sometimes, to visit their fathers, and the prisoners in those cells could see them: the children. He says that having your family taken away from you makes you hungry for so much, so that if you can see a child running out from a boat, playing, “then you feel like the luckiest somebody.”</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;We have just come from seeing the cells, including #5, where Nelson Mandela lived for twenty-five years, with its bucket and folded blanket on the floor, his cage.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Michael tells us they fought for things that were worth fighting for: books, enough food so they didn’t get sick, hot water. Not about every little injustice. They picked the battles that made a difference between living and dying.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I feel small and smaller, sitting here, listening to him. It’s like big, important history drapes over everything here in South Africa—waiters and quarries and a president who had to live in a cage. Nothing I know comes close to being a matter of life and death, nothing I can think of. I remember how in third grade Mrs. Hogan had us make our own personal history books. We got to include all the stuff that marked what had happened in our lives so far. Almost everyone had learning to ride a bike, or moving, or a baby sister or brother being born. Grandparents dying, and dead animals, too—cats and dogs and gerbils. All the little stuff we thought was so important. But it was important to us! You can’t help how and where you are born, what family you get, what country you live in!</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When Michael invites us to ask questions, I want to, but I can’t. Someone asks about the size of the prison population. Someone else wants to know how the prisoners got news of what was going on in the outside world. Finally the man next to me asks, “Aren’t you bitter?” It is my father. “Why aren’t you bitter?” A good, real question. I’m glad he asked it, proud.</p>
        <p>14<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Michael sighs deeply. Then he says, heavily, “No.” It is a deep, final sound, his <em>no</em>. He says that being bitter will not help anything, will keep him from going forward. He says it is time to get on with other things, with reconciliation.<sup>3</sup></p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I believe him, but I don’t get it. I look hard at him again, the way I did earlier, to see if spending half his life in prison shows on him, only this time I am looking for whatever it is that lets him not be bitter, and it does not show either; it must be on the inside. He tells us that he and some of the former prisoners still live on the island, together with some of their former jailers.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Michael stands at the door as we file out to board the bus again and make our way back to the ferry. He shakes hands with each person in our group. I look him in the eye. I know this is stupid, but I try and put everything I think and feel into my handshake—my smallness, how I felt the reading in the walls of the classroom, how much I loved hearing him say “the luckiest somebody.” It occurs to me that maybe his history gave him the chance to get bigger, and he took it.</p>
        <p><sup>1</sup><em>interrogation</em> — formal questioning</p>
        <p><sup>2</sup><em>Phillip</em> — a man the narrator met in Soweto, South Africa</p>
        <p><sup>3</sup><em>reconciliation</em> — settling differences</p>

        <p class="txt-ctr"><strong>The Man from Snowy River</strong><br>
By A.B. Paterson</p>
        <p><br>
There was movement at the station, for the word had passed around<br>
That the colt from old Regret had got away,<br>
And had joined the wild bush horses - he was worth a thousand pound,<br>
So all the cracks had gathered to the fray.<br>
All the tried and noted riders from the stations near and far&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5<br>
Had mustered at the homestead overnight,<br>
For the bushmen love hard riding where the wild bush horses are,<br>
And the stockhorse snuffs the battle with delight.</p>
        <p><br>
There was Harrison, who made his pile when Pardon won the cup,<br>
The old man with his hair as white as snow;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;10<br>
But few could ride beside him when his blood was fairly up -<br>
He would go wherever horse and man could go.<br>
And Clancy of the Overflow came down to lend a hand,<br>
No better horseman ever held the reins;<br>
For never horse could throw him while the saddle girths would stand,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;15<br>
He learnt to ride while droving on the plains.</p>
        <p><br>
And one was there, a stripling on a small and weedy beast,<br>
He was something like a racehorse undersized,<br>
With a touch of Timor pony - three parts thoroughbred at least -<br>
And such as are by mountain horsemen prized.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 20<br>
He was hard and tough and wiry - just the sort that won't say die -<br>
There was courage in his quick impatient tread;<br>
And he bore the badge of gameness in his bright and fiery eye,<br>
And the proud and lofty carriage of his head.</p>

By A.B. Paterson</p>
        <p><br>
There was movement at the station, for the word had passed around<br>
That the colt from old Regret had got away,<br>
And had joined the wild bush horses - he was worth a thousand pound,<br>
So all the cracks had gathered to the fray.<br>
All the tried and noted riders from the stations near and far&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5<br>
Had mustered at the homestead overnight,<br>
For the bushmen love hard riding where the wild bush horses are,<br>
And the stockhorse snuffs the battle with delight.</p>
        <p><br>
There was Harrison, who made his pile when Pardon won the cup,<br>
The old man with his hair as white as snow;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;10<br>
But few could ride beside him when his blood was fairly up -<br>
He would go wherever horse and man could go.<br>
And Clancy of the Overflow came down to lend a hand,<br>
No better horseman ever held the reins;<br>
For never horse could throw him while the saddle girths would stand,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;15<br>
He learnt to ride while droving on the plains.</p>
        <p><br>
And one was there, a stripling on a small and weedy beast,<br>
He was something like a racehorse undersized,<br>
With a touch of Timor pony - three parts thoroughbred at least -<br>
And such as are by mountain horsemen prized.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 20<br>
He was hard and tough and wiry - just the sort that won't say die -<br>
There was courage in his quick impatient tread;<br>
And he bore the badge of gameness in his bright and fiery eye,<br>
And the proud and lofty carriage of his head.</p>

By A.B. Paterson</p>
        <p><br>
There was movement at the station, for the word had passed around<br>
That the colt from old Regret had got away,<br>
And had joined the wild bush horses - he was worth a thousand pound,<br>
So all the cracks had gathered to the fray.<br>
All the tried and noted riders from the stations near and far&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5<br>
Had mustered at the homestead overnight,<br>
For the bushmen love hard riding where the wild bush horses are,<br>
And the stockhorse snuffs the battle with delight.</p>
        <p><br>
There was Harrison, who made his pile when Pardon won the cup,<br>
The old man with his hair as white as snow;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;10<br>
But few could ride beside him when his blood was fairly up -<br>
He would go wherever horse and man could go.<br>
And Clancy of the Overflow came down to lend a hand,<br>
No better horseman ever held the reins;<br>
For never horse could throw him while the saddle girths would stand,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;15<br>
He learnt to ride while droving on the plains.</p>
        <p><br>
And one was there, a stripling on a small and weedy beast,<br>
He was something like a racehorse undersized,<br>
With a touch of Timor pony - three parts thoroughbred at least -<br>
And such as are by mountain horsemen prized.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 20<br>
He was hard and tough and wiry - just the sort that won't say die -<br>
There was courage in his quick impatient tread;<br>
And he bore the badge of gameness in his bright and fiery eye,<br>
And the proud and lofty carriage of his head.</p>

There was Harrison, who made his pile when Pardon won the cup,<br>
The old man with his hair as white as snow;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;10<br>
But few could ride beside him when his blood was fairly up -<br>
He would go wherever horse and man could go.<br>
And Clancy of the Overflow came down to lend a hand,<br>
No better horseman ever held the reins;<br>
For never horse could throw him while the saddle girths would stand,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;15<br>
He learnt to ride while droving on the plains.</p>
        <p><br>
And one was there, a stripling on a small and weedy beast,<br>
He was something like a racehorse undersized,<br>
With a touch of Timor pony - three parts thoroughbred at least -<br>
And such as are by mountain horsemen prized.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 20<br>
He was hard and tough and wiry - just the sort that won't say die -<br>
There was courage in his quick impatient tread;<br>
And he bore the badge of gameness in his bright and fiery eye,<br>
And the proud and lofty carriage of his head.</p>

By A.B. Paterson</p>

There was movement at the station, for the word had passed around<br>
That the colt from old Regret had got away,<br>
And had joined the wild bush horses - he was worth a thousand pound,<br>
So all the cracks had gathered to the fray.<br>
All the tried and noted riders from the stations near and far&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5<br>
Had mustered at the homestead overnight,<br>
For the bushmen love hard riding where the wild bush horses are,<br>
And the stockhorse snuffs the battle with delight.</p>
        <p><br>
There was Harrison, who made his pile when Pardon won the cup,<br>
The old man with his hair as white as snow;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;10<br>

He learnt to ride while droving on the plains.</p>
        <p><br>
And one was there, a stripling on a small and weedy beast,<br>

He was hard and tough and wiry - just the sort that won't say die -<br>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
                  <img width="48%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766025472/jyrvtz590v4x4jrgkl7p.png" alt="stt15_rc_33">


        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Brian awakened just after dawn, when the sun began to warm the tent. The sky was cloudless. He flipped the canoe, and when he went to lower his packs he saw the bear tracks.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;One bear, medium size. It had come in the night so quietly that Brian hadn’t heard it—though he had slept so soundly his first night back in the woods, the bear could have been tipping garbage cans.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It had done no damage. The tracks went by the fire, then moved to where he’d buried the fish leftovers. The bear had dug them up and eaten them. It had moved to the tent, apparently looked in on him, then gone to the packs. Brian could see that it had tried to stand and reach them. There were claw marks on the tree but the bear had never figured out the rope holding the packs and had gone off without doing anything destructive.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Company,” Brian said. “And I didn’t even wake up.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He slid the canoe into the water at the edge of the lake and loaded all his gear, tying everything in. He took time to gather some bits of wood and leaves to use as a smudge in a coffee can to fend off mosquitoes, then jumped in. It was still early but already warm, and he quickly stripped down to shorts.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He kept the map in its clear plastic bag jammed beneath a rope in front of him. He knelt to paddle instead of sitting on the small seat because it felt more stable. He was not as confident in the canoe as he wished to be. He’d taken it to a small lake near home to practice and rented canoes in other places, but he was very conscious of the fact that he had much to learn. By staying low and on his knees he had much more control.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He had only a mile to go in the present lake and then he would enter the river. He had the compass in one of the packs but didn’t truly need it. The lakes were well drawn on the map and he could see where the river flowed out.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;All that day he felt as if he were in a painting, a beautiful private diorama. He worked through a sheltered narrow lagoon and then out into the open to cross a small lake, then back under the canopy through the still water.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He had never had a day pass so quickly nor so beautifully and he nearly forgot that he had to find a camp and get some food before dark. He wasn’t sick of boiled fish and rice yet, so in the late afternoon he took time to move back along the lily pads and drop the hook over. He caught a large sunfish immediately and took three more small ones, dropping them all over the side using a short piece of nylon rope as a stringer, running the nylon through their gills and out their mouths.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He took his time looking for a campsite and picked one on a flat area five or six feet above the surface of the lake. It was a clearing about 20 yards across. There were many such clearings, probably all made by beaver cutting down the small trees years before, allowing the grass to take over.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Brian pulled the canoe well up onto the grass and for no real reason tied a piece of line from the boat’s bow to a tree.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Later he would wonder at this bit of foresight. He had not done it the night before, and since this site was higher he wouldn’t have thought he’d need to secure the canoe here.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The storm hit in the middle of the night.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was not that there was so much wind—certainly not as much as he’d been through before with the tornado when he was first marooned in the wilderness—and not that there was so much rain, although there was a good amount of it.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was a combination of the two.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He had cooked dinner and eaten, boiled water for the next day’s canteen, pulled his packs up in a tree, set up the tent and arranged his sleeping bag and weapons. Then he’d sat by the fire and written to his friend Caleb about the day in one of his journals, using tiny writing so he wouldn’t waste the pages. He would have to give the letters to Caleb when he saw him again—there was no mailbox out here.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When he was done he put the book back in a plastic bag and crawled inside the tent to go to bed.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He was awakened by a new sound, a loud sound. Not thunder—it never did thunder or lightning—and not the train-like roar of a tornado. This just started low, the hissing of rain driven against the tent. He snuggled back in his bag. He was in a good shelter, waterproof—let it rain.</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Except that it kept coming and <em>kept </em>coming. It went from a moderate rain to a downpour and finally to an outright <span class="txt-underline">deluge</span>. And with the rain came wind. Not violent, but enough to break off branches and push the rain still harder. Soon Brian found his bag wet as the rain came in under the tent. He lifted the flap to look out but it was far too dark to see anything.</p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;And it rained harder. And harder. The wind pushed stronger and still stronger and at last the tent seemed to sigh. It collapsed around him and he started rolling across the grass toward the edge of the clearing.</p>
        <p>21&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Everything was upside down, crazy. He couldn’t find the entrance and about the time he thought he had it, the tent dropped off the five-foot embankment and he rolled down to the lakeshore.</p>
        <p>22&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He landed in a heap and felt an intense, hot pain in his left leg at the upper thigh and reached down to feel an arrow shaft protruding from his leg.</p>
        <p>23&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Great,</em> he thought<em>. I’ve shot myself in the leg.</em> He hadn’t, of course, but had rolled onto an arrow that had fallen out of the quiver just as the tent rolled off the embankment.</p>
        <p>24&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t get his bearings, but he knew where his thigh was and grabbed the arrow and jerked the shaft out of his leg. There was an immediate surge of pain and he felt like passing out. He didn’t, but then he heard a strange <em>whump-thump</em> and something crashed down on his head. This time he did pass out.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Brian awakened just after dawn, when the sun began to warm the tent. The sky was cloudless. He flipped the canoe, and when he went to lower his packs he saw the bear tracks.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;One bear, medium size. It had come in the night so quietly that Brian hadn’t heard it—though he had slept so soundly his first night back in the woods, the bear could have been tipping garbage cans.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It had done no damage. The tracks went by the fire, then moved to where he’d buried the fish leftovers. The bear had dug them up and eaten them. It had moved to the tent, apparently looked in on him, then gone to the packs. Brian could see that it had tried to stand and reach them. There were claw marks on the tree but the bear had never figured out the rope holding the packs and had gone off without doing anything destructive.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Company,” Brian said. “And I didn’t even wake up.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He slid the canoe into the water at the edge of the lake and loaded all his gear, tying everything in. He took time to gather some bits of wood and leaves to use as a smudge in a coffee can to fend off mosquitoes, then jumped in. It was still early but already warm, and he quickly stripped down to shorts.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He kept the map in its clear plastic bag jammed beneath a rope in front of him. He knelt to paddle instead of sitting on the small seat because it felt more stable. He was not as confident in the canoe as he wished to be. He’d taken it to a small lake near home to practice and rented canoes in other places, but he was very conscious of the fact that he had much to learn. By staying low and on his knees he had much more control.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He had only a mile to go in the present lake and then he would enter the river. He had the compass in one of the packs but didn’t truly need it. The lakes were well drawn on the map and he could see where the river flowed out.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;All that day he felt as if he were in a painting, a beautiful private diorama. He worked through a sheltered narrow lagoon and then out into the open to cross a small lake, then back under the canopy through the still water.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He had never had a day pass so quickly nor so beautifully and he nearly forgot that he had to find a camp and get some food before dark. He wasn’t sick of boiled fish and rice yet, so in the late afternoon he took time to move back along the lily pads and drop the hook over. He caught a large sunfish immediately and took three more small ones, dropping them all over the side using a short piece of nylon rope as a stringer, running the nylon through their gills and out their mouths.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He took his time looking for a campsite and picked one on a flat area five or six feet above the surface of the lake. It was a clearing about 20 yards across. There were many such clearings, probably all made by beaver cutting down the small trees years before, allowing the grass to take over.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Brian pulled the canoe well up onto the grass and for no real reason tied a piece of line from the boat’s bow to a tree.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Later he would wonder at this bit of foresight. He had not done it the night before, and since this site was higher he wouldn’t have thought he’d need to secure the canoe here.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The storm hit in the middle of the night.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was not that there was so much wind—certainly not as much as he’d been through before with the tornado when he was first marooned in the wilderness—and not that there was so much rain, although there was a good amount of it.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was a combination of the two.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He had cooked dinner and eaten, boiled water for the next day’s canteen, pulled his packs up in a tree, set up the tent and arranged his sleeping bag and weapons. Then he’d sat by the fire and written to his friend Caleb about the day in one of his journals, using tiny writing so he wouldn’t waste the pages. He would have to give the letters to Caleb when he saw him again—there was no mailbox out here.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When he was done he put the book back in a plastic bag and crawled inside the tent to go to bed.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He was awakened by a new sound, a loud sound. Not thunder—it never did thunder or lightning—and not the train-like roar of a tornado. This just started low, the hissing of rain driven against the tent. He snuggled back in his bag. He was in a good shelter, waterproof—let it rain.</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Except that it kept coming and <em>kept </em>coming. It went from a moderate rain to a downpour and finally to an outright <span class="txt-underline">deluge</span>. And with the rain came wind. Not violent, but enough to break off branches and push the rain still harder. Soon Brian found his bag wet as the rain came in under the tent. He lifted the flap to look out but it was far too dark to see anything.</p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;And it rained harder. And harder. The wind pushed stronger and still stronger and at last the tent seemed to sigh. It collapsed around him and he started rolling across the grass toward the edge of the clearing.</p>
        <p>21&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Everything was upside down, crazy. He couldn’t find the entrance and about the time he thought he had it, the tent dropped off the five-foot embankment and he rolled down to the lakeshore.</p>
        <p>22&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He landed in a heap and felt an intense, hot pain in his left leg at the upper thigh and reached down to feel an arrow shaft protruding from his leg.</p>
        <p>23&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Great,</em> he thought<em>. I’ve shot myself in the leg.</em> He hadn’t, of course, but had rolled onto an arrow that had fallen out of the quiver just as the tent rolled off the embankment.</p>
        <p>24&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t get his bearings, but he knew where his thigh was and grabbed the arrow and jerked the shaft out of his leg. There was an immediate surge of pain and he felt like passing out. He didn’t, but then he heard a strange <em>whump-thump</em> and something crashed down on his head. This time he did pass out.</p>

        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Brian awakened just after dawn, when the sun began to warm the tent. The sky was cloudless. He flipped the canoe, and when he went to lower his packs he saw the bear tracks.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;One bear, medium size. It had come in the night so quietly that Brian hadn’t heard it—though he had slept so soundly his first night back in the woods, the bear could have been tipping garbage cans.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It had done no damage. The tracks went by the fire, then moved to where he’d buried the fish leftovers. The bear had dug them up and eaten them. It had moved to the tent, apparently looked in on him, then gone to the packs. Brian could see that it had tried to stand and reach them. There were claw marks on the tree but the bear had never figured out the rope holding the packs and had gone off without doing anything destructive.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Company,” Brian said. “And I didn’t even wake up.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He slid the canoe into the water at the edge of the lake and loaded all his gear, tying everything in. He took time to gather some bits of wood and leaves to use as a smudge in a coffee can to fend off mosquitoes, then jumped in. It was still early but already warm, and he quickly stripped down to shorts.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He kept the map in its clear plastic bag jammed beneath a rope in front of him. He knelt to paddle instead of sitting on the small seat because it felt more stable. He was not as confident in the canoe as he wished to be. He’d taken it to a small lake near home to practice and rented canoes in other places, but he was very conscious of the fact that he had much to learn. By staying low and on his knees he had much more control.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He had only a mile to go in the present lake and then he would enter the river. He had the compass in one of the packs but didn’t truly need it. The lakes were well drawn on the map and he could see where the river flowed out.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;All that day he felt as if he were in a painting, a beautiful private diorama. He worked through a sheltered narrow lagoon and then out into the open to cross a small lake, then back under the canopy through the still water.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He had never had a day pass so quickly nor so beautifully and he nearly forgot that he had to find a camp and get some food before dark. He wasn’t sick of boiled fish and rice yet, so in the late afternoon he took time to move back along the lily pads and drop the hook over. He caught a large sunfish immediately and took three more small ones, dropping them all over the side using a short piece of nylon rope as a stringer, running the nylon through their gills and out their mouths.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He took his time looking for a campsite and picked one on a flat area five or six feet above the surface of the lake. It was a clearing about 20 yards across.

Then he’d sat by the fire and written to his friend Caleb about the day in one of his journals, using tiny writing so he wouldn’t waste the pages. He would have to give the letters to Caleb when he saw him again—there was no mailbox out here.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When he was done he put the book back in a plastic bag and crawled inside the tent to go to bed.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He was awakened by a new sound, a loud sound. Not thunder—it never did thunder or lightning—and not the train-like roar of a tornado. This just started low, the hissing of rain driven against the tent. He snuggled back in his bag. He was in a good shelter, waterproof—let it rain.</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Except that it kept coming and <em>kept </em>coming. It went from a moderate rain to a downpour and finally to an outright <span class="txt-underline">deluge</span>. And with the rain came wind. Not violent, but enough to break off branches and push the rain still harder. Soon Brian found his bag wet as the rain came in under the tent. He lifted the flap to look out but it was far too dark to see anything.</p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;And it rained harder. And harder. The wind pushed stronger and still stronger and at last the tent seemed to sigh. It collapsed around him and he started rolling across the grass toward the edge of the clearing.</p>
        <p>21&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Everything was upside down, crazy. He couldn’t find the entrance and about the time he thought he had it, the tent dropped off the five-foot embankment and he rolled down to the lakeshore.</p>
        <p>22&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He landed in a heap and felt an intense, hot pain in his left leg at the upper thigh and reached down to feel an arrow shaft protruding from his leg.</p>
        <p>23&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Great,</em> he thought<em>. I’ve shot myself in the leg.</em> He hadn’t, of course, but had rolled onto an arrow that had fallen out of the quiver just as the tent rolled off the embankment.</p>
        <p>24&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t get his bearings, but he knew where his thigh was and grabbed the arrow and jerked the shaft out of his leg. There was an immediate surge of pain and he felt like passing out. He didn’t, but then he heard a strange <em>whump-thump</em> and something crashed down on his head. This time he did pass out.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Brian awakened just after dawn, when the sun began to warm the tent. The sky was cloudless. He flipped the canoe, and when he went to lower his packs he saw the bear tracks.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;One bear, medium size. It had come in the night so quietly that Brian hadn’t heard it—though he had slept so soundly his first night back in the woods, the bear could have been tipping garbage cans.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It had done no damage. The tracks went by the fire, then moved to where he’d buried the fish leftovers. The bear had dug them up and eaten them. It had moved to the tent, apparently looked in on him, then gone to the packs. Brian could see that it had tried to stand and reach them. There were claw marks on the tree but the bear had never figured out the rope holding the packs and had gone off without doing anything destructive.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Company,” Brian said. “And I didn’t even wake up.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He slid the canoe into the water at the edge of the lake and loaded all his gear, tying everything in. He took time to gather some bits of wood and leaves to use as a smudge in a coffee can to fend off mosquitoes, then jumped in. It was still early but already warm, and he quickly stripped down to shorts.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He kept the map in its clear plastic bag jammed beneath a rope in front of him. He knelt to paddle instead of sitting on the small seat because it felt more stable. He was not as confident in the canoe as he wished to be. He’d taken it to a small lake near home to practice and rented canoes in other places, but he was very conscious of the fact that he had much to learn. By staying low and on his knees he had much more control.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He had only a mile to go in the present lake and then he would enter the river. He had the compass in one of the packs but didn’t truly need it. The lakes were well drawn on the map and he could see where the river flowed out.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;All that day he felt as if he were in a painting, a beautiful private diorama. He worked through a sheltered narrow lagoon and then out into the open to cross a small lake, then back under the canopy through the still water.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He had never had a day pass so quickly nor so beautifully and he nearly forgot that he had to find a camp and get some food before dark. He wasn’t sick of boiled fish and rice yet, so in the late afternoon he took time to move back along the lily pads and drop the hook over. He caught a large sunfish immediately and took three more small ones, dropping them all over the side using a short piece of nylon rope as a stringer, running the nylon through their gills and out their mouths.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He took his time looking for a campsite and picked one on a flat area five or six feet above the surface of the lake. It was a clearing about 20 yards across. There were many such clearings, probably all made by beaver cutting down the small trees years before, allowing the grass to take over.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Brian pulled the canoe well up onto the grass and for no real reason tied a piece of line from the boat’s bow to a tree.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Later he would wonder at this bit of foresight. He had not done it the night before, and since this site was higher he wouldn’t have thought he’d need to secure the canoe here.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The storm hit in the middle of the night.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was not that there was so much wind—certainly not as much as he’d been through before with the tornado when he was first marooned in the wilderness—and not that there was so much rain, although there was a good amount of it.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was a combination of the two.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He had cooked dinner and eaten, boiled water for the next day’s canteen, pulled his packs up in a tree, set up the tent and arranged his sleeping bag and weapons. Then he’d sat by the fire and written to his friend Caleb about the day in one of his journals, using tiny writing so he wouldn’t waste the pages. He would have to give the letters to Caleb when he saw him again—there was no mailbox out here.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When he was done he put the book back in a plastic bag and crawled inside the tent to go to bed.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He was awakened by a new sound, a loud sound. Not thunder—it never did thunder or lightning—and not the train-like roar of a tornado. This just started low, the hissing of rain driven against the tent. He snuggled back in his bag. He was in a good shelter, waterproof—let it rain.</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Except that it kept coming and <em>kept </em>coming. It went from a moderate rain to a downpour and finally to an outright <span class="txt-underline">deluge</span>. And with the rain came wind. Not violent, but enough to break off branches and push the rain still harder. Soon Brian found his bag wet as the rain came in under the tent. He lifted the flap to look out but it was far too dark to see anything.</p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;And it rained harder. And harder. The wind pushed stronger and still stronger and at last the tent seemed to sigh. It collapsed around him and he started rolling across the grass toward the edge of the clearing.</p>
        <p>21&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Everything was upside down, crazy. He couldn’t find the entrance and about the time he thought he had it, the tent dropped off the five-foot embankment and he rolled down to the lakeshore.</p>
        <p>22&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He landed in a heap and felt an intense, hot pain in his left leg at the upper thigh and reached down to feel an arrow shaft protruding from his leg.</p>
        <p>23&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Great,</em> he thought<em>. I’ve shot myself in the leg.</em> He hadn’t, of course, but had rolled onto an arrow that had fallen out of the quiver just as the tent rolled off the embankment.</p>
        <p>24&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t get his bearings, but he knew where his thigh was and grabbed the arrow and jerked the shaft out of his leg. There was an immediate surge of pain and he felt like passing out. He didn’t, but then he heard a strange <em>whump-thump</em> and something crashed down on his head. This time he did pass out.</p>

        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He kept the map in its clear plastic bag jammed beneath a rope in front of him. He knelt to paddle instead of sitting on the small seat because it felt more stable. He was not as confident in the canoe as he wished to be. He’d taken it to a small lake near home to practice and rented canoes in other places, but he was very conscious of the fact that he had much to learn. By staying low and on his knees he had much more control.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He had only a mile to go in the present lake and then he would enter the river. He had the compass in one of the packs but didn’t truly need it. The lakes were well drawn on the map and he could see where the river flowed out.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;All that day he felt as if he were in a painting, a beautiful private diorama. He worked through a sheltered narrow lagoon and then out into the open to cross a small lake, then back under the canopy through the still water.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He had never had a day pass so quickly nor so beautifully and he nearly forgot that he had to find a camp and get some food before dark. He wasn’t sick of boiled fish and rice yet, so in the late afternoon he took time to move back along the lily pads and drop the hook over. He caught a large sunfish immediately and took three more small ones, dropping them all over the side using a short piece of nylon rope as a stringer, running the nylon through their gills and out their mouths.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He took his time looking for a campsite and picked one on a flat area five or six feet above the surface of the lake. It was a clearing about 20 yards across. There were many such clearings, probably all made by beaver cutting down the small trees years before, allowing the grass to take over.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Brian pulled the canoe well up onto the grass and for no real reason tied a piece of line from the boat’s bow to a tree.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Later he would wonder at this bit of foresight. He had not done it the night before, and since this site was higher he wouldn’t have thought he’d need to secure the canoe here.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The storm hit in the middle of the night.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was not that there was so much wind—certainly not as much as he’d been through before with the tornado when he was first marooned in the wilderness—and not that there was so much rain, although there was a good amount of it.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was a combination of the two.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He had cooked dinner and eaten, boiled water for the next day’s canteen, pulled his packs up in a tree, set up the tent and arranged his sleeping bag and weapons. Then he’d sat by the fire and written to his friend Caleb about the day in one of his journals, using tiny writing so he wouldn’t waste the pages. He would have to give the letters to Caleb when he saw him again—there was no mailbox out here.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When he was done he put the book back in a plastic bag and crawled inside the tent to go to bed.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He was awakened by a new sound, a loud sound. Not thunder—it never did thunder or lightning—and not the train-like roar of a tornado. This just started low, the hissing of rain driven against the tent. He snuggled back in his bag. He was in a good shelter, waterproof—let it rain.</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Except that it kept coming and <em>kept </em>coming. It went from a moderate rain to a downpour and finally to an outright <span class="txt-underline">deluge</span>. And with the rain came wind. Not violent, but enough to break off branches and push the rain still harder. Soon Brian found his bag wet as the rain came in under the tent. He lifted the flap to look out but it was far too dark to see anything.</p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;And it rained harder. And harder. The wind pushed stronger and still stronger and at last the tent seemed to sigh. It collapsed around him and he started rolling across the grass toward the edge of the clearing.</p>
        <p>21&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Everything was upside down, crazy. He couldn’t find the entrance and about the time he thought he had it, the tent dropped off the five-foot embankment and he rolled down to the lakeshore.</p>
        <p>22&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He landed in a heap and felt an intense, hot pain in his left leg at the upper thigh and reached down to feel an arrow shaft protruding from his leg.</p>
        <p>23&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Great,</em> he thought<em>. I’ve shot myself in the leg.</em> He hadn’t, of course, but had rolled onto an arrow that had fallen out of the quiver just as the tent rolled off the embankment.</p>
        <p>24&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t get his bearings, but he knew where his thigh was and grabbed the arrow and jerked the shaft out of his leg. There was an immediate surge of pain and he felt like passing out. He didn’t, but then he heard a strange <em>whump-thump</em> and something crashed down on his head. This time he did pass out.</p>

        <p class="txt-ctr">
                  <img width="48%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766039284/cbmeohzehcc6ce2p3ye6.png" alt="stt15_rc_33">


        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Brian awakened just after dawn, when the sun began to warm the tent. The sky was cloudless. He flipped the canoe, and when he went to lower his packs he saw the bear tracks.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;One bear, medium size. It had come in the night so quietly that Brian hadn’t heard it—though he had slept so soundly his first night back in the woods, the bear could have been tipping garbage cans.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It had done no damage. The tracks went by the fire, then moved to where he’d buried the fish leftovers. The bear had dug them up and eaten them. It had moved to the tent, apparently looked in on him, then gone to the packs. Brian could see that it had tried to stand and reach them. There were claw marks on the tree but the bear had never figured out the rope holding the packs and had gone off without doing anything destructive.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Company,” Brian said. “And I didn’t even wake up.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He slid the canoe into the water at the edge of the lake and loaded all his gear, tying everything in. He took time to gather some bits of wood and leaves to use as a smudge in a coffee can to fend off mosquitoes, then jumped in. It was still early but already warm, and he quickly stripped down to shorts.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He kept the map in its clear plastic bag jammed beneath a rope in front of him. He knelt to paddle instead of sitting on the small seat because it felt more stable. He was not as confident in the canoe as he wished to be. He’d taken it to a small lake near home to practice and rented canoes in other places, but he was very conscious of the fact that he had much to learn. By staying low and on his knees he had much more control.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He had only a mile to go in the present lake and then he would enter the river. He had the compass in one of the packs but didn’t truly need it. The lakes were well drawn on the map and he could see where the river flowed out.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;All that day he felt as if he were in a painting, a beautiful private diorama. He worked through a sheltered narrow lagoon and then out into the open to cross a small lake, then back under the canopy through the still water.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He had never had a day pass so quickly nor so beautifully and he nearly forgot that he had to find a camp and get some food before dark. He wasn’t sick of boiled fish and rice yet, so in the late afternoon he took time to move back along the lily pads and drop the hook over. He caught a large sunfish immediately and took three more small ones, dropping them all over the side using a short piece of nylon rope as a stringer, running the nylon through their gills and out their mouths.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He took his time looking for a campsite and picked one on a flat area five or six feet above the surface of the lake. It was a clearing about 20 yards across. There were many such clearings, probably all made by beaver cutting down the small trees years before, allowing the grass to take over.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Brian pulled the canoe well up onto the grass and for no real reason tied a piece of line from the boat’s bow to a tree.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Later he would wonder at this bit of foresight. He had not done it the night before, and since this site was higher he wouldn’t have thought he’d need to secure the canoe here.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The storm hit in the middle of the night.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was not that there was so much wind—certainly not as much as he’d been through before with the tornado when he was first marooned in the wilderness—and not that there was so much rain, although there was a good amount of it.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was a combination of the two.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He had cooked dinner and eaten, boiled water for the next day’s canteen, pulled his packs up in a tree, set up the tent and arranged his sleeping bag and weapons. Then he’d sat by the fire and written to his friend Caleb about the day in one of his journals, using tiny writing so he wouldn’t waste the pages. He would have to give the letters to Caleb when he saw him again—there was no mailbox out here.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When he was done he put the book back in a plastic bag and crawled inside the tent to go to bed.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He was awakened by a new sound, a loud sound. Not thunder—it never did thunder or lightning—and not the train-like roar of a tornado. This just started low, the hissing of rain driven against the tent. He snuggled back in his bag. He was in a good shelter, waterproof—let it rain.</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Except that it kept coming and <em>kept </em>coming. It went from a moderate rain to a downpour and finally to an outright <span class="txt-underline">deluge</span>. And with the rain came wind. Not violent, but enough to break off branches and push the rain still harder. Soon Brian found his bag wet as the rain came in under the tent. He lifted the flap to look out but it was far too dark to see anything.</p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;And it rained harder. And harder. The wind pushed stronger and still stronger and at last the tent seemed to sigh. It collapsed around him and he started rolling across the grass toward the edge of the clearing.</p>
        <p>21&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Everything was upside down, crazy. He couldn’t find the entrance and about the time he thought he had it, the tent dropped off the five-foot embankment and he rolled down to the lakeshore.</p>
        <p>22&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He landed in a heap and felt an intense, hot pain in his left leg at the upper thigh and reached down to feel an arrow shaft protruding from his leg.</p>
        <p>23&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Great,</em> he thought<em>. I’ve shot myself in the leg.</em> He hadn’t, of course, but had rolled onto an arrow that had fallen out of the quiver just as the tent rolled off the embankment.</p>
        <p>24&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t get his bearings, but he knew where his thigh was and grabbed the arrow and jerked the shaft out of his leg. There was an immediate surge of pain and he felt like passing out. He didn’t, but then he heard a strange <em>whump-thump</em> and something crashed down on his head. This time he did pass out.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Brian awakened just after dawn, when the sun began to warm the tent. The sky was cloudless. He flipped the canoe, and when he went to lower his packs he saw the bear tracks.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;One bear, medium size. It had come in the night so quietly that Brian hadn’t heard it—though he had slept so soundly his first night back in the woods, the bear could have been tipping garbage cans.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It had done no damage. The tracks went by the fire, then moved to where he’d buried the fish leftovers. The bear had dug them up and eaten them. It had moved to the tent, apparently looked in on him, then gone to the packs. Brian could see that it had tried to stand and reach them. There were claw marks on the tree but the bear had never figured out the rope holding the packs and had gone off without doing anything destructive.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Company,” Brian said. “And I didn’t even wake up.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He slid the canoe into the water at the edge of the lake and loaded all his gear, tying everything in. He took time to gather some bits of wood and leaves to use as a smudge in a coffee can to fend off mosquitoes, then jumped in. It was still early but already warm, and he quickly stripped down to shorts.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He kept the map in its clear plastic bag jammed beneath a rope in front of him. He knelt to paddle instead of sitting on the small seat because it felt more stable. He was not as confident in the canoe as he wished to be. He’d taken it to a small lake near home to practice and rented canoes in other places, but he was very conscious of the fact that he had much to learn. By staying low and on his knees he had much more control.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He had only a mile to go in the present lake and then he would enter the river. He had the compass in one of the packs but didn’t truly need it. The lakes were well drawn on the map and he could see where the river flowed out.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;All that day he felt as if he were in a painting, a beautiful private diorama. He worked through a sheltered narrow lagoon and then out into the open to cross a small lake, then back under the canopy through the still water.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He had never had a day pass so quickly nor so beautifully and he nearly forgot that he had to find a camp and get some food before dark. He wasn’t sick of boiled fish and rice yet, so in the late afternoon he took time to move back along the lily pads and drop the hook over. He caught a large sunfish immediately and took three more small ones, dropping them all over the side using a short piece of nylon rope as a stringer, running the nylon through their gills and out their mouths.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He took his time looking for a campsite and picked one on a flat area five or six feet above the surface of the lake. It was a clearing about 20 yards across. There were many such clearings, probably all made by beaver cutting down the small trees years before, allowing the grass to take over.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Brian pulled the canoe well up onto the grass and for no real reason tied a piece of line from the boat’s bow to a tree.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Later he would wonder at this bit of foresight. He had not done it the night before, and since this site was higher he wouldn’t have thought he’d need to secure the canoe here.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The storm hit in the middle of the night.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was not that there was so much wind—certainly not as much as he’d been through before with the tornado when he was first marooned in the wilderness—and not that there was so much rain, although there was a good amount of it.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was a combination of the two.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He had cooked dinner and eaten, boiled water for the next day’s canteen, pulled his packs up in a tree, set up the tent and arranged his sleeping bag and weapons. Then he’d sat by the fire and written to his friend Caleb about the day in one of his journals, using tiny writing so he wouldn’t waste the pages. He would have to give the letters to Caleb when he saw him again—there was no mailbox out here.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When he was done he put the book back in a plastic bag and crawled inside the tent to go to bed.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He was awakened by a new sound, a loud sound. Not thunder—it never did thunder or lightning—and not the train-like roar of a tornado. This just started low, the hissing of rain driven against the tent. He snuggled back in his bag. He was in a good shelter, waterproof—let it rain.</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Except that it kept coming and <em>kept </em>coming. It went from a moderate rain to a downpour and finally to an outright <span class="txt-underline">deluge</span>. And with the rain came wind. Not violent, but enough to break off branches and push the rain still harder. Soon Brian found his bag wet as the rain came in under the tent. He lifted the flap to look out but it was far too dark to see anything.</p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;And it rained harder. And harder. The wind pushed stronger and still stronger and at last the tent seemed to sigh. It collapsed around him and he started rolling across the grass toward the edge of the clearing.</p>
        <p>21&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Everything was upside down, crazy. He couldn’t find the entrance and about the time he thought he had it, the tent dropped off the five-foot embankment and he rolled down to the lakeshore.</p>
        <p>22&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He landed in a heap and felt an intense, hot pain in his left leg at the upper thigh and reached down to feel an arrow shaft protruding from his leg.</p>
        <p>23&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Great,</em> he thought<em>. I’ve shot myself in the leg.</em> He hadn’t, of course, but had rolled onto an arrow that had fallen out of the quiver just as the tent rolled off the embankment.</p>
        <p>24&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t get his bearings, but he knew where his thigh was and grabbed the arrow and jerked the shaft out of his leg. There was an immediate surge of pain and he felt like passing out. He didn’t, but then he heard a strange <em>whump-thump</em> and something crashed down on his head. This time he did pass out.</p>

        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Brian awakened just after dawn, when the sun began to warm the tent. The sky was cloudless. He flipped the canoe, and when he went to lower his packs he saw the bear tracks.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;One bear, medium size. It had come in the night so quietly that Brian hadn’t heard it—though he had slept so soundly his first night back in the woods, the bear could have been tipping garbage cans.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It had done no damage. The tracks went by the fire, then moved to where he’d buried the fish leftovers. The bear had dug them up and eaten them. It had moved to the tent, apparently looked in on him, then gone to the packs. Brian could see that it had tried to stand and reach them. There were claw marks on the tree but the bear had never figured out the rope holding the packs and had gone off without doing anything destructive.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Company,” Brian said. “And I didn’t even wake up.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He slid the canoe into the water at the edge of the lake and loaded all his gear, tying everything in. He took time to gather some bits of wood and leaves to use as a smudge in a coffee can to fend off mosquitoes, then jumped in. It was still early but already warm, and he quickly stripped down to shorts.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He kept the map in its clear plastic bag jammed beneath a rope in front of him. He knelt to paddle instead of sitting on the small seat because it felt more stable. He was not as confident in the canoe as he wished to be. He’d taken it to a small lake near home to practice and rented canoes in other places, but he was very conscious of the fact that he had much to learn. By staying low and on his knees he had much more control.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He had only a mile to go in the present lake and then he would enter the river. He had the compass in one of the packs but didn’t truly need it. The lakes were well drawn on the map and he could see where the river flowed out.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;All that day he felt as if he were in a painting, a beautiful private diorama. He worked through a sheltered narrow lagoon and then out into the open to cross a small lake, then back under the canopy through the still water.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He had never had a day pass so quickly nor so beautifully and he nearly forgot that he had to find a camp and get some food before dark. He wasn’t sick of boiled fish and rice yet, so in the late afternoon he took time to move back along the lily pads and drop the hook over. He caught a large sunfish immediately and took three more small ones, dropping them all over the side using a short piece of nylon rope as a stringer, running the nylon through their gills and out their mouths.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He took his time looking for a campsite and picked one on a flat area five or six feet above the surface of the lake. It was a clearing about 20 yards across.

Then he’d sat by the fire and written to his friend Caleb about the day in one of his journals, using tiny writing so he wouldn’t waste the pages. He would have to give the letters to Caleb when he saw him again—there was no mailbox out here.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Brian awakened just after dawn, when the sun began to warm the tent. The sky was cloudless. He flipped the canoe, and when he went to lower his packs he saw the bear tracks.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;One bear, medium size. It had come in the night so quietly that Brian hadn’t heard it—though he had slept so soundly his first night back in the woods, the bear could have been tipping garbage cans.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It had done no damage. The tracks went by the fire, then moved to where he’d buried the fish leftovers. The bear had dug them up and eaten them. It had moved to the tent, apparently looked in on him, then gone to the packs. Brian could see that it had tried to stand and reach them. There were claw marks on the tree but the bear had never figured out the rope holding the packs and had gone off without doing anything destructive.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Company,” Brian said. “And I didn’t even wake up.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He slid the canoe into the water at the edge of the lake and loaded all his gear, tying everything in. He took time to gather some bits of wood and leaves to use as a smudge in a coffee can to fend off mosquitoes, then jumped in. It was still early but already warm, and he quickly stripped down to shorts.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He kept the map in its clear plastic bag jammed beneath a rope in front of him. He knelt to paddle instead of sitting on the small seat because it felt more stable. He was not as confident in the canoe as he wished to be. He’d taken it to a small lake near home to practice and rented canoes in other places, but he was very conscious of the fact that he had much to learn. By staying low and on his knees he had much more control.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He had only a mile to go in the present lake and then he would enter the river. He had the compass in one of the packs but didn’t truly need it. The lakes were well drawn on the map and he could see where the river flowed out.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;All that day he felt as if he were in a painting, a beautiful private diorama. He worked through a sheltered narrow lagoon and then out into the open to cross a small lake, then back under the canopy through the still water.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He had never had a day pass so quickly nor so beautifully and he nearly forgot that he had to find a camp and get some food before dark. He wasn’t sick of boiled fish and rice yet, so in the late afternoon he took time to move back along the lily pads and drop the hook over. He caught a large sunfish immediately and took three more small ones, dropping them all over the side using a short piece of nylon rope as a stringer, running the nylon through their gills and out their mouths.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He took his time looking for a campsite and picked one on a flat area five or six feet above the surface of the lake. It was a clearing about 20 yards across. There were many such clearings, probably all made by beaver cutting down the small trees years before, allowing the grass to take over.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Brian pulled the canoe well up onto the grass and for no real reason tied a piece of line from the boat’s bow to a tree.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Later he would wonder at this bit of foresight. He had not done it the night before, and since this site was higher he wouldn’t have thought he’d need to secure the canoe here.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The storm hit in the middle of the night.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was not that there was so much wind—certainly not as much as he’d been through before with the tornado when he was first marooned in the wilderness—and not that there was so much rain, although there was a good amount of it.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was a combination of the two.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He had cooked dinner and eaten, boiled water for the next day’s canteen, pulled his packs up in a tree, set up the tent and arranged his sleeping bag and weapons. Then he’d sat by the fire and written to his friend Caleb about the day in one of his journals, using tiny writing so he wouldn’t waste the pages. He would have to give the letters to Caleb when he saw him again—there was no mailbox out here.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When he was done he put the book back in a plastic bag and crawled inside the tent to go to bed.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He was awakened by a new sound, a loud sound. Not thunder—it never did thunder or lightning—and not the train-like roar of a tornado. This just started low, the hissing of rain driven against the tent. He snuggled back in his bag. He was in a good shelter, waterproof—let it rain.</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Except that it kept coming and <em>kept </em>coming. It went from a moderate rain to a downpour and finally to an outright <span class="txt-underline">deluge</span>. And with the rain came wind. Not violent, but enough to break off branches and push the rain still harder. Soon Brian found his bag wet as the rain came in under the tent. He lifted the flap to look out but it was far too dark to see anything.</p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;And it rained harder. And harder. The wind pushed stronger and still stronger and at last the tent seemed to sigh. It collapsed around him and he started rolling across the grass toward the edge of the clearing.</p>
        <p>21&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Everything was upside down, crazy. He couldn’t find the entrance and about the time he thought he had it, the tent dropped off the five-foot embankment and he rolled down to the lakeshore.</p>
        <p>22&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He landed in a heap and felt an intense, hot pain in his left leg at the upper thigh and reached down to feel an arrow shaft protruding from his leg.</p>
        <p>23&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Great,</em> he thought<em>. I’ve shot myself in the leg.</em> He hadn’t, of course, but had rolled onto an arrow that had fallen out of the quiver just as the tent rolled off the embankment.</p>
        <p>24&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t get his bearings, but he knew where his thigh was and grabbed the arrow and jerked the shaft out of his leg. There was an immediate surge of pain and he felt like passing out. He didn’t, but then he heard a strange <em>whump-thump</em> and something crashed down on his head. This time he did pass out.</p>

        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Brian awakened just after dawn, when the sun began to warm the tent. The sky was cloudless. He flipped the canoe, and when he went to lower his packs he saw the bear tracks.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;One bear, medium size. It had come in the night so quietly that Brian hadn’t heard it—though he had slept so soundly his first night back in the woods, the bear could have been tipping garbage cans.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It had done no damage. The tracks went by the fire, then moved to where he’d buried the fish leftovers. The bear had dug them up and eaten them. It had moved to the tent, apparently looked in on him, then gone to the packs. Brian could see that it had tried to stand and reach them. There were claw marks on the tree but the bear had never figured out the rope holding the packs and had gone off without doing anything destructive.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Company,” Brian said. “And I didn’t even wake up.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He slid the canoe into the water at the edge of the lake and loaded all his gear, tying everything in. He took time to gather some bits of wood and leaves to use as a smudge in a coffee can to fend off mosquitoes, then jumped in. It was still early but already warm, and he quickly stripped down to shorts.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He kept the map in its clear plastic bag jammed beneath a rope in front of him. He knelt to paddle instead of sitting on the small seat because it felt more stable. He was not as confident in the canoe as he wished to be. He’d taken it to a small lake near home to practice and rented canoes in other places, but he was very conscious of the fact that he had much to learn. By staying low and on his knees he had much more control.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He had only a mile to go in the present lake and then he would enter the river. He had the compass in one of the packs but didn’t truly need it. The lakes were well drawn on the map and he could see where the river flowed out.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;All that day he felt as if he were in a painting, a beautiful private diorama. He worked through a sheltered narrow lagoon and then out into the open to cross a small lake, then back under the canopy through the still water.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He had never had a day pass so quickly nor so beautifully and he nearly forgot that he had to find a camp and get some food before dark. He wasn’t sick of boiled fish and rice yet, so in the late afternoon he took time to move back along the lily pads and drop the hook over. He caught a large sunfish immediately and took three more small ones, dropping them all over the side using a short piece of nylon rope as a stringer, running the nylon through their gills and out their mouths.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He took his time looking for a campsite and picked one on a flat area five or six feet above the surface of the lake. It was a clearing about 20 yards across. There were many such clearings, probably all made by beaver cutting down the small trees years before, allowing the grass to take over.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Brian pulled the canoe well up onto the grass and for no real reason tied a piece of line from the boat’s bow to a tree.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Later he would wonder at this bit of foresight. He had not done it the night before, and since this site was higher he wouldn’t have thought he’d need to secure the canoe here.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The storm hit in the middle of the night.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was not that there was so much wind—certainly not as much as he’d been through before with the tornado when he was first marooned in the wilderness—and not that there was so much rain, although there was a good amount of it.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was a combination of the two.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He had cooked dinner and eaten, boiled water for the next day’s canteen, pulled his packs up in a tree, set up the tent and arranged his sleeping bag and weapons. Then he’d sat by the fire and written to his friend Caleb about the day in one of his journals, using tiny writing so he wouldn’t waste the pages. He would have to give the letters to Caleb when he saw him again—there was no mailbox out here.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When he was done he put the book back in a plastic bag and crawled inside the tent to go to bed.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He was awakened by a new sound, a loud sound. Not thunder—it never did thunder or lightning—and not the train-like roar of a tornado. This just started low, the hissing of rain driven against the tent. He snuggled back in his bag. He was in a good shelter, waterproof—let it rain.</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Except that it kept coming and <em>kept </em>coming. It went from a moderate rain to a downpour and finally to an outright <span class="txt-underline">deluge</span>. And with the rain came wind. Not violent, but enough to break off branches and push the rain still harder. Soon Brian found his bag wet as the rain came in under the tent. He lifted the flap to look out but it was far too dark to see anything.</p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;And it rained harder. And harder. The wind pushed stronger and still stronger and at last the tent seemed to sigh. It collapsed around him and he started rolling across the grass toward the edge of the clearing.</p>
        <p>21&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Everything was upside down, crazy. He couldn’t find the entrance and about the time he thought he had it, the tent dropped off the five-foot embankment and he rolled down to the lakeshore.</p>
        <p>22&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He landed in a heap and felt an intense, hot pain in his left leg at the upper thigh and reached down to feel an arrow shaft protruding from his leg.</p>
        <p>23&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Great,</em> he thought<em>. I’ve shot myself in the leg.</em> He hadn’t, of course, but had rolled onto an arrow that had fallen out of the quiver just as the tent rolled off the embankment.</p>
        <p>24&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t get his bearings, but he knew where his thigh was and grabbed the arrow and jerked the shaft out of his leg. There was an immediate surge of pain and he felt like passing out. He didn’t, but then he heard a strange <em>whump-thump</em> and something crashed down on his head. This time he did pass out.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Brian awakened just after dawn, when the sun began to warm the tent. The sky was cloudless. He flipped the canoe, and when he went to lower his packs he saw the bear tracks.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;One bear, medium size. It had come in the night so quietly that Brian hadn’t heard it—though he had slept so soundly his first night back in the woods, the bear could have been tipping garbage cans.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It had done no damage. The tracks went by the fire, then moved to where he’d buried the fish leftovers. The bear had dug them up and eaten them. It had moved to the tent, apparently looked in on him, then gone to the packs. Brian could see that it had tried to stand and reach them. There were claw marks on the tree but the bear had never figured out the rope holding the packs and had gone off without doing anything destructive.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Company,” Brian said. “And I didn’t even wake up.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He slid the canoe into the water at the edge of the lake and loaded all his gear, tying everything in. He took time to gather some bits of wood and leaves to use as a smudge in a coffee can to fend off mosquitoes, then jumped in. It was still early but already warm, and he quickly stripped down to shorts.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He kept the map in its clear plastic bag jammed beneath a rope in front of him. He knelt to paddle instead of sitting on the small seat because it felt more stable. He was not as confident in the canoe as he wished to be. He’d taken it to a small lake near home to practice and rented canoes in other places, but he was very conscious of the fact that he had much to learn. By staying low and on his knees he had much more control.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He had only a mile to go in the present lake and then he would enter the river. He had the compass in one of the packs but didn’t truly need it. The lakes were well drawn on the map and he could see where the river flowed out.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;All that day he felt as if he were in a painting, a beautiful private diorama. He worked through a sheltered narrow lagoon and then out into the open to cross a small lake, then back under the canopy through the still water.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He had never had a day pass so quickly nor so beautifully and he nearly forgot that he had to find a camp and get some food before dark. He wasn’t sick of boiled fish and rice yet, so in the late afternoon he took time to move back along the lily pads and drop the hook over. He caught a large sunfish immediately and took three more small ones, dropping them all over the side using a short piece of nylon rope as a stringer, running the nylon through their gills and out their mouths.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He took his time looking for a campsite and picked one on a flat area five or six feet above the surface of the lake. It was a clearing about 20 yards across. There were many such clearings, probably all made by beaver cutting down the small trees years before, allowing the grass to take over.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Brian pulled the canoe well up onto the grass and for no real reason tied a piece of line from the boat’s bow to a tree.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Later he would wonder at this bit of foresight. He had not done it the night before, and since this site was higher he wouldn’t have thought he’d need to secure the canoe here.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The storm hit in the middle of the night.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was not that there was so much wind—certainly not as much as he’d been through before with the tornado when he was first marooned in the wilderness—and not that there was so much rain, although there was a good amount of it.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was a combination of the two.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He had cooked dinner and eaten, boiled water for the next day’s canteen, pulled his packs up in a tree, set up the tent and arranged his sleeping bag and weapons. Then he’d sat by the fire and written to his friend Caleb about the day in one of his journals, using tiny writing so he wouldn’t waste the pages. He would have to give the letters to Caleb when he saw him again—there was no mailbox out here.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When he was done he put the book back in a plastic bag and crawled inside the tent to go to bed.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He was awakened by a new sound, a loud sound. Not thunder—it never did thunder or lightning—and not the train-like roar of a tornado. This just started low, the hissing of rain driven against the tent. He snuggled back in his bag. He was in a good shelter, waterproof—let it rain.</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Except that it kept coming and <em>kept </em>coming. It went from a moderate rain to a downpour and finally to an outright <span class="txt-underline">deluge</span>. And with the rain came wind. Not violent, but enough to break off branches and push the rain still harder. Soon Brian found his bag wet as the rain came in under the tent. He lifted the flap to look out but it was far too dark to see anything.</p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;And it rained harder. And harder. The wind pushed stronger and still stronger and at last the tent seemed to sigh. It collapsed around him and he started rolling across the grass toward the edge of the clearing.</p>
        <p>21&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Everything was upside down, crazy. He couldn’t find the entrance and about the time he thought he had it, the tent dropped off the five-foot embankment and he rolled down to the lakeshore.</p>
        <p>22&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He landed in a heap and felt an intense, hot pain in his left leg at the upper thigh and reached down to feel an arrow shaft protruding from his leg.</p>
        <p>23&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Great,</em> he thought<em>. I’ve shot myself in the leg.</em> He hadn’t, of course, but had rolled onto an arrow that had fallen out of the quiver just as the tent rolled off the embankment.</p>
        <p>24&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t get his bearings, but he knew where his thigh was and grabbed the arrow and jerked the shaft out of his leg. There was an immediate surge of pain and he felt like passing out. He didn’t, but then he heard a strange <em>whump-thump</em> and something crashed down on his head. This time he did pass out.</p>

        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Brian awakened just after dawn, when the sun began to warm the tent. The sky was cloudless. He flipped the canoe, and when he went to lower his packs he saw the bear tracks.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;One bear, medium size. It had come in the night so quietly that Brian hadn’t heard it—though he had slept so soundly his first night back in the woods, the bear could have been tipping garbage cans.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It had done no damage. The tracks went by the fire, then moved to where he’d buried the fish leftovers. The bear had dug them up and eaten them. It had moved to the tent, apparently looked in on him, then gone to the packs. Brian could see that it had tried to stand and reach them. There were claw marks on the tree but the bear had never figured out the rope holding the packs and had gone off without doing anything destructive.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Company,” Brian said. “And I didn’t even wake up.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He slid the canoe into the water at the edge of the lake and loaded all his gear, tying everything in. He took time to gather some bits of wood and leaves to use as a smudge in a coffee can to fend off mosquitoes, then jumped in. It was still early but already warm, and he quickly stripped down to shorts.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He kept the map in its clear plastic bag jammed beneath a rope in front of him. He knelt to paddle instead of sitting on the small seat because it felt more stable. He was not as confident in the canoe as he wished to be. He’d taken it to a small lake near home to practice and rented canoes in other places, but he was very conscious of the fact that he had much to learn. By staying low and on his knees he had much more control.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He had only a mile to go in the present lake and then he would enter the river. He had the compass in one of the packs but didn’t truly need it. The lakes were well drawn on the map and he could see where the river flowed out.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;All that day he felt as if he were in a painting, a beautiful private diorama. He worked through a sheltered narrow lagoon and then out into the open to cross a small lake, then back under the canopy through the still water.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He had never had a day pass so quickly nor so beautifully and he nearly forgot that he had to find a camp and get some food before dark. He wasn’t sick of boiled fish and rice yet, so in the late afternoon he took time to move back along the lily pads and drop the hook over. He caught a large sunfish immediately and took three more small ones, dropping them all over the side using a short piece of nylon rope as a stringer, running the nylon through their gills and out their mouths.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He took his time looking for a campsite and picked one on a flat area five or six feet above the surface of the lake. It was a clearing about 20 yards across. There were many such clearings, probably all made by beaver cutting down the small trees years before, allowing the grass to take over.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Brian pulled the canoe well up onto the grass and for no real reason tied a piece of line from the boat’s bow to a tree.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Later he would wonder at this bit of foresight. He had not done it the night before, and since this site was higher he wouldn’t have thought he’d need to secure the canoe here.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The storm hit in the middle of the night.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was not that there was so much wind—certainly not as much as he’d been through before with the tornado when he was first marooned in the wilderness—and not that there was so much rain, although there was a good amount of it.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was a combination of the two.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He had cooked dinner and eaten, boiled water for the next day’s canteen, pulled his packs up in a tree, set up the tent and arranged his sleeping bag and weapons. Then he’d sat by the fire and written to his friend Caleb about the day in one of his journals, using tiny writing so he wouldn’t waste the pages. He would have to give the letters to Caleb when he saw him again—there was no mailbox out here.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When he was done he put the book back in a plastic bag and crawled inside the tent to go to bed.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He was awakened by a new sound, a loud sound. Not thunder—it never did thunder or lightning—and not the train-like roar of a tornado. This just started low, the hissing of rain driven against the tent. He snuggled back in his bag. He was in a good shelter, waterproof—let it rain.</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Except that it kept coming and <em>kept </em>coming. It went from a moderate rain to a downpour and finally to an outright <span class="txt-underline">deluge</span>. And with the rain came wind. Not violent, but enough to break off branches and push the rain still harder. Soon Brian found his bag wet as the rain came in under the tent. He lifted the flap to look out but it was far too dark to see anything.</p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;And it rained harder. And harder. The wind pushed stronger and still stronger and at last the tent seemed to sigh. It collapsed around him and he started rolling across the grass toward the edge of the clearing.</p>

                  <img width="48%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766026346/d9ilnekxepkgaogqyrxy.png" alt="stt15_rc_33">


        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Brian awakened just after dawn, when the sun began to warm the tent. The sky was cloudless. He flipped the canoe, and when he went to lower his packs he saw the bear tracks.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;One bear, medium size. It had come in the night so quietly that Brian hadn’t heard it—though he had slept so soundly his first night back in the woods, the bear could have been tipping garbage cans.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It had done no damage. The tracks went by the fire, then moved to where he’d buried the fish leftovers. The bear had dug them up and eaten them. It had moved to the tent, apparently looked in on him, then gone to the packs. Brian could see that it had tried to stand and reach them. There were claw marks on the tree but the bear had never figured out the rope holding the packs and had gone off without doing anything destructive.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Company,” Brian said. “And I didn’t even wake up.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He slid the canoe into the water at the edge of the lake and loaded all his gear, tying everything in. He took time to gather some bits of wood and leaves to use as a smudge in a coffee can to fend off mosquitoes, then jumped in. It was still early but already warm, and he quickly stripped down to shorts.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He kept the map in its clear plastic bag jammed beneath a rope in front of him. He knelt to paddle instead of sitting on the small seat because it felt more stable. He was not as confident in the canoe as he wished to be. He’d taken it to a small lake near home to practice and rented canoes in other places, but he was very conscious of the fact that he had much to learn. By staying low and on his knees he had much more control.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He had only a mile to go in the present lake and then he would enter the river. He had the compass in one of the packs but didn’t truly need it. The lakes were well drawn on the map and he could see where the river flowed out.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;All that day he felt as if he were in a painting, a beautiful private diorama. He worked through a sheltered narrow lagoon and then out into the open to cross a small lake, then back under the canopy through the still water.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He had never had a day pass so quickly nor so beautifully and he nearly forgot that he had to find a camp and get some food before dark. He wasn’t sick of boiled fish and rice yet, so in the late afternoon he took time to move back along the lily pads and drop the hook over. He caught a large sunfish immediately and took three more small ones, dropping them all over the side using a short piece of nylon rope as a stringer, running the nylon through their gills and out their mouths.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He took his time looking for a campsite and picked one on a flat area five or six feet above the surface of the lake. It was a clearing about 20 yards across. There were many such clearings, probably all made by beaver cutting down the small trees years before, allowing the grass to take over.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Brian pulled the canoe well up onto the grass and for no real reason tied a piece of line from the boat’s bow to a tree.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Later he would wonder at this bit of foresight. He had not done it the night before, and since this site was higher he wouldn’t have thought he’d need to secure the canoe here.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The storm hit in the middle of the night.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was not that there was so much wind—certainly not as much as he’d been through before with the tornado when he was first marooned in the wilderness—and not that there was so much rain, although there was a good amount of it.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was a combination of the two.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He had cooked dinner and eaten, boiled water for the next day’s canteen, pulled his packs up in a tree, set up the tent and arranged his sleeping bag and weapons. Then he’d sat by the fire and written to his friend Caleb about the day in one of his journals, using tiny writing so he wouldn’t waste the pages. He would have to give the letters to Caleb when he saw him again—there was no mailbox out here.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When he was done he put the book back in a plastic bag and crawled inside the tent to go to bed.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He was awakened by a new sound, a loud sound. Not thunder—it never did thunder or lightning—and not the train-like roar of a tornado. This just started low, the hissing of rain driven against the tent. He snuggled back in his bag. He was in a good shelter, waterproof—let it rain.</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Except that it kept coming and <em>kept </em>coming. It went from a moderate rain to a downpour and finally to an outright <span class="txt-underline">deluge</span>. And with the rain came wind. Not violent, but enough to break off branches and push the rain still harder. Soon Brian found his bag wet as the rain came in under the tent. He lifted the flap to look out but it was far too dark to see anything.</p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;And it rained harder. And harder. The wind pushed stronger and still stronger and at last the tent seemed to sigh. It collapsed around him and he started rolling across the grass toward the edge of the clearing.</p>
        <p>21&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Everything was upside down, crazy. He couldn’t find the entrance and about the time he thought he had it, the tent dropped off the five-foot embankment and he rolled down to the lakeshore.</p>
        <p>22&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He landed in a heap and felt an intense, hot pain in his left leg at the upper thigh and reached down to feel an arrow shaft protruding from his leg.</p>
        <p>23&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Great,</em> he thought<em>. I’ve shot myself in the leg.</em> He hadn’t, of course, but had rolled onto an arrow that had fallen out of the quiver just as the tent rolled off the embankment.</p>
        <p>24&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t get his bearings, but he knew where his thigh was and grabbed the arrow and jerked the shaft out of his leg. There was an immediate surge of pain and he felt like passing out. He didn’t, but then he heard a strange <em>whump-thump</em> and something crashed down on his head. This time he did pass out.</p>
