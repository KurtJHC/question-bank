The big river<br>
rolls past our town<br>
at Hobson’s Bend,<br>
takes a slow look<br>
at the houses on stilts<br>
with timber creaking, paint flaking,<br>
at the graveyard hushed<br>
in the lonely shade,<br>
at the fruit bats<br>
dropping mango pulp<br>
into the undergrowth,<br>
at the foundry, and sawmill<br>
grinding under a blazing sun,<br>
at the pub with welcoming verandahs<br>
shaded in wisteria vine,<br>
at Durra Creek surrendering<br>
to the incessant flow,<br>
at Pearce Swamp upstream<br>
on the creek among the willows<br>
and rivergum,<br>
at the storm clouds<br>
rumbling over Rookwood Hill,<br>
at the two boys<br>
casting a line<br>
on the crumbling bank,<br>
at the cow fields<br>
purple with Paterson’s curse,<br>
at the jammed tree-trunks<br>
washed down after summer thunder,<br>
at the shop<br>
with dead flies in the window display,<br>
at the mosquito mangroves<br>
and the sucking sound of mud crabs,<br>
at the children throwing mulberries<br>
the stain like lipstick.<br>
The big river<br>
rolls past our town,<br>
takes a slow look,<br>
and rolls away.</div>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>The King's Speech&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
This is the Incredible True Story of How King George VI Overcame His Stutter for His 1939 Speech. <strong>15 ………. </strong>But that's exactly what happened when his older brother, Edward VIII, abdicated the throne in December 1936. He did this in order to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson. Despite the non-traditional start to his reign, George VI went on to become a symbol of strength and hope for the British people throughout World War II and beyond. This reignited their faith in the country's monarchy. It's this rise and reign of the unexpected King that is chronicled in the second episode of CNN docuseries The Windsors: Inside the Royal Dynasty, which airs on Sunday at 10 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Unsurprisingly, the journey to becoming a successful and beloved King wasn't an easy one for George VI. <strong>16 ………. </strong>But his anxiety about taking on the role was only compounded by the stammer he had struggled with ever since he was a young boy.</p>
        <p>As is shown in the Oscar-winning 2010 movie, <em>The King's Speech</em>, George VI (who was known as Albert or "Bertie" to those closest to him) struggled with a stutter from a young age. After being named the Duke of York in 1920 (but long before he became King), he feared that his stutter would prevent him from effectively giving important speeches to his people. <strong>17 ……….</strong></p>
        <p><strong>18 ……….</strong> There are no logs of what, exactly, Lionel and the King did during their sessions. Therefore we can't be sure of what exercises the speech therapist had George VI practise. (What you see in the movie is based on writer David Seidler's own experiences with speech therapy.) What the records do show, however, is that for some time, the King was meeting with Lionel for an hour every day, weekends included.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, George VI became King and later gave his first big radio address on September 3, 1939. This was when he announced that England would be going to war against Germany. <strong>19 ………. </strong>He believed it was absolutely imperative that he give the best speech he could — with as few stutters and stammers as possible.</p>
        <p>A copy of the speech now belongs to Lionel's grandson, Mark Logue. It shows that Lionel and the King marked up a physical copy of the address for him to reference, highlighting places where he should consider pausing or swapping words for something easier to pronounce. <strong>20 ………. </strong>It's now considered one of his most iconic addresses. Of course, after giving this well-known speech, King George VI went on to act as a beloved leader for more than a decade longer. He held the British throne until his death on February 6, 1952.</p>

        <p>A copy of the speech now belongs to Lionel's grandson, Mark Logue. It shows that Lionel and the King marked up a physical copy of the address for him to reference, highlighting places where he should consider pausing or swapping words for something easier to pronounce. <strong>20 ………. </strong>It's now considered one of his most iconic addresses. Of course, after giving this well-known speech, King George VI went on to act as a beloved leader for more than a decade longer. He held the British throne until his death on February 6, 1952.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>The King's Speech&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
This is the Incredible True Story of How King George VI Overcame His Stutter for His 1939 Speech. <strong>15 ………. </strong>But that's exactly what happened when his older brother, Edward VIII, abdicated the throne in December 1936. He did this in order to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson. Despite the non-traditional start to his reign, George VI went on to become a symbol of strength and hope for the British people throughout World War II and beyond. This reignited their faith in the country's monarchy. It's this rise and reign of the unexpected King that is chronicled in the second episode of CNN docuseries The Windsors: Inside the Royal Dynasty, which airs on Sunday at 10 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Unsurprisingly, the journey to becoming a successful and beloved King wasn't an easy one for George VI. <strong>16 ………. </strong>But his anxiety about taking on the role was only compounded by the stammer he had struggled with ever since he was a young boy.</p>
        <p>As is shown in the Oscar-winning 2010 movie, <em>The King's Speech</em>, George VI (who was known as Albert or "Bertie" to those closest to him) struggled with a stutter from a young age. After being named the Duke of York in 1920 (but long before he became King), he feared that his stutter would prevent him from effectively giving important speeches to his people. <strong>17 ……….</strong></p>
        <p><strong>18 ……….</strong> There are no logs of what, exactly, Lionel and the King did during their sessions. Therefore we can't be sure of what exercises the speech therapist had George VI practise. (What you see in the movie is based on writer David Seidler's own experiences with speech therapy.) What the records do show, however, is that for some time, the King was meeting with Lionel for an hour every day, weekends included.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, George VI became King and later gave his first big radio address on September 3, 1939. This was when he announced that England would be going to war against Germany. <strong>19 ………. </strong>He believed it was absolutely imperative that he give the best speech he could — with as few stutters and stammers as possible.</p>
        <p>A copy of the speech now belongs to Lionel's grandson, Mark Logue. It shows that Lionel and the King marked up a physical copy of the address for him to reference, highlighting places where he should consider pausing or swapping words for something easier to pronounce. <strong>20 ………. </strong>It's now considered one of his most iconic addresses. Of course, after giving this well-known speech, King George VI went on to act as a beloved leader for more than a decade longer. He held the British throne until his death on February 6, 1952.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>The King's Speech&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
This is the Incredible True Story of How King George VI Overcame His Stutter for His 1939 Speech. <strong>15 ………. </strong>But that's exactly what happened when his older brother, Edward VIII, abdicated the throne in December 1936. He did this in order to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson. Despite the non-traditional start to his reign, George VI went on to become a symbol of strength and hope for the British people throughout World War II and beyond. This reignited their faith in the country's monarchy. It's this rise and reign of the unexpected King that is chronicled in the second episode of CNN docuseries The Windsors: Inside the Royal Dynasty, which airs on Sunday at 10 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Unsurprisingly, the journey to becoming a successful and beloved King wasn't an easy one for George VI. <strong>16 ………. </strong>But his anxiety about taking on the role was only compounded by the stammer he had struggled with ever since he was a young boy.</p>
        <p>As is shown in the Oscar-winning 2010 movie, <em>The King's Speech</em>, George VI (who was known as Albert or "Bertie" to those closest to him) struggled with a stutter from a young age. After being named the Duke of York in 1920 (but long before he became King), he feared that his stutter would prevent him from effectively giving important speeches to his people. <strong>17 ……….</strong></p>
        <p><strong>18 ……….</strong> There are no logs of what, exactly, Lionel and the King did during their sessions. Therefore we can't be sure of what exercises the speech therapist had George VI practise. (What you see in the movie is based on writer David Seidler's own experiences with speech therapy.) What the records do show, however, is that for some time, the King was meeting with Lionel for an hour every day, weekends included.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, George VI became King and later gave his first big radio address on September 3, 1939. This was when he announced that England would be going to war against Germany. <strong>19 ………. </strong>He believed it was absolutely imperative that he give the best speech he could — with as few stutters and stammers as possible.</p>
        <p>A copy of the speech now belongs to Lionel's grandson, Mark Logue. It shows that Lionel and the King marked up a physical copy of the address for him to reference, highlighting places where he should consider pausing or swapping words for something easier to pronounce. <strong>20 ………. </strong>It's now considered one of his most iconic addresses. Of course, after giving this well-known speech, King George VI went on to act as a beloved leader for more than a decade longer. He held the British throne until his death on February 6, 1952.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>The King's Speech&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
This is the Incredible True Story of How King George VI Overcame His Stutter for His 1939 Speech. <strong>15 ………. </strong>But that's exactly what happened when his older brother, Edward VIII, abdicated the throne in December 1936. He did this in order to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson. Despite the non-traditional start to his reign, George VI went on to become a symbol of strength and hope for the British people throughout World War II and beyond. This reignited their faith in the country's monarchy. It's this rise and reign of the unexpected King that is chronicled in the second episode of CNN docuseries The Windsors: Inside the Royal Dynasty, which airs on Sunday at 10 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Unsurprisingly, the journey to becoming a successful and beloved King wasn't an easy one for George VI. <strong>16 ………. </strong>But his anxiety about taking on the role was only compounded by the stammer he had struggled with ever since he was a young boy.</p>
        <p>As is shown in the Oscar-winning 2010 movie, <em>The King's Speech</em>, George VI (who was known as Albert or "Bertie" to those closest to him) struggled with a stutter from a young age. After being named the Duke of York in 1920 (but long before he became King), he feared that his stutter would prevent him from effectively giving important speeches to his people. <strong>17 ……….</strong></p>
        <p><strong>18 ……….</strong> There are no logs of what, exactly, Lionel and the King did during their sessions. Therefore we can't be sure of what exercises the speech therapist had George VI practise. (What you see in the movie is based on writer David Seidler's own experiences with speech therapy.) What the records do show, however, is that for some time, the King was meeting with Lionel for an hour every day, weekends included.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, George VI became King and later gave his first big radio address on September 3, 1939. This was when he announced that England would be going to war against Germany. <strong>19 ………. </strong>He believed it was absolutely imperative that he give the best speech he could — with as few stutters and stammers as possible.</p>
        <p>A copy of the speech now belongs to Lionel's grandson, Mark Logue. It shows that Lionel and the King marked up a physical copy of the address for him to reference, highlighting places where he should consider pausing or swapping words for something easier to pronounce. <strong>20 ………. </strong>It's now considered one of his most iconic addresses. Of course, after giving this well-known speech, King George VI went on to act as a beloved leader for more than a decade longer. He held the British throne until his death on February 6, 1952.</p>

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn follows the life of a young adventurous boy (Huck Finn) as he runs away from both his guardian, the Widow Douglas and his father Pap. He accidentally teams up with another runaway, a slave named Jim. As the two set off they hope to find freedom from different things; Huck from both the thought of being “civilised” and his drunken father, and Jim from his current life. Jim is a slave and is running away to become a free man, so he can in turn, free his family from slavery.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The two unlikely friends journey down the Mississippi river in what turns out to be a series of adventures filled with death, disguise and eventually the growth and maturity of their friendship and of Huck himself. The river is an important symbol and is the agent that brings the two closer to their destination.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The Mississippi is the fourth largest river in the world and stretches over ten US states. Twain retells his experiences on the Mississippi river in a memoir published in 1883, ‘Life on the Mississippi’, centered on his life as a steamboat pilot. It follows his journeys on the&nbsp;Mississippi from St Louis to New Orleans. His own experiences were what inspired the 1834 novel. Twain’s recount of Huck’s journey along the river maps the road to the young boy discovering himself. Twain’s love for the Mississippi river is no doubt evident in the novel. It is portrayed as not just a long and winding trail that leads out of town and away from potential conflicts, but also a path that enables one to find oneself.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
There’s a reason why the sound of a river or a creek calms your soul. Even the sight of it calms you. It is because the river has come to teach us all one of the most powerful lessons on earth: No one’s words or thoughts can derail us from our goals.<br>
<br>
The&nbsp;river is a great teacher. Round up every high school bully, every negative person who wants the worst for others and have them congregate around the river. Then, have them look downward into its clear moving water. As they look down they can see their faces looking back up at them. They begin chanting at the river with every fibre of their mind and spirit: “You’re not good enough.” “You’re wasting your time, you’ll never make it.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
What other negative things might they be saying? Yet, even while all of this profound negativity is being channelled toward the river, <strong>it continues to flow</strong>. The river moves no matter what the atmosphere. If it’s raining, lightning or grey – it moves. The river channels all of its mind, body and spirit into the direction of its dreams. When the river goes through a break up with its beloved – it doesn’t stop moving. It flows. It’s relentless. It’s wise.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
One thing you can be certain of about the river is that it never dwells on the past. <strong>Ever</strong>. Do you hear the sound of the water rushing over the rocks? Tell me… when you hear the babbling water, when are you hearing it; in the past or the future? Neither. It’s only possible to hear this precious sound in the now. The river understands by letting go of the past entirely, allows for its potential in the present to reach its absolute zenith. We all can take away great wisdom from the river. It personifies the truth that <strong>moving while challenged is at the core of what wisdom really is</strong>.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
NSW floods are unmatched in scale and rainfall, but history shows there have been worse. It's been called many things. A "once-in-100-year flood", "unprecedented" and "chaotic". Thousands of people were ordered to evacuate, a home floated down the Manning River on the Mid-North Coast and one person died after becoming trapped in their car in Sydney's north-west.<br>
<br>
So how do NSW's most recent floods stack up against others in the state? Experts say what makes this flood event a stand-out is the vast area affected. "It’s just the sheer scale of having it from the border all the way down south of Sydney and now heading west as well," said Fiona Johnson, a hydrologist from the water research centre at UNSW. The three largest coastal catchments, the Hawkesbury-Nepean, Clarence and Hunter rivers,&nbsp;are all flooded. Tens of thousands of people were ordered to evacuate from the Hawkesbury-Nepean River area in Sydney. The valley, which has a catchment of 21,400 square kilometres, has experienced 130 moderate to major floods since records began in the 1790s.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Rivers, as the source of life are reflected in the myths and beliefs of the multitude of cultures. In many parts of the world rivers are called “mothers”. Narmadai River in India, “Mother Narmada”; Volga River in Russia is Mat Rodnaya, “Mother Earth”. The Thai word ‘mae nan’ is translated as “water mother”.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There is something poetic in the life of rivers. It is too complex to describe the spiritual connection between a person and a river. The melting snow and pouring rain on tops of mountains and hills, form beautiful mountain streams that flow in the high grounds. As the streams power down the tributaries, they gain their volume and become a river. As they leave the high grounds, rivers slow down and begin to meander, seeking the path of least resistance through wide valleys. Finally, the river flows into a lake or ocean.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
All the big milestones in the human history have taken place around riverbanks. The first civilisation emerged +/- 3000 BC along the Euphrates, Tigris, Nile, and Indus; and later along the Yellow River. The industrial revolution occurred along rivers in northern England which contributed to the development of industry. Most large cities in the world are located on a river. An interesting fact is that 65% of the water we drink comes from a surrounding river. It is another great reason to keep them clean.<br>

There’s a reason why the sound of a river or a creek calms your soul. Even the sight of it calms you. It is because the river has come to teach us all one of the most powerful lessons on earth: No one’s words or thoughts can derail us from our goals.<br>
<br>
The&nbsp;river is a great teacher. Round up every high school bully, every negative person who wants the worst for others and have them congregate around the river. Then, have them look downward into its clear moving water. As they look down they can see their faces looking back up at them. They begin chanting at the river with every fibre of their mind and spirit: “You’re not good enough.” “You’re wasting your time, you’ll never make it.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
What other negative things might they be saying? Yet, even while all of this profound negativity is being channelled toward the river,&nbsp;<strong>it continues to flow</strong>. The river moves no matter what the atmosphere. If it’s raining, lightning or grey – it moves. The river channels all of its mind, body and spirit into the direction of its dreams. When the river goes through a break up with its beloved – it doesn’t stop moving. It flows. It’s relentless. It’s wise.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
One thing you can be certain of about the river is that it never dwells on the past.&nbsp;<strong>Ever</strong>. Do you hear the sound of the water rushing over the rocks? Tell me… when you hear the babbling water, when are you hearing it; in the past or the future? Neither. It’s only possible to hear this precious sound in the now. The river understands by letting go of the past entirely, allows for its potential in the present to reach its absolute zenith. We all can take away great wisdom from the river. It personifies the truth that&nbsp;<strong>moving while challenged is at the core of what wisdom really is</strong>.<br>

NSW floods are unmatched in scale and rainfall, but history shows there have been worse. It's been called many things. A "once-in-100-year flood", "unprecedented" and "chaotic". Thousands of people were ordered to evacuate, a home floated down the Manning River on the Mid-North Coast and one person died after becoming trapped in their car in Sydney's north-west.<br>
<br>
So how do NSW's most recent floods stack up against others in the state? Experts say what makes this flood event a stand-out is the vast area affected. "It’s just the sheer scale of having it from the border all the way down south of Sydney and now heading west as well," said Fiona Johnson, a hydrologist from the water research centre at UNSW. The three largest coastal catchments, the Hawkesbury-Nepean, Clarence and Hunter rivers,&nbsp;are all flooded. Tens of thousands of people were ordered to evacuate from the Hawkesbury-Nepean River area in Sydney. The valley, which has a catchment of 21,400 square kilometres, has experienced 130 moderate to major floods since records began in the 1790s.&nbsp;<br>

There is something poetic in the life of rivers. It is too complex to describe the spiritual connection between a person and a river. The melting snow and pouring rain on tops of mountains and hills, form beautiful mountain streams that flow in the high grounds. As the streams power down the tributaries, they gain their volume and become a river. As they leave the high grounds, rivers slow down and begin to meander, seeking the path of least resistance through wide valleys. Finally, the river flows into a lake or ocean.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
All the big milestones in the human history have taken place around riverbanks. The first civilisation emerged +/- 3000 BC along the Euphrates, Tigris, Nile, and Indus; and later along the Yellow River. The industrial revolution occurred along rivers in northern England which contributed to the development of industry. Most large cities in the world are located on a river. An interesting fact is that 65% of the water we drink comes from a surrounding river. It is another great reason to keep them clean.<br>

There’s a reason why the sound of a river or a creek calms your soul. Even the sight of it calms you. It is because the river has come to teach us all one of the most powerful lessons on earth: No one’s words or thoughts can derail us from our goals.<br>
<br>
The&nbsp;river is a great teacher. Round up every high school bully, every negative person who wants the worst for others and have them congregate around the river. Then, have them look downward into its clear moving water. As they look down they can see their faces looking back up at them. They begin chanting at the river with every fibre of their mind and spirit: “You’re not good enough.” “You’re wasting your time, you’ll never make it.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
What other negative things might they be saying? Yet, even while all of this profound negativity is being channelled toward the river,&nbsp;<strong>it continues to flow</strong>. The river moves no matter what the atmosphere. If it’s raining, lightning or grey – it moves. The river channels all of its mind, body and spirit into the direction of its dreams. When the river goes through a break up with its beloved – it doesn’t stop moving. It flows. It’s relentless. It’s wise.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
One thing you can be certain of about the river is that it never dwells on the past.&nbsp;<strong>Ever</strong>. Do you hear the sound of the water rushing over the rocks? Tell me… when you hear the babbling water, when are you hearing it; in the past or the future? Neither. It’s only possible to hear this precious sound in the now. The river understands by letting go of the past entirely, allows for its potential in the present to reach its absolute zenith. We all can take away great wisdom from the river. It personifies the truth that&nbsp;<strong>moving while challenged is at the core of what wisdom really is.</strong><br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
NSW floods are unmatched in scale and rainfall, but history shows there have been worse. It's been called many things. A "once-in-100-year flood", "unprecedented" and "chaotic". Thousands of people were ordered to evacuate, a home floated down the Manning River on the Mid-North Coast and one person died after becoming trapped in their car in Sydney's north-west.<br>
<br>
So how do NSW's most recent floods stack up against others in the state? Experts say what makes this flood event a stand-out is the vast area affected. "It’s just the sheer scale of having it from the border all the way down south of Sydney and now heading west as well," said Fiona Johnson, a hydrologist from the water research centre at UNSW. The three largest coastal catchments, the Hawkesbury-Nepean, Clarence and Hunter rivers,&nbsp;are all flooded. Tens of thousands of people were ordered to evacuate from the Hawkesbury-Nepean River area in Sydney. The valley, which has a catchment of 21,400 square kilometres, has experienced 130 moderate to major floods since records began in the 1790s.&nbsp;<br>

Rivers, as the source of life are reflected in the myths and beliefs of the multitude of cultures. In many parts of the world rivers are called “mothers”. Narmadai River in India, “Mother Narmada”; Volga River in Russia is Mat Rodnaya, “Mother Earth”. The Thai word ‘mae nan’ is translated as “water mother”.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There is something poetic in the life of rivers. It is too complex to describe the spiritual connection between a person and a river. The melting snow and pouring rain on tops of mountains and hills, form beautiful mountain streams that flow in the high grounds. As the streams power down the tributaries, they gain their volume and become a river. As they leave the high grounds, rivers slow down and begin to meander, seeking the path of least resistance through wide valleys. Finally, the river flows into a lake or ocean.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
All the big milestones in the human history have taken place around riverbanks.

NSW floods are unmatched in scale and rainfall, but history shows there have been worse. It's been called many things. A "once-in-100-year flood", "unprecedented" and "chaotic". Thousands of people were ordered to evacuate, a home floated down the Manning River on the Mid-North Coast and one person died after becoming trapped in their car in Sydney's north-west.<br>
<br>
So how do NSW's most recent floods stack up against others in the state? Experts say what makes this flood event a stand-out is the vast area affected. "It’s just the sheer scale of having it from the border all the way down south of Sydney and now heading west as well," said Fiona Johnson, a hydrologist from the water research centre at UNSW. The three largest coastal catchments, the Hawkesbury-Nepean, Clarence and Hunter rivers,&nbsp;are all flooded. Tens of thousands of people were ordered to evacuate from the Hawkesbury-Nepean River area in Sydney. The valley, which has a catchment of 21,400 square kilometres, has experienced 130 moderate to major floods since records began in the 1790s.&nbsp;<br>

Rivers, as the source of life are reflected in the myths and beliefs of the multitude of cultures. In many parts of the world rivers are called “mothers”. Narmadai River in India, “Mother Narmada”; Volga River in Russia is Mat Rodnaya, “Mother Earth”. The Thai word ‘mae nan’ is translated as “water mother”.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There is something poetic in the life of rivers. It is too complex to describe the spiritual connection between a person and a river. The melting snow and pouring rain on tops of mountains and hills, form beautiful mountain streams that flow in the high grounds. As the streams power down the tributaries, they gain their volume and become a river. As they leave the high grounds, rivers slow down and begin to meander, seeking the path of least resistance through wide valleys. Finally, the river flows into a lake or ocean.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
All the big milestones in the human history have taken place around riverbanks. The first civilisation emerged +/- 3000 BC along the Euphrates, Tigris, Nile, and Indus; and later along the Yellow River. The industrial revolution occurred along rivers in northern England which contributed to the development of industry. Most large cities in the world are located on a river. An interesting fact is that 65% of the water we drink comes from a surrounding river. It is another great reason to keep them clean.<br>

The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn follows the life of a young adventurous boy (Huck Finn) as he runs away from both his guardian, the Widow Douglas and his father Pap. He accidentally teams up with another runaway, a slave named Jim. As the two set off they hope to find freedom from different things; Huck from both the thought of being “civilised” and his drunken father, and Jim from his current life. Jim is a slave and is running away to become a free man, so he can in turn, free his family from slavery.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The two unlikely friends journey down the Mississippi river in what turns out to be a series of adventures filled with death, disguise and eventually the growth and maturity of their friendship and of Huck himself. The river is an important symbol and is the agent that brings the two closer to their destination.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The Mississippi is the fourth largest river in the world and stretches over ten US states. Twain retells his experiences on the Mississippi river in a memoir published in 1883, ‘Life on the Mississippi’, centered on his life as a steamboat pilot. It follows his journeys on the&nbsp;Mississippi from St Louis to New Orleans. His own experiences were what inspired the 1834 novel. Twain’s recount of Huck’s journey along the river maps the road to the young boy discovering himself. Twain’s love for the Mississippi river is no doubt evident in the novel. It is portrayed as not just a long and winding trail that leads out of town and away from potential conflicts, but also a path that enables one to find oneself.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
There’s a reason why the sound of a river or a creek calms your soul. Even the sight of it calms you. It is because the river has come to teach us all one of the most powerful lessons on earth: No one’s words or thoughts can derail us from our goals.<br>
<br>
The&nbsp;river is a great teacher. Round up every high school bully, every negative person who wants the worst for others and have them congregate around the river. Then, have them look downward into its clear moving water. As they look down they can see their faces looking back up at them. They begin chanting at the river with every fibre of their mind and spirit: “You’re not good enough.” “You’re wasting your time, you’ll never make it.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
What other negative things might they be saying? Yet, even while all of this profound negativity is being channelled toward the river,<strong>&nbsp;it continues to flow</strong>. The river moves no matter what the atmosphere. If it’s raining, lightning or grey – it moves. The river channels all of its mind, body and spirit into the direction of its dreams. When the river goes through a break up with its beloved – it doesn’t stop moving. It flows. It’s relentless. It’s wise.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
One thing you can be certain of about the river is that it never dwells on the past.&nbsp;<strong>Ever</strong>. Do you hear the sound of the water rushing over the rocks? Tell me… when you hear the babbling water, when are you hearing it; in the past or the future? Neither. It’s only possible to hear this precious sound in the now. The river understands by letting go of the past entirely, allows for its potential in the present to reach its absolute zenith. We all can take away great wisdom from the river. It personifies the truth that&nbsp;<strong>moving while challenged is at the core of what wisdom really is</strong>.<br>
