          <em>Read the extract below then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>One night, a few days after James had left, I had eaten my hay and was lying down in my straw fast asleep, when I was suddenly roused by the stable bell ringing very loud. I heard the door of John’s house open, and his feet running up to the hall. He was back again in no time; he unlocked the stable door, and came in, calling out, “Wake up, Beauty! You must go well now, if ever you did;” and almost before I could think he had got the saddle on my back and the bridle on my head. He just ran round for his coat, and then took me at a quick trot up to the hall door. The squire stood there, with a lamp in his hand.</p>
        <p>“Now, John,” he said, “ride for your life—that is, for your mistress’ life; there is not a moment to lose. Give this note to Dr. White; give your horse a rest at the inn and be back as soon as you can.”</p>
        <p>John said, “Yes, sir,” and was on my back in a minute.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was before us a long piece of level road by the river side; John said to me, “Now, Beauty, do your best,” and so I did; I wanted no whip nor spur, and for two miles I galloped as fast as I could lay my feet to the ground; I don’t believe that my old grandfather, who won the race at Newmarket, could have gone faster. When we came to the bridge John pulled me up a little and patted my neck. “Well done, Beauty! good old fellow,” he said. He would have let me go slower, but my spirit was up, and I was off again as fast as before. The air was frosty; the moon was bright; it was very pleasant. We came through a village, then through a dark wood, then uphill, then downhill, till after eight miles’ run we came to the town, through the streets and into the marketplace. It was all quite still except the clatter of my feet on the stones—everybody was asleep. The church clock truck three as we drew up at Dr. White’s door. John rang the bell twice and then knocked at the door like thunder. A window was thrown up, and Dr. White, in his nightcap, put his head out and said, “What do you want?”</p>
        <p>“Mrs. Gordon is very ill, sir; master wants you to go at once; he thinks she will die if you cannot get there. Here is a note.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Wait,” he said, “I will come.”</p>
        <p>He shut the window and was soon at the door.</p>
        <p>“The worst of it is,” he said, “that my horse has been out all day and is quite done up; my son has just been sent for, and he has taken the other. What is to be done? Can I have your horse?”</p>
        <p>“He has come at a gallop nearly all the way, sir, and I was to give him a rest here; but I think my master would not be against it, if you think fit, sir.”</p>
        <p>“All right,” he said; “I will soon be ready.”</p>
        <p>John stood by me and stroked my neck; I was very hot. The doctor came out with his riding-whip.</p>
        <p>“You need not take that, sir,” said John; “Black Beauty will go till he drops. Take care of him, sir, if you can; I should not like any harm to come to him.”</p>
        <p>“No, no, John,” said the doctor, “I hope not,” and in a minute we had left John far behind.<br>
I will not tell about our way back. The doctor was a heavier man than John, and not so good a rider; however, I did my very best. The man at the toll-gate had it open. When we came to the hill the doctor drew me up.</p>
        <p>“Now, my good fellow,” he said, “take some breath.”</p>
        <p>I was glad he did, for I was nearly spent, but that breathing helped me on, and soon we were in the park. Joe was at the lodge gate; my master was at the hall door, for he had heard us coming. He spoke not a word; the doctor went into the house with him, and Joe led me to the stable. I was glad to get home; my legs shook under me, and I could only stand and pant. I had not a dry hair on my body, the water ran down my legs, and I steamed all over, Joe used to say, like a pot on the fire. Poor Joe! he was young and small, and as yet he knew very little, and his father, who would have helped him, had been sent to the next village; but I am sure he did the very best he knew. He rubbed my legs and my chest, but he did not put my warm cloth on me; he thought I was so hot I should not like it. Then he gave me a pailful of water to drink; it was cold and very good, and I drank it all; then he gave me some hay and some corn, and thinking he had done right, he went away. Soon I began to shake and tremble, and turned deadly cold; my legs ached, my loins ached, and my chest ached, and I felt sore all over. Oh! how I wished for my warm, thick cloth, as I stood and trembled. I wished for John, but he had eight miles to walk, so I lay down in my straw and tried to go to sleep. After a long while I heard John at the door; I gave a low moan, for I was in great pain. He was at my side in a moment, stooping down by me. I could not tell him how I felt, but he seemed to know it all; he covered me up with two or three warm cloths, and then ran to the house for some hot water; he made me some warm gruel, which I drank, and then I think I went to sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>John seemed to be very much put out. I heard him say to himself over and over again, “Stupid boy! stupid boy! No cloth put on, and I dare say the water was cold, too; boys are no good;” but Joe was a good boy, after all.</p>
        <p>I was now very ill; a strong inflammation had attacked my lungs, and I could not draw my breath without pain. John nursed me night and day; he would get up two or three times in the night to come to me. My master, too, often came to see me. “My poor Beauty,” he said one day, “my good horse, you saved your mistress’ life, Beauty; yes, you saved her life.”&nbsp;</p>

        </p>
        <p>One night, a few days after James had left, I had eaten my hay and was lying down in my straw fast asleep, when I was suddenly roused by the stable bell ringing very loud. I heard the door of John’s house open, and his feet running up to the hall. He was back again in no time; he unlocked the stable door, and came in, calling out, “Wake up, Beauty! You must go well now, if ever you did;” and almost before I could think he had got the saddle on my back and the bridle on my head. He just ran round for his coat, and then took me at a quick trot up to the hall door. The squire stood there, with a lamp in his hand.</p>
        <p>“Now, John,” he said, “ride for your life—that is, for your mistress’ life; there is not a moment to lose. Give this note to Dr. White; give your horse a rest at the inn and be back as soon as you can.”</p>
        <p>John said, “Yes, sir,” and was on my back in a minute.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was before us a long piece of level road by the river side; John said to me, “Now, Beauty, do your best,” and so I did; I wanted no whip nor spur, and for two miles I galloped as fast as I could lay my feet to the ground; I don’t believe that my old grandfather, who won the race at Newmarket, could have gone faster. When we came to the bridge John pulled me up a little and patted my neck. “Well done, Beauty! good old fellow,” he said. He would have let me go slower, but my spirit was up, and I was off again as fast as before. The air was frosty; the moon was bright; it was very pleasant. We came through a village, then through a dark wood, then uphill, then downhill, till after eight miles’ run we came to the town, through the streets and into the marketplace. It was all quite still except the clatter of my feet on the stones—everybody was asleep. The church clock truck three as we drew up at Dr. White’s door. John rang the bell twice and then knocked at the door like thunder. A window was thrown up, and Dr. White, in his nightcap, put his head out and said, “What do you want?”</p>
        <p>“Mrs. Gordon is very ill, sir; master wants you to go at once; he thinks she will die if you cannot get there. Here is a note.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Wait,” he said, “I will come.”</p>
        <p>He shut the window and was soon at the door.</p>
        <p>“The worst of it is,” he said, “that my horse has been out all day and is quite done up; my son has just been sent for, and he has taken the other. What is to be done? Can I have your horse?”</p>
        <p>“He has come at a gallop nearly all the way, sir, and I was to give him a rest here; but I think my master would not be against it, if you think fit, sir.”</p>
        <p>“All right,” he said; “I will soon be ready.”</p>
        <p>John stood by me and stroked my neck; I was very hot. The doctor came out with his riding-whip.</p>
        <p>“You need not take that, sir,” said John; “Black Beauty will go till he drops. Take care of him, sir, if you can; I should not like any harm to come to him.”</p>
        <p>“No, no, John,” said the doctor, “I hope not,” and in a minute we had left John far behind.<br>
I will not tell about our way back. The doctor was a heavier man than John, and not so good a rider; however, I did my very best. The man at the toll-gate had it open. When we came to the hill the doctor drew me up.</p>
        <p>“Now, my good fellow,” he said, “take some breath.”</p>
        <p>I was glad he did, for I was nearly spent, but that breathing helped me on, and soon we were in the park. Joe was at the lodge gate; my master was at the hall door, for he had heard us coming. He spoke not a word; the doctor went into the house with him, and Joe led me to the stable. I was glad to get home; my legs shook under me, and I could only stand and pant. I had not a dry hair on my body, the water ran down my legs, and I steamed all over, Joe used to say, like a pot on the fire. Poor Joe! he was young and small, and as yet he knew very little, and his father, who would have helped him, had been sent to the next village; but I am sure he did the very best he knew. He rubbed my legs and my chest, but he did not put my warm cloth on me; he thought I was so hot I should not like it. Then he gave me a pailful of water to drink; it was cold and very good, and I drank it all; then he gave me some hay and some corn, and thinking he had done right, he went away. Soon I began to shake and tremble, and turned deadly cold; my legs ached, my loins ached, and my chest ached, and I felt sore all over. Oh! how I wished for my warm, thick cloth, as I stood and trembled. I wished for John, but he had eight miles to walk, so I lay down in my straw and tried to go to sleep. After a long while I heard John at the door; I gave a low moan, for I was in great pain. He was at my side in a moment, stooping down by me. I could not tell him how I felt, but he seemed to know it all; he covered me up with two or three warm cloths, and then ran to the house for some hot water; he made me some warm gruel, which I drank, and then I think I went to sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>John seemed to be very much put out. I heard him say to himself over and over again, “Stupid boy! stupid boy! No cloth put on, and I dare say the water was cold, too; boys are no good;” but Joe was a good boy, after all.</p>
        <p>I was now very ill; a strong inflammation had attacked my lungs, and I could not draw my breath without pain. John nursed me night and day; he would get up two or three times in the night to come to me. My master, too, often came to see me. “My poor Beauty,” he said one day, “my good horse, you saved your mistress’ life, Beauty; yes, you saved her life.”&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Feliks Skrzynecki</strong>
        </p>
        <p>My gentle father<br>
Kept pace only with the Joneses<br>
Of his own mind’s making -<br>
Loved his garden like an only child,<br>
Spent years walking its perimeter<br>
From sunrise to sleep.<br>
Alert, brisk and silent,<br>
He swept its paths<br>
Ten times around the world.</p>
        <p>Hands darkened<br>
From cement, fingers with cracks<br>
Like the sods he broke,<br>
I often wondered how he existed<br>
On five or six hours’ sleep each night -<br>
Why his arms didn’t fall off<br>
From the soil he turned<br>
And tobacco he rolled.</p>
        <p>His Polish friends<br>
Always shook hands too violently,<br>
I thought… Feliks Skrzynecki,<br>
That formal address<br>
I never got used to.<br>
Talking, they reminisced<br>
About farms where paddocks flowered<br>
With corn and wheat,<br>
Horses they bred, pigs<br>
They were skilled in slaughtering.<br>
Five years of forced labour in Germany<br>
Did not dull the softness of his blue eyes<br>
I never once heard<br>
Him complain of work, the weather<br>
Or pain. When twice<br>
They dug cancer out of his foot,<br>
His comment was: ‘but I’m alive’.</p>
        <p>Growing older, I<br>
Remember words he taught me,<br>
Remnants of a language<br>
I inherited unknowingly -<br>
The curse that damned<br>
A crew-cut, grey-haired<br>
Department clerk<br>
Who asked me in dancing-bear grunts:<br>
‘Did your father ever attempt to learn English?’</p>
        <p>On the back steps of his house,<br>
Bordered by golden cypress,<br>
Lawns - geraniums younger<br>
Than both parents,<br>
My father sits out the evening<br>

          <strong>Feliks Skrzynecki</strong>
        </p>
        <p>My gentle father<br>
Kept pace only with the Joneses<br>
Of his own mind’s making -<br>
Loved his garden like an only child,<br>
Spent years walking its perimeter<br>
From sunrise to sleep.<br>
Alert, brisk and silent,<br>
He swept its paths<br>
Ten times around the world.</p>
        <p>Hands darkened<br>
From cement, fingers with cracks<br>
Like the sods he broke,<br>
I often wondered how he existed<br>
On five or six hours’ sleep each night -<br>
Why his arms didn’t fall off<br>
From the soil he turned<br>
And tobacco he rolled.</p>
        <p>His Polish friends<br>
Always shook hands too violently,<br>
I thought… Feliks Skrzynecki,<br>
That formal address<br>
I never got used to.<br>
Talking, they reminisced<br>
About farms where paddocks flowered<br>
With corn and wheat,<br>
Horses they bred, pigs<br>
They were skilled in slaughtering.<br>
Five years of forced labour in Germany<br>
Did not dull the softness of his blue eyes<br>
I never once heard<br>
Him complain of work, the weather<br>
Or pain. When twice<br>
They dug cancer out of his foot,<br>
His comment was: ‘but I’m alive’.</p>
        <p>Growing older, I<br>
Remember words he taught me,<br>
Remnants of a language<br>
I inherited unknowingly -<br>
The curse that damned<br>
A crew-cut, grey-haired<br>
Department clerk<br>
Who asked me in dancing-bear grunts:<br>
‘Did your father ever attempt to learn English?’</p>
        <p>On the back steps of his house,<br>
Bordered by golden cypress,<br>
Lawns - geraniums younger<br>
Than both parents,<br>
My father sits out the evening<br>
With his dog, smoking,<br>
Watching stars and street lights come on,<br>
Happy as I have never been.</p>
        <p>At thirteen,<br>
Stumbling over tenses in Caesar’s Gallic War,<br>
I forgot my first Polish word.<br>
He repeated it so I never forgot.<br>
After that, like a dumb prophet,<br>
Watched me pegging my tents<br>
Further and further south of Hadrian’s Wall.</p>

          <br>
          <strong>Feliks Skrzynecki</strong>
        </p>
        <p>My gentle father<br>
Kept pace only with the Joneses<br>
Of his own mind’s making -<br>
Loved his garden like an only child,<br>
Spent years walking its perimeter<br>
From sunrise to sleep.<br>
Alert, brisk and silent,<br>
He swept its paths<br>
Ten times around the world.</p>
        <p>Hands darkened<br>
From cement, fingers with cracks<br>
Like the sods he broke,<br>
I often wondered how he existed<br>
On five or six hours’ sleep each night -<br>
Why his arms didn’t fall off<br>
From the soil he turned<br>
And tobacco he rolled.</p>
        <p>His Polish friends<br>
Always shook hands too violently,<br>
I thought… Feliks Skrzynecki,<br>
That formal address<br>
I never got used to.<br>
Talking, they reminisced<br>
About farms where paddocks flowered<br>
With corn and wheat,<br>
Horses they bred, pigs<br>
They were skilled in slaughtering.<br>
Five years of forced labour in Germany<br>
Did not dull the softness of his blue eyes<br>
I never once heard<br>
Him complain of work, the weather<br>
Or pain. When twice<br>
They dug cancer out of his foot,<br>
His comment was: ‘but I’m alive’.</p>
        <p>Growing older, I<br>
Remember words he taught me,<br>
Remnants of a language<br>
I inherited unknowingly -<br>
The curse that damned<br>
A crew-cut, grey-haired<br>
Department clerk<br>
Who asked me in dancing-bear grunts:<br>
‘Did your father ever attempt to learn English?’</p>
        <p>On the back steps of his house,<br>
Bordered by golden cypress,<br>
Lawns - geraniums younger<br>
Than both parents,<br>
My father sits out the evening<br>
With his dog, smoking,<br>
Watching stars and street lights come on,<br>
Happy as I have never been.</p>
        <p>At thirteen,<br>
Stumbling over tenses in Caesar’s Gallic War,<br>
I forgot my first Polish word.<br>
He repeated it so I never forgot.<br>
After that, like a dumb prophet,<br>
Watched me pegging my tents<br>
Further and further south of Hadrian’s Wall.</p>

Spent years walking its perimeter<br>
From sunrise to sleep.<br>
Alert, brisk and silent,<br>
He swept its paths<br>
Ten times around the world.</p>
        <p>Hands darkened<br>
From cement, fingers with cracks<br>
Like the sods he broke,<br>
I often wondered how he existed<br>
On five or six hours’ sleep each night -<br>
Why his arms didn’t fall off<br>
From the soil he turned<br>
And tobacco he rolled.</p>
        <p>His Polish friends<br>
Always shook hands too violently,<br>
I thought… Feliks Skrzynecki,<br>
That formal address<br>
I never got used to.<br>
Talking, they reminisced<br>
About farms where paddocks flowered<br>
With corn and wheat,<br>
Horses they bred, pigs<br>
They were skilled in slaughtering.<br>
Five years of forced labour in Germany<br>
Did not dull the softness of his blue eyes<br>
I never once heard<br>
Him complain of work, the weather<br>
Or pain. When twice<br>
They dug cancer out of his foot,<br>
His comment was: ‘but I’m alive’.</p>
        <p>Growing older, I<br>
Remember words he taught me,<br>
Remnants of a language<br>
I inherited unknowingly -<br>
The curse that damned<br>
A crew-cut, grey-haired<br>
Department clerk<br>
Who asked me in dancing-bear grunts:<br>
‘Did your father ever attempt to learn English?’</p>
        <p>On the back steps of his house,<br>
Bordered by golden cypress,<br>
Lawns - geraniums younger<br>
Than both parents,<br>
My father sits out the evening<br>
With his dog, smoking,<br>
Watching stars and street lights come on,<br>
Happy as I have never been.</p>
        <p>At thirteen,<br>
Stumbling over tenses in Caesar’s Gallic War,<br>
I forgot my first Polish word.<br>
He repeated it so I never forgot.<br>
After that, like a dumb prophet,<br>
Watched me pegging my tents<br>
Further and further south of Hadrian’s Wall.</p>

          <strong>The Stolen Generations</strong>
        </p>
        <p>From 1869 to 1970, various Australian state and territory governments implemented a policy that became known as the Stolen Generations. During this grim chapter of civil rights history, thousands of First Nations children were forcibly taken from their families and placed with white foster families, adopted, or raised in institutions. <strong>(A)</strong>………….</p>
        <p>The motivation behind these removals was to ‘civilise’ Indigenous children and assimilate them into white society. Such actions were rooted in racist beliefs that Indigenous people were inferior and incapable of managing their own lives. The intention was also to erase Indigenous culture and identity. <strong>(B)</strong>………….</p>
        <p>The earliest example of forced removal dates to 1814 with the Native Institution in Parramatta. Later, laws such as the Aboriginal Protection Act 1869 in Victoria and the Aborigines Protection Act 1909 in New South Wales gave authorities sweeping powers over Indigenous lives. <strong>(C)</strong>…………. Institutions like the Cootamundra Domestic Training Home for Aboriginal Girls and Kinchela Boys’ Home became notorious for neglect and abuse.</p>
        <p>Assimilation policies gained strength in the twentieth century. A.O. Neville, Chief Protector of Aborigines in Western Australia from 1915 to 1940, was a major architect of these ideas. He believed Indigenous people should eventually be absorbed into white society. In 1937, a national conference officially endorsed assimilation, targeting especially so-called ‘half-caste’ children. <strong>(D)</strong>………….</p>
        <p>The impact of these policies was devastating. Many children were physically and emotionally abused, separated from their siblings, and denied their culture. As adults, survivors often suffered trauma, poverty, and loss of identity. <strong>(E)</strong>…………. The 1997 *Bringing Them Home* report collected over 500 testimonies, highlighting ongoing pain across generations.</p>
        <p>Efforts at reconciliation have continued. In 2008, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd issued a formal apology to the Stolen Generations on behalf of the Australian people. Schools now teach this history, and initiatives such as National Reconciliation Week aim to promote healing. <strong>(F)</strong>…………. This cinematic story revealed to many Australians the harsh reality of forced removals</p>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of dreams. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
To follow one’s dreams is to pursue a personal vision that feels both necessary and inspiring. Dreams may be professional goals, creative ambitions, or even hopes for family and community life. At their best, they give individuals purpose and determination. Yet chasing dreams can involve sacrifice. Financial insecurity, social disapproval, and repeated failure are real risks. Some argue it is safer to settle for stability rather than risk disappointment. Others believe the greatest danger is not trying at all, leaving a life of regret. Following dreams can bring fulfilment, but it can also bring frustration. For many, the path is uneven, with moments of triumph mixed with long stretches of uncertainty. Nevertheless, the pursuit itself is often described as valuable: even when the destination remains distant, striving for it helps people discover hidden strengths. Dreams, then, are not only about achievement but about self-understanding. They can raise us up or weigh us down, depending on how we manage them.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of dreams. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Few stories illustrate the importance of following one’s dreams better than that of Malala Yousafzai. As a young girl in Pakistan, she longed for the right to go to school, even as extremists threatened those who supported female education. Despite the risks, Malala spoke publicly and wrote under her own name, arguing that every child should have the chance to learn. In 2012 she was attacked and severely wounded for her defiance. Yet her dream was stronger than fear. She recovered and continued her advocacy on an international stage, eventually becoming the youngest ever Nobel Peace Prize laureate. Malala’s story shows that following dreams is rarely an easy path: it can be dangerous and lonely. But it also demonstrates how one individual’s determination can alter the lives of millions. For her, a personal dream became a global cause. Her journey proves that to follow your dreams can mean not only fulfilling your own ambitions but also lifting others with you.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of dreams. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
In today’s culture, the language of “follow your dreams” is everywhere—from advertisements encouraging young people to chase careers in fashion or sport, to films where protagonists defy the odds and win. While inspiring, such messages can also mislead. For every person who succeeds, there are countless others who devote years to a dream only to fall short. An aspiring actor may never find steady work; a young athlete may face injury before their chance arrives. These stories are less often told, yet they are common. The reality is that opportunity is shaped by privilege, resources, and luck, as much as determination. Some critics argue that society’s obsession with dreams can set people up for crushing disappointment, while distracting them from realistic goals. Still, there is something powerful in the idea: dreams can motivate extraordinary effort and nurture resilience. The question is not whether we should dream, but whether we can balance ambition with perspective.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of dreams. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
I remember the first time I dared to tell someone about my dream of becoming a writer. I was a teenager, clutching a battered notebook filled with unfinished stories. When I nervously confided in a teacher, I expected laughter or dismissal. Instead, she leaned forward, listened carefully, and told me my words had promise. That moment felt like a spark catching light. I began to write every day, not because I thought success would come easily, but because the dream had taken root in my identity. Years later, after countless rejections, I finally saw my name in print. It was a small article in a local magazine, but it meant more than the payment. It was proof that the path I had chosen, however uncertain, was real. Following a dream, I learned, is less about a destination than about finding the courage to persist, even when no one is watching.<br>
