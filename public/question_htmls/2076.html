          <strong>A School on Rails</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> Anne and Jim were visiting Grandpa. They liked the time after supper when they usually sat and talked. Grandpa often told them stories about the “old days,” when he was a boy. Sometimes his stories were funny. Other times they were sad. Most of his stories were about how things used to be.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> “Last week I found a picture of a school I went to when I was a boy. Let me show it to you.” Grandpa went to his desk and brought back an old, faded photograph.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> Jim looked at it and said, “But, Grandpa, this looks like a train!”</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> “It was my school for a while,” Grandpa said. “Would you like to hear about it?”</p>
        <p><strong><em>5</em></strong> “A school in a train?” asked Anne.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “I have to hear this!” exclaimed Jim.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> Grandpa looked at the picture silently for a moment. “When I was a boy, my father worked for the railroad in Canada,” he began. “His job was to take care of sections of railroad track in remote areas. The workers’ families lived along the tracks in small groups many miles from other towns or people. There was no school. Everyone knew this was a problem, but no one knew what to do about it.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “At last someone had an idea. A railroad car was turned into a schoolroom, and school was brought to us! It stopped at settlements where there were enough children to attend and stayed for several weeks. Then it moved on to the next settlement. There was a teacher on the train who taught the lessons.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> “Where did the teacher live?” asked Jim.</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> “The teacher lived in the railroad car! He had a small kitchen with a sink and stove and a living area with a dining room, bedroom, and bathroom. There was no electricity on the train. A small furnace burned coal to keep the school car warm.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> “It doesn’t look much like a school,” Anne said, looking at the picture again.</p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> “In many ways it was just an ordinary railroad car,” Grandpa said. “It had comfortable cushioned seats and wood-paneled walls lined with windows. However, they did modify some things. The seats were turned to face each other, and a table was put in between each pair. At the front of the car were chalkboards, maps, and a desk for the teacher. Rows of shelves held books and other supplies.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> “Our parents didn’t have to make us go to school. We were happy for the chance to go. Any child who was able to get to the school car was allowed to attend, so the school car served the children of loggers, farmers, and miners in the area, too. I had 10 classmates.</p>
        <p><em><strong>14</strong></em> “School lasted from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M., with about an hour for lunch and recess. We learned most of the same lessons as students in regular schools did. The school car stayed for about six weeks. Then it was pushed back onto the main track, hitched to an engine, and pulled to the next settlement. While the school car was away, we did homework. When it returned, we were ready to continue to learn in our school on rails.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>15</strong></em> “Does it still exist?” Anne asked.</p>
        <p><em><strong>16</strong></em> “No,” Grandpa answered. “After a while, things changed. School cars aren’t around any longer. More people moved into the area. New roads were built, and towns were established. Schoolhouses were erected, too. My family moved to a small town. Other families sent their children to school in nearby towns. The school car wasn’t needed anymore.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>17</strong></em> “Too bad,” Jim muttered.</p>
        <p><em><strong>18</strong></em> “Oh, it’s probably for the best,” Grandpa added. “There was too much work for one teacher, and the time between visits was too long. Sometimes the homework was difficult, and no one could help. Still, while it was around, the school car was a special place for many of us.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>19</strong></em> “Do you remember the children in this picture?” Anne asked.</p>
        <p><em><strong>20</strong></em> “Some of them,” answered Grandpa. “But I remember all of those cold Canadian winters! After we do the dishes, I’ll tell you all about them.”</p>

        <p><strong><em>5</em></strong> “A school in a train?” asked Anne.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “I have to hear this!” exclaimed Jim.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> Grandpa looked at the picture silently for a moment. “When I was a boy, my father worked for the railroad in Canada,” he began. “His job was to take care of sections of railroad track in remote areas. The workers’ families lived along the tracks in small groups many miles from other towns or people. There was no school. Everyone knew this was a problem, but no one knew what to do about it.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “At last someone had an idea. A railroad car was turned into a schoolroom, and school was brought to us! It stopped at settlements where there were enough children to attend and stayed for several weeks. Then it moved on to the next settlement. There was a teacher on the train who taught the lessons.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> “Where did the teacher live?” asked Jim.</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> “The teacher lived in the railroad car! He had a small kitchen with a sink and stove and a living area with a dining room, bedroom, and bathroom. There was no electricity on the train. A small furnace burned coal to keep the school car warm.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> “It doesn’t look much like a school,” Anne said, looking at the picture again.</p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> “In many ways it was just an ordinary railroad car,” Grandpa said. “It had comfortable cushioned seats and wood-paneled walls lined with windows. However, they did modify some things. The seats were turned to face each other, and a table was put in between each pair. At the front of the car were chalkboards, maps, and a desk for the teacher. Rows of shelves held books and other supplies.</p>

        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> “Our parents didn’t have to make us go to school. We were happy for the chance to go. Any child who was able to get to the school car was allowed to attend, so the school car served the children of loggers, farmers, and miners in the area, too. I had 10 classmates.</p>
        <p><em><strong>14</strong></em> “School lasted from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M., with about an hour for lunch and recess. We learned most of the same lessons as students in regular schools did. The school car stayed for about six weeks. Then it was pushed back onto the main track, hitched to an engine, and pulled to the next settlement. While the school car was away, we did homework. When it returned, we were ready to continue to learn in our school on rails.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>15</strong></em> “Does it still exist?” Anne asked.</p>
        <p><em><strong>16</strong></em> “No,” Grandpa answered. “After a while, things changed. School cars aren’t around any longer. More people moved into the area. New roads were built, and towns were established. Schoolhouses were erected, too. My family moved to a small town. Other families sent their children to school in nearby towns. The school car wasn’t needed anymore.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>17</strong></em> “Too bad,” Jim muttered.</p>
        <p><em><strong>18</strong></em> “Oh, it’s probably for the best,” Grandpa added. “There was too much work for one teacher, and the time between visits was too long. Sometimes the homework was difficult, and no one could help. Still, while it was around, the school car was a special place for many of us.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>19</strong></em> “Do you remember the children in this picture?” Anne asked.</p>
        <p><em><strong>20</strong></em> “Some of them,” answered Grandpa. “But I remember all of those cold Canadian winters! After we do the dishes, I’ll tell you all about them.”</p>

          <strong>A School on Rails</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> Anne and Jim were visiting Grandpa. They liked the time after supper when they usually sat and talked. Grandpa often told them stories about the “old days,” when he was a boy. Sometimes his stories were funny. Other times they were sad. Most of his stories were about how things used to be.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> “Last week I found a picture of a school I went to when I was a boy. Let me show it to you.” Grandpa went to his desk and brought back an old, faded photograph.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> Jim looked at it and said, “But, Grandpa, this looks like a train!”</p>

        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> “It doesn’t look much like a school,” Anne said, looking at the picture again.</p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> “In many ways it was just an ordinary railroad car,” Grandpa said. “It had comfortable cushioned seats and wood-paneled walls lined with windows. However, they did modify some things. The seats were turned to face each other, and a table was put in between each pair. At the front of the car were chalkboards, maps, and a desk for the teacher. Rows of shelves held books and other supplies.</p>

        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> “Our parents didn’t have to make us go to school. We were happy for the chance to go. Any child who was able to get to the school car was allowed to attend, so the school car served the children of loggers, farmers, and miners in the area, too. I had 10 classmates.</p>
        <p><em><strong>14</strong></em> “School lasted from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M., with about an hour for lunch and recess. We learned most of the same lessons as students in regular schools did. The school car stayed for about six weeks. Then it was pushed back onto the main track, hitched to an engine, and pulled to the next settlement. While the school car was away, we did homework. When it returned, we were ready to continue to learn in our school on rails.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>15</strong></em> “Does it still exist?” Anne asked.</p>
        <p><em><strong>16</strong></em> “No,” Grandpa answered. “After a while, things changed. School cars aren’t around any longer. More people moved into the area. New roads were built, and towns were established. Schoolhouses were erected, too. My family moved to a small town. Other families sent their children to school in nearby towns. The school car wasn’t needed anymore.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>17</strong></em> “Too bad,” Jim muttered.</p>
        <p><em><strong>18</strong></em> “Oh, it’s probably for the best,” Grandpa added. “There was too much work for one teacher, and the time between visits was too long. Sometimes the homework was difficult, and no one could help. Still, while it was around, the school car was a special place for many of us.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>19</strong></em> “Do you remember the children in this picture?” Anne asked.</p>
        <p><em><strong>20</strong></em> “Some of them,” answered Grandpa. “But I remember all of those cold Canadian winters! After we do the dishes, I’ll tell you all about them.”</p>

          <strong>A School on Rails</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> Anne and Jim were visiting Grandpa. They liked the time after supper when they usually sat and talked. Grandpa often told them stories about the “old days,” when he was a boy. Sometimes his stories were funny. Other times they were sad. Most of his stories were about how things used to be.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> “Last week I found a picture of a school I went to when I was a boy. Let me show it to you.” Grandpa went to his desk and brought back an old, faded photograph.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> Jim looked at it and said, “But, Grandpa, this looks like a train!”</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> “It was my school for a while,” Grandpa said. “Would you like to hear about it?”</p>
        <p><strong><em>5</em></strong> “A school in a train?” asked Anne.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “I have to hear this!” exclaimed Jim.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> Grandpa looked at the picture silently for a moment. “When I was a boy, my father worked for the railroad in Canada,” he began. “His job was to take care of sections of railroad track in remote areas. The workers’ families lived along the tracks in small groups many miles from other towns or people. There was no school. Everyone knew this was a problem, but no one knew what to do about it.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “At last someone had an idea. A railroad car was turned into a schoolroom, and school was brought to us! It stopped at settlements where there were enough children to attend and stayed for several weeks. Then it moved on to the next settlement. There was a teacher on the train who taught the lessons.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> “Where did the teacher live?” asked Jim.</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> “The teacher lived in the railroad car! He had a small kitchen with a sink and stove and a living area with a dining room, bedroom, and bathroom. There was no electricity on the train. A small furnace burned coal to keep the school car warm.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> “It doesn’t look much like a school,” Anne said, looking at the picture again.</p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> “In many ways it was just an ordinary railroad car,” Grandpa said. “It had comfortable cushioned seats and wood-paneled walls lined with windows. However, they did modify some things. The seats were turned to face each other, and a table was put in between each pair. At the front of the car were chalkboards, maps, and a desk for the teacher.

        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> “Our parents didn’t have to make us go to school. We were happy for the chance to go. Any child who was able to get to the school car was allowed to attend, so the school car served the children of loggers, farmers, and miners in the area, too. I had 10 classmates.</p>
        <p><em><strong>14</strong></em> “School lasted from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M., with about an hour for lunch and recess. We learned most of the same lessons as students in regular schools did. The school car stayed for about six weeks. Then it was pushed back onto the main track, hitched to an engine, and pulled to the next settlement. While the school car was away, we did homework. When it returned, we were ready to continue to learn in our school on rails.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>15</strong></em> “Does it still exist?” Anne asked.</p>
        <p><em><strong>16</strong></em> “No,” Grandpa answered. “After a while, things changed. School cars aren’t around any longer. More people moved into the area. New roads were built, and towns were established. Schoolhouses were erected, too. My family moved to a small town. Other families sent their children to school in nearby towns. The school car wasn’t needed anymore.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>17</strong></em> “Too bad,” Jim muttered.</p>
        <p><em><strong>18</strong></em> “Oh, it’s probably for the best,” Grandpa added. “There was too much work for one teacher, and the time between visits was too long. Sometimes the homework was difficult, and no one could help. Still, while it was around, the school car was a special place for many of us.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>19</strong></em> “Do you remember the children in this picture?” Anne asked.</p>
        <p><em><strong>20</strong></em> “Some of them,” answered Grandpa. “But I remember all of those cold Canadian winters! After we do the dishes, I’ll tell you all about them.”</p>

          <strong>A School on Rails</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> Anne and Jim were visiting Grandpa. They liked the time after supper when they usually sat and talked. Grandpa often told them stories about the “old days,” when he was a boy. Sometimes his stories were funny. Other times they were sad. Most of his stories were about how things used to be.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> “Last week I found a picture of a school I went to when I was a boy. Let me show it to you.” Grandpa went to his desk and brought back an old, faded photograph.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> Jim looked at it and said, “But, Grandpa, this looks like a train!”</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> “It was my school for a while,” Grandpa said. “Would you like to hear about it?”</p>
        <p><strong><em>5</em></strong> “A school in a train?” asked Anne.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “I have to hear this!” exclaimed Jim.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> Grandpa looked at the picture silently for a moment. “When I was a boy, my father worked for the railroad in Canada,” he began. “His job was to take care of sections of railroad track in remote areas. The workers’ families lived along the tracks in small groups many miles from other towns or people. There was no school. Everyone knew this was a problem, but no one knew what to do about it.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “At last someone had an idea. A railroad car was turned into a schoolroom, and school was brought to us! It stopped at settlements where there were enough children to attend and stayed for several weeks. Then it moved on to the next settlement. There was a teacher on the train who taught the lessons.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> “Where did the teacher live?” asked Jim.</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> “The teacher lived in the railroad car! He had a small kitchen with a sink and stove and a living area with a dining room, bedroom, and bathroom. There was no electricity on the train. A small furnace burned coal to keep the school car warm.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> “It doesn’t look much like a school,” Anne said, looking at the picture again.</p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> “In many ways it was just an ordinary railroad car,” Grandpa said. “It had comfortable cushioned seats and wood-paneled walls lined with windows. However, they did modify some things. The seats were turned to face each other, and a table was put in between each pair. At the front of the car were chalkboards, maps, and a desk for the teacher. Rows of shelves held books and other supplies.</p>
        <p>

        <p><em><strong>17</strong></em> “Too bad,” Jim muttered.</p>
        <p><em><strong>18</strong></em> “Oh, it’s probably for the best,” Grandpa added. “There was too much work for one teacher, and the time between visits was too long. Sometimes the homework was difficult, and no one could help. Still, while it was around, the school car was a special place for many of us.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>19</strong></em> “Do you remember the children in this picture?” Anne asked.</p>
        <p><em><strong>20</strong></em> “Some of them,” answered Grandpa. “But I remember all of those cold Canadian winters! After we do the dishes, I’ll tell you all about them.”</p>

          <strong>A School on Rails</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> Anne and Jim were visiting Grandpa. They liked the time after supper when they usually sat and talked. Grandpa often told them stories about the “old days,” when he was a boy. Sometimes his stories were funny. Other times they were sad. Most of his stories were about how things used to be.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> “Last week I found a picture of a school I went to when I was a boy. Let me show it to you.” Grandpa went to his desk and brought back an old, faded photograph.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> Jim looked at it and said, “But, Grandpa, this looks like a train!”</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> “It was my school for a while,” Grandpa said. “Would you like to hear about it?”</p>
        <p><strong><em>5</em></strong> “A school in a train?” asked Anne.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “I have to hear this!” exclaimed Jim.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> Grandpa looked at the picture silently for a moment. “When I was a boy, my father worked for the railroad in Canada,” he began. “His job was to take care of sections of railroad track in remote areas. The workers’ families lived along the tracks in small groups many miles from other towns or people. There was no school. Everyone knew this was a problem, but no one knew what to do about it.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “At last someone had an idea. A railroad car was turned into a schoolroom, and school was brought to us! It stopped at settlements where there were enough children to attend and stayed for several weeks. Then it moved on to the next settlement. There was a teacher on the train who taught the lessons.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> “Where did the teacher live?” asked Jim.</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> “The teacher lived in the railroad car! He had a small kitchen with a sink and stove and a living area with a dining room, bedroom, and bathroom. There was no electricity on the train. A small furnace burned coal to keep the school car warm.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> “It doesn’t look much like a school,” Anne said, looking at the picture again.</p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> “In many ways it was just an ordinary railroad car,” Grandpa said. “It had comfortable cushioned seats and wood-paneled walls lined with windows. However, they did modify some things. The seats were turned to face each other, and a table was put in between each pair. At the front of the car were chalkboards, maps, and a desk for the teacher. Rows of shelves held books and other supplies.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> “Our parents didn’t have to make us go to school. We were happy for the chance to go. Any child who was able to get to the school car was allowed to attend, so the school car served the children of loggers, farmers, and miners in the area, too. I had 10 classmates.</p>
        <p><em><strong>14</strong></em> “School lasted from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M., with about an hour for lunch and recess. We learned most of the same lessons as students in regular schools did. The school car stayed for about six weeks. Then it was pushed back onto the main track, hitched to an engine, and pulled to the next settlement. While the school car was away, we did homework. When it returned, we were ready to continue to learn in our school on rails.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>15</strong></em> “Does it still exist?” Anne asked.</p>
        <p><em><strong>16</strong></em> “No,” Grandpa answered. “After a while, things changed. School cars aren’t around any longer. More people moved into the area. New roads were built, and towns were established. Schoolhouses were erected, too. My family moved to a small town. Other families sent their children to school in nearby towns. The school car wasn’t needed anymore.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>17</strong></em> “Too bad,” Jim muttered.</p>
        <p><em><strong>18</strong></em> “Oh, it’s probably for the best,” Grandpa added. “There was too much work for one teacher, and the time between visits was too long.

        <p><em><strong>19</strong></em> “Do you remember the children in this picture?” Anne asked.</p>
        <p><em><strong>20</strong></em> “Some of them,” answered Grandpa. “But I remember all of those cold Canadian winters! After we do the dishes, I’ll tell you all about them.”</p>
