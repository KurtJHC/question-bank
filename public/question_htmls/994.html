          <strong>Mattie Stepanek, Poet-Hero</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by S. L. Dulak</em><br><br><em><strong>1</strong></em> Mattie Stepanek is very busy. He speaks at conferences and participates in fund-raising events. He has been a guest on television shows in Chicago and New York City. He has written two number-one best-sellers. He owns a motorized scooter that he calls Slick. Although this sounds like an exciting life, Mattie has to deal with many hardships as well. Mattie is an 11-year-old boy with a life-threatening disease.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> Matthew Joseph Thaddeus Stepanek likes to be called Mattie. He was born with a rare form of muscular dystrophy, or MD for short. MD interferes with the body’s ability to breathe and also affects the heart. Mattie’s muscles have become so weak that he has a hard time walking. His scooter is a motorized wheelchair. He must take a portable oxygen tank everywhere he goes. These things remind Mattie of the seriousness of his disease, as do the many timeconsuming medical treatments he has to have each day. But despite the disease, Mattie enjoys many of the same activities as other children his age. He loves to watch baseball and read. He has favorite games and toys. He even has a first-degree black belt in a martial art. And like other 11-year-olds, he has schoolwork. Because of the complications related to his disease, Mattie is homeschooled instead of going to a regular school.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> Every summer Mattie spends one week at Camp Maria, the Muscular Dystrophy Association camp in Leonardtown, Maryland. The camp motto is “Friends Helping Friends.” A friend is assigned to help each camper. Mattie’s friend helps him with arts and crafts, wheelchair football and baseball, singing, and dancing. At the close of the session, campers write their special wishes on a piece of paper. The papers are then put into a basket, which is tied to balloons and released into the air. The balloons sail into the sky, launching the wishes.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> For the past five years, Mattie has made the same three wishes: to have some of the thousands of poems he has written published in a book, to meet one of his heroes, former U.S. president Jimmy Carter, and to have his poems read on television. Now Mattie believes the balloon wishes work.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> Mattie’s first wish came true during one of his numerous stays in the hospital. Cheryl and Peter Barnes, founders of VSP Books, read some of Mattie’s poems and knew right away that they were special. In July 2001 the Barneses agreed to print some of the poems in a book Mattie entitled <strong>Heartsongs</strong>. His second book, <strong>Journey Through Heartsongs</strong>, was published in October 2001. More than 450,000 copies of both books have been sold.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> While Mattie was in the hospital in Washington, D.C., another wish came true. He spoke on the telephone with Jimmy Carter. During their conversation Mattie didn’t mention his disease. Instead, he and Mr. Carter talked of bringing peace to countries at war, such as Bosnia. Mattie thinks Jimmy Carter is the perfect hero. Since his presidency ended in 1981, Mr. Carter has worked for world peace and human rights. Mattie, too, wants to grow up to be a peacemaker and a politician.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7 </strong></em>On October 19, 2001, the last of his wishes came true. Mattie was a guest on Oprah Winfrey’s nationally televised talk show. He talked with Ms. Winfrey about his desire for peace in the world. She read several of Mattie’s poems on television. Some of Mattie’s poems are about the ordeal of living with a serious disease. But Mattie doesn’t always write about the hardships of life. Most of his poems are about hope, peace, and wisdom.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> Mattie is the Muscular Dystrophy Association’s 2002 National Goodwill Ambassador. As a spokesperson for Children’s Hospice International, he speaks on behalf of sick children and their families. Although he has received many honors, Mattie feels that his greatest achievement is being alive today, especially since he has had many close calls throughout the years. Mattie continues to spread his message of peace and goodwill, hoping to inspire people to help others.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> Mattie tries to live his life by three ideas. The first is to play in the puddles after every storm. The second is to celebrate life every day. The third is to never give up trying to reach what you want. Mattie’s life is certainly a reflection of each of these principles.</p>

He has been a guest on television shows in Chicago and New York City. He has written two number-one best-sellers. He owns a motorized scooter that he calls Slick. Although this sounds like an exciting life, Mattie has to deal with many hardships as well. Mattie is an 11-year-old boy with a life-threatening disease.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> Matthew Joseph Thaddeus Stepanek likes to be called Mattie. He was born with a rare form of muscular dystrophy, or MD for short. MD interferes with the body’s ability to breathe and also affects the heart. Mattie’s muscles have become so weak that he has a hard time walking. His scooter is a motorized wheelchair. He must take a portable oxygen tank everywhere he goes. These things remind Mattie of the seriousness of his disease, as do the many timeconsuming medical treatments he has to have each day. But despite the disease, Mattie enjoys many of the same activities as other children his age. He loves to watch baseball and read. He has favorite games and toys. He even has a first-degree black belt in a martial art. And like other 11-year-olds, he has schoolwork. Because of the complications related to his disease, Mattie is homeschooled instead of going to a regular school.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> Every summer Mattie spends one week at Camp Maria, the Muscular Dystrophy Association camp in Leonardtown, Maryland. The camp motto is “Friends Helping Friends.” A friend is assigned to help each camper. Mattie’s friend helps him with arts and crafts, wheelchair football and baseball, singing, and dancing. At the close of the session, campers write their special wishes on a piece of paper. The papers are then put into a basket, which is tied to balloons and released into the air. The balloons sail into the sky, launching the wishes.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> For the past five years, Mattie has made the same three wishes: to have some of the thousands of poems he has written published in a book, to meet one of his heroes, former U.S. president Jimmy Carter, and to have his poems read on television. Now Mattie believes the balloon wishes work.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> Mattie’s first wish came true during one of his numerous stays in the hospital. Cheryl and Peter Barnes, founders of VSP Books, read some of Mattie’s poems and knew right away that they were special. In July 2001 the Barneses agreed to print some of the poems in a book Mattie entitled <strong>Heartsongs</strong>. His second book, <strong>Journey Through Heartsongs</strong>, was published in October 2001. More than 450,000 copies of both books have been sold.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> While Mattie was in the hospital in Washington, D.C., another wish came true. He spoke on the telephone with Jimmy Carter. During their conversation Mattie didn’t mention his disease. Instead, he and Mr. Carter talked of bringing peace to countries at war, such as Bosnia. Mattie thinks Jimmy Carter is the perfect hero. Since his presidency ended in 1981, Mr. Carter has worked for world peace and human rights. Mattie, too, wants to grow up to be a peacemaker and a politician.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7 </strong></em>On October 19, 2001, the last of his wishes came true. Mattie was a guest on Oprah Winfrey’s nationally televised talk show. He talked with Ms. Winfrey about his desire for peace in the world. She read several of Mattie’s poems on television. Some of Mattie’s poems are about the ordeal of living with a serious disease. But Mattie doesn’t always write about the hardships of life. Most of his poems are about hope, peace, and wisdom.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> Mattie is the Muscular Dystrophy Association’s 2002 National Goodwill Ambassador. As a spokesperson for Children’s Hospice International, he speaks on behalf of sick children and their families. Although he has received many honors, Mattie feels that his greatest achievement is being alive today, especially since he has had many close calls throughout the years. Mattie continues to spread his message of peace and goodwill, hoping to inspire people to help others.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> Mattie tries to live his life by three ideas. The first is to play in the puddles after every storm. The second is to celebrate life every day. The third is to never give up trying to reach what you want. Mattie’s life is certainly a reflection of each of these principles.</p>

        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> Every summer Mattie spends one week at Camp Maria, the Muscular Dystrophy Association camp in Leonardtown, Maryland. The camp motto is “Friends Helping Friends.” A friend is assigned to help each camper. Mattie’s friend helps him with arts and crafts, wheelchair football and baseball, singing, and dancing. At the close of the session, campers write their special wishes on a piece of paper. The papers are then put into a basket, which is tied to balloons and released into the air. The balloons sail into the sky, launching the wishes.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> For the past five years, Mattie has made the same three wishes: to have some of the thousands of poems he has written published in a book, to meet one of his heroes, former U.S. president Jimmy Carter, and to have his poems read on television. Now Mattie believes the balloon wishes work.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> Mattie’s first wish came true during one of his numerous stays in the hospital. Cheryl and Peter Barnes, founders of VSP Books, read some of Mattie’s poems and knew right away that they were special. In July 2001 the Barneses agreed to print some of the poems in a book Mattie entitled <strong>Heartsongs</strong>. His second book, <strong>Journey Through Heartsongs</strong>, was published in October 2001. More than 450,000 copies of both books have been sold.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> While Mattie was in the hospital in Washington, D.C., another wish came true. He spoke on the telephone with Jimmy Carter. During their conversation Mattie didn’t mention his disease. Instead, he and Mr. Carter talked of bringing peace to countries at war, such as Bosnia. Mattie thinks Jimmy Carter is the perfect hero. Since his presidency ended in 1981, Mr. Carter has worked for world peace and human rights. Mattie, too, wants to grow up to be a peacemaker and a politician.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7 </strong></em>On October 19, 2001, the last of his wishes came true. Mattie was a guest on Oprah Winfrey’s nationally televised talk show. He talked with Ms. Winfrey about his desire for peace in the world. She read several of Mattie’s poems on television. Some of Mattie’s poems are about the ordeal of living with a serious disease. But Mattie doesn’t always write about the hardships of life. Most of his poems are about hope, peace, and wisdom.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> Mattie is the Muscular Dystrophy Association’s 2002 National Goodwill Ambassador. As a spokesperson for Children’s Hospice International, he speaks on behalf of sick children and their families. Although he has received many honors, Mattie feels that his greatest achievement is being alive today, especially since he has had many close calls throughout the years. Mattie continues to spread his message of peace and goodwill, hoping to inspire people to help others.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> Mattie tries to live his life by three ideas. The first is to play in the puddles after every storm. The second is to celebrate life every day. The third is to never give up trying to reach what you want. Mattie’s life is certainly a reflection of each of these principles.</p>

          <strong>Mattie Stepanek, Poet-Hero</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by S. L. Dulak</em><br><br><em><strong>1</strong></em> Mattie Stepanek is very busy. He speaks at conferences and participates in fund-raising events. He has been a guest on television shows in Chicago and New York City. He has written two number-one best-sellers. He owns a motorized scooter that he calls Slick. Although this sounds like an exciting life, Mattie has to deal with many hardships as well. Mattie is an 11-year-old boy with a life-threatening disease.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> Matthew Joseph Thaddeus Stepanek likes to be called Mattie. He was born with a rare form of muscular dystrophy, or MD for short. MD interferes with the body’s ability to breathe and also affects the heart. Mattie’s muscles have become so weak that he has a hard time walking. His scooter is a motorized wheelchair. He must take a portable oxygen tank everywhere he goes. These things remind Mattie of the seriousness of his disease, as do the many timeconsuming medical treatments he has to have each day. But despite the disease, Mattie enjoys many of the same activities as other children his age. He loves to watch baseball and read. He has favorite games and toys. He even has a first-degree black belt in a martial art. And like other 11-year-olds, he has schoolwork. Because of the complications related to his disease, Mattie is homeschooled instead of going to a regular school.</p>

        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> Every summer Mattie spends one week at Camp Maria, the Muscular Dystrophy Association camp in Leonardtown, Maryland. The camp motto is “Friends Helping Friends.” A friend is assigned to help each camper. Mattie’s friend helps him with arts and crafts, wheelchair football and baseball, singing, and dancing. At the close of the session, campers write their special wishes on a piece of paper. The papers are then put into a basket, which is tied to balloons and released into the air. The balloons sail into the sky, launching the wishes.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> For the past five years, Mattie has made the same three wishes: to have some of the thousands of poems he has written published in a book, to meet one of his heroes, former U.S. president Jimmy Carter, and to have his poems read on television. Now Mattie believes the balloon wishes work.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> Mattie’s first wish came true during one of his numerous stays in the hospital. Cheryl and Peter Barnes, founders of VSP Books, read some of Mattie’s poems and knew right away that they were special. In July 2001 the Barneses agreed to print some of the poems in a book Mattie entitled <strong>Heartsongs</strong>. His second book, <strong>Journey Through Heartsongs</strong>, was published in October 2001. More than 450,000 copies of both books have been sold.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> While Mattie was in the hospital in Washington, D.C., another wish came true. He spoke on the telephone with Jimmy Carter. During their conversation Mattie didn’t mention his disease. Instead, he and Mr. Carter talked of bringing peace to countries at war, such as Bosnia. Mattie thinks Jimmy Carter is the perfect hero. Since his presidency ended in 1981, Mr. Carter has worked for world peace and human rights. Mattie, too, wants to grow up to be a peacemaker and a politician.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7 </strong></em>On October 19, 2001, the last of his wishes came true. Mattie was a guest on Oprah Winfrey’s nationally televised talk show. He talked with Ms. Winfrey about his desire for peace in the world. She read several of Mattie’s poems on television. Some of Mattie’s poems are about the ordeal of living with a serious disease. But Mattie doesn’t always write about the hardships of life. Most of his poems are about hope, peace, and wisdom.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> Mattie is the Muscular Dystrophy Association’s 2002 National Goodwill Ambassador. As a spokesperson for Children’s Hospice International, he speaks on behalf of sick children and their families. Although he has received many honors, Mattie feels that his greatest achievement is being alive today, especially since he has had many close calls throughout the years. Mattie continues to spread his message of peace and goodwill, hoping to inspire people to help others.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> Mattie tries to live his life by three ideas. The first is to play in the puddles after every storm. The second is to celebrate life every day. The third is to never give up trying to reach what you want. Mattie’s life is certainly a reflection of each of these principles.</p>
