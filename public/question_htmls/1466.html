The Earth is divided into four main layers. The dense, hot inner core (yellow), the molten outer core (orange), the mantle (red), and the thin crust (brown), which supports all life in the known universe.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The hard, brittle crust extends from Earth's surface to the so-called Mohorovicic discontinuity, nicknamed the Moho. The Moho is not located at a uniform depth, but about 10 kilometers below the seafloor and about 35 kilometers beneath the surface of continents.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Beneath the Moho is the mantle, the viscous layer that makes up more than half of Earth's volume. The mantle is divided from the core by the Gutenberg discontinuity, about 2,880 kilometers beneath Earth's surface. The outer core is molten and liquid iron and nickel, while the inner core is solid and much more dense than either iron or nickel at the surface.<br>

What does it take for an alien planet to host life as we know it on Earth? A lot, as it turns out. Despite a paper last year claiming that there may be 300 million planets in our galaxy that are “potentially habitable,” new research published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society confounds that view.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Suggesting that Earth-like conditions on potentially habitable planets may be much rarer than previously thought, this new analysis of known exoplanets focuses on photosynthesis. 4,422 exoplanets have been discovered thus far by astronomers, but only a handful are considered to be potentially habitable.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Photosynthesis is how plants use sunlight, water and carbon dioxide to create oxygen and energy. Given that photosynthesis has been critical in enabling complex biospheres of the type found on Earth, for an exoplanet to be potentially habitable therefore means it would develop an oxygen-based atmosphere. Photosynthesis requires liquid water. Only exoplanets that are the right temperature — not too hot, not too cold — could host such a thing on their surface. So how many rocky, Earth-sized exoplanets are in this so-called “Goldilock’s Zone?” Not many, suggests this research. The study reveals only one planet that comes close to receiving enough sunshine to sustain a large biosphere that could be detected — Kepler−442b<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
When did humans first walk the surface of Planet Earth? The oldest Homo sapiens fossils that anthropologists have found thus far date to around 315,000 years ago. That means we can say that modern humans are at least that old.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But our lineage likely extends further back in time — we just don’t have the fossils to prove it. DNA evidence drawn from comparisons of different human genomes, as well as those of close cousins like Neanderthals and Denisovans, put the split between the three groups at least 400,000 years ago. So, it’s possible that Homo sapiens are over half a million years old.<br>

How serious will the Earth’s over-population problem be in the future? For the first time in modern history, the world’s population is expected to virtually stop growing by the end of this century, due in large part to falling global fertility rates, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of new data from the United Nations.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
By 2100, the world’s population is projected to reach approximately 10.9 billion, with annual growth of less than 0.1% – a steep decline from the current rate. Between 1950 and today, the world’s population grew between 1% and 2% each year, with the number of people rising from 2.5 billion to more than 7.7 billion.<br>

The Earth is divided into four main layers. The dense, hot inner core (yellow), the molten outer core (orange), the mantle (red), and the thin crust (brown), which supports all life in the known universe.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The hard, brittle crust extends from Earth's surface to the so-called Mohorovicic discontinuity, nicknamed the Moho. The Moho is not located at a uniform depth, but about 10 kilometers below the seafloor and about 35 kilometers beneath the surface of continents.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Beneath the Moho is the mantle, the viscous layer that makes up more than half of Earth's volume. The mantle is divided from the core by the Gutenberg discontinuity, about 2,880 kilometers beneath Earth's surface. The outer core is molten and liquid iron and nickel, while the inner core is solid and much more dense than either iron or nickel at the surface.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
What does it take for an alien planet to host life as we know it on Earth? A lot, as it turns out. Despite a paper last year claiming that there may be 300 million planets in our galaxy that are “potentially habitable,” new research published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society confounds that view.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Suggesting that Earth-like conditions on potentially habitable planets may be much rarer than previously thought, this new analysis of known exoplanets focuses on photosynthesis. 4,422 exoplanets have been discovered thus far by astronomers, but only a handful are considered to be potentially habitable.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Photosynthesis is how plants use sunlight, water and carbon dioxide to create oxygen and energy. Given that photosynthesis has been critical in enabling complex biospheres of the type found on Earth, for an exoplanet to be potentially habitable therefore means it would develop an oxygen-based atmosphere. Photosynthesis requires liquid water. Only exoplanets that are the right temperature — not too hot, not too cold — could host such a thing on their surface. So how many rocky, Earth-sized exoplanets are in this so-called “Goldilock’s Zone?” Not many, suggests this research. The study reveals only one planet that comes close to receiving enough sunshine to sustain a large biosphere that could be detected — Kepler−442b<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
When did humans first walk the surface of Planet Earth? The oldest Homo sapiens fossils that anthropologists have found thus far date to around 315,000 years ago. That means we can say that modern humans are at least that old.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But our lineage likely extends further back in time — we just don’t have the fossils to prove it. DNA evidence drawn from comparisons of different human genomes, as well as those of close cousins like Neanderthals and Denisovans, put the split between the three groups at least 400,000 years ago. So, it’s possible that Homo sapiens are over half a million years old.<br>

How serious will the Earth’s over-population problem be in the future? For the first time in modern history, the world’s population is expected to virtually stop growing by the end of this century, due in large part to falling global fertility rates, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of new data from the United Nations.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
​By 2100, the world’s population is projected to reach approximately 10.9 billion, with annual growth of less than 0.1% – a steep decline from the current rate. Between 1950 and today, the world’s population grew between 1% and 2% each year, with the number of people rising from 2.5 billion to more than 7.7 billion.<br>

DNA evidence drawn from comparisons of different human genomes, as well as those of close cousins like Neanderthals and Denisovans, put the split between the three groups at least 400,000 years ago. So, it’s possible that Homo sapiens are over half a million years old.<br>

How serious will the Earth’s over-population problem be in the future? For the first time in modern history, the world’s population is expected to virtually stop growing by the end of this century, due in large part to falling global fertility rates, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of new data from the United Nations.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
​By 2100, the world’s population is projected to reach approximately 10.9 billion, with annual growth of less than 0.1% – a steep decline from the current rate. Between 1950 and today, the world’s population grew between 1% and 2% each year, with the number of people rising from 2.5 billion to more than 7.7 billion.<br>
