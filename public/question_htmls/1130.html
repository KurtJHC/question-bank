        <p><em>Read the poem below by Billy Collins then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>​The Long Day</strong><br><br>
In the morning I ate a banana<br>
Like a young ape<br>
And worked on a poem called “Nocturne.”</p>
        <p>In the afternoon I opened the mail<br>
With a short kitchen knife<br>
And when dusk began to fall</p>
        <p>I took off my clothes,<br>
Put on “Sweethearts of the Rodeo” *<br>
And soaked in a claw-footed bathtub.</p>
        <p>I closed my eyes and thought<br>
About the alphabet,<br>
The letters leaving the halls of kindergarten</p>
        <p>To become literature.<br>
If the British call z zed,<br>
I wondered, why not call b bed and d dead</p>
        <p>Why is z, which looks like<br>
The fastest letter, at the very end?<br>
<span class="txt-underline"><strong>Unless they are all moving east</strong></span></p>
        <p>When we are facing north in our chairs.<br>
It was then that the dog barked,<br>
There was a clap of thunder,</p>
        <p>And the claw-footed bathtub<br>
Took one step forward,<br>
Or was it backward</p>
        <p>I had to ask<br>
As the windows went dark<br>
And I reached for a far-away towel.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>* “Sweethearts of the Rodeo” is a name of music band.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>What is Flat Pack Furniture?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Flat packs, also known as ready-to-assemble furniture, known-down furniture, or selfassembly furniture are incredibly popular because of their affordability. This type of furniture is produced in flat parts and are assembled when purchased without the need for special tools (in most cases). <strong>12 ……….</strong> Depending on the piece of furniture, they can have 5 components to assemble, or over 50. One of the most known flat pack retailers is IKEA, with stores in over 25 countries.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>What is Flat Pack Furniture Made from?&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The materials used for the making of flat packs is either solid wood, medium-density fibreboard (MDF), or chipboard. MDF is the product of the residuals of softwood and hardwood mixed with wax and combined to form a panel stronger than chipboard. Chipboard is made from wood chippings, sawdust, wood shavings or particles, and are bound together into a board. <strong>13 ………. </strong>The only disadvantage of it is that it is more susceptible to water damage. Solid wood can crack due to time or environment conditions, which is something that cannot happen to chipboard. MDF prices can vary as well, but if it is of a high quality, then it is much stronger than chipboard. <strong>14 ……….</strong> It is often used in furniture such as desks, and cabinets.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Advantages of Flat Pack Furniture&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&gt;&gt; One of the most famous advantages of flat pack furniture – affordable prices.<strong> 15 ………</strong> Also, they are said to be cheaper because they compensate for their low durability, but if properly maintained they can be very durable.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&gt;&gt; They are easy to ship, disassemble and put together. Companies do not spend tons of money on shipping costs and transportation because customers can pick their furniture themselves and build them in their homes.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&gt;&gt; Flat packs can be customised – there are many sites and hacks for improving, changing the design or style of flat packs.<strong> 16 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>&gt;&gt; They are produced by machines, which cuts company costs a lot. <strong>17 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>&gt;&gt; This type of furniture is easily packed and moved from one place to another. If you ever move house, you can dismantle your furniture, put them in their flat boxes and easily transport and reassemble them.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>What is Flat Pack Furniture?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Flat packs, also known as ready-to-assemble furniture, known-down furniture, or selfassembly furniture are incredibly popular because of their affordability. This type of furniture is produced in flat parts and are assembled when purchased without the need for special tools (in most cases).&nbsp;<strong>12 ………</strong>.&nbsp;Depending on the piece of furniture, they can have 5 components to assemble, or over 50. One of the most known flat pack retailers is IKEA, with stores in over 25 countries.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
What is Flat Pack Furniture Made from?&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The materials used for the making of flat packs is either solid wood, medium-density fibreboard (MDF), or chipboard. MDF is the product of the residuals of softwood and hardwood mixed with wax and combined to form a panel stronger than chipboard. Chipboard is made from wood chippings, sawdust, wood shavings or particles, and are bound together into a board.&nbsp;<strong>13 ………</strong>.&nbsp;The only disadvantage of it is that it is more susceptible to water damage. Solid wood can crack due to time or environment conditions, which is something that cannot happen to chipboard. MDF prices can vary as well, but if it is of a high quality, then it is much stronger than chipboard.&nbsp;<strong>14 ………</strong>.&nbsp;It is often used in furniture such as desks, and cabinets.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Advantages of Flat Pack Furniture&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&gt;&gt; One of the most famous advantages of flat pack furniture – affordable prices.&nbsp;<strong>15 ………</strong>. Also, they are said to be cheaper because they compensate for their low durability, but if properly maintained they can be very durable.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&gt;&gt; Flat packs can be customised – there are many sites and hacks for improving, changing the design or style of flat packs.&nbsp;<strong>16 ………</strong>.</p>
        <p>&gt;&gt; They are produced by machines, which cuts company costs a lot.&nbsp;<strong>17 ………</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>What is Flat Pack Furniture?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Flat packs, also known as ready-to-assemble furniture, known-down furniture, or selfassembly furniture are incredibly popular because of their affordability. This type of furniture is produced in flat parts and are assembled when purchased without the need for special tools (in most cases).&nbsp;<strong>12 ………</strong>.&nbsp;Depending on the piece of furniture, they can have 5 components to assemble, or over 50. One of the most known flat pack retailers is IKEA, with stores in over 25 countries.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
What is Flat Pack Furniture Made from?&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The materials used for the making of flat packs is either solid wood, medium-density fibreboard (MDF), or chipboard. MDF is the product of the residuals of softwood and hardwood mixed with wax and combined to form a panel stronger than chipboard. Chipboard is made from wood chippings, sawdust, wood shavings or particles, and are bound together into a board.&nbsp;<strong>13 ………</strong>.&nbsp;The only disadvantage of it is that it is more susceptible to water damage. Solid wood can crack due to time or environment conditions, which is something that cannot happen to chipboard. MDF prices can vary as well, but if it is of a high quality, then it is much stronger than chipboard.&nbsp;<strong>14 ………</strong>.&nbsp;It is often used in furniture such as desks, and cabinets.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Advantages of Flat Pack Furniture&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&gt;&gt; One of the most famous advantages of flat pack furniture – affordable prices.&nbsp;<strong>15 ………</strong>. Also, they are said to be cheaper because they compensate for their low durability, but if properly maintained they can be very durable.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&gt;&gt; They are easy to ship, disassemble and put together. Companies do not spend tons of money on shipping costs and transportation because customers can pick their furniture themselves and build them in their homes.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&gt;&gt; Flat packs can be customised – there are many sites and hacks for improving, changing the design or style of flat packs.&nbsp;<strong>16 ………</strong>.</p>
        <p>&gt;&gt; They are produced by machines, which cuts company costs a lot.&nbsp;<strong>17 ………</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&gt;&gt; This type of furniture is easily packed and moved from one place to another. If you ever move house, you can dismantle your furniture, put them in their flat boxes and easily transport and reassemble them.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>What is Flat Pack Furniture?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Flat packs, also known as ready-to-assemble furniture, known-down furniture, or selfassembly furniture are incredibly popular because of their affordability. This type of furniture is produced in flat parts and are assembled when purchased without the need for special tools (in most cases).&nbsp;<strong>12 ………</strong>.&nbsp;Depending on the piece of furniture, they can have 5 components to assemble, or over 50. One of the most known flat pack retailers is IKEA, with stores in over 25 countries.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
What is Flat Pack Furniture Made from?&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The materials used for the making of flat packs is either solid wood, medium-density fibreboard (MDF), or chipboard. MDF is the product of the residuals of softwood and hardwood mixed with wax and combined to form a panel stronger than chipboard. Chipboard is made from wood chippings, sawdust, wood shavings or particles, and are bound together into a board.&nbsp;<strong>13 ………</strong>.&nbsp;The only disadvantage of it is that it is more susceptible to water damage. Solid wood can crack due to time or environment conditions, which is something that cannot happen to chipboard. MDF prices can vary as well, but if it is of a high quality, then it is much stronger than chipboard.&nbsp;<strong>14 ………</strong>.&nbsp;It is often used in furniture such as desks, and cabinets.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Advantages of Flat Pack Furniture&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&gt;&gt; One of the most famous advantages of flat pack furniture – affordable prices.&nbsp;<strong>15 ………</strong>. Also, they are said to be cheaper because they compensate for their low durability, but if properly maintained they can be very durable.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&gt;&gt; They are easy to ship, disassemble and put together. Companies do not spend tons of money on shipping costs and transportation because customers can pick their furniture themselves and build them in their homes.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&gt;&gt; Flat packs can be customised – there are many sites and hacks for improving, changing the design or style of flat packs.&nbsp;<strong>16 ………</strong>.</p>
        <p>&gt;&gt; They are produced by machines, which cuts company costs a lot.&nbsp;<strong>17 ………</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&gt;&gt; This type of furniture is easily packed and moved from one place to another. If you ever move house, you can dismantle your furniture, put them in their flat boxes and easily transport and reassemble them.</p>

      <div class="col-6">{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
I remember seeing her face and falling in love. Those deep blue eyes. A clean coat, all black. Except for one spot, just below her left eye. It was as though she had a black eye, but it was white. And she had the cutest meow.<br>
<br>
I remember staring into her eyes just as she stared back at me. I told the man that I wanted this kitten. No other would suffice. This kitten, named Jess, she would be mine. I will be hers.<br>
<br>
I remember taking her home. She was purring so loudly, I could hardly hear the radio in the background. She loved having her chin rubbed. Her eyes were closed as her tail swayed back and forth.<br>
<br>
I remember watching her jump out of my arms onto the floor. She began walking around. Her new home was one big puzzle. She was going to piece it all together. She started in the living room, made her way to the kitchen, through the halls, and soon she found my room. Her room.<br>
<br>
I remember the next 14 years with Jess. We did everything together. She was my best friend. I never felt alone. I always had her when no one else was available. I was sad to leave her when I went to college. They wouldn't allow pets in the dorms. But I was ready to see her during Thanksgiving break.<br>
<br>
I remember that call. I didn't move for several minutes. My mum kept asking if I was okay. Of course I wasn't. Jess wasn't okay. Our stupid neighbour let his son drive without a license. He ran over Jess. The vet wasn't sure if she'd make it.<br>
<br>
I remember driving home. That long drive home. It took everything in me not to cry the entire time. I couldn't deal with this. My best friend, gone. I didn't even get to say goodbye.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
At the time, it felt as if I were opening my eyes for the very first time; I felt as if it were the very first moment of my life.<br>
<br>
Our existence, our lives, they are the culmination of our memories and of experiences. They teach us how to behave around others, who to trust and who to avoid. How to get ready for the day, how to deal with hurt, how to drown in bliss.<br>
<br>
They are the infinite files tucked away in our minds, instruction manuals for life; so imagine waking from that deep place and finding that the warehouse with all those files suddenly lay barren.<br>
<br>
What would you do? I would simply scratch my head and flip the switch that drowns the place in darkness, never to be of use again. But when it came to life, I didn't have that luxury.<br>
<br>
When I awoke upon the soft cushion that was my bed, I was lost. I instinctively rummaged the recesses of my mind, trying to find any sign, any remnant of something that could help me. I knew something was missing, the sudden absence leaving me unnerved, a hollow pit left where my memories once were. I almost felt as if I could stick a hand inside and rummage around an abandoned skull. Yet still I searched, hoping that at the very least, I could find a shadow of what I once had, of who I once was.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
The first day I flew, it is such a crystalline memory. I can close my eyes and relive the moment I left the earth. The clench, fear, panic as my hands slipped from the bar, and the relief, wonder, joy as when I just kept going up.<br>
<br>
I was twelve, and it was the third day of a cub scout summer camp. My mum had been busy that morning. She just had time to bag me a sandwich, hand me a tube of sunscreen, and drop me off at the scout leader’s house. I put on the sunscreen as I sat on the front porch and waited for the leader’s son to be ready. Soon, we were off.<br>
<br>
At the camp, I bolted out of the car to find my friend, Patrick. He was already on the playground. I don't remember what we did before we got to the monkey bars. The monkey bars were my favourite. For days I had been trying to convince him to join me on the high bar. I don't know how tall it was, but it was up there. I would scramble onto the chest high sand box and leap off the edge to grab hold of the bar. I was good. My parents had sent me to some gymnastics classes and I could spin and whip circles around the bar. I felt big up there, taunting my friend to join me. I was a bit of a show-off. On that morning of the third day, I was once again telling him how safe and easy it was. "Watch me," I said as I climbed onto the sandbox. I lept, grabbed hold of the bar and swung. Instantly, I knew something was wrong. Too late I realised what was wrong. The first two days my mother had put my sunscreen on, and I had never thought of how slick the cream would be. How the greasiness of it would linger on my hands.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Thumbing through the dusty scrapbook, I zero in on a Polaroid of my grandmother, pruning the roses in her garden. I caught her at just the right time - a gloved hand blocking the sunlight from her eyes and only her smile visible beneath the shadow, a few pink roses lay beside her on the ground, and everything warm and bright.<br>
<br>
Tears come to my eyes as I remember her wake, the smell of fresh-cut roses in bouquets around her coffin, the pink lipstick she wore to the grave. I sat beside my mother in the front row, holding her hand while she soaked through every new tissue with her tears. I consoled her and snuggled into her side as person after person stepped up to the podium to speak, to sing, to cry, to grieve, to remember, to pray. At last, the minister walked up and smiled.<br>
<br>
“Ginny was one of the best women.”<br>
<br>
And I was gone. I ripped my hand out of my mother’s, I raced to the door, and I pushed past attendants and family members. I held my breath as I darted into the bathroom and locked the door behind me.&nbsp;<br>

I remember seeing her face and falling in love. Those deep blue eyes. A clean coat, all black. Except for one spot, just below her left eye. It was as though she had a black eye, but it was white. And she had the cutest meow.<br>
<br>
I remember staring into her eyes just as she stared back at me. I told the man that I wanted this kitten. No other would suffice. This kitten, named Jess, she would be mine. I will be hers.<br>
<br>
I remember taking her home. She was purring so loudly, I could hardly hear the radio in the background. She loved having her chin rubbed. Her eyes were closed as her tail swayed back and forth.<br>
<br>
I remember watching her jump out of my arms onto the floor. She began walking around. Her new home was one big puzzle. She was going to piece it all together. She started in the living room, made her way to the kitchen, through the halls, and soon she found my room. Her room.<br>
<br>
I remember the next 14 years with Jess. We did everything together. She was my best friend. I never felt alone. I always had her when no one else was available. I was sad to leave her when I went to college. They wouldn't allow pets in the dorms. But I was ready to see her during Thanksgiving break.<br>
<br>
I remember that call. I didn't move for several minutes. My mum kept asking if I was okay. Of course I wasn't. Jess wasn't okay. Our stupid neighbour let his son drive without a license. He ran over Jess. The vet wasn't sure if she'd make it.<br>
<br>
I remember driving home. That long drive home. It took everything in me not to cry the entire time. I couldn't deal with this. My best friend, gone. I didn't even get to say goodbye.<br>

Our existence, our lives, they are the culmination of our memories and of experiences. They teach us how to behave around others, who to trust and who to avoid. How to get ready for the day, how to deal with hurt, how to drown in bliss.<br>

They are the infinite files tucked away in our minds, instruction manuals for life; so imagine waking from that deep place and finding that the warehouse with all those files suddenly lay barren.<br>

What would you do? I would simply scratch my head and flip the switch that drowns the place in darkness, never to be of use again. But when it came to life, I didn't have that luxury.<br>
<br>
When I awoke upon the soft cushion that was my bed, I was lost. I instinctively rummaged the recesses of my mind, trying to find any sign, any remnant of something that could help me. I knew something was missing, the sudden absence leaving me unnerved, a hollow pit left where my memories once were. I almost felt as if I could stick a hand inside and rummage around an abandoned skull.

The first day I flew, it is such a crystalline memory. I can close my eyes and relive the moment I left the earth. The clench, fear, panic as my hands slipped from the bar, and the relief, wonder, joy as when I just kept going up.<br>
<br>
I was twelve, and it was the third day of a cub scout summer camp. My mum had been busy that morning. She just had time to bag me a sandwich, hand me a tube of sunscreen, and drop me off at the scout leader’s house. I put on the sunscreen as I sat on the front porch and waited for the leader’s son to be ready. Soon, we were off.<br>
<br>
At the camp, I bolted out of the car to find my friend, Patrick. He was already on the playground. I don't remember what we did before we got to the monkey bars. The monkey bars were my favourite.

Thumbing through the dusty scrapbook, I zero in on a Polaroid of my grandmother, pruning the roses in her garden. I caught her at just the right time - a gloved hand blocking the sunlight from her eyes and only her smile visible beneath the shadow, a few pink roses lay beside her on the ground, and everything warm and bright.<br>
<br>
Tears come to my eyes as I remember her wake, the smell of fresh-cut roses in bouquets around her coffin, the pink lipstick she wore to the grave. I sat beside my mother in the front row, holding her hand while she soaked through every new tissue with her tears. I consoled her and snuggled into her side as person after person stepped up to the podium to speak, to sing, to cry, to grieve, to remember, to pray. At last, the minister walked up and smiled.<br>
<br>
​“Ginny was one of the best women.”<br>
<br>
And I was gone. I ripped my hand out of my mother’s, I raced to the door, and I pushed past attendants and family members. I held my breath as I darted into the bathroom and locked the door behind me.&nbsp;<br>

Thumbing through the dusty scrapbook, I zero in on a Polaroid of my grandmother, pruning the roses in her garden. I caught her at just the right time - a gloved hand blocking the sunlight from her eyes and only her smile visible beneath the shadow, a few pink roses lay beside her on the ground, and everything warm and bright.<br>
<br>
Tears come to my eyes as I remember her wake, the smell of fresh-cut roses in bouquets around her coffin, the pink lipstick she wore to the grave. I sat beside my mother in the front row, holding her hand while she soaked through every new tissue with her tears. I consoled her and snuggled into her side as person after person stepped up to the podium to speak, to sing, to cry, to grieve, to remember, to pray. At last, the minister walked up and smiled.<br>
<br>
​“Ginny was one of the best women.”<br>
<br>
And I was gone. I ripped my hand out of my mother’s, I raced to the door, and I pushed past attendants and family members. I held my breath as I darted into the bathroom and locked the door behind me.&nbsp;<br>

I remember seeing her face and falling in love. Those deep blue eyes. A clean coat, all black. Except for one spot, just below her left eye. It was as though she had a black eye, but it was white. And she had the cutest meow.<br>
<br>
I remember staring into her eyes just as she stared back at me. I told the man that I wanted this kitten. No other would suffice. This kitten, named Jess, she would be mine. I will be hers.<br>
<br>
I remember taking her home. She was purring so loudly, I could hardly hear the radio in the background. She loved having her chin rubbed. Her eyes were closed as her tail swayed back and forth.<br>
<br>
I remember watching her jump out of my arms onto the floor. She began walking around. Her new home was one big puzzle. She was going to piece it all together. She started in the living room, made her way to the kitchen, through the halls, and soon she found my room. Her room.<br>
<br>
I remember the next 14 years with Jess. We did everything together. She was my best friend. I never felt alone. I always had her when no one else was available. I was sad to leave her when I went to college. They wouldn't allow pets in the dorms. But I was ready to see her during Thanksgiving break.<br>
<br>
I remember that call. I didn't move for several minutes. My mum kept asking if I was okay. Of course I wasn't. Jess wasn't okay. Our stupid neighbour let his son drive without a license. He ran over Jess. The vet wasn't sure if she'd make it.<br>
<br>
I remember driving home. That long drive home. It took everything in me not to cry the entire time. I couldn't deal with this. My best friend, gone. I didn't even get to say goodbye.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
At the time, it felt as if I were opening my eyes for the very first time; I felt as if it were the very first moment of my life.<br>
<br>
Our existence, our lives, they are the culmination of our memories and of experiences. They teach us how to behave around others, who to trust and who to avoid. How to get ready for the day, how to deal with hurt, how to drown in bliss.<br>
<br>
They are the infinite files tucked away in our minds, instruction manuals for life; so imagine waking from that deep place and finding that the warehouse with all those files suddenly lay barren.<br>
<br>
What would you do? I would simply scratch my head and flip the switch that drowns the place in darkness, never to be of use again. But when it came to life, I didn't have that luxury.<br>
<br>
When I awoke upon the soft cushion that was my bed, I was lost. I instinctively rummaged the recesses of my mind, trying to find any sign, any remnant of something that could help me. I knew something was missing, the sudden absence leaving me unnerved, a hollow pit left where my memories once were. I almost felt as if I could stick a hand inside and rummage around an abandoned skull. Yet still I searched, hoping that at the very least, I could find a shadow of what I once had, of who I once was.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
The first day I flew, it is such a crystalline memory. I can close my eyes and relive the moment I left the earth. The clench, fear, panic as my hands slipped from the bar, and the relief, wonder, joy as when I just kept going up.<br>
<br>
I was twelve, and it was the third day of a cub scout summer camp. My mum had been busy that morning. She just had time to bag me a sandwich, hand me a tube of sunscreen, and drop me off at the scout leader’s house. I put on the sunscreen as I sat on the front porch and waited for the leader’s son to be ready. Soon, we were off.<br>
<br>
At the camp, I bolted out of the car to find my friend, Patrick. He was already on the playground. I don't remember what we did before we got to the monkey bars. The monkey bars were my favourite. For days I had been trying to convince him to join me on the high bar. I don't know how tall it was, but it was up there. I would scramble onto the chest high sand box and leap off the edge to grab hold of the bar. I was good. My parents had sent me to some gymnastics classes and I could spin and whip circles around the bar. I felt big up there, taunting my friend to join me. I was a bit of a show-off. On that morning of the third day, I was once again telling him how safe and easy it was. "Watch me," I said as I climbed onto the sandbox. I lept, grabbed hold of the bar and swung. Instantly, I knew something was wrong. Too late I realised what was wrong. The first two days my mother had put my sunscreen on, and I had never thought of how slick the cream would be. How the greasiness of it would linger on my hands.&nbsp;<br>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Take Me Home&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br>
by Karly Lane&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Elspeth Kinnaird sighed in irritation as she stared at the computer screen and the picturesque image of rolling green Highlands hills that had interrupted her Facebook newsfeed. Normally Elle wouldn’t give the ad a second glance, but that was before she’d started to notice the unsettlingly repetitive signs. No, not signs, she told herself firmly. Coincidences. That’s all they were.</p>
        <p>Ever since her Gran’s funeral two weeks ago, everywhere she turned, Scotland kept appearing before her eyes.</p>
        <p>Elle knew it wasn’t really a sign. She’d just been thinking about Scotland so much lately. A similar thing happened when she updated to the new iPhone – she hadn’t seen anyone with one, and then suddenly every second person in town seemed to be carrying her model. This was the same kind of thing. She was just noticing the Scottish references now because of Gran.</p>
        <p>Her heart sank a little at the thought.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Gran.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I miss you so much,” she said quietly.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She had only been gone a few weeks, and already it felt longer. Elle closed the laptop and stood up, grabbing her keys and handbag before heading out the door to work.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Take Me Home&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br>
by Karly Lane&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Elspeth Kinnaird sighed in irritation as she stared at the computer screen and the picturesque image of rolling green Highlands hills that had interrupted her Facebook newsfeed. Normally Elle wouldn’t give the ad a second glance, but that was before she’d started to notice the unsettlingly repetitive signs. No, not signs, she told herself firmly. Coincidences. That’s all they were.</p>
        <p>Ever since her Gran’s funeral two weeks ago, everywhere she turned, Scotland kept appearing before her eyes.</p>
        <p>Elle knew it wasn’t really a sign. She’d just been thinking about Scotland so much lately. A similar thing happened when she updated to the new iPhone – she hadn’t seen anyone with one, and then suddenly every second person in town seemed to be carrying her model. This was the same kind of thing. She was just noticing the Scottish references now because of Gran.</p>
        <p>Her heart sank a little at the thought.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Gran.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I miss you so much,” she said quietly.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She had only been gone a few weeks, and already it felt longer. Elle closed the laptop and stood up, grabbing her keys and handbag before heading out the door to work.</p>
        <p>Jessup’s Creek had been her home her entire life. Population three thousand two hundred and fifty-three. Tucked away in the New South Wales hinterland, their sleepy little town had been bypassed by the tourist trade and highways for most of its life, which had never been a problem for a tightknit farming community. Not until the past few generations, when working farms began to dwindle as kinds moved away to start their careers, and parents running properties got too old and tired to continue working them.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then, a miracle of sorts happened. Over the past two years, the grey-nomad trade had come to the rescue, saving Jessup’s Creek from becoming another dying country town with more closed shops than residents. The retirees and their caravans, motorhomes and campervans were an almost constant stream driving through. More shops had opened, filling the main street with all kinds of quirky businesses, drawing now only the travellers but weekend tours from the coast and inland as well.</p>
        <p>There was a chocolatier, two antique stores and a pottery-and-craft barn, which sold local handmade items and ran workshops, where Elle had taken a few art classes. Cafes were spring up left, right and centre, and only a month ago a boutique brewery had opened its doors, bringing quite a few beard-sorting, man-bun-wearing men to town on weekend beer-tasting sessions.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As a result, property prices had begun to climb, and new people were moving to town. The downside to this was that the once-quiet village was changing. It looked the same, with verandah-lined shops running along both sides of the whole main street, but there was a very different vibe about the place. Where Elle once knew every face in town, nowadays, more often than not she could walk into a shop and not recognise a single person. It&nbsp;wasn’t like newcomers were overrunning the place, but it was still strange, and a lot of the older residents were finding it a tad confronting.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Take Me Home&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br>
by Karly Lane&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Elspeth Kinnaird sighed in irritation as she stared at the computer screen and the picturesque image of rolling green Highlands hills that had interrupted her Facebook newsfeed. Normally Elle wouldn’t give the ad a second glance, but that was before she’d started to notice the unsettlingly repetitive signs. No, not signs, she told herself firmly. Coincidences. That’s all they were.</p>
        <p>Ever since her Gran’s funeral two weeks ago, everywhere she turned, Scotland kept appearing before her eyes.</p>
        <p>Elle knew it wasn’t really a sign. She’d just been thinking about Scotland so much lately. A similar thing happened when she updated to the new iPhone – she hadn’t seen anyone with one, and then suddenly every second person in town seemed to be carrying her model. This was the same kind of thing. She was just noticing the Scottish references now because of Gran.</p>
        <p>Her heart sank a little at the thought.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Gran.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I miss you so much,” she said quietly.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She had only been gone a few weeks, and already it felt longer. Elle closed the laptop and stood up, grabbing her keys and handbag before heading out the door to work.</p>
        <p>Jessup’s Creek had been her home her entire life. Population three thousand two hundred and fifty-three. Tucked away in the New South Wales hinterland, their sleepy little town had been bypassed by the tourist trade and highways for most of its life, which had never been a problem for a tightknit farming community. Not until the past few generations, when working farms began to dwindle as kinds moved away to start their careers, and parents running properties got too old and tired to continue working them.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then, a miracle of sorts happened. Over the past two years, the grey-nomad trade had come to the rescue, saving Jessup’s Creek from becoming another dying country town with more closed shops than residents. The retirees and their caravans, motorhomes and campervans were an almost constant stream driving through. More shops had opened, filling the main street with all kinds of quirky businesses, drawing now only the travellers but weekend tours from the coast and inland as well.</p>
        <p>There was a chocolatier, two antique stores and a pottery-and-craft barn, which sold local handmade items and ran workshops, where Elle had taken a few art classes. Cafes were spring up left, right and centre, and only a month ago a boutique brewery had opened its doors, bringing quite a few beard-sorting, man-bun-wearing men to town on weekend beer-tasting sessions.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As a result, property prices had begun to climb, and new people were moving to town. The downside to this was that the once-quiet village was changing. It looked the same, with verandah-lined shops running along both sides of the whole main street, but there was a very different vibe about the place. Where Elle once knew every face in town, nowadays, more often than not she could walk into a shop and not recognise a single person. It&nbsp;wasn’t like newcomers were overrunning the place, but it was still strange, and a lot of the older residents were finding it a tad confronting.</p>

        <p>She had only been gone a few weeks, and already it felt longer. Elle closed the laptop and stood up, grabbing her keys and handbag before heading out the door to work.</p>
        <p>Jessup’s Creek had been her home her entire life. Population three thousand two hundred and fifty-three. Tucked away in the New South Wales hinterland, their sleepy little town had been bypassed by the tourist trade and highways for most of its life, which had never been a problem for a tightknit farming community. Not until the past few generations, when working farms began to dwindle as kinds moved away to start their careers, and parents running properties got too old and tired to continue working them.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then, a miracle of sorts happened. Over the past two years, the grey-nomad trade had come to the rescue, saving Jessup’s Creek from becoming another dying country town with more closed shops than residents. The retirees and their caravans, motorhomes and campervans were an almost constant stream driving through. More shops had opened, filling the main street with all kinds of quirky businesses, drawing now only the travellers but weekend tours from the coast and inland as well.</p>
        <p>There was a chocolatier, two antique stores and a pottery-and-craft barn, which sold local handmade items and ran workshops, where Elle had taken a few art classes. Cafes were spring up left, right and centre, and only a month ago a boutique brewery had opened its doors, bringing quite a few beard-sorting, man-bun-wearing men to town on weekend beer-tasting sessions.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As a result, property prices had begun to climb, and new people were moving to town. The downside to this was that the once-quiet village was changing. It looked the same, with verandah-lined shops running along both sides of the whole main street, but there was a very different vibe about the place. Where Elle once knew every face in town, nowadays, more often than not she could walk into a shop and not recognise a single person. It&nbsp;wasn’t like newcomers were overrunning the place, but it was still strange, and a lot of the older residents were finding it a tad confronting.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>What is Flat Pack Furniture?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Flat packs, also known as ready-to-assemble furniture, known-down furniture, or selfassembly furniture are incredibly popular because of their affordability. This type of furniture is produced in flat parts and are assembled when purchased without the need for special tools (in most cases). <strong>12 ……….</strong> Depending on the piece of furniture, they can have 5 components to assemble, or over 50. One of the most known flat pack retailers is IKEA, with stores in over 25 countries.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>What is Flat Pack Furniture Made from?&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The materials used for the making of flat packs is either solid wood, medium-density fibreboard (MDF), or chipboard. MDF is the product of the residuals of softwood and hardwood mixed with wax and combined to form a panel stronger than chipboard. Chipboard is made from wood chippings, sawdust, wood shavings or particles, and are bound together into a board. <strong>13 ………. </strong>The only disadvantage of it is that it is more susceptible to water damage. Solid wood can crack due to time or environment conditions, which is something that cannot happen to chipboard. MDF prices can vary as well, but if it is of a high quality, then it is much stronger than chipboard. <strong>14 ……….</strong> It is often used in furniture such as desks, and cabinets.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Advantages of Flat Pack Furniture&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&gt;&gt; One of the most famous advantages of flat pack furniture – affordable prices.<strong> 15 ………</strong> Also, they are said to be cheaper because they compensate for their low durability, but if properly maintained they can be very durable.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&gt;&gt; They are easy to ship, disassemble and put together. Companies do not spend tons of money on shipping costs and transportation because customers can pick their furniture themselves and build them in their homes.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&gt;&gt; Flat packs can be customised – there are many sites and hacks for improving, changing the design or style of flat packs.<strong> 16 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>&gt;&gt; They are produced by machines, which cuts company costs a lot. <strong>17 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>&gt;&gt; This type of furniture is easily packed and moved from one place to another. If you ever move house, you can dismantle your furniture, put them in their flat boxes and easily transport and reassemble them.</p>

Flat packs, also known as ready-to-assemble furniture, known-down furniture, or selfassembly furniture are incredibly popular because of their affordability. This type of furniture is produced in flat parts and are assembled when purchased without the need for special tools (in most cases).&nbsp;<strong>12 ………</strong>.&nbsp;Depending on the piece of furniture, they can have 5 components to assemble, or over 50.

<br>
What is Flat Pack Furniture Made from?&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The materials used for the making of flat packs is either solid wood, medium-density fibreboard (MDF), or chipboard. MDF is the product of the residuals of softwood and hardwood mixed with wax and combined to form a panel stronger than chipboard. Chipboard is made from wood chippings, sawdust, wood shavings or particles, and are bound together into a board.&nbsp;<strong>13 ………</strong>.&nbsp;The only disadvantage of it is that it is more susceptible to water damage. Solid wood can crack due to time or environment conditions, which is something that cannot happen to chipboard. MDF prices can vary as well, but if it is of a high quality, then it is much stronger than chipboard.&nbsp;<strong>14 ………</strong>.&nbsp;It is often used in furniture such as desks, and cabinets.&nbsp;<br>
<br>

        <p>&gt;&gt; They are easy to ship, disassemble and put together. Companies do not spend tons of money on shipping costs and transportation because customers can pick their furniture themselves and build them in their homes.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&gt;&gt; Flat packs can be customised – there are many sites and hacks for improving, changing the design or style of flat packs.&nbsp;<strong>16 ………</strong>.</p>
        <p>&gt;&gt; They are produced by machines, which cuts company costs a lot.&nbsp;<strong>17 ………</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
