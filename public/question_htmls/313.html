        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; It was cold in the forest. A bitter March wind rattled bare trees like skeletons and whipped up the dark clouds in an iron gray sky. The approaching snowstorm probably would not be the last one of the winter.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The red fox couldn’t have chosen a worse time to bring a litter of kits into the world. Nestled in a small hollow beneath a hickory tree, curled against their mother’s plush fur, the three young kits were warm and comfortable. But when the freezing storms came, the shallow nest would surely let in the snow. And it would be too easy for predators to find the babies when their mother left them to search for&nbsp;food. The fox knew she would have to seek a new home, and soon.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She nuzzled her kits, whose eyes were not yet open. She licked them, and they mewed about her like kittens. Then she left them. Outside her den, cold air stung her nose as she sniffed about for danger. Then she padded off into the gray, wintry forest.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She ducked beneath a wooden fence and followed a path across a familiar field, where during the summer she’d chased rabbits. She was near a farm, a place she’d always avoided because of the fearful smell of humans. But now, the warmth and protection of the barn drew her close.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Squeezing through the gap where a board was missing, she sneaked into the barn. The straw was deep and soft, a perfect bed for fox kits.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The red fox hurried back to her babies. One by one she carried them under the fence, across the field, and through the hole in the barn wall. And when all three kits were snuggled down in the blanket of straw, she licked them and felt safe. Even when the&nbsp;farmer came to milk his cows, the silent fox knew her family would be unnoticed, hidden in the farthest and darkest corner of the barn.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;One snowy evening, the farmer turned off his lantern and hung it on the wall as he left the barn, just as he did every night. But as he closed the door, the lantern slipped from its hook and shattered on the floor. A tiny spark danced across the pool of kerosene and nibbled<br>
at the scattered straw.</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="59%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766024544/x3wu45uujtsid0gjfyxz.png" alt="stt13_rc_01_kerosene">


        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; The fox watched with wide, yellow eyes as the straw curled and caught flame. Wisps of&nbsp;smoke reached her nostrils, and she became fearful. Slipping through the hole in the wall, she ran outside and howled. Her voice carried across the barnyard, and the farmer turned around. He was surprised and angry to see a fox. He was even more angry to see it run into his barn.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Setting down his milk pail, the farmer headed back to his barn, determined to chase away the unwelcome visitor. But when he threw open the barn door, fire danced about his feet. Grabbing a shovel, he beat the flames until they were out. Once again, the barn was safe and dark.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Winter’s harshness gave way to spring’s gentle warmth. One day the farmer glanced into the darkest corner of the barn and found it empty. But for a time it had been a place to feel safe. It had been home to a red fox family.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; It was cold in the forest. A bitter March wind rattled bare trees like skeletons and whipped up the dark clouds in an iron gray sky. The approaching snowstorm probably would not be the last one of the winter.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The red fox couldn’t have chosen a worse time to bring a litter of kits into the world. Nestled in a small hollow beneath a hickory tree, curled against their mother’s plush fur, the three young kits were warm and comfortable. But when the freezing storms came, the shallow nest would surely let in the snow. And it would be too easy for predators to find the babies when their mother left them to search for&nbsp;food. The fox knew she would have to seek a new home, and soon.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She nuzzled her kits, whose eyes were not yet open. She licked them, and they mewed about her like kittens. Then she left them. Outside her den, cold air stung her nose as she sniffed about for danger. Then she padded off into the gray, wintry forest.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She ducked beneath a wooden fence and followed a path across a familiar field, where during the summer she’d chased rabbits. She was near a farm, a place she’d always avoided because of the fearful smell of humans. But now, the warmth and protection of the barn drew her close.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Squeezing through the gap where a board was missing, she sneaked into the barn. The straw was deep and soft, a perfect bed for fox kits.</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The red fox hurried back to her babies. One by one she carried them under the fence, across the field, and through the hole in the barn wall. And when all three kits were snuggled down in the blanket of straw, she licked them and felt safe. Even when the&nbsp;farmer came to milk his cows, the silent fox knew her family would be unnoticed, hidden in the farthest and darkest corner of the barn.</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
                  <img width="100%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766021798/edxl8m65asnjyn5xdalu.png" alt="stt13_rc_01_3">


        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;One snowy evening, the farmer turned off his lantern and hung it on the wall as he left the barn, just as he did every night. But as he closed the door, the lantern slipped from its hook and shattered on the floor. A tiny spark danced across the pool of kerosene and nibbled<br>
at the scattered straw.</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="59%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766021801/g7cycgism5etgcgandfs.png" alt="stt13_rc_01_kerosene">


        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; The fox watched with wide, yellow eyes as the straw curled and caught flame. Wisps of&nbsp;smoke reached her nostrils, and she became fearful. Slipping through the hole in the wall, she ran outside and howled. Her voice carried across the barnyard, and the farmer turned around. He was surprised and angry to see a fox. He was even more angry to see it run into his barn.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Setting down his milk pail, the farmer headed back to his barn, determined to chase away the unwelcome visitor. But when he threw open the barn door, fire danced about his feet. Grabbing a shovel, he beat the flames until they were out. Once again, the barn was safe and dark.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Taking up a flashlight, the farmer shone its beam about the barn. It finally came to rest on the fox, her family nestled close, her eyes shining gold. The farmer smiled. He flicked off the light and walked away, quietly closing the barn door behind him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Winter’s harshness gave way to spring’s gentle warmth. One day the farmer glanced into the darkest corner of the barn and found it empty. But for a time it had been a place to feel safe. It had been home to a red fox family.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Far from the evening shadows thrown by Hong Kong’s tall buildings, the narrow streets of the city of Kowloon come alive under the rice moon.<sup>1</sup> Food stands sell bowls of noodles, rice, and fried fish balls on bamboo sticks to factory workers strolling homeward at the end of the day.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In a small rattan<sup>2</sup> cage, a cliff swallow huddles with its tiny wings tucked in around its body. For the first time in its life, the little swallow will not fly under the rice moon tonight.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The man who caught the swallow that same morning sells dried fruits and sugarcane. A young girl walking through the marketplace buys a stick of cane to chew and sees the swallow in its small cage.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She has just enough money to buy it, and as she walks home, the rattan cage swings and bobs lightly on her arm. “I promise to take care of you, little bird,” the young girl whispers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The swallow blinks at her sadly from the corner of the cage, and in a language the young girl cannot understand, the bird cries, “Let me fly under the rice moon!”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sour smells and sharp noises come from the side alleys and drift out to the crowds, and taxi horns blare in a dash for the next fare. Near the center of the market, a boy glances up from the pairs of colorful brocade<sup>3</sup> slippers his mother has made for him to sell.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When a young girl stops to look at the slippers, the boy sees a caged bird at her side.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The swallow blinks at him from the corner of the cage.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The boy trades a pair of his mother’s best brocade slippers for the swallow and lifts the cage to look at the bird. “I promise to take care of you, little bird,” the boy murmurs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The cliff swallow coos, “How I would like to fly under the rice moon!” But the boy does not understand.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He puts the cage to one side as a man stops at the market stand to look at the rows of brocade slippers. After a hard day’s work, he wearily searches for a cheerful gift for his young daughter, who has been at home with a fever.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He hears the cliff swallow flutter its wings softly as he looks through the stacks of shoes. Thinking that the tiny bird would make his ailing daughter happy, he offers the boy a very high price. “I know who will take care of you, little bird,” the man whispers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When he arrives home, he carries the cliff swallow in its rattan cage to the room where his daughter lies sleeping. Rather than wake her, he places the caged bird on her bedside table. As he leaves the room the little bird coos, “Oh, please let me fly under the rice moon tonight!” But the man does not understand the swallow’s language.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the girl wakes suddenly in the middle of the night, the first thing she sees through her fever is a small cliff swallow blinking at her from behind the bars of a rattan cage. She knows too well how terrible it is to be kept inside.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I know what you need, little bird,” she murmurs. But the swallow no longer believes what people say.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Slowly, the sickly girl rises from her bed and carries the cage to the open window. Unlatching the rattan door, the girl asks, “Will you fly for me, too, little bird?” And her language is one that the swallow understands.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For a moment, the bird studies the open cage door uncertainly. Then it steps to the ledge, carefully spreads its small wings, and flies away.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although the cliff swallow now can fly anywhere it chooses, it always passes by the little girl’s bedroom window each night. And each night, for a little while, both the bird and the girl are free under the rice moon.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Far from the evening shadows thrown by Hong Kong’s tall buildings, the narrow streets of the city of Kowloon come alive under the rice moon.<sup>1</sup> Food stands sell bowls of noodles, rice, and fried fish balls on bamboo sticks to factory workers strolling homeward at the end of the day.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In a small rattan<sup>2</sup> cage, a cliff swallow huddles with its tiny wings tucked in around its body. For the first time in its life, the little swallow will not fly under the rice moon tonight.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The man who caught the swallow that same morning sells dried fruits and sugarcane. A young girl walking through the marketplace buys a stick of cane to chew and sees the swallow in its small cage.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She has just enough money to buy it, and as she walks home, the rattan cage swings and bobs lightly on her arm. “I promise to take care of you, little bird,” the young girl whispers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The swallow blinks at her sadly from the corner of the cage, and in a language the young girl cannot understand, the bird cries, “Let me fly under the rice moon!”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sour smells and sharp noises come from the side alleys and drift out to the crowds, and taxi horns blare in a dash for the next fare. Near the center of the market, a boy glances up from the pairs of colorful brocade<sup>3</sup> slippers his mother has made for him to sell.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When a young girl stops to look at the slippers, the boy sees a caged bird at her side.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The swallow blinks at him from the corner of the cage.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The boy trades a pair of his mother’s best brocade slippers for the swallow and lifts the cage to look at the bird. “I promise to take care of you, little bird,” the boy murmurs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The cliff swallow coos, “How I would like to fly under the rice moon!” But the boy does not understand.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He puts the cage to one side as a man stops at the market stand to look at the rows of brocade slippers. After a hard day’s work, he wearily searches for a cheerful gift for his young daughter, who has been at home with a fever.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He hears the cliff swallow flutter its wings softly as he looks through the stacks of shoes. Thinking that the tiny bird would make his ailing daughter happy, he offers the boy a very high price. “I know who will take care of you, little bird,” the man whispers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When he arrives home, he carries the cliff swallow in its rattan cage to the room where his daughter lies sleeping. Rather than wake her, he places the caged bird on her bedside table. As he leaves the room the little bird coos, “Oh, please let me fly under the rice moon tonight!” But the man does not understand the swallow’s language.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the girl wakes suddenly in the middle of the night, the first thing she sees through her fever is a small cliff swallow blinking at her from behind the bars of a rattan cage. She knows too well how terrible it is to be kept inside.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I know what you need, little bird,” she murmurs. But the swallow no longer believes what people say.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Slowly, the sickly girl rises from her bed and carries the cage to the open window. Unlatching the rattan door, the girl asks, “Will you fly for me, too, little bird?” And her language is one that the swallow understands.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For a moment, the bird studies the open cage door uncertainly. Then it steps to the ledge, carefully spreads its small wings, and flies away.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although the cliff swallow now can fly anywhere it chooses, it always passes by the little girl’s bedroom window each night. And each night, for a little while, both the bird and the girl are free under the rice moon.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The boy trades a pair of his mother’s best brocade slippers for the swallow and lifts the cage to look at the bird. “I promise to take care of you, little bird,” the boy murmurs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The cliff swallow coos, “How I would like to fly under the rice moon!” But the boy does not understand.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He puts the cage to one side as a man stops at the market stand to look at the rows of brocade slippers. After a hard day’s work, he wearily searches for a cheerful gift for his young daughter, who has been at home with a fever.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He hears the cliff swallow flutter its wings softly as he looks through the stacks of shoes. Thinking that the tiny bird would make his ailing daughter happy, he offers the boy a very high price. “I know who will take care of you, little bird,” the man whispers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When he arrives home, he carries the cliff swallow in its rattan cage to the room where his daughter lies sleeping. Rather than wake her, he places the caged bird on her bedside table. As he leaves the room the little bird coos, “Oh, please let me fly under the rice moon tonight!” But the man does not understand the swallow’s language.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the girl wakes suddenly in the middle of the night, the first thing she sees through her fever is a small cliff swallow blinking at her from behind the bars of a rattan cage. She knows too well how terrible it is to be kept inside.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I know what you need, little bird,” she murmurs. But the swallow no longer believes what people say.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Slowly, the sickly girl rises from her bed and carries the cage to the open window. Unlatching the rattan door, the girl asks, “Will you fly for me, too, little bird?” And her language is one that the swallow understands.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For a moment, the bird studies the open cage door uncertainly. Then it steps to the ledge, carefully spreads its small wings, and flies away.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although the cliff swallow now can fly anywhere it chooses, it always passes by the little girl’s bedroom window each night. And each night, for a little while, both the bird and the girl are free under the rice moon.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Far from the evening shadows thrown by Hong Kong’s tall buildings, the narrow streets of the city of Kowloon come alive under the rice moon.<sup>1</sup> Food stands sell bowls of noodles, rice, and fried fish balls on bamboo sticks to factory workers strolling homeward at the end of the day.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In a small rattan<sup>2</sup> cage, a cliff swallow huddles with its tiny wings tucked in around its body. For the first time in its life, the little swallow will not fly under the rice moon tonight.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The man who caught the swallow that same morning sells dried fruits and sugarcane. A young girl walking through the marketplace buys a stick of cane to chew and sees the swallow in its small cage.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She has just enough money to buy it, and as she walks home, the rattan cage swings and bobs lightly on her arm. “I promise to take care of you, little bird,” the young girl whispers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The swallow blinks at her sadly from the corner of the cage, and in a language the young girl cannot understand, the bird cries, “Let me fly under the rice moon!”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sour smells and sharp noises come from the side alleys and drift out to the crowds, and taxi horns blare in a dash for the next fare. Near the center of the market, a boy glances up from the pairs of colorful brocade<sup>3</sup> slippers his mother has made for him to sell.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When a young girl stops to look at the slippers, the boy sees a caged bird at her side.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The swallow blinks at him from the corner of the cage.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The boy trades a pair of his mother’s best brocade slippers for the swallow and lifts the cage to look at the bird. “I promise to take care of you, little bird,” the boy murmurs.</p>

        <p class="txt-ctr">_________________________________________________</p>
        <p>Thirteen-year-old Karl has always wanted to fish for herring like his father. His father has recently been injured in a fall, but is ready to return to fishing. For the first time, he has<br>
asked Karl to go along to help him. In this part of the story, they are in the fishing boat.<br>
They have caught many herring.</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">_________________________________________________</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By the time we finished, herring covered the bottom of the boat as deep as my calves. For the first time in days, my father seemed happy.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then he looked at the western sky, and his smile faded.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They are called Northwesters. They’re storms that sweep out of Canada hard and fast.<br>
No one can predict their arrival. All fishermen fear them.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“We’re going back,” my father said.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He started the motor, wincing from the pain as he pulled the cord.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We were only two miles out, but the shoreline looked to me to be as far away as the moon. Over the distant hills, black clouds galloped toward us like wild horses. My father set a course directly for them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We made it only halfway home before we met the storm.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The wind came first. It lifted the lake in whitecaps. The weight of the herring made us ride low in the water, and the waves broke over our bow. The spray was icy cold, needles against my face. I grasped the gunwales<sup>2</sup> as the boat bucked. In the stern, my father struggled to hold us on course. I’d put on my slicker,<sup>3</sup> but I had no life jacket. Most commercial fishermen don’t carry life jackets in their boats. Wrong or right, they figure that if your boat goes down, a life jacket is useless. Even if you don’t drown, the cold of the water will quickly kill you.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By the time the rain came, we’d put more distance behind us. Although we were now only half a mile from shore, the rain fell so hard we couldn’t see the land. The boat was filling with water. I began to bail.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was scared, but I saw my father sitting erect in the stern, holding the boat steady into the wind, and I felt hopeful. He didn’t look hurt at all.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was starting to think we were going to make it. That’s when the motor died. My father jerked the cord desperately, but the motor wouldn’t catch. I saw that the boat was coming about, broadside to the wind. I knew what that meant. We would swamp in no time. We would go down.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My father didn’t fight the motor long. He leaped to the middle of the boat, beside me.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Grab an oar,” he hollered above the wind.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He always carried two oars for just such an emergency.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We set the oars in the locks and began to pull hard. My father grunted, from pain or effort I couldn’t tell. He dug his oar into the churning lake, bringing the boat around, bow into the wind again. With all my strength, I pulled on my own oar.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The wind pushed hard against us. We seemed to be fighting the anger of the whole lake. I was tired. My arms felt heavy and on fire. I didn’t know how much longer I could shove that oar through the water.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As if he heard my thinking, my father called to me, “I need you, Karl. Only a little longer.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So I kept stroking.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Just when I thought I had no more strength, I heard it. The sound of waves breaking against the shore. We moved into the shelter of our small cove and rode the swells toward the landing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My mother rushed through the rain to greet us. “I’ve been so worried,” she said. She hugged me and then my father.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Nothing to worry about,” he assured her. He put his hand on my shoulder. “You did well, son. How do you feel?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tired as I was, I managed a smile. “I feel like a herring choker.”</p>

        <p class="txt-ctr">_________________________________________________</p>
        <p>Thirteen-year-old Karl has always wanted to fish for herring like his father. His father has recently been injured in a fall, but is ready to return to fishing. For the first time, he has<br>
asked Karl to go along to help him. In this part of the story, they are in the fishing boat.<br>
They have caught many herring.</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">_________________________________________________</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By the time we finished, herring covered the bottom of the boat as deep as my calves. For the first time in days, my father seemed happy.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then he looked at the western sky, and his smile faded.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They are called Northwesters. They’re storms that sweep out of Canada hard and fast.<br>
No one can predict their arrival. All fishermen fear them.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“We’re going back,” my father said.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He started the motor, wincing from the pain as he pulled the cord.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We were only two miles out, but the shoreline looked to me to be as far away as the moon. Over the distant hills, black clouds galloped toward us like wild horses. My father set a course directly for them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We made it only halfway home before we met the storm.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The wind came first. It lifted the lake in whitecaps. The weight of the herring made us ride low in the water, and the waves broke over our bow. The spray was icy cold, needles against my face. I grasped the gunwales<sup>2</sup> as the boat bucked. In the stern, my father struggled to hold us on course. I’d put on my slicker,<sup>3</sup> but I had no life jacket. Most commercial fishermen don’t carry life jackets in their boats. Wrong or right, they figure that if your boat goes down, a life jacket is useless. Even if you don’t drown, the cold of the water will quickly kill you.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By the time the rain came, we’d put more distance behind us. Although we were now only half a mile from shore, the rain fell so hard we couldn’t see the land. The boat was filling with water. I began to bail.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was scared, but I saw my father sitting erect in the stern, holding the boat steady into the wind, and I felt hopeful. He didn’t look hurt at all.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was starting to think we were going to make it. That’s when the motor died. My father jerked the cord desperately, but the motor wouldn’t catch. I saw that the boat was coming about, broadside to the wind. I knew what that meant. We would swamp in no time. We would go down.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My father didn’t fight the motor long. He leaped to the middle of the boat, beside me.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Grab an oar,” he hollered above the wind.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He always carried two oars for just such an emergency.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We set the oars in the locks and began to pull hard. My father grunted, from pain or effort I couldn’t tell. He dug his oar into the churning lake, bringing the boat around, bow into the wind again. With all my strength, I pulled on my own oar.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As if he heard my thinking, my father called to me, “I need you, Karl. Only a little longer.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So I kept stroking.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Just when I thought I had no more strength, I heard it. The sound of waves breaking against the shore. We moved into the shelter of our small cove and rode the swells toward the landing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My mother rushed through the rain to greet us. “I’ve been so worried,” she said. She hugged me and then my father.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Nothing to worry about,” he assured her. He put his hand on my shoulder. “You did well, son. How do you feel?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tired as I was, I managed a smile. “I feel like a herring choker.”</p>

        <p class="txt-ctr">_________________________________________________</p>
        <p>Thirteen-year-old Karl has always wanted to fish for herring like his father. His father has recently been injured in a fall, but is ready to return to fishing. For the first time, he has<br>
asked Karl to go along to help him. In this part of the story, they are in the fishing boat.<br>
They have caught many herring.</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">_________________________________________________</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By the time we finished, herring covered the bottom of the boat as deep as my calves. For the first time in days, my father seemed happy.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then he looked at the western sky, and his smile faded.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They are called Northwesters. They’re storms that sweep out of Canada hard and fast.<br>
No one can predict their arrival. All fishermen fear them.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“We’re going back,” my father said.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He started the motor, wincing from the pain as he pulled the cord.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We were only two miles out, but the shoreline looked to me to be as far away as the moon. Over the distant hills, black clouds galloped toward us like wild horses. My father set a course directly for them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We made it only halfway home before we met the storm.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The wind came first. It lifted the lake in whitecaps. The weight of the herring made us ride low in the water, and the waves broke over our bow. The spray was icy cold, needles against my face. I grasped the gunwales<sup>2</sup> as the boat bucked. In the stern, my father struggled to hold us on course. I’d put on my slicker,<sup>3</sup> but I had no life jacket. Most commercial fishermen don’t carry life jackets in their boats. Wrong or right, they figure that if your boat goes down, a life jacket is useless. Even if you don’t drown, the cold of the water will quickly kill you.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By the time the rain came, we’d put more distance behind us. Although we were now only half a mile from shore, the rain fell so hard we couldn’t see the land. The boat was filling with water. I began to bail.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was scared, but I saw my father sitting erect in the stern, holding the boat steady into the wind, and I felt hopeful. He didn’t look hurt at all.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was starting to think we were going to make it. That’s when the motor died. My father jerked the cord desperately, but the motor wouldn’t catch. I saw that the boat was coming about, broadside to the wind. I knew what that meant. We would swamp in no time. We would go down.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My father didn’t fight the motor long. He leaped to the middle of the boat, beside me.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Grab an oar,” he hollered above the wind.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He always carried two oars for just such an emergency.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We set the oars in the locks and began to pull hard. My father grunted, from pain or effort I couldn’t tell. He dug his oar into the churning lake, bringing the boat around, bow into the wind again. With all my strength, I pulled on my own oar.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The wind pushed hard against us. We seemed to be fighting the anger of the whole lake. I was tired. My arms felt heavy and on fire. I didn’t know how much longer I could shove that oar through the water.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So I kept stroking.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As if he heard my thinking, my father called to me, “I need you, Karl. Only a little longer.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So I kept stroking.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Just when I thought I had no more strength, I heard it. The sound of waves breaking against the shore. We moved into the shelter of our small cove and rode the swells toward the landing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My mother rushed through the rain to greet us. “I’ve been so worried,” she said. She hugged me and then my father.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Nothing to worry about,” he assured her. He put his hand on my shoulder. “You did well, son. How do you feel?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tired as I was, I managed a smile. “I feel like a herring choker.”</p>

        <p class="txt-ctr">_________________________________________________</p>
        <p>Thirteen-year-old Karl has always wanted to fish for herring like his father. His father has recently been injured in a fall, but is ready to return to fishing. For the first time, he has<br>
asked Karl to go along to help him. In this part of the story, they are in the fishing boat.<br>
They have caught many herring.</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">_________________________________________________</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By the time we finished, herring covered the bottom of the boat as deep as my calves. For the first time in days, my father seemed happy.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then he looked at the western sky, and his smile faded.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They are called Northwesters. They’re storms that sweep out of Canada hard and fast.<br>
No one can predict their arrival. All fishermen fear them.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“We’re going back,” my father said.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He started the motor, wincing from the pain as he pulled the cord.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We were only two miles out, but the shoreline looked to me to be as far away as the moon. Over the distant hills, black clouds galloped toward us like wild horses. My father set a course directly for them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We made it only halfway home before we met the storm.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The wind came first. It lifted the lake in whitecaps. The weight of the herring made us ride low in the water, and the waves broke over our bow. The spray was icy cold, needles against my face. I grasped the gunwales<sup>2</sup> as the boat bucked. In the stern, my father struggled to hold us on course. I’d put on my slicker,<sup>3</sup> but I had no life jacket. Most commercial fishermen don’t carry life jackets in their boats. Wrong or right, they figure that if your boat goes down, a life jacket is useless. Even if you don’t drown, the cold of the water will quickly kill you.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By the time the rain came, we’d put more distance behind us. Although we were now only half a mile from shore, the rain fell so hard we couldn’t see the land. The boat was filling with water. I began to bail.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was scared, but I saw my father sitting erect in the stern, holding the boat steady into the wind, and I felt hopeful. He didn’t look hurt at all.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was starting to think we were going to make it. That’s when the motor died. My father jerked the cord desperately, but the motor wouldn’t catch. I saw that the boat was coming about, broadside to the wind. I knew what that meant. We would swamp in no time. We would go down.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My father didn’t fight the motor long. He leaped to the middle of the boat, beside me.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Grab an oar,” he hollered above the wind.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He always carried two oars for just such an emergency.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We set the oars in the locks and began to pull hard. My father grunted, from pain or effort I couldn’t tell. He dug his oar into the churning lake, bringing the boat around, bow into the wind again. With all my strength, I pulled on my own oar.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The wind pushed hard against us. We seemed to be fighting the anger of the whole lake. I was tired. My arms felt heavy and on fire. I didn’t know how much longer I could shove that oar through the water.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As if he heard my thinking, my father called to me, “I need you, Karl. Only a little longer.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So I kept stroking.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Just when I thought I had no more strength, I heard it. The sound of waves breaking against the shore. We moved into the shelter of our small cove and rode the swells toward the landing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My mother rushed through the rain to greet us. “I’ve been so worried,” she said. She hugged me and then my father.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Nothing to worry about,” he assured her. He put his hand on my shoulder. “You did well, son. How do you feel?”</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Station Keeper Richard Etheridge peered from the lookout tower of the Pea Island life-saving station. Fog swirled around his face, and it was pitch-dark. Huge waves crashed onto the beach, and hurricane-force winds hurled sand and sea spray into the air.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On that night back in October 1896, the worst storm in almost fifty years was battering the North Carolina coast. Moments earlier, one of Etheridge’s surfmen, Theodore Meekins, had spotted a faint red glimmer in the distance. Could it have been a flare from a ship in distress</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Etheridge quickly lit a flare and held it high over his head until the flame died out. Then he saw it–a dull red light flickered to the south. That could mean only one thing:<br>
shipwreck.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>The Keeper of the Station</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rescuing ships in distress was nothing new for Etheridge. He had been keeper of this life-saving station since 1880. Etheridge had grown up swimming, fishing, and boating on nearby Roanoke Island. He eventually became known as one of the best surfmen and lifesavers in North Carolina. But Etheridge was also known for something else: he was the Life-Saving Service’s first African American station chief.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;White surfmen refused to work under Etheridge. So Etheridge and the Life-Saving Service recruited a crew of African American rescuers to work with him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Etheridge’s men trained for ten hours a day, seven days a week. They swam in the rough surf and patrolled the beach. They performed life-saving drills and tugged their 1,500-pound surfboat and equipment for miles through the sand. But the wreck on the night of October 1896 put all of the crew’s practice to the test.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Rescuing the Wreck</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As soon as Etheridge and Meekins spotted the red flare, they woke up the other five surfmen on duty. The crew quickly hitched up a team of mules. Then they pushed and pulled their surfboat and equipment cart down the beach for two miles.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“The storm was raging fearfully,” Etheridge later wrote, “and . . . the team was often brought to a standstill by the sweeping current.” But the crew kept trudging through the knee-deep sand and icy water. Finally, they spotted the wreck.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The schooner <em>E.S. Newman</em> had blown aground 30 yards offshore. The storm had ripped off the ship’s sails and demolished her deck. Now the battered ship was rolling and tossing in the surf. All nine of the passengers and crew, including the captain’s wife and three-year-old child, were trapped onboard.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“It seemed impossible under such circumstances to render any assistance,” Etheridge later wrote.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But unless someone did something soon, the passengers would probably be swept out to sea, die from exposure, or be crushed when the <em>Newman </em>broke apart in the surf. So Etheridge came up with a daring plan.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His men would try to swim to the ship. Meekins and another surfman volunteered for the first attempt. They lashed themselves together with a rope. Then they grabbed one end of a life-saving line while the rest of the crew held the other end of the line securely to the beach.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meekins and the other surfman slowly waded farther out into the chilly water. They struggled through the currents and against the undertow in total darkness.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Onboard the <em>Newman</em>, the captain lowered a ladder over the side of the broken ship. Finally the surfmen reached the ship.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“The voice of gladden[ed] hearts greeted the arrival of the station crew,” Etheridge later wrote.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One passenger climbed carefully down the ladder. Meekins knotted the end of the rope around him. Slowly they carried him through the churning water to safety. Then two other surfmen headed back to the <em>Newman</em>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Next, they carried the child to shore. Then they returned to rescue the captain’s wife. Again and again, the surfmen took turns swimming in pairs through the sea to the wreck. After six grueling hours, the <em>Newman </em>was destroyed, but all nine passengers were safely onshore.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Life After the Rescue</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The captain of the <em>Newman </em>was so grateful that he gave Etheridge and his crew the ship’s name board. But for many years, this was the only award that the surfmen received. Pea Island Station was closed in 1947, and everyone seemed to forget the courageous crew.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally, in 1996 Etheridge and his men were awarded the Coast Guard’s highest honor, the Gold Lifesaving Medal, for their “extreme and heroic daring.” One hundred years after the <em>Newman </em>rescue, the men of the Pea Island Station were recognized for what they were—heroes.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Station Keeper Richard Etheridge peered from the lookout tower of the Pea Island life-saving station. Fog swirled around his face, and it was pitch-dark. Huge waves crashed onto the beach, and hurricane-force winds hurled sand and sea spray into the air.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On that night back in October 1896, the worst storm in almost fifty years was battering the North Carolina coast. Moments earlier, one of Etheridge’s surfmen, Theodore Meekins, had spotted a faint red glimmer in the distance. Could it have been a flare from a ship in distress</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Etheridge quickly lit a flare and held it high over his head until the flame died out. Then he saw it–a dull red light flickered to the south. That could mean only one thing:<br>
shipwreck.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>The Keeper of the Station</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rescuing ships in distress was nothing new for Etheridge. He had been keeper of this life-saving station since 1880. Etheridge had grown up swimming, fishing, and boating on nearby Roanoke Island. He eventually became known as one of the best surfmen and lifesavers in North Carolina. But Etheridge was also known for something else: he was the Life-Saving Service’s first African American station chief.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;White surfmen refused to work under Etheridge. So Etheridge and the Life-Saving Service recruited a crew of African American rescuers to work with him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Etheridge’s men trained for ten hours a day, seven days a week. They swam in the rough surf and patrolled the beach. They performed life-saving drills and tugged their 1,500-pound surfboat and equipment for miles through the sand. But the wreck on the night of October 1896 put all of the crew’s practice to the test.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Rescuing the Wreck</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As soon as Etheridge and Meekins spotted the red flare, they woke up the other five surfmen on duty. The crew quickly hitched up a team of mules. Then they pushed and pulled their surfboat and equipment cart down the beach for two miles.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“The storm was raging fearfully,” Etheridge later wrote, “and . . . the team was often brought to a standstill by the sweeping current.” But the crew kept trudging through the knee-deep sand and icy water. Finally, they spotted the wreck.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The schooner <em>E.S. Newman</em> had blown aground 30 yards offshore. The storm had ripped off the ship’s sails and demolished her deck. Now the battered ship was rolling and tossing in the surf. All nine of the passengers and crew, including the captain’s wife and three-year-old child, were trapped onboard.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“It seemed impossible under such circumstances to render any assistance,” Etheridge later wrote.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But unless someone did something soon, the passengers would probably be swept out to sea, die from exposure, or be crushed when the <em>Newman </em>broke apart in the surf. So Etheridge came up with a daring plan.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His men would try to swim to the ship. Meekins and another surfman volunteered for the first attempt. They lashed themselves together with a rope. Then they grabbed one end of a life-saving line while the rest of the crew held the other end of the line securely to the beach.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meekins and the other surfman slowly waded farther out into the chilly water. They struggled through the currents and against the undertow in total darkness.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Onboard the <em>Newman</em>, the captain lowered a ladder over the side of the broken ship. Finally the surfmen reached the ship.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“The voice of gladden[ed] hearts greeted the arrival of the station crew,” Etheridge later wrote.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One passenger climbed carefully down the ladder. Meekins knotted the end of the rope around him. Slowly they carried him through the churning water to safety. Then two other surfmen headed back to the <em>Newman</em>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Next, they carried the child to shore. Then they returned to rescue the captain’s wife. Again and again, the surfmen took turns swimming in pairs through the sea to the wreck. After six grueling hours, the <em>Newman </em>was destroyed, but all nine passengers were safely onshore.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Life After the Rescue</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The captain of the <em>Newman </em>was so grateful that he gave Etheridge and his crew the ship’s name board. But for many years, this was the only award that the surfmen received. Pea Island Station was closed in 1947, and everyone seemed to forget the courageous crew.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally, in 1996 Etheridge and his men were awarded the Coast Guard’s highest honor, the Gold Lifesaving Medal, for their “extreme and heroic daring.” One hundred years after the <em>Newman </em>rescue, the men of the Pea Island Station were recognized for what they were—heroes.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Station Keeper Richard Etheridge peered from the lookout tower of the Pea Island life-saving station. Fog swirled around his face, and it was pitch-dark. Huge waves crashed onto the beach, and hurricane-force winds hurled sand and sea spray into the air.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On that night back in October 1896, the worst storm in almost fifty years was battering the North Carolina coast. Moments earlier, one of Etheridge’s surfmen, Theodore Meekins, had spotted a faint red glimmer in the distance. Could it have been a flare from a ship in distress</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Etheridge quickly lit a flare and held it high over his head until the flame died out. Then he saw it–a dull red light flickered to the south. That could mean only one thing:<br>
shipwreck.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>The Keeper of the Station</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rescuing ships in distress was nothing new for Etheridge. He had been keeper of this life-saving station since 1880. Etheridge had grown up swimming, fishing, and boating on nearby Roanoke Island. He eventually became known as one of the best surfmen and lifesavers in North Carolina. But Etheridge was also known for something else: he was the Life-Saving Service’s first African American station chief.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;White surfmen refused to work under Etheridge. So Etheridge and the Life-Saving Service recruited a crew of African American rescuers to work with him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Etheridge’s men trained for ten hours a day, seven days a week. They swam in the rough surf and patrolled the beach. They performed life-saving drills and tugged their 1,500-pound surfboat and equipment for miles through the sand. But the wreck on the night of October 1896 put all of the crew’s practice to the test.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Rescuing the Wreck</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As soon as Etheridge and Meekins spotted the red flare, they woke up the other five surfmen on duty. The crew quickly hitched up a team of mules. Then they pushed and pulled their surfboat and equipment cart down the beach for two miles.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“The storm was raging fearfully,” Etheridge later wrote, “and . . . the team was often brought to a standstill by the sweeping current.” But the crew kept trudging through the knee-deep sand and icy water. Finally, they spotted the wreck.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The schooner <em>E.S. Newman</em> had blown aground 30 yards offshore. The storm had ripped off the ship’s sails and demolished her deck. Now the battered ship was rolling and tossing in the surf. All nine of the passengers and crew, including the captain’s wife and three-year-old child, were trapped onboard.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“It seemed impossible under such circumstances to render any assistance,” Etheridge later wrote.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But unless someone did something soon, the passengers would probably be swept out to sea, die from exposure, or be crushed when the <em>Newman </em>broke apart in the surf. So Etheridge came up with a daring plan.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His men would try to swim to the ship. Meekins and another surfman volunteered for the first attempt. They lashed themselves together with a rope. Then they grabbed one end of a life-saving line while the rest of the crew held the other end of the line securely to the beach.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meekins and the other surfman slowly waded farther out into the chilly water. They struggled through the currents and against the undertow in total darkness.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Onboard the <em>Newman</em>, the captain lowered a ladder over the side of the broken ship. Finally the surfmen reached the ship.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“The voice of gladden[ed] hearts greeted the arrival of the station crew,” Etheridge later wrote.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One passenger climbed carefully down the ladder. Meekins knotted the end of the rope around him. Slowly they carried him through the churning water to safety. Then two other surfmen headed back to the <em>Newman</em>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Next, they carried the child to shore. Then they returned to rescue the captain’s wife. Again and again, the surfmen took turns swimming in pairs through the sea to the wreck. After six grueling hours, the <em>Newman </em>was destroyed, but all nine passengers were safely onshore.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Life After the Rescue</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The captain of the <em>Newman </em>was so grateful that he gave Etheridge and his crew the ship’s name board. But for many years, this was the only award that the surfmen received. Pea Island Station was closed in 1947, and everyone seemed to forget the courageous crew.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally, in 1996 Etheridge and his men were awarded the Coast Guard’s highest honor, the Gold Lifesaving Medal, for their “extreme and heroic daring.” One hundred years after the <em>Newman </em>rescue, the men of the Pea Island Station were recognized for what they were—heroes.</p>

          <strong>The Keeper of the Station</strong>

Etheridge had grown up swimming, fishing, and boating on nearby Roanoke Island. He eventually became known as one of the best surfmen and lifesavers in North Carolina.

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As soon as Etheridge and Meekins spotted the red flare, they woke up the other five surfmen on duty. The crew quickly hitched up a team of mules. Then they pushed and pulled their surfboat and equipment cart down the beach for two miles.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“The storm was raging fearfully,” Etheridge later wrote, “and . . . the team was often brought to a standstill by the sweeping current.” But the crew kept trudging through the knee-deep sand and icy water. Finally, they spotted the wreck.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The schooner <em>E.S. Newman</em> had blown aground 30 yards offshore. The storm had ripped off the ship’s sails and demolished her deck.

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meekins and the other surfman slowly waded farther out into the chilly water. They struggled through the currents and against the undertow in total darkness.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Onboard the <em>Newman</em>, the captain lowered a ladder over the side of the broken ship. Finally the surfmen reached the ship.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“The voice of gladden[ed] hearts greeted the arrival of the station crew,” Etheridge later wrote.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One passenger climbed carefully down the ladder. Meekins knotted the end of the rope around him. Slowly they carried him through the churning water to safety. Then two other surfmen headed back to the <em>Newman</em>.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Station Keeper Richard Etheridge peered from the lookout tower of the Pea Island life-saving station. Fog swirled around his face, and it was pitch-dark. Huge waves crashed onto the beach, and hurricane-force winds hurled sand and sea spray into the air.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On that night back in October 1896, the worst storm in almost fifty years was battering the North Carolina coast. Moments earlier, one of Etheridge’s surfmen, Theodore Meekins, had spotted a faint red glimmer in the distance. Could it have been a flare from a ship in distress</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Etheridge quickly lit a flare and held it high over his head until the flame died out. Then he saw it–a dull red light flickered to the south. That could mean only one thing:<br>
shipwreck.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>The Keeper of the Station</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rescuing ships in distress was nothing new for Etheridge. He had been keeper of this life-saving station since 1880. Etheridge had grown up swimming, fishing, and boating on nearby Roanoke Island. He eventually became known as one of the best surfmen and lifesavers in North Carolina. But Etheridge was also known for something else: he was the Life-Saving Service’s first African American station chief.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;White surfmen refused to work under Etheridge. So Etheridge and the Life-Saving Service recruited a crew of African American rescuers to work with him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Etheridge’s men trained for ten hours a day, seven days a week. They swam in the rough surf and patrolled the beach. They performed life-saving drills and tugged their 1,500-pound surfboat and equipment for miles through the sand. But the wreck on the night of October 1896 put all of the crew’s practice to the test.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Rescuing the Wreck</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As soon as Etheridge and Meekins spotted the red flare, they woke up the other five surfmen on duty. The crew quickly hitched up a team of mules. Then they pushed and pulled their surfboat and equipment cart down the beach for two miles.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“The storm was raging fearfully,” Etheridge later wrote, “and . . . the team was often brought to a standstill by the sweeping current.” But the crew kept trudging through the knee-deep sand and icy water. Finally, they spotted the wreck.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The schooner <em>E.S. Newman</em> had blown aground 30 yards offshore. The storm had ripped off the ship’s sails and demolished her deck. Now the battered ship was rolling and tossing in the surf. All nine of the passengers and crew, including the captain’s wife and three-year-old child, were trapped onboard.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“It seemed impossible under such circumstances to render any assistance,” Etheridge later wrote.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But unless someone did something soon, the passengers would probably be swept out to sea, die from exposure, or be crushed when the <em>Newman </em>broke apart in the surf. So Etheridge came up with a daring plan.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His men would try to swim to the ship. Meekins and another surfman volunteered for the first attempt. They lashed themselves together with a rope. Then they grabbed one end of a life-saving line while the rest of the crew held the other end of the line securely to the beach.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meekins and the other surfman slowly waded farther out into the chilly water. They struggled through the currents and against the undertow in total darkness.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Onboard the <em>Newman</em>, the captain lowered a ladder over the side of the broken ship. Finally the surfmen reached the ship.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“The voice of gladden[ed] hearts greeted the arrival of the station crew,” Etheridge later wrote.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One passenger climbed carefully down the ladder. Meekins knotted the end of the rope around him. Slowly they carried him through the churning water to safety. Then two other surfmen headed back to the <em>Newman</em>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Next, they carried the child to shore. Then they returned to rescue the captain’s wife. Again and again, the surfmen took turns swimming in pairs through the sea to the wreck. After six grueling hours, the <em>Newman </em>was destroyed, but all nine passengers were safely onshore.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Life After the Rescue</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The captain of the <em>Newman </em>was so grateful that he gave Etheridge and his crew the ship’s name board. But for many years, this was the only award that the surfmen received. Pea Island Station was closed in 1947, and everyone seemed to forget the courageous crew.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally, in 1996 Etheridge and his men were awarded the Coast Guard’s highest honor, the Gold Lifesaving Medal, for their “extreme and heroic daring.” One hundred years after the <em>Newman </em>rescue, the men of the Pea Island Station were recognized for what they were—heroes.</p>

          <strong>As American as . . . Pizza Pie?</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Michael Demchsak</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; In America, the pizza industry makes more than 30 billion dollars a year. Americans eat 350 slices of pizza per second. A pizza that would satisfy the cravings of the American public each day would cover a 100-acre field. Among kids ages 3–11, pizza is reported to be the first choice for either lunch or dinner.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, it is not surprising that pizza seems ready to take the title of “America’s&nbsp;favorite food” away from the hamburger.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The success achieved by the pizza pie is fairly amazing. After all, pizza was an ethnic food&nbsp;found only in big-city Italian neighborhoods until around 60 years ago.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ancient History</strong>
        </p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In the area around the Mediterranean Sea, people have been baking flat breads, usually covered with herbs, for thousands of years. In fact, the Latin word picea refers to bread blackening in an oven. It may be the origin of the term pizza. The flat breads baked by these Mediterranean people, especially the Italians, were sometimes topped with cheese or vegetables. The result was fairly close to being pizza. But these culinary efforts were not what most of us think of when we hear the word pizza.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Two of the essential ingredients—the crust and the cheese—were in place. It is hard to imagine pizza without tomato sauce, but the tomato is not native to the Mediterranean. It would be many years before this third crucial ingredient would be available. The tomato is a New World plant. It would not have been available in Europe until the 16th century, when Spanish explorers brought it back from Mexico.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>More Recent History</strong>
        </p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In the 16th and 17th centuries, the city of Naples in Italy began producing the ancestors of the tasty treats we now call pizzas. Vendors carried pizzas through the streets in metal stoves worn on their heads. This practice of taking the product to the customer helped increase the popularity of pizza. The first sit-down pizzeria, the Antica Pizzeria Port’Alba, opened in 1830. It continues to operate to this day.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was not until 1889 that pizza had its great moment in history. A restaurant owner in Naples was asked to make a dish in honor of the visiting Queen Margherita. He decided to recreate a version of the Italian flag on crusty flat bread. Tomatoes, mozzarella cheese and a puree of basil formed the red, white and green of the Italian flag. The dish was a giant hit. In fact, visitors to Naples today can still see a royal thank you note from June 1889 written by Galli Camillo, the head of the table of the royal household of Italy.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Italian immigrants brought their love of pizza to the United States. It was popular in Italian neighborhoods in the early 20th century. The first pizzeria in the United States opened in 1905 in New York City. For a time, the popularity of pizza remained <span class="txt-underline">restricted</span> mostly to cities where large groups of Italians lived. But servicemen who had been stationed in Italy during World War II (1941–1945) sparked a new enthusiasm for pizza as they returned home. That spark obviously turned into a wildfire.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Getting Creative with Pizza</strong>
        </p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Pizza is an incredibly versatile dish. Over time, modifications to pizza and its ingredients have become common. Purists can debate whether or not a particular combination is really pizza. But personal and cultural preferences guarantee that pizza will vary widely–and wildly–depending where in the world it is found. At the moment, pizza can be eaten in this country with regular hand-tossed, deep-dish, or ultra-thin crust. Seemingly unusual ingredients are not very unusual at all. For example, Americans with a taste for something different can often ask for a pizza topped with anything from pineapple to sauerkraut. In other lands, the choices may be even more interesting. There are squid pizzas in Japan and mackerel pizzas in Russia. There are coconut pizzas in Costa Rica and curry pizzas in Pakistan.</p>

          <strong>Pizza Today</strong>
        </p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In America today, there are approximately 61,000 pizzerias. Pizza is so common that it is hard to imagine that there are people today who grew up in a time when many Americans had never heard of pizza or seen a slice of this food favorite. It seems almost sad. But those times are gone. Now it can be claimed that America is the pizza capital of the world. But . . . shhh! Don’t tell Naples.</p>

          <strong>As American as . . . Pizza Pie?</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Michael Demchsak</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; In America, the pizza industry makes more than 30 billion dollars a year. Americans eat 350 slices of pizza per second. A pizza that would satisfy the cravings of the American public each day would cover a 100-acre field. Among kids ages 3–11, pizza is reported to be the first choice for either lunch or dinner.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, it is not surprising that pizza seems ready to take the title of “America’s&nbsp;favorite food” away from the hamburger.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The success achieved by the pizza pie is fairly amazing. After all, pizza was an ethnic food&nbsp;found only in big-city Italian neighborhoods until around 60 years ago.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ancient History</strong>
        </p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In the area around the Mediterranean Sea, people have been baking flat breads, usually covered with herbs, for thousands of years. In fact, the Latin word picea refers to bread blackening in an oven. It may be the origin of the term pizza. The flat breads baked by these Mediterranean people, especially the Italians, were sometimes topped with cheese or vegetables. The result was fairly close to being pizza. But these culinary efforts were not what most of us think of when we hear the word pizza.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Two of the essential ingredients—the crust and the cheese—were in place. It is hard to imagine pizza without tomato sauce, but the tomato is not native to the Mediterranean. It would be many years before this third crucial ingredient would be available. The tomato is a New World plant. It would not have been available in Europe until the 16th century, when Spanish explorers brought it back from Mexico.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>More Recent History</strong>
        </p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In the 16th and 17th centuries, the city of Naples in Italy began producing the ancestors of the tasty treats we now call pizzas. Vendors carried pizzas through the streets in metal stoves worn on their heads. This practice of taking the product to the customer helped increase the popularity of pizza. The first sit-down pizzeria, the Antica Pizzeria Port’Alba, opened in 1830. It continues to operate to this day.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was not until 1889 that pizza had its great moment in history. A restaurant owner in Naples was asked to make a dish in honor of the visiting Queen Margherita. He decided to recreate a version of the Italian flag on crusty flat bread. Tomatoes, mozzarella cheese and a puree of basil formed the red, white and green of the Italian flag. The dish was a giant hit. In fact, visitors to Naples today can still see a royal thank you note from June 1889 written by Galli Camillo, the head of the table of the royal household of Italy.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Italian immigrants brought their love of pizza to the United States. It was popular in Italian neighborhoods in the early 20th century. The first pizzeria in the United States opened in 1905 in New York City. For a time, the popularity of pizza remained <span class="txt-underline">restricted</span> mostly to cities where large groups of Italians lived. But servicemen who had been stationed in Italy during World War II (1941–1945) sparked a new enthusiasm for pizza as they returned home. That spark obviously turned into a wildfire.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Getting Creative with Pizza</strong>
        </p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Pizza is an incredibly versatile dish. Over time, modifications to pizza and its ingredients have become common. Purists can debate whether or not a particular combination is really pizza. But personal and cultural preferences guarantee that pizza will vary widely–and wildly–depending where in the world it is found. At the moment, pizza can be eaten in this country with regular hand-tossed, deep-dish, or ultra-thin crust. Seemingly unusual ingredients are not very unusual at all. For example, Americans with a taste for something different can often ask for a pizza topped with anything from pineapple to sauerkraut. In other lands, the choices may be even more interesting. There are squid pizzas in Japan and mackerel pizzas in Russia. There are coconut pizzas in Costa Rica and curry pizzas in Pakistan.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Pizza Today</strong>
        </p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In America today, there are approximately 61,000 pizzerias. Pizza is so common that it is hard to imagine that there are people today who grew up in a time when many Americans had never heard of pizza or seen a slice of this food favorite. It seems almost sad. But those times are gone. Now it can be claimed that America is the pizza capital of the world. But . . . shhh! Don’t tell Naples.</p>

          <strong>As American as . . . Pizza Pie?</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Michael Demchsak</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; In America, the pizza industry makes more than 30 billion dollars a year. Americans eat 350 slices of pizza per second. A pizza that would satisfy the cravings of the American public each day would cover a 100-acre field. Among kids ages 3–11, pizza is reported to be the first choice for either lunch or dinner.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, it is not surprising that pizza seems ready to take the title of “America’s&nbsp;favorite food” away from the hamburger.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The success achieved by the pizza pie is fairly amazing. After all, pizza was an ethnic food&nbsp;found only in big-city Italian neighborhoods until around 60 years ago.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ancient History</strong>
        </p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In the area around the Mediterranean Sea, people have been baking flat breads, usually covered with herbs, for thousands of years. In fact, the Latin word picea refers to bread blackening in an oven. It may be the origin of the term pizza. The flat breads baked by these Mediterranean people, especially the Italians, were sometimes topped with cheese or vegetables. The result was fairly close to being pizza. But these culinary efforts were not what most of us think of when we hear the word pizza.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Two of the essential ingredients—the crust and the cheese—were in place. It is hard to imagine pizza without tomato sauce, but the tomato is not native to the Mediterranean. It would be many years before this third crucial ingredient would be available. The tomato is a New World plant. It would not have been available in Europe until the 16th century, when Spanish explorers brought it back from Mexico.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>More Recent History</strong>
        </p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In the 16th and 17th centuries, the city of Naples in Italy began producing the ancestors of the tasty treats we now call pizzas. Vendors carried pizzas through the streets in metal stoves worn on their heads. This practice of taking the product to the customer helped increase the popularity of pizza. The first sit-down pizzeria, the Antica Pizzeria Port’Alba, opened in 1830. It continues to operate to this day.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was not until 1889 that pizza had its great moment in history. A restaurant owner in Naples was asked to make a dish in honor of the visiting Queen Margherita. He decided to recreate a version of the Italian flag on crusty flat bread. Tomatoes, mozzarella cheese and a puree of basil formed the red, white and green of the Italian flag. The dish was a giant hit. In fact, visitors to Naples today can still see a royal thank you note from June 1889 written by Galli Camillo, the head of the table of the royal household of Italy.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Italian immigrants brought their love of pizza to the United States. It was popular in Italian neighborhoods in the early 20th century. The first pizzeria in the United States opened in 1905 in New York City. For a time, the popularity of pizza remained <span class="txt-underline">restricted</span> mostly to cities where large groups of Italians lived. But servicemen who had been stationed in Italy during World War II (1941–1945) sparked a new enthusiasm for pizza as they returned home. That spark obviously turned into a wildfire.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Getting Creative with Pizza</strong>
        </p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Pizza is an incredibly versatile dish. Over time, modifications to pizza and its ingredients have become common. Purists can debate whether or not a particular combination is really pizza. But personal and cultural preferences guarantee that pizza will vary widely–and wildly–depending where in the world it is found. At the moment, pizza can be eaten in this country with regular hand-tossed, deep-dish, or ultra-thin crust. Seemingly unusual ingredients are not very unusual at all. For example, Americans with a taste for something different can often ask for a pizza topped with anything from pineapple to sauerkraut. In other lands, the choices may be even more interesting. There are squid pizzas in Japan and mackerel pizzas in Russia. There are coconut pizzas in Costa Rica and curry pizzas in Pakistan.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Pizza Today</strong>
        </p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In America today, there are approximately 61,000 pizzerias. Pizza is so common that it is hard to imagine that there are people today who grew up in a time when many Americans had never heard of pizza or seen a slice of this food favorite. It seems almost sad. But those times are gone. Now it can be claimed that America is the pizza capital of the world. But . . . shhh! Don’t tell Naples.</p>
