Jarred backed away from him, fighting back the pain from his injured hand, trying desperately to think. He had no wish to die, but he knew that at all costs he must save Endon, Sharn, and their unborn child, the heir to the throne of Deltora.</p>
        <p>"We are too many for you, Prandine," he said loudly.</p>
        <p>"While you struggle with one, the others can escape." He wondered if Prandine would realize that this was not just a challenge to him, but a message for Endon. While I distract him, take Sharn and run!</p>
        <p>But Prandine was laughing again, kicking the door shut behind him. "There will be no struggle," he jeered, moving forward. "The poison on this blade is deadly. One tiny scratch</p>
        <p>and the end comes quickly. As it did for your mother and father, King Endon."</p>
        <p>"Murderer! Traitor!" breathed Endon, pushing Sharn behind him. "You have betrayed your king, and your land." "This is not my land," sneered Prandine. "My loyalty, like the loyalty of the chief advisors before me, has always been to another place and to a far greater master."</p>
        <p>He looked at Endon with contempt. "You are the last in a line of royal buffoons, King Endon. Little by little we robbed your family of power until you were nothing but puppets</p>
        <p>moving as we pulled the strings. And then, at last, the time was right to take your last protection from you."</p>
        <p>He pointed a bony finger at the tangled chain in Endon's hands. "Finally, the blacksmith Adin's accursed work has been undone. The Belt of Deltora is no more."</p>
        <p>"The gems cannot be destroyed," Endon said through pale lips. "And it is death to take them beyond Deltora's borders."</p>
        <p>Prandine smiled cruelly. "The gems have been scattered far and wide, hidden where no one would dare to find them. And when you and your unborn brat are dead, finding them</p>
        <p>would be no use in any case."</p>
        <p>The room darkened and thunder growled outside the tower. Prandine's eyes glowed with triumph. "The Shadow Lord comes," he hissed.</p>
        <p>Cowering against the wall, Sharn moaned softly. Then she seemed to hear something. She sidled to the open window and looked out-not up to the black sky but down to the ground below the tower. The next moment she had jumped back, covering her mouth with her hand as if to smother a shriek.</p>
        <p>"What is it?" snarled Prandine, suddenly alert.</p>
        <p>Sharn shook her head. "Nothing," she stammered. "I was mistaken. There is no one there."</p>
        <p>Oh, Sharn, even a child could tell that you are lying! thought Jarred desperately. Thanks to you, whoever has come to help us is doomed.</p>
        <p>"Stay where you are or she dies at once!" barked Prandine to the two men as he crossed the room.</p>
        <p>Sharn shrank away from him as he reached her. "Do not look out! There is no one there!" she cried again.</p>
        <p>"So you say," Prandine sneered. He thrust his head and shoulders out of the open window.</p>
        <p>And in the next instant Sharn had crouched behind him, thrown her arms around his knees, jerked his legs back and upwards, and tipped him over the sill.</p>
        <p>Jarred and Endon, frozen with shock, listened to their enemy's screams as he plunged to the hard earth far below. They both stared, astounded, at the small figure turning from the window to face them.</p>
        <p>"Often, in the great hall, I have watched little clowns upset big ones from below," Sharn said calmly. "I did not see why the trick should not work for me."</p>
        <p>"What-what did you see from the window?" Jarred stammered.</p>
        <p>"Nothing. As I told him. But I knew he would not trust my word." Sharn tossed her head. "And I knew he would lean out. Why should he fear a little painted doll like me?"</p>
        <p>Jarred gazed at her in frank admiration, then turned to Endon. "You are as fortunate in your bride as I am in mine," he said.</p>

        <p>Oh, Sharn, even a child could tell that you are lying! thought Jarred desperately. Thanks to you, whoever has come to help us is doomed.</p>
        <p>"Stay where you are or she dies at once!" barked Prandine to the two men as he crossed the room.</p>
        <p>Sharn shrank away from him as he reached her. "Do not look out! There is no one there!" she cried again.</p>
        <p>"So you say," Prandine sneered. He thrust his head and shoulders out of the open window.</p>
        <p>And in the next instant Sharn had crouched behind him, thrown her arms around his knees, jerked his legs back and upwards, and tipped him over the sill.</p>
        <p>Jarred and Endon, frozen with shock, listened to their enemy's screams as he plunged to the hard earth far below. They both stared, astounded, at the small figure turning from the window to face them.</p>
        <p>"Often, in the great hall, I have watched little clowns upset big ones from below," Sharn said calmly. "I did not see why the trick should not work for me."</p>
        <p>"What-what did you see from the window?" Jarred stammered.</p>
        <p>"Nothing. As I told him. But I knew he would not trust my word." Sharn tossed her head. "And I knew he would lean out. Why should he fear a little painted doll like me?"</p>
        <p>Jarred gazed at her in frank admiration, then turned to Endon. "You are as fortunate in your bride as I am in mine," he said.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br>
Lief and his friends picked as many of the apples as they could carry and went down into the drain-tunnels under the city to eat them in secret. The fruits were small and spotted, but they were sweet. It was a feast, enjoyed all the better for knowing that it was stolen from the hated Shadow Lord.</p>
        <p>An hour before sunset, Lief's friends left him and hurried home. Lief, however, was unwilling to waste his last hour of freedom. He stayed in the silence and dimness of the drains, exploring and thinking.</p>
        <p>He meant to stay only a little while, but then he discovered a small drain-tunnel branching off the main, leading, he was sure, towards the palace on the hill. He crept along this new tunnel as far as he dared, then turned back, promising himself that he would follow it further another day. But when, finally, he crawled up to the surface, he found that time had rushed by. Night had fallen.</p>
        <p>So now he was in danger.</p>
        <p>Lief skidded to a stop as two Grey Guards turned a corner in front of him and began pacing in his direction. They were talking and had not yet heard him, seen him, or caught his scent. But when they did ...</p>
        <p>He held his breath, desperately looking this way and that, seeking a way of escape. High walls rose on either side of him, dripping with slimy water and slippery with moss. He could never climb them unaided. He could not turn and run, either.</p>
        <p>To do so would mean certain death.</p>
        <p>Lief had prowled Del's streets all his life and often met with danger. He prided himself on his many lucky escapes in the past. He was fast, agile, and daring. But he had sense,</p>
        <p>too-sense enough to know that he could not run the length of this street without being cut down.</p>
        <p>Each Guard carried a sling and a supply of what the people of Del called "blisters." The blisters were silver eggs filled with burning poison. They burst on contact with a target and the Guards could hurl them with deadly strength and accuracy, even in darkness. Lief had seen enough blister victims fall, writhing in agony, to know that he did not want to risk the same fate.</p>
        <p>Yet if he stayed where he was the Guards would come upon him and he would die in any case. By blister or by dagger, he would die.</p>
        <p>Lief flattened himself against the wall, still as a shadow, not daring to move a muscle. The Guards paced on towards him. Closer, closer ...</p>
        <p>If only they would turn around! he thought feverishly. If only something would distract them! Then I would have a chance.</p>
        <p>He was not praying for a miracle, because he did not believe in miracles. Few citizens of Del did these days. So he was astounded when a moment later there was a clatter from</p>
        <p>the corner behind the Guards. They spun around and began running towards the sound.</p>
        <p>Hardly able to believe his luck, Lief turned to run. Then, with a shock, he felt something hit his shoulder. To his amazement, he saw that it was a rope-a rope dangling from the top</p>
        <p>of the wall. Who had thrown it?</p>
        <p>There was no time to think or wonder. In seconds, he was climbing for his life. He did not pause for breath until he had reached the top of the wall and swung himself into a great tree on the other side. Panting, he huddled in a fork between two branches and looked around him.</p>
        <p>He was alone. The rope had been tied securely around the tree's trunk, but there was no sign of whoever had thrown it over the wall.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br>
Lief and his friends picked as many of the apples as they could carry and went down into the drain-tunnels under the city to eat them in secret. The fruits were small and spotted, but they were sweet. It was a feast, enjoyed all the better for knowing that it was stolen from the hated Shadow Lord.</p>
        <p>An hour before sunset, Lief's friends left him and hurried home. Lief, however, was unwilling to waste his last hour of freedom. He stayed in the silence and dimness of the drains, exploring and thinking.</p>
        <p>He meant to stay only a little while, but then he discovered a small drain-tunnel branching off the main, leading, he was sure, towards the palace on the hill. He crept along this new tunnel as far as he dared, then turned back, promising himself that he would follow it further another day. But when, finally, he crawled up to the surface, he found that time had rushed by. Night had fallen.</p>
        <p>So now he was in danger.</p>
        <p>Lief skidded to a stop as two Grey Guards turned a corner in front of him and began pacing in his direction. They were talking and had not yet heard him, seen him, or caught his scent. But when they did ...</p>
        <p>He held his breath, desperately looking this way and that, seeking a way of escape. High walls rose on either side of him, dripping with slimy water and slippery with moss. He could never climb them unaided. He could not turn and run, either.</p>
        <p>To do so would mean certain death.</p>
        <p>Lief had prowled Del's streets all his life and often met with danger. He prided himself on his many lucky escapes in the past. He was fast, agile, and daring. But he had sense,</p>
        <p>too-sense enough to know that he could not run the length of this street without being cut down.</p>
        <p>Each Guard carried a sling and a supply of what the people of Del called "blisters." The blisters were silver eggs filled with burning poison. They burst on contact with a target and the Guards could hurl them with deadly strength and accuracy, even in darkness. Lief had seen enough blister victims fall, writhing in agony, to know that he did not want to risk the same fate.</p>
        <p>Yet if he stayed where he was the Guards would come upon him and he would die in any case. By blister or by dagger, he would die.</p>
        <p>Lief flattened himself against the wall, still as a shadow, not daring to move a muscle. The Guards paced on towards him. Closer, closer ...</p>
        <p>If only they would turn around! he thought feverishly. If only something would distract them! Then I would have a chance.</p>
        <p>He was not praying for a miracle, because he did not believe in miracles. Few citizens of Del did these days. So he was astounded when a moment later there was a clatter from</p>
        <p>the corner behind the Guards. They spun around and began running towards the sound.</p>
        <p>Hardly able to believe his luck, Lief turned to run. Then, with a shock, he felt something hit his shoulder. To his amazement, he saw that it was a rope-a rope dangling from the top</p>
        <p>of the wall. Who had thrown it?</p>
        <p>There was no time to think or wonder. In seconds, he was climbing for his life. He did not pause for breath until he had reached the top of the wall and swung himself into a great tree on the other side. Panting, he huddled in a fork between two branches and looked around him.</p>
        <p>He was alone. The rope had been tied securely around the tree's trunk, but there was no sign of whoever had thrown it over the wall.&nbsp;</p>

Lief and his friends picked as many of the apples as they could carry and went down into the drain-tunnels under the city to eat them in secret. The fruits were small and spotted, but they were sweet. It was a feast, enjoyed all the better for knowing that it was stolen from the hated Shadow Lord.</p>
        <p>An hour before sunset, Lief's friends left him and hurried home. Lief, however, was unwilling to waste his last hour of freedom. He stayed in the silence and dimness of the drains, exploring and thinking.</p>
        <p>He meant to stay only a little while, but then he discovered a small drain-tunnel branching off the main, leading, he was sure, towards the palace on the hill. He crept along this new tunnel as far as he dared, then turned back, promising himself that he would follow it further another day. But when, finally, he crawled up to the surface, he found that time had rushed by. Night had fallen.</p>
        <p>So now he was in danger.</p>
        <p>Lief skidded to a stop as two Grey Guards turned a corner in front of him and began pacing in his direction. They were talking and had not yet heard him, seen him, or caught his scent. But when they did ...</p>
        <p>He held his breath, desperately looking this way and that, seeking a way of escape. High walls rose on either side of him, dripping with slimy water and slippery with moss. He could never climb them unaided. He could not turn and run, either.</p>
        <p>To do so would mean certain death.</p>
        <p>Lief had prowled Del's streets all his life and often met with danger. He prided himself on his many lucky escapes in the past. He was fast, agile, and daring. But he had sense,</p>
        <p>too-sense enough to know that he could not run the length of this street without being cut down.</p>
        <p>Each Guard carried a sling and a supply of what the people of Del called "blisters." The blisters were silver eggs filled with burning poison. They burst on contact with a target and the Guards could hurl them with deadly strength and accuracy, even in darkness. Lief had seen enough blister victims fall, writhing in agony, to know that he did not want to risk the same fate.</p>
        <p>Yet if he stayed where he was the Guards would come upon him and he would die in any case. By blister or by dagger, he would die.</p>
        <p>Lief flattened himself against the wall, still as a shadow, not daring to move a muscle. The Guards paced on towards him. Closer, closer ...</p>
        <p>If only they would turn around! he thought feverishly. If only something would distract them! Then I would have a chance.</p>
        <p>He was not praying for a miracle, because he did not believe in miracles. Few citizens of Del did these days. So he was astounded when a moment later there was a clatter from</p>
        <p>the corner behind the Guards. They spun around and began running towards the sound.</p>
        <p>Hardly able to believe his luck, Lief turned to run. Then, with a shock, he felt something hit his shoulder. To his amazement, he saw that it was a rope-a rope dangling from the top</p>
        <p>of the wall. Who had thrown it?</p>
        <p>There was no time to think or wonder. In seconds, he was climbing for his life. He did not pause for breath until he had reached the top of the wall and swung himself into a great tree on the other side. Panting, he huddled in a fork between two branches and looked around him.</p>
        <p>He was alone. The rope had been tied securely around the tree's trunk, but there was no sign of whoever had thrown it over the wall.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br>
Stunned by what he had just heard, Lief stared at his father.</p>
        <p>It was as if he were seeing him with new eyes. "You once lived in the palace? You were the king's friend? You-I cannot believe this! I will not believe it!"</p>
        <p>His father smiled grimly. "You must believe it, my son."</p>
        <p>His fists clenched. "Why else do you think we have lived so quietly all these years, tamely obeying every order given to us, never rebelling? Many, many times I have been tempted</p>
        <p>to do otherwise. But I knew that we had to avoid drawing the enemy's attention to us."</p>
        <p>"But-but why have you never told me before?" Lief stammered.</p>
        <p>"We thought it best to keep silent until now, Lief." It was his mother who had spoken. She stood by the fire looking at him gravely.</p>
        <p>"It was so important, you see, that no word reached the ears of the Shadow Lord," she went on. "And until you were ten your father believed that he himself would be the one who would go to seek the gems of Deltora, when the time came. But then-"</p>
        <p>She broke off, glancing at her husband sitting in his armchair, his injured leg stuck stiffly out in front of him.</p>
        <p>He smiled grimly. "Then the tree fell, and I had to accept that this could not be," he finished for her. "I can still work in the forge- enough to earn our bread- but I cannot travel.</p>
        <p>And so, Lief, the task is left to you. If you are willing."</p>
        <p>Lief's head was spinning. So much that he had believed had been overturned in one short hour.</p>
        <p>"The king was not killed after all," he mumbled, trying to take it in. "He escaped, with the queen. But why did the Shadow Lord not find them?"</p>
        <p>"When we reached the forge the king and queen made themselves look like ordinary working people," his father said. "In haste we discussed the plan for escape while outside the wind howled and the darkness of the Shadow Lord deepened</p>
        <p>over the land. And then we parted."</p>
        <p>His face was furrowed with grief and memory. "We knew that we might never meet again. Endon had realized by then that by his foolishness and blindness the people's last trust in him had been destroyed. The Belt would never again shine for him. All our hopes rested with his unborn child."</p>
        <p>"But-how do you know that the child was born safely and is still alive, Father?" Lief blurted out.</p>
        <p>His father heaved himself to his feet. He took off the old brown belt that he always wore at his work. It was strong and heavy, made of two lengths of leather stitched together. He cut the stitching at one end with his knife and pulled out what was hidden inside.</p>
        <p>Lief caught his breath. Sliding from the leather tube was a fine steel chain linking seven steel medallions. Even plain and without ornament, it was still the most beautiful thing he had ever seen.</p>
        <p>He longed to touch it. Eagerly he held out his hands.</p>
        <p>"I mended it, making it ready to receive the gems once more, before I hid it away," his father said, handing it to him. "But so closely is it bound to the blood of Adin that it would have crumbled into pieces if the heir was no more. As you see, it is still whole. So we can be sure that the heir lives."</p>
        <p>In wonder, Lief gazed at the marvelous thing in his hands—the dream Belt made by the great Adin himself. How many times had he read of it in The Belt of Deltora, the small, pale blue book his father had given him to study? He could hardly believe that he was actually holding it.</p>
        <p>“If you agree to go on the quest, my son, you must put the Belt on and never let it out of your sight until it is complete,” he heard his mother say. “Are you willing? Think carefully before you answer.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br>
Stunned by what he had just heard, Lief stared at his father.</p>
        <p>It was as if he were seeing him with new eyes. "You once lived in the palace? You were the king's friend? You-I cannot believe this! I will not believe it!"</p>
        <p>His father smiled grimly. "You must believe it, my son."</p>
        <p>His fists clenched. "Why else do you think we have lived so quietly all these years, tamely obeying every order given to us, never rebelling? Many, many times I have been tempted</p>
        <p>to do otherwise. But I knew that we had to avoid drawing the enemy's attention to us."</p>
        <p>"But-but why have you never told me before?" Lief stammered.</p>
        <p>"We thought it best to keep silent until now, Lief." It was his mother who had spoken. She stood by the fire looking at him gravely.</p>
        <p>"It was so important, you see, that no word reached the ears of the Shadow Lord," she went on. "And until you were ten your father believed that he himself would be the one who would go to seek the gems of Deltora, when the time came. But then-"</p>
        <p>She broke off, glancing at her husband sitting in his armchair, his injured leg stuck stiffly out in front of him.</p>
        <p>He smiled grimly. "Then the tree fell, and I had to accept that this could not be," he finished for her. "I can still work in the forge- enough to earn our bread- but I cannot travel.</p>
        <p>And so, Lief, the task is left to you. If you are willing."</p>
        <p>Lief's head was spinning. So much that he had believed had been overturned in one short hour.</p>
        <p>"The king was not killed after all," he mumbled, trying to take it in. "He escaped, with the queen. But why did the Shadow Lord not find them?"</p>
        <p>"When we reached the forge the king and queen made themselves look like ordinary working people," his father said. "In haste we discussed the plan for escape while outside the wind howled and the darkness of the Shadow Lord deepened</p>
        <p>over the land. And then we parted."</p>
        <p>His face was furrowed with grief and memory. "We knew that we might never meet again. Endon had realized by then that by his foolishness and blindness the people's last trust in him had been destroyed. The Belt would never again shine for him. All our hopes rested with his unborn child."</p>
        <p>"But-how do you know that the child was born safely and is still alive, Father?" Lief blurted out.</p>
        <p>His father heaved himself to his feet. He took off the old brown belt that he always wore at his work. It was strong and heavy, made of two lengths of leather stitched together. He cut the stitching at one end with his knife and pulled out what was hidden inside.</p>
        <p>Lief caught his breath. Sliding from the leather tube was a fine steel chain linking seven steel medallions. Even plain and without ornament, it was still the most beautiful thing he had ever seen.</p>
        <p>He longed to touch it. Eagerly he held out his hands.</p>
        <p>"I mended it, making it ready to receive the gems once more, before I hid it away," his father said, handing it to him. "But so closely is it bound to the blood of Adin that it would have crumbled into pieces if the heir was no more. As you see, it is still whole. So we can be sure that the heir lives."</p>
        <p>In wonder, Lief gazed at the marvelous thing in his hands—the dream Belt made by the great Adin himself. How many times had he read of it in The Belt of Deltora, the small, pale blue book his father had given him to study? He could hardly believe that he was actually holding it.</p>
        <p>“If you agree to go on the quest, my son, you must put the Belt on and never let it out of your sight until it is complete,” he heard his mother say. “Are you willing? Think carefully before you answer.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br>
Stunned by what he had just heard, Lief stared at his father.</p>
        <p>It was as if he were seeing him with new eyes. "You once lived in the palace? You were the king's friend? You-I cannot believe this! I will not believe it!"</p>
        <p>His father smiled grimly. "You must believe it, my son."</p>
        <p>His fists clenched. "Why else do you think we have lived so quietly all these years, tamely obeying every order given to us, never rebelling? Many, many times I have been tempted</p>
        <p>to do otherwise. But I knew that we had to avoid drawing the enemy's attention to us."</p>
        <p>"But-but why have you never told me before?" Lief stammered.</p>
        <p>"We thought it best to keep silent until now, Lief." It was his mother who had spoken. She stood by the fire looking at him gravely.</p>
        <p>"It was so important, you see, that no word reached the ears of the Shadow Lord," she went on. "And until you were ten your father believed that he himself would be the one who would go to seek the gems of Deltora, when the time came. But then-"</p>
        <p>She broke off, glancing at her husband sitting in his armchair, his injured leg stuck stiffly out in front of him.</p>
        <p>He smiled grimly. "Then the tree fell, and I had to accept that this could not be," he finished for her. "I can still work in the forge- enough to earn our bread- but I cannot travel.</p>
        <p>And so, Lief, the task is left to you. If you are willing."</p>
        <p>Lief's head was spinning. So much that he had believed had been overturned in one short hour.</p>
        <p>"The king was not killed after all," he mumbled, trying to take it in. "He escaped, with the queen. But why did the Shadow Lord not find them?"</p>
        <p>"When we reached the forge the king and queen made themselves look like ordinary working people," his father said. "In haste we discussed the plan for escape while outside the wind howled and the darkness of the Shadow Lord deepened</p>
        <p>over the land. And then we parted."</p>
        <p>His face was furrowed with grief and memory. "We knew that we might never meet again. Endon had realized by then that by his foolishness and blindness the people's last trust in him had been destroyed. The Belt would never again shine for him. All our hopes rested with his unborn child."</p>
        <p>"But-how do you know that the child was born safely and is still alive, Father?" Lief blurted out.</p>
        <p>His father heaved himself to his feet. He took off the old brown belt that he always wore at his work. It was strong and heavy, made of two lengths of leather stitched together. He cut the stitching at one end with his knife and pulled out what was hidden inside.</p>
        <p>Lief caught his breath. Sliding from the leather tube was a fine steel chain linking seven steel medallions. Even plain and without ornament, it was still the most beautiful thing he had ever seen.</p>
        <p>He longed to touch it. Eagerly he held out his hands.</p>
        <p>"I mended it, making it ready to receive the gems once more, before I hid it away," his father said, handing it to him. "But so closely is it bound to the blood of Adin that it would have crumbled into pieces if the heir was no more. As you see, it is still whole. So we can be sure that the heir lives."</p>
        <p>In wonder, Lief gazed at the marvelous thing in his hands—the dream Belt made by the great Adin himself. How many times had he read of it in The Belt of Deltora, the small, pale blue book his father had given him to study? He could hardly believe that he was actually holding it.</p>
        <p>“If you agree to go on the quest, my son, you must put the Belt on and never let it out of your sight until it is complete,” he heard his mother say. “Are you willing? Think carefully before you answer.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <p>His fists clenched. "Why else do you think we have lived so quietly all these years, tamely obeying every order given to us, never rebelling? Many, many times I have been tempted</p>
        <p>to do otherwise. But I knew that we had to avoid drawing the enemy's attention to us."</p>
        <p>"But-but why have you never told me before?" Lief stammered.</p>
        <p>"We thought it best to keep silent until now, Lief." It was his mother who had spoken. She stood by the fire looking at him gravely.</p>
        <p>"It was so important, you see, that no word reached the ears of the Shadow Lord," she went on. "And until you were ten your father believed that he himself would be the one who would go to seek the gems of Deltora, when the time came. But then-"</p>
        <p>She broke off, glancing at her husband sitting in his armchair, his injured leg stuck stiffly out in front of him.</p>
        <p>He smiled grimly. "Then the tree fell, and I had to accept that this could not be," he finished for her. "I can still work in the forge- enough to earn our bread- but I cannot travel.</p>
        <p>And so, Lief, the task is left to you. If you are willing."</p>
        <p>Lief's head was spinning. So much that he had believed had been overturned in one short hour.</p>
        <p>"The king was not killed after all," he mumbled, trying to take it in. "He escaped, with the queen. But why did the Shadow Lord not find them?"</p>
        <p>"When we reached the forge the king and queen made themselves look like ordinary working people," his father said. "In haste we discussed the plan for escape while outside the wind howled and the darkness of the Shadow Lord deepened</p>
        <p>over the land. And then we parted."</p>
        <p>His face was furrowed with grief and memory. "We knew that we might never meet again. Endon had realized by then that by his foolishness and blindness the people's last trust in him had been destroyed. The Belt would never again shine for him. All our hopes rested with his unborn child."</p>
        <p>"But-how do you know that the child was born safely and is still alive, Father?" Lief blurted out.</p>
        <p>His father heaved himself to his feet. He took off the old brown belt that he always wore at his work. It was strong and heavy, made of two lengths of leather stitched together. He cut the stitching at one end with his knife and pulled out what was hidden inside.</p>
        <p>Lief caught his breath. Sliding from the leather tube was a fine steel chain linking seven steel medallions. Even plain and without ornament, it was still the most beautiful thing he had ever seen.</p>
        <p>He longed to touch it. Eagerly he held out his hands.</p>
        <p>"I mended it, making it ready to receive the gems once more, before I hid it away," his father said, handing it to him. "But so closely is it bound to the blood of Adin that it would have crumbled into pieces if the heir was no more. As you see, it is still whole. So we can be sure that the heir lives."</p>
        <p>In wonder, Lief gazed at the marvelous thing in his hands—the dream Belt made by the great Adin himself. How many times had he read of it in The Belt of Deltora, the small, pale blue book his father had given him to study? He could hardly believe that he was actually holding it.</p>
        <p>“If you agree to go on the quest, my son, you must put the Belt on and never let it out of your sight until it is complete,” he heard his mother say. “Are you willing? Think carefully before you answer.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br>
Astounded, Lief blinked up at the girl. She was about his own age, elfin faced, with black hair, slanting black brows, and green eyes. She was dressed in ragged grey clothes that seemed strangely familiar. She was bending over him, unfastening the ties of his cloak.</p>
        <p>"Thank heavens you have come!" he whispered.</p>
        <p>"This will be useful, Filli," the girl said.</p>
        <p>With a shock, Lief realized that she was not speaking to him, but to a small, furry, wide-eyed creature that was clinging to her shoulder.</p>
        <p>"How lucky that we came this way today," she went on.</p>
        <p>"If we had left it until tomorrow the cloth would have been quite spoiled."</p>
        <p>With a single push of her slim, sun-browned arm, she rolled Lief onto his side so that she could pull the cloak from beneath him. Then she let him roll back and stood up, the cloak</p>
        <p>draped carelessly over her arm.</p>
        <p>A harsh cry came from overhead. Lief raised his eyes and saw a black bird, a raven, perched in the tree from which the girl had leapt. Its head on one side, it was watching them carefully with one sharp yellow eye.</p>
        <p>The girl grinned and held up the cloak. "See what I have found, Kree!" she called. "A fine new blanket for the nest. But we are coming back now. Do not fear."</p>
        <p>She turned to go.</p>
        <p>"No!" shouted Lief in panic. "Do not leave us!"</p>
        <p>"You cannot leave us here to die!" Barda roared at the same moment. But already the girl had disappeared from sight, taking the cloak with her. And suddenly, in the midst of his despair, Lief thought of his mother's hands, patiently weaving the cloth by candlelight.</p>
        <p>"Bring back my cloak!" he bellowed.</p>
        <p>Even as he shouted, he knew how foolish it was. He was going to die, horribly, very soon. What did it matter if the cloak was gone?</p>
        <p>But somehow it did matter. "You have no right to take it!"</p>
        <p>he shouted furiously to the empty air. "My mother made it for me. My mother!"</p>
        <p>There was a moment's silence. Then, to Lief's astonishment, the girl was back, staring down at him suspiciously through the tangled mass of her hair.</p>
        <p>"How could your mother have made this cloak?" she demanded. "Grey Guards do not know their mothers. They are raised in groups of ten, in houses with-"</p>
        <p>"I am not a Grey Guard!" shouted Lief. "My friend and I are — travelers, from Del. Can you not see by our garments?"</p>
        <p>The girl laughed scornfully. "Your disguise does not fool me. Only Grey Guards take the Wenn Del path, for it leads nowhere but to the Forests."</p>
        <p>She raised her hand to caress the little animal clinging to her shoulder, and her voice hardened. "Many of your fellows have been here before you, seeking living things to take or destroy. They have learned painfully of their mistake."</p>
        <p>"We are not Guards," Barda called out. "My name is Barda. My companion is Lief. We came to the Forests for good reason."</p>
        <p>"What reason?" the girl demanded disbelievingly.</p>
        <p>"We-we cannot tell you," said Lief.</p>

Astounded, Lief blinked up at the girl. She was about his own age, elfin faced, with black hair, slanting black brows, and green eyes. She was dressed in ragged grey clothes that seemed strangely familiar. She was bending over him, unfastening the ties of his cloak.</p>
        <p>"Thank heavens you have come!" he whispered.</p>
        <p>"This will be useful, Filli," the girl said.</p>
        <p>With a shock, Lief realized that she was not speaking to him, but to a small, furry, wide-eyed creature that was clinging to her shoulder.</p>
        <p>"How lucky that we came this way today," she went on.</p>
        <p>"If we had left it until tomorrow the cloth would have been quite spoiled."</p>
        <p>With a single push of her slim, sun-browned arm, she rolled Lief onto his side so that she could pull the cloak from beneath him. Then she let him roll back and stood up, the cloak</p>
        <p>draped carelessly over her arm.</p>
        <p>A harsh cry came from overhead. Lief raised his eyes and saw a black bird, a raven, perched in the tree from which the girl had leapt. Its head on one side, it was watching them carefully with one sharp yellow eye.</p>
        <p>The girl grinned and held up the cloak. "See what I have found, Kree!" she called. "A fine new blanket for the nest. But we are coming back now. Do not fear."</p>
        <p>She turned to go.</p>
        <p>"No!" shouted Lief in panic. "Do not leave us!"</p>
        <p>"You cannot leave us here to die!" Barda roared at the same moment. But already the girl had disappeared from sight, taking the cloak with her. And suddenly, in the midst of his despair, Lief thought of his mother's hands, patiently weaving the cloth by candlelight.</p>
        <p>"Bring back my cloak!" he bellowed.</p>
        <p>Even as he shouted, he knew how foolish it was. He was going to die, horribly, very soon. What did it matter if the cloak was gone?</p>
        <p>But somehow it did matter. "You have no right to take it!"</p>
        <p>he shouted furiously to the empty air. "My mother made it for me. My mother!"</p>
        <p>There was a moment's silence. Then, to Lief's astonishment, the girl was back, staring down at him suspiciously through the tangled mass of her hair.</p>
        <p>"How could your mother have made this cloak?" she demanded. "Grey Guards do not know their mothers. They are raised in groups of ten, in houses with-"</p>
        <p>"I am not a Grey Guard!" shouted Lief. "My friend and I are — travelers, from Del. Can you not see by our garments?"</p>
        <p>The girl laughed scornfully. "Your disguise does not fool me. Only Grey Guards take the Wenn Del path, for it leads nowhere but to the Forests."</p>
        <p>She raised her hand to caress the little animal clinging to her shoulder, and her voice hardened. "Many of your fellows have been here before you, seeking living things to take or destroy. They have learned painfully of their mistake."</p>
        <p>"We are not Guards," Barda called out. "My name is Barda. My companion is Lief. We came to the Forests for good reason."</p>
        <p>"What reason?" the girl demanded disbelievingly.</p>
        <p>"We-we cannot tell you," said Lief.</p>

Astounded, Lief blinked up at the girl. She was about his own age, elfin faced, with black hair, slanting black brows, and green eyes. She was dressed in ragged grey clothes that seemed strangely familiar. She was bending over him, unfastening the ties of his cloak.</p>
        <p>"Thank heavens you have come!" he whispered.</p>
        <p>"This will be useful, Filli," the girl said.</p>
        <p>With a shock, Lief realized that she was not speaking to him, but to a small, furry, wide-eyed creature that was clinging to her shoulder.</p>
        <p>"How lucky that we came this way today," she went on.</p>
        <p>"If we had left it until tomorrow the cloth would have been quite spoiled."</p>
        <p>With a single push of her slim, sun-browned arm, she rolled Lief onto his side so that she could pull the cloak from beneath him. Then she let him roll back and stood up, the cloak</p>
        <p>draped carelessly over her arm.</p>
        <p>A harsh cry came from overhead. Lief raised his eyes and saw a black bird, a raven, perched in the tree from which the girl had leapt. Its head on one side, it was watching them carefully with one sharp yellow eye.</p>
        <p>The girl grinned and held up the cloak. "See what I have found, Kree!" she called. "A fine new blanket for the nest. But we are coming back now. Do not fear."</p>
        <p>She turned to go.</p>
        <p>"No!" shouted Lief in panic. "Do not leave us!"</p>
        <p>"You cannot leave us here to die!" Barda roared at the same moment. But already the girl had disappeared from sight, taking the cloak with her. And suddenly, in the midst of his despair, Lief thought of his mother's hands, patiently weaving the cloth by candlelight.</p>
        <p>"Bring back my cloak!" he bellowed.</p>
        <p>Even as he shouted, he knew how foolish it was. He was going to die, horribly, very soon. What did it matter if the cloak was gone?</p>
        <p>But somehow it did matter. "You have no right to take it!"</p>
        <p>he shouted furiously to the empty air. "My mother made it for me. My mother!"</p>
        <p>There was a moment's silence. Then, to Lief's astonishment, the girl was back, staring down at him suspiciously through the tangled mass of her hair.</p>
        <p>"How could your mother have made this cloak?" she demanded. "Grey Guards do not know their mothers. They are raised in groups of ten, in houses with-"</p>
        <p>"I am not a Grey Guard!" shouted Lief. "My friend and I are — travelers, from Del. Can you not see by our garments?"</p>
        <p>The girl laughed scornfully. "Your disguise does not fool me. Only Grey Guards take the Wenn Del path, for it leads nowhere but to the Forests."</p>
        <p>She raised her hand to caress the little animal clinging to her shoulder, and her voice hardened. "Many of your fellows have been here before you, seeking living things to take or destroy. They have learned painfully of their mistake."</p>
        <p>"We are not Guards," Barda called out. "My name is Barda. My companion is Lief. We came to the Forests for good reason."</p>
        <p>"What reason?" the girl demanded disbelievingly.</p>
        <p>"We-we cannot tell you," said Lief.</p>

Jasmine's voice broke into his thoughts. He looked up as she sat down beside him. "Food will help you to recover," she said. "And this food is good." She helped herself to a strange,</p>
        <p>pink-coloured fruit and bit into it greedily, the juice running down her chin.</p>
        <p>I am a fool to judge her, Lief thought. She lives as best she can. And it is thanks to her that we are alive. She put herself in grave danger for us, when she could have turned her back.</p>
        <p>Now she has brought us to her home and shares her food and drink with us.</p>
        <p>He saw that Barda had begun to eat, and he did the same. He had never eaten a stranger meal. Not just because the food was different from what he was used to at home, but because it was being eaten so high above the ground, beneath a white moon, on a platform that swayed gently with every breeze. And because a black bird called Kree and a small, furred creature called Filli shared the meal with him.</p>
        <p>"How long have you lived here alone, Jasmine?" he asked at last.</p>
        <p>"I was seven years old when the Grey Guards came," the girl answered, licking her fingers and reaching for another fruit. "They must have come the long way from Del, for the</p>
        <p>Wenn had not seized them. I was filling the water bags at the stream. My parents were searching for food and carrying it up to our house in the treetops. The Guards saw them and caught them, burned the house and took them away.”</p>
        <p>“But the guards did not find you?” asked Barda. “How was that?”</p>
        <p>"My mother looked back to me and made a sign for me to hide in the ferns and to be silent," answered Jasmine. "So I did as I was told. I thought that if I did that, if I was good, my mother and father would come back. But they did not come back."</p>
        <p>Her mouth tightened and turned down at the corners, but she did not cry. Jasmine, thought Lief, had probably not cried for a very long time.</p>
        <p>"So you grew up alone, in this Forest?" he asked.</p>
        <p>She nodded. "The good trees and the birds helped me," she said, as though this was the most normal thing in the world. "And I remembered things my parents had taught me. I</p>
        <p>collected what I could from our old house—what had not been burned. I made this nest and slept in it at night, and so was safe from the things that roam the forest floor in the darkness. And so I have lived ever since."</p>
        <p>"That potion you gave us to help us move again," said Barda, making a face at the memory. "What was it?"</p>
        <p>"My mother made it long ago, from leaves like the ones that grow along the Wenn path," Jasmine said. "It cured father when he was stung. I used it on Filli, too, when I found him</p>
        <p>caught by the Wenn as a baby. That was how he came to live with me, wasn't it, Filli?"</p>
        <p>The little creature nibbling berries beside her chattered in agreement. She grinned, but her smile quickly faded as she turned back to Barda and Lief. "There were only a few drops</p>
        <p>left when I found you," she said quietly. "The bottle is empty now."</p>
        <p>"Can you not make more?" asked Barda.</p>
        <p>She shook her head. "The Guards' fire killed the leaves that grew here in the Forest. The only others are on the Wenn path."</p>
        <p>So, Lief thought. She is unprotected now. Because of us.</p>
        <p>"We are deeply grateful, Jasmine," he murmured. "We owe you our lives."</p>
        <p>She shrugged, brushing the last of the fruit stones from her lap.</p>
        <p>"And Deltora owes you a great debt," Barda added. "For now we can continue our quest."</p>
        <p>Jasmine looked up. "If your quest to the Forests leads you to the place I think it will, you will not survive in any case," she</p>
        <p>said bluntly. "I might as well have left you to the Wennbar."</p>
        <p>There was a short, unpleasant silence. Then the girl shrugged again. "But I suppose you will go on, whatever I say," she sighed, climbing to her feet. "So I will show you the way.</p>
        <p>Are you ready?"</p>

Jasmine's voice broke into his thoughts. He looked up as she sat down beside him. "Food will help you to recover," she said. "And this food is good." She helped herself to a strange,</p>
        <p>pink-coloured fruit and bit into it greedily, the juice running down her chin.</p>
        <p>I am a fool to judge her, Lief thought. She lives as best she can. And it is thanks to her that we are alive. She put herself in grave danger for us, when she could have turned her back.</p>
        <p>Now she has brought us to her home and shares her food and drink with us.</p>
        <p>He saw that Barda had begun to eat, and he did the same. He had never eaten a stranger meal. Not just because the food was different from what he was used to at home, but because it was being eaten so high above the ground, beneath a white moon, on a platform that swayed gently with every breeze. And because a black bird called Kree and a small, furred creature called Filli shared the meal with him.</p>
        <p>"How long have you lived here alone, Jasmine?" he asked at last.</p>
        <p>"I was seven years old when the Grey Guards came," the girl answered, licking her fingers and reaching for another fruit. "They must have come the long way from Del, for the</p>
        <p>Wenn had not seized them. I was filling the water bags at the stream. My parents were searching for food and carrying it up to our house in the treetops. The Guards saw them and caught them, burned the house and took them away.”</p>
        <p>“But the guards did not find you?” asked Barda. “How was that?”</p>
        <p>"My mother looked back to me and made a sign for me to hide in the ferns and to be silent," answered Jasmine. "So I did as I was told. I thought that if I did that, if I was good, my mother and father would come back. But they did not come back."</p>
        <p>Her mouth tightened and turned down at the corners, but she did not cry. Jasmine, thought Lief, had probably not cried for a very long time.</p>
        <p>"So you grew up alone, in this Forest?" he asked.</p>
        <p>She nodded. "The good trees and the birds helped me," she said, as though this was the most normal thing in the world. "And I remembered things my parents had taught me. I</p>
        <p>collected what I could from our old house—what had not been burned. I made this nest and slept in it at night, and so was safe from the things that roam the forest floor in the darkness. And so I have lived ever since."</p>
        <p>"That potion you gave us to help us move again," said Barda, making a face at the memory. "What was it?"</p>
        <p>"My mother made it long ago, from leaves like the ones that grow along the Wenn path," Jasmine said. "It cured father when he was stung. I used it on Filli, too, when I found him</p>

Jasmine's voice broke into his thoughts. He looked up as she sat down beside him. "Food will help you to recover," she said. "And this food is good." She helped herself to a strange,</p>
        <p>pink-coloured fruit and bit into it greedily, the juice running down her chin.</p>
        <p>I am a fool to judge her, Lief thought. She lives as best she can. And it is thanks to her that we are alive. She put herself in grave danger for us, when she could have turned her back.</p>
        <p>Now she has brought us to her home and shares her food and drink with us.</p>
        <p>He saw that Barda had begun to eat, and he did the same. He had never eaten a stranger meal. Not just because the food was different from what he was used to at home, but because it was being eaten so high above the ground, beneath a white moon, on a platform that swayed gently with every breeze. And because a black bird called Kree and a small, furred creature called Filli shared the meal with him.</p>
        <p>"How long have you lived here alone, Jasmine?" he asked at last.</p>
        <p>"I was seven years old when the Grey Guards came," the girl answered, licking her fingers and reaching for another fruit. "They must have come the long way from Del, for the</p>
        <p>Wenn had not seized them. I was filling the water bags at the stream. My parents were searching for food and carrying it up to our house in the treetops. The Guards saw them and caught them, burned the house and took them away.”</p>
        <p>“But the guards did not find you?” asked Barda. “How was that?”</p>
        <p>"My mother looked back to me and made a sign for me to hide in the ferns and to be silent," answered Jasmine. "So I did as I was told. I thought that if I did that, if I was good, my mother and father would come back. But they did not come back."</p>
        <p>Her mouth tightened and turned down at the corners, but she did not cry. Jasmine, thought Lief, had probably not cried for a very long time.</p>
        <p>"So you grew up alone, in this Forest?" he asked.</p>
        <p>She nodded. "The good trees and the birds helped me," she said, as though this was the most normal thing in the world. "And I remembered things my parents had taught me. I</p>
        <p>collected what I could from our old house—what had not been burned. I made this nest and slept in it at night, and so was safe from the things that roam the forest floor in the darkness. And so I have lived ever since."</p>
        <p>"That potion you gave us to help us move again," said Barda, making a face at the memory. "What was it?"</p>
        <p>"My mother made it long ago, from leaves like the ones that grow along the Wenn path," Jasmine said. "It cured father when he was stung. I used it on Filli, too, when I found him</p>
        <p>caught by the Wenn as a baby. That was how he came to live with me, wasn't it, Filli?"</p>
        <p>The little creature nibbling berries beside her chattered in agreement. She grinned, but her smile quickly faded as she turned back to Barda and Lief. "There were only a few drops</p>
        <p>left when I found you," she said quietly. "The bottle is empty now."</p>
        <p>"Can you not make more?" asked Barda.</p>
        <p>She shook her head. "The Guards' fire killed the leaves that grew here in the Forest. The only others are on the Wenn path."</p>
        <p>So, Lief thought. She is unprotected now. Because of us.</p>
        <p>"We are deeply grateful, Jasmine," he murmured. "We owe you our lives."</p>
        <p>She shrugged, brushing the last of the fruit stones from her lap.</p>
        <p>"And Deltora owes you a great debt," Barda added. "For now we can continue our quest."</p>
        <p>Jasmine looked up. "If your quest to the Forests leads you to the place I think it will, you will not survive in any case," she</p>
        <p>said bluntly. "I might as well have left you to the Wennbar."</p>
        <p>There was a short, unpleasant silence. Then the girl shrugged again. "But I suppose you will go on, whatever I say," she sighed, climbing to her feet. "So I will show you the way.</p>
        <p>Are you ready?"</p>

Jasmine's voice broke into his thoughts. He looked up as she sat down beside him. "Food will help you to recover," she said. "And this food is good." She helped herself to a strange,</p>
        <p>pink-coloured fruit and bit into it greedily, the juice running down her chin.</p>
        <p>I am a fool to judge her, Lief thought. She lives as best she can. And it is thanks to her that we are alive. She put herself in grave danger for us, when she could have turned her back.</p>
        <p>Now she has brought us to her home and shares her food and drink with us.</p>
        <p>He saw that Barda had begun to eat, and he did the same. He had never eaten a stranger meal. Not just because the food was different from what he was used to at home, but because it was being eaten so high above the ground, beneath a white moon, on a platform that swayed gently with every breeze. And because a black bird called Kree and a small, furred creature called Filli shared the meal with him.</p>
        <p>"How long have you lived here alone, Jasmine?" he asked at last.</p>
        <p>"I was seven years old when the Grey Guards came," the girl answered, licking her fingers and reaching for another fruit. "They must have come the long way from Del, for the</p>
        <p>Wenn had not seized them. I was filling the water bags at the stream. My parents were searching for food and carrying it up to our house in the treetops. The Guards saw them and caught them, burned the house and took them away.”</p>
        <p>“But the guards did not find you?” asked Barda. “How was that?”</p>
        <p>"My mother looked back to me and made a sign for me to hide in the ferns and to be silent," answered Jasmine. "So I did as I was told. I thought that if I did that, if I was good, my mother and father would come back. But they did not come back."</p>
        <p>Her mouth tightened and turned down at the corners, but she did not cry. Jasmine, thought Lief, had probably not cried for a very long time.</p>
        <p>"So you grew up alone, in this Forest?" he asked.</p>
        <p>She nodded. "The good trees and the birds helped me," she said, as though this was the most normal thing in the world. "And I remembered things my parents had taught me. I</p>
        <p>collected what I could from our old house—what had not been burned. I made this nest and slept in it at night, and so was safe from the things that roam the forest floor in the darkness. And so I have lived ever since."</p>
        <p>"That potion you gave us to help us move again," said Barda, making a face at the memory. "What was it?"</p>
        <p>"My mother made it long ago, from leaves like the ones that grow along the Wenn path," Jasmine said. "It cured father when he was stung. I used it on Filli, too, when I found him</p>
        <p>caught by the Wenn as a baby. That was how he came to live with me, wasn't it, Filli?"</p>
        <p>The little creature nibbling berries beside her chattered in agreement. She grinned, but her smile quickly faded as she turned back to Barda and Lief. "There were only a few drops</p>
        <p>left when I found you," she said quietly. "The bottle is empty now."</p>
        <p>"Can you not make more?" asked Barda.</p>
        <p>She shook her head. "The Guards' fire killed the leaves that grew here in the Forest. The only others are on the Wenn path."</p>
        <p>So, Lief thought. She is unprotected now. Because of us.</p>
        <p>"We are deeply grateful, Jasmine," he murmured. "We owe you our lives."</p>
        <p>She shrugged, brushing the last of the fruit stones from her lap.</p>
        <p>"And Deltora owes you a great debt," Barda added. "For now we can continue our quest."</p>
        <p>Jasmine looked up. "If your quest to the Forests leads you to the place I think it will, you will not survive in any case," she</p>
        <p>said bluntly. "I might as well have left you to the Wennbar."</p>
        <p>There was a short, unpleasant silence. Then the girl shrugged again. "But I suppose you will go on, whatever I say," she sighed, climbing to her feet. "So I will show you the way.</p>
        <p>Are you ready?"</p>

His eyes, so long accustomed to the dimness, squinted against the bright sunlight that poured into the clearing from the open sky above. The roof of vines had been torn through,</p>
        <p>and leaves and stems still pattered down like rain. Where he and Gorl had stood together only minutes before lay the reason for the damage—a great fallen branch. And beneath the branch was a mass of crushed golden armour.</p>
        <p>Lief stared, unable to believe what had happened so suddenly. The Belt grew hot against his skin. He looked down and saw Gorl's sword, lying right in front of him. Almost absent-mindedly, he picked it up. The topaz in the hilt shone clear gold. So, he thought dreamily, the first gem to be found was the topaz—the symbol of faithfulness.</p>
        <p>Suddenly his mind cleared. His eyes searched for, and then found, the still, pale figure of Barda, lying at the edge of the clearing. He jumped up and ran to him, kneeling down beside him, calling his name.</p>
        <p>Barda did not stir. He still breathed, but very weakly. The terrible wound in his chest was still bleeding. Lief opened the jacket and shirt, tried to clean the wound, tried to stop the</p>
        <p>blood with his cloak. He had to do something. But he knew it was useless. It was too late.</p>
        <p>He barely looked up as Jasmine leapt lightly down beside him. "Barda is dying," he said drearily. There was a terrible pain in his chest. A terrible sense of loss and loneliness and</p>
        <p>waste.</p>
        <p>"Lief!" he heard Jasmine gasp. But still he did not move.</p>
        <p>"Lief! Look!"</p>
        <p>She was pulling at his arm. Reluctantly he raised his head.</p>
        <p>Jasmine was staring at the center of the clearing. Her face was filled with awe. Lief spun around to see what she was looking at.</p>
        <p>The Lilies of Life were blooming. The golden arrows that were their buds had opened in the sunlight so long denied them. Now they were golden trumpets, their petals spread</p>
        <p>joyously, drinking in the light. And from the centre of the trumpets a rich gold nectar was welling, overflowing, pouring in a sweet-smelling stream down to the black mud.</p>
        <p>With a cry, Lief threw down the sword and leapt up. He ran to the patch of mud and thrust his cupped hands under the nectar flow. When they were full to the brim he ran back to Barda, pouring the nectar onto the wound in his chest, smearing what was left on his pale lips.</p>
        <p>"Barda!" Lief begged. "Come back! Come back!"</p>
        <p>The big man's eyelids fluttered. His eyes opened. They were dazed, as though he had been dreaming. "What is it?" he mumbled. As color began to steal back into his cheeks, his hand fumbled towards the wound on his chest. He licked his lips. "Hurts," he said.</p>
        <p>"Barda! You are well!" he shouted.</p>
        <p>"Of course I am!" With a grunt, Barda sat up, running his hands through his tangled hair. He stared around, astounded, but quite himself again. "What happened?" he demanded,</p>
        <p>climbing to his feet. "Did I faint? Where is Gorl?"</p>
        <p>Lief pointed wordlessly at the crumpled armour beneath the fallen branch.</p>

        <p>and leaves and stems still pattered down like rain. Where he and Gorl had stood together only minutes before lay the reason for the damage—a great fallen branch. And beneath the branch was a mass of crushed golden armour.</p>
        <p>Lief stared, unable to believe what had happened so suddenly. The Belt grew hot against his skin. He looked down and saw Gorl's sword, lying right in front of him. Almost absent-mindedly, he picked it up. The topaz in the hilt shone clear gold. So, he thought dreamily, the first gem to be found was the topaz—the symbol of faithfulness.</p>
        <p>Suddenly his mind cleared. His eyes searched for, and then found, the still, pale figure of Barda, lying at the edge of the clearing. He jumped up and ran to him, kneeling down beside him, calling his name.</p>
        <p>Barda did not stir. He still breathed, but very weakly. The terrible wound in his chest was still bleeding. Lief opened the jacket and shirt, tried to clean the wound, tried to stop the</p>
        <p>blood with his cloak. He had to do something. But he knew it was useless. It was too late.</p>
        <p>He barely looked up as Jasmine leapt lightly down beside him. "Barda is dying," he said drearily. There was a terrible pain in his chest. A terrible sense of loss and loneliness and</p>
        <p>waste.</p>
        <p>"Lief!" he heard Jasmine gasp. But still he did not move.</p>
        <p>"Lief! Look!"</p>
        <p>She was pulling at his arm. Reluctantly he raised his head.</p>
        <p>Jasmine was staring at the center of the clearing. Her face was filled with awe. Lief spun around to see what she was looking at.</p>
        <p>The Lilies of Life were blooming. The golden arrows that were their buds had opened in the sunlight so long denied them. Now they were golden trumpets, their petals spread</p>
        <p>joyously, drinking in the light. And from the centre of the trumpets a rich gold nectar was welling, overflowing, pouring in a sweet-smelling stream down to the black mud.</p>
        <p>With a cry, Lief threw down the sword and leapt up. He ran to the patch of mud and thrust his cupped hands under the nectar flow. When they were full to the brim he ran back to Barda, pouring the nectar onto the wound in his chest, smearing what was left on his pale lips.</p>
        <p>"Barda!" Lief begged. "Come back! Come back!"</p>
        <p>The big man's eyelids fluttered. His eyes opened. They were dazed, as though he had been dreaming. "What is it?" he mumbled. As color began to steal back into his cheeks, his hand fumbled towards the wound on his chest. He licked his lips. "Hurts," he said.</p>
        <p>"Barda! You are well!" he shouted.</p>
        <p>"Of course I am!" With a grunt, Barda sat up, running his hands through his tangled hair. He stared around, astounded, but quite himself again. "What happened?" he demanded,</p>
        <p>climbing to his feet. "Did I faint? Where is Gorl?"</p>
        <p>Lief pointed wordlessly at the crumpled armour beneath the fallen branch.</p>
