          <strong>A Personal Achievement</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> “You’re next, Carl,” Mrs. Sosa said. Carl walked nervously to the stage. Why had he let his friend Neil talk him into trying out for the play? He hated standing in front of people.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> He had spent the weekend memorizing lines, but he knew he wouldn’t get the part. It was a small part anyway, not like the lead role he just knew Neil would get. Neil had already finished his audition. As always he had done well even though he hadn’t practiced at all.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> “You’re trying out for a guard?” Mrs. Sosa asked. “I’ll read the queen’s lines. Begin when you’re ready.”</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="86%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766021972/amskr7jx1yqa3iof76sj.png" alt="ASS_Y4_EN_32">


        </p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> Carl took a deep breath and tried to picture himself as a guard, just as his mother had suggested when she helped him practice. “Your majesty,” Carl began uncertainly, “the castle is under siege.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> “Call my knights!” Mrs. Sosa responded as the queen, sounding like Carl’s mother had. He almost smiled. At first he felt silly in front of the other students, but as he concentrated on his lines, he forgot about the people watching. It was as if he had really become a guard in a queen’s service!</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> After Carl finished, he walked over to Neil. As soon as Carl sat down, Neil asked, “Do you think I got the part of the knight?”</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> “I’m sure you did,” Carl mumbled. Sometimes he thought Neil just liked hearing how great he was. “It’s not like he doesn’t &nbsp;already hear what a great basketball player he is,” Carl thought. Neil was confident and talented. He seemed to succeed at everything without even trying, while Carl struggled just to be average.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “You should have made your voice sound like that actor in The Bank Caper,” Neil said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> “I had enough trouble just remembering my lines,” Carl said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> The next afternoon Carl went to Mrs. Sosa’s room to see who had been given the part of the guard. His name wasn’t listed. “Figures,” he muttered.</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> Mrs. Sosa walked up to Carl and said, “Rehearsals start tomorrow. There’s a lot of work to do.” Seeing Carl’s puzzled face, she said, “Oh, you haven’t heard.” She pointed to the top of the list. “You’re playing Sir Trawood. You had the best tryout of anyone, Carl.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> Carl was stunned. “But what about Neil?”</p>
        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> Mrs. Sosa sighed. “Neil was offered a smaller part, but he <span class="txt-underline"><strong>rejected</strong></span> it.”</p>
        <p><strong><em>14</em></strong> “He did?” Carl’s eyes widened. “But I can’t be in the play without Neil,” he said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>15</strong></em> Mrs. Sosa frowned. “But, Carl, you’re the best actor for this part.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>16</strong></em> Neil called Carl that night and said, “I guess you’re happy to get the best part. I have to admit I’m jealous.” Carl&nbsp;was silent. He couldn’t believe that Neil would be jealous of him .</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Star of the Show</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1&nbsp;</strong></em>“Begin when you’re ready, Neil,” Mrs. Sosa said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em>&nbsp;Neil started to speak. “Humph,” he coughed, trying to stall. He had looked at the script that morning, but now his mind was blank. Maybe he could <span class="txt-underline"><strong>improvise</strong></span>—make up his own words now and memorize his lines after he got the part. Then luckily he remembered. “Knights of the Royal Order,” he hissed, trying to sound like his favorite actor, “this means war!”</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em>&nbsp;He saw Mrs. Sosa raise her eyebrows. He could tell she was impressed. He stumbled over his words a couple more times, but he still felt confident when he had finished. He couldn’t wait to star in a real play. Most days he imagined himself as a basketball star, but sometimes he thought he would like to star in the movies. “Maybe I’ll be an actor after I retire from basketball,” he thought.</p>
        <p><strong><em>4&nbsp;</em></strong>His friend Carl was next. Neil felt sorry for him. Carl looked terrified. When he started talking, he sounded as if he had swallowed a frog. Carl remembered all his lines, but he didn’t act very well. He just used his regular voice.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em>&nbsp;When Carl returned, Neil noticed that he was sullen. “Do you think I got the part of the knight?” he asked his friend, hoping to take Carl’s mind off his own tryout. “Maybe I’ll ask Mrs. Sosa to give Carl another chance,” Neil thought.</p>
        <p><strong><em>6</em></strong>&nbsp;After basketball practice the next day, Neil rushed to Mrs. Sosa’s room to see who else was in the play. He noticed right away that Carl hadn’t gotten the part of the guard. Then Neil gasped. Carl had gotten the part of Sir Trawood! There had to be some mistake.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em>&nbsp;“I’m afraid you didn’t get the part you wanted, Neil,” Mrs. Sosa said. “You’ll be playing the part of a messenger.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em>&nbsp;“But Carl didn’t even try out for Sir Trawood,” Neil protested.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em>&nbsp;Mrs. Sosa nodded. “Yes, but I think he’ll make an excellent knight.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em>&nbsp;“He didn’t even sound like an actor,” Neil complained.</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em>&nbsp;“That’s why he did so well,” Mrs. Sosa said. “You’ll see what I mean at practice tomorrow.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em>&nbsp;“No, I won’t,” Neil said. “I’m not going to be some stupid messenger.” He stormed out. As he walked home, he kept thinking it wasn’t fair. Carl probably wouldn’t even have tried out for the play if Neil hadn’t insisted. He felt angry that Carl would be in the play without him. “But I guess I should congratulate him,” he thought. “After all, I’m the school’s star basketball player, and Carl didn’t even make the team.”</p>

          <strong>A DAY AT THE FLOATING MARKET</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Jerry Bridgens</em>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> City life in Thailand is much like city life in the United States. People live in tall buildings or in houses close together. They travel in cars and buses and buy what they need in stores. But outside the cities, life is different. People usually live on farms far apart from one another. Many of these farms do not have electricity for lights or refrigerators. Therefore, people grow their own food or buy it fresh almost every day at the market. But the market is not in a building. It is a floating market located on a river. People travel in their boats on the river, buying and selling almost anything.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em>&nbsp;Lamai and her family live on a farm. They grow fruits and vegetables and sell them at the market each day. The family’s day starts about 3:00 A.M. Long before the sun comes up, Lamai and her brother help their parents. They pick out fruits and vegetables and clean them. Then they load everything into a long boat called a ruilla pais. &nbsp;</p>
        <p>Their boat is ready by about 6:00 A.M. Lamai’s father and brother stay on the farm to work while Lamai and her mother row to the closest floating market. On the way the water is still and peaceful. Lamai sees the bright sun beginning to shine.</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="55%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766023516/i20avlvvzs6e3s8rovlr.png" alt="ASS_Y3_EN_01_2">


        </p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> Soon the peace and calm are gone. Lamai hears laughing and yelling in the distance. Then the sounds grow louder. Her mother rows the boat around a corner. Suddenly they are at the floating market. Hundreds of boats are gathered at a wide place in the river.</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="64%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766023523/njlcpkkhg8kilfuwimrp.png" alt="ASS_Y3_EN_01_3">


        </p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em><span class="txt-underline"><strong>Merchants</strong></span> call out what they have to sell. Lamai’s mother is selling bananas and ripe tomatoes today. Lamai sees baskets of yellow rambutan and sour star fruit in other boats. She hopes her mother will buy some star fruit later. It’s Lamai’s favorite. People go from one seller to another in their boats. Many of the long boats are parked right next to one another. Other boats float a little farther out in the river. People can buy sweet reddish-brown mangosteens at one boat and fresh bread at another.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> For Lamai a trip to the market is more than just a chance to sell or buy something. It is a chance for her to talk to her friends. Today Lamai sees her friend Suki. He is helping his mother prepare meals in their boat. Lamai loves the smell of the fried bananas Suki’s mother is making. Lamai’s &nbsp;mother rows over to buy a late breakfast. As Lamai eats, she and Suki talk about their summer plans.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> Lamai waves good-bye to her friend as she and her mother move away to sell the rest of their food. Lamai sees some people on the walkway beside the river. Many boats stop next to the walkway to sell things to the tourists. Some of these visitors buy food from the boats, but most of them go to the boats that have souvenirs for sale. They buy the T-shirts, pencils, statues, and colorful purses sold on these boats.</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="64%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766023524/c42tp6qmrvg4mgtulhvc.png" alt="ASS_Y3_EN_01_4">


        </p>
        <p><em><strong>8 </strong></em>Around 11:00 A.M. people begin to go home. Lamai is glad. She is drowsy from waking up so early. Her mother has sold most of what they brought to the market. They will leave the market with less food in their boat but with more money for Lamai’s family. Lamai’s mother makes one last stop so Lamai can buy some star fruit. Then they row home. Tomorrow the work will begin again.</p>

          <strong>A DAY AT THE FLOATING MARKET</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Jerry Bridgens</em>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> City life in Thailand is much like city life in the United States. People live in tall buildings or in houses close together. They travel in cars and buses and buy what they need in stores. But outside the cities, life is different. People usually live on farms far apart from one another. Many of these farms do not have electricity for lights or refrigerators. Therefore, people grow their own food or buy it fresh almost every day at the market. But the market is not in a building. It is a floating market located on a river. People travel in their boats on the river, buying and selling almost anything.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em>&nbsp;Lamai and her family live on a farm. They grow fruits and vegetables and sell them at the market each day. The family’s day starts about 3:00 A.M. Long before the sun comes up, Lamai and her brother help their parents. They pick out fruits and vegetables and clean them. Then they load everything into a long boat called a ruilla pais. &nbsp;</p>
        <p>Their boat is ready by about 6:00 A.M. Lamai’s father and brother stay on the farm to work while Lamai and her mother row to the closest floating market. On the way the water is still and peaceful. Lamai sees the bright sun beginning to shine.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> Soon the peace and calm are gone. Lamai hears laughing and yelling in the distance. Then the sounds grow louder. Her mother rows the boat around a corner. Suddenly they are at the floating market. Hundreds of boats are gathered at a wide place in the river.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em><span class="txt-underline"><strong>Merchants</strong></span> call out what they have to sell. Lamai’s mother is selling bananas and ripe tomatoes today. Lamai sees baskets of yellow rambutan and sour star fruit in other boats. She hopes her mother will buy some star fruit later. It’s Lamai’s favorite. People go from one seller to another in their boats. Many of the long boats are parked right next to one another. Other boats float a little farther out in the river. People can buy sweet reddish-brown mangosteens at one boat and fresh bread at another.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> For Lamai a trip to the market is more than just a chance to sell or buy something. It is a chance for her to talk to her friends. Today Lamai sees her friend Suki. He is helping his mother prepare meals in their boat. Lamai loves the smell of the fried bananas Suki’s mother is making. Lamai’s &nbsp;mother rows over to buy a late breakfast. As Lamai eats, she and Suki talk about their summer plans.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> Lamai waves good-bye to her friend as she and her mother move away to sell the rest of their food. Lamai sees some people on the walkway beside the river. Many boats stop next to the walkway to sell things to the tourists. Some of these visitors buy food from the boats, but most of them go to the boats that have souvenirs for sale. They buy the T-shirts, pencils, statues, and colorful purses sold on these boats.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>8 </strong></em>Around 11:00 A.M. people begin to go home. Lamai is glad. She is drowsy from waking up so early. Her mother has sold most of what they brought to the market. They will leave the market with less food in their boat but with more money for Lamai’s family. Lamai’s mother makes one last stop so Lamai can buy some star fruit. Then they row home. Tomorrow the work will begin again.</p>

          <strong>A DAY AT THE FLOATING MARKET</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Jerry Bridgens</em>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> City life in Thailand is much like city life in the United States. People live in tall buildings or in houses close together. They travel in cars and buses and buy what they need in stores. But outside the cities, life is different. People usually live on farms far apart from one another. Many of these farms do not have electricity for lights or refrigerators. Therefore, people grow their own food or buy it fresh almost every day at the market. But the market is not in a building. It is a floating market located on a river. People travel in their boats on the river, buying and selling almost anything.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em>&nbsp;Lamai and her family live on a farm. They grow fruits and vegetables and sell them at the market each day. The family’s day starts about 3:00 A.M. Long before the sun comes up, Lamai and her brother help their parents. They pick out fruits and vegetables and clean them. Then they load everything into a long boat called a ruilla pais. &nbsp;</p>
        <p>Their boat is ready by about 6:00 A.M. Lamai’s father and brother stay on the farm to work while Lamai and her mother row to the closest floating market. On the way the water is still and peaceful. Lamai sees the bright sun beginning to shine.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> Soon the peace and calm are gone. Lamai hears laughing and yelling in the distance. Then the sounds grow louder. Her mother rows the boat around a corner. Suddenly they are at the floating market. Hundreds of boats are gathered at a wide place in the river.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em><span class="txt-underline"><strong>Merchants</strong></span> call out what they have to sell. Lamai’s mother is selling bananas and ripe tomatoes today. Lamai sees baskets of yellow rambutan and sour star fruit in other boats. She hopes her mother will buy some star fruit later. It’s Lamai’s favorite. People go from one seller to another in their boats. Many of the long boats are parked right next to one another. Other boats float a little farther out in the river. People can buy sweet reddish-brown mangosteens at one boat and fresh bread at another.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> For Lamai a trip to the market is more than just a chance to sell or buy something. It is a chance for her to talk to her friends. Today Lamai sees her friend Suki. He is helping his mother prepare meals in their boat. Lamai loves the smell of the fried bananas Suki’s mother is making. Lamai’s &nbsp;mother rows over to buy a late breakfast. As Lamai eats, she and Suki talk about their summer plans.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> Lamai waves good-bye to her friend as she and her mother move away to sell the rest of their food. Lamai sees some people on the walkway beside the river. Many boats stop next to the walkway to sell things to the tourists. Some of these visitors buy food from the boats, but most of them go to the boats that have souvenirs for sale. They buy the T-shirts, pencils, statues, and colorful purses sold on these boats.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>8 </strong></em>Around 11:00 A.M. people begin to go home. Lamai is glad. She is drowsy from waking up so early. Her mother has sold most of what they brought to the market. They will leave the market with less food in their boat but with more money for Lamai’s family. Lamai’s mother makes one last stop so Lamai can buy some star fruit. Then they row home. Tomorrow the work will begin again.</p>

They travel in cars and buses and buy what they need in stores. But outside the cities, life is different. People usually live on farms far apart from one another. Many of these farms do not have electricity for lights or refrigerators. Therefore, people grow their own food or buy it fresh almost every day at the market. But the market is not in a building. It is a floating market located on a river. People travel in their boats on the river, buying and selling almost anything.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em>&nbsp;Lamai and her family live on a farm. They grow fruits and vegetables and sell them at the market each day. The family’s day starts about 3:00 A.M. Long before the sun comes up, Lamai and her brother help their parents. They pick out fruits and vegetables and clean them. Then they load everything into a long boat called a ruilla pais. &nbsp;</p>
        <p>Their boat is ready by about 6:00 A.M. Lamai’s father and brother stay on the farm to work while Lamai and her mother row to the closest floating market. On the way the water is still and peaceful. Lamai sees the bright sun beginning to shine.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> Soon the peace and calm are gone. Lamai hears laughing and yelling in the distance. Then the sounds grow louder. Her mother rows the boat around a corner. Suddenly they are at the floating market. Hundreds of boats are gathered at a wide place in the river.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em><span class="txt-underline"><strong>Merchants</strong></span> call out what they have to sell. Lamai’s mother is selling bananas and ripe tomatoes today. Lamai sees baskets of yellow rambutan and sour star fruit in other boats. She hopes her mother will buy some star fruit later. It’s Lamai’s favorite. People go from one seller to another in their boats. Many of the long boats are parked right next to one another. Other boats float a little farther out in the river. People can buy sweet reddish-brown mangosteens at one boat and fresh bread at another.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> For Lamai a trip to the market is more than just a chance to sell or buy something. It is a chance for her to talk to her friends. Today Lamai sees her friend Suki. He is helping his mother prepare meals in their boat. Lamai loves the smell of the fried bananas Suki’s mother is making. Lamai’s &nbsp;mother rows over to buy a late breakfast. As Lamai eats, she and Suki talk about their summer plans.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> Lamai waves good-bye to her friend as she and her mother move away to sell the rest of their food. Lamai sees some people on the walkway beside the river. Many boats stop next to the walkway to sell things to the tourists. Some of these visitors buy food from the boats, but most of them go to the boats that have souvenirs for sale. They buy the T-shirts, pencils, statues, and colorful purses sold on these boats.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>8 </strong></em>Around 11:00 A.M. people begin to go home. Lamai is glad. She is drowsy from waking up so early. Her mother has sold most of what they brought to the market. They will leave the market with less food in their boat but with more money for Lamai’s family. Lamai’s mother makes one last stop so Lamai can buy some star fruit. Then they row home. Tomorrow the work will begin again.</p>

          <strong>A DAY AT THE FLOATING MARKET</strong>

        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> Soon the peace and calm are gone. Lamai hears laughing and yelling in the distance. Then the sounds grow louder. Her mother rows the boat around a corner.

        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em><span class="txt-underline"><strong>Merchants</strong></span> call out what they have to sell. Lamai’s mother is selling bananas and ripe tomatoes today. Lamai sees baskets of yellow rambutan and sour star fruit in other boats. She hopes her mother will buy some star fruit later. It’s Lamai’s favorite. People go from one seller to another in their boats. Many of the long boats are parked right next to one another. Other boats float a little farther out in the river. People can buy sweet reddish-brown mangosteens at one boat and fresh bread at another.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> For Lamai a trip to the market is more than just a chance to sell or buy something. It is a chance for her to talk to her friends. Today Lamai sees her friend Suki. He is helping his mother prepare meals in their boat. Lamai loves the smell of the fried bananas Suki’s mother is making. Lamai’s &nbsp;mother rows over to buy a late breakfast. As Lamai eats, she and Suki talk about their summer plans.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> Lamai waves good-bye to her friend as she and her mother move away to sell the rest of their food. Lamai sees some people on the walkway beside the river. Many boats stop next to the walkway to sell things to the tourists. Some of these visitors buy food from the boats, but most of them go to the boats that have souvenirs for sale. They buy the T-shirts, pencils, statues, and colorful purses sold on these boats.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>8 </strong></em>Around 11:00 A.M. people begin to go home. Lamai is glad. She is drowsy from waking up so early. Her mother has sold most of what they brought to the market. They will leave the market with less food in their boat but with more money for Lamai’s family. Lamai’s mother makes one last stop so Lamai can buy some star fruit. Then they row home. Tomorrow the work will begin again.</p>

          <strong>A DAY AT THE FLOATING MARKET</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Jerry Bridgens</em>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> City life in Thailand is much like city life in the United States. People live in tall buildings or in houses close together. They travel in cars and buses and buy what they need in stores. But outside the cities, life is different. People usually live on farms far apart from one another. Many of these farms do not have electricity for lights or refrigerators. Therefore, people grow their own food or buy it fresh almost every day at the market. But the market is not in a building. It is a floating market located on a river. People travel in their boats on the river, buying and selling almost anything.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em>&nbsp;Lamai and her family live on a farm. They grow fruits and vegetables and sell them at the market each day. The family’s day starts about 3:00 A.M. Long before the sun comes up, Lamai and her brother help their parents. They pick out fruits and vegetables and clean them. Then they load everything into a long boat called a ruilla pais. &nbsp;</p>
        <p>Their boat is ready by about 6:00 A.M. Lamai’s father and brother stay on the farm to work while Lamai and her mother row to the closest floating market. On the way the water is still and peaceful. Lamai sees the bright sun beginning to shine.</p>

People can buy sweet reddish-brown mangosteens at one boat and fresh bread at another.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> For Lamai a trip to the market is more than just a chance to sell or buy something. It is a chance for her to talk to her friends. Today Lamai sees her friend Suki. He is helping his mother prepare meals in their boat. Lamai loves the smell of the fried bananas Suki’s mother is making. Lamai’s &nbsp;mother rows over to buy a late breakfast. As Lamai eats, she and Suki talk about their summer plans.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> Lamai waves good-bye to her friend as she and her mother move away to sell the rest of their food. Lamai sees some people on the walkway beside the river. Many boats stop next to the walkway to sell things to the tourists. Some of these visitors buy food from the boats, but most of them go to the boats that have souvenirs for sale. They buy the T-shirts, pencils, statues, and colorful purses sold on these boats.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>8 </strong></em>Around 11:00 A.M. people begin to go home. Lamai is glad. She is drowsy from waking up so early. Her mother has sold most of what they brought to the market. They will leave the market with less food in their boat but with more money for Lamai’s family. Lamai’s mother makes one last stop so Lamai can buy some star fruit. Then they row home. Tomorrow the work will begin again.</p>

          <strong>A DAY AT THE FLOATING MARKET</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Jerry Bridgens</em>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> City life in Thailand is much like city life in the United States. People live in tall buildings or in houses close together. They travel in cars and buses and buy what they need in stores. But outside the cities, life is different. People usually live on farms far apart from one another. Many of these farms do not have electricity for lights or refrigerators. Therefore, people grow their own food or buy it fresh almost every day at the market. But the market is not in a building. It is a floating market located on a river. People travel in their boats on the river, buying and selling almost anything.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em>&nbsp;Lamai and her family live on a farm. They grow fruits and vegetables and sell them at the market each day. The family’s day starts about 3:00 A.M. Long before the sun comes up, Lamai and her brother help their parents. They pick out fruits and vegetables and clean them. Then they load everything into a long boat called a ruilla pais. &nbsp;</p>
        <p>Their boat is ready by about 6:00 A.M. Lamai’s father and brother stay on the farm to work while Lamai and her mother row to the closest floating market. On the way the water is still and peaceful. Lamai sees the bright sun beginning to shine.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> Soon the peace and calm are gone. Lamai hears laughing and yelling in the distance. Then the sounds grow louder. Her mother rows the boat around a corner. Suddenly they are at the floating market. Hundreds of boats are gathered at a wide place in the river.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em><span class="txt-underline"><strong>Merchants</strong></span> call out what they have to sell. Lamai’s mother is selling bananas and ripe tomatoes today. Lamai sees baskets of yellow rambutan and sour star fruit in other boats. She hopes her mother will buy some star fruit later. It’s Lamai’s favorite. People go from one seller to another in their boats. Many of the long boats are parked right next to one another. Other boats float a little farther out in the river.

        <p><em><strong>8 </strong></em>Around 11:00 A.M. people begin to go home. Lamai is glad. She is drowsy from waking up so early. Her mother has sold most of what they brought to the market. They will leave the market with less food in their boat but with more money for Lamai’s family. Lamai’s mother makes one last stop so Lamai can buy some star fruit. Then they row home. Tomorrow the work will begin again.</p>

            <strong>Rhodopis and the Slippers</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> Long ago Rhodopis left her home in Greece and went far away to Egypt, where she worked as a housemaid. Rhodopis didn’t look like the other housemaids, so they often mistreated her.</p>
        <p><strong><em>2</em></strong> “Rhodopis, make us something to eat! Wash our clothes!” the housemaids screamed. They also blamed Rhodopis for all their mistakes.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> One day the master of the house saw Rhodopis dancing as she did her work. He was charmed by how gracefully Rhodopis danced, so he had a special pair of beautiful slippers made for her. Angered by the gift, the other housemaids treated Rhodopis even worse than before.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> A month later, the pharaoh, or ruler, of Egypt announced a great feast. Even servants were invited, as long as they finished their work. However, the housemaids gave Rhodopis so much of their work that she wasn’t able to go.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> Later, while everyone was at the feast, Rhodopis sat alone by the Nile River. “What good are these?” she asked as she pulled the slippers from her feet. Suddenly a falcon flew down and stole one slipper. With a heavy heart, Rhodopis watched as the falcon flew away.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> At the same time that Rhodopis sat on the shore of the river, the pharaoh’s son Amasis sat alone at the great feast. To his surprise a falcon dropped a slipper onto his lap. Amasis knew this was a sign. The maiden who wore the slipper would be his princess.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> The next day Amasis began his search. Women young and old tried on the slipper, but it fit none of them. Soon Amasis arrived at the house where Rhodopis lived. The other housemaids oiled their feet, but still the slipper wouldn’t fit. Then Amasis saw Rhodopis watching from a distance and called her over. The slipper fit perfectly.</p>

            <strong>Rhodopis and the Slippers</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> Long ago Rhodopis left her home in Greece and went far away to Egypt, where she worked as a housemaid. Rhodopis didn’t look like the other housemaids, so they often mistreated her.</p>
        <p><strong><em>2</em></strong> “Rhodopis, make us something to eat! Wash our clothes!” the housemaids screamed. They also blamed Rhodopis for all their mistakes.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> One day the master of the house saw Rhodopis dancing as she did her work. He was charmed by how gracefully Rhodopis danced, so he had a special pair of beautiful slippers made for her. Angered by the gift, the other housemaids treated Rhodopis even worse than before.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> A month later, the pharaoh, or ruler, of Egypt announced a great feast. Even servants were invited, as long as they finished their work. However, the housemaids gave Rhodopis so much of their work that she wasn’t able to go.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> Later, while everyone was at the feast, Rhodopis sat alone by the Nile River. “What good are these?” she asked as she pulled the slippers from her feet. Suddenly a falcon flew down and stole one slipper. With a heavy heart, Rhodopis watched as the falcon flew away.</p>

            <strong>Rhodopis and the Slippers</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> Long ago Rhodopis left her home in Greece and went far away to Egypt, where she worked as a housemaid. Rhodopis didn’t look like the other housemaids, so they often mistreated her.</p>
        <p><strong><em>2</em></strong> “Rhodopis, make us something to eat! Wash our clothes!” the housemaids screamed. They also blamed Rhodopis for all their mistakes.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> One day the master of the house saw Rhodopis dancing as she did her work. He was charmed by how gracefully Rhodopis danced, so he had a special pair of beautiful slippers made for her. Angered by the gift, the other housemaids treated Rhodopis even worse than before.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> A month later, the pharaoh, or ruler, of Egypt announced a great feast. Even servants were invited, as long as they finished their work. However, the housemaids gave Rhodopis so much of their work that she wasn’t able to go.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> Later, while everyone was at the feast, Rhodopis sat alone by the Nile River. “What good are these?” she asked as she pulled the slippers from her feet. Suddenly a falcon flew down and stole one slipper. With a heavy heart, Rhodopis watched as the falcon flew away.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> At the same time that Rhodopis sat on the shore of the river, the pharaoh’s son Amasis sat alone at the great feast. To his surprise a falcon dropped a slipper onto his lap. Amasis knew this was a sign. The maiden who wore the slipper would be his princess.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> The next day Amasis began his search. Women young and old tried on the slipper, but it fit none of them. Soon Amasis arrived at the house where Rhodopis lived. The other housemaids oiled their feet, but still the slipper wouldn’t fit. Then Amasis saw Rhodopis watching from a distance and called her over. The slipper fit perfectly.</p>

            <strong>A Star for a Prince</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> In Persia long ago a girl named Settareh, which means “star,” was born with a star-shaped mark on her cheek. Settareh’s mother died. Later her father married another woman who already had two daughters of her own. Shortly afterward Settareh’s father became ill and died, leaving Settareh to be raised by her stepmother.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> Settareh’s stepmother and stepsisters treated her very unkindly. They took away her fine clothes and made her wear their old clothes. She had to do many of their chores. They let her eat only what was left after they had finished, so she often went hungry.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> One day the family was invited to the prince’s royal ball. The stepmother gave her daughters and Settareh money to buy new dresses in town. While Settareh looked for a dress to buy, she felt weak. As she bought something to eat, she thought, “I will still have enough money for a dress.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> “Please, can you spare some food?” a beggar asked. The beggar looked thin and weak from starvation. Without a thought Settareh spent the rest of her money on food for the beggar.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> “Please take this,” the beggar smiled, offering Settareh a small blue jug. Although it was cracked, Settareh accepted the old woman’s gift.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “Fool!” Settareh’s stepsisters laughed when she returned without a dress. Later they left for the ball without her.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> “If only I had a dress,” Settareh sighed, holding the jug. Suddenly she was wearing a beautiful dress and matching anklets</p>
        <p>around her ankles.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “But how will I get to the ball?” No sooner had Settareh spoken than she was there.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> Fearing her stepmother and stepsisters would see her new dress, Settareh stayed where they wouldn’t notice her. She was sitting alone when the prince walked up and introduced himself. She had a wonderful time talking and laughing with the prince. Then she noticed the time. She fled so she could be home to change before her stepmother and stepsisters arrived.</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> The prince was heartbroken as he watched Settareh leave. As he walked sadly outside the palace, he came across one of her anklets on the ground. He decided that he must find Settareh again and make her his wife. The next day he began his search.</p>
        <p>He asked every woman in the land to try on the anklet, but it was too small. Finally he came to Settareh’s house. Her stepsisters pushed and pushed, but the anklet would not fit. The prince was about to leave when he saw small footprints in the dirt. “Who made these?” he demanded.</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> “I did,” Settareh said from behind her stepsisters. Keeping her head down, she slipped on the anklet. When she looked up at the prince, he recognized the star on her cheek.</p>

            <strong>A Star for a Prince</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> In Persia long ago a girl named Settareh, which means “star,” was born with a star-shaped mark on her cheek. Settareh’s mother died. Later her father married another woman who already had two daughters of her own. Shortly afterward Settareh’s father became ill and died, leaving Settareh to be raised by her stepmother.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> Settareh’s stepmother and stepsisters treated her very unkindly. They took away her fine clothes and made her wear their old clothes. She had to do many of their chores. They let her eat only what was left after they had finished, so she often went hungry.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> One day the family was invited to the prince’s royal ball. The stepmother gave her daughters and Settareh money to buy new dresses in town. While Settareh looked for a dress to buy, she felt weak. As she bought something to eat, she thought, “I will still have enough money for a dress.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> “Please, can you spare some food?” a beggar asked. The beggar looked thin and weak from starvation. Without a thought Settareh spent the rest of her money on food for the beggar.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> “Please take this,” the beggar smiled, offering Settareh a small blue jug. Although it was cracked, Settareh accepted the old woman’s gift.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “Fool!” Settareh’s stepsisters laughed when she returned without a dress. Later they left for the ball without her.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> “If only I had a dress,” Settareh sighed, holding the jug. Suddenly she was wearing a beautiful dress and matching anklets</p>
        <p>around her ankles.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “But how will I get to the ball?” No sooner had Settareh spoken than she was there.</p>

            <strong>A Star for a Prince</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> In Persia long ago a girl named Settareh, which means “star,” was born with a star-shaped mark on her cheek. Settareh’s mother died. Later her father married another woman who already had two daughters of her own. Shortly afterward Settareh’s father became ill and died, leaving Settareh to be raised by her stepmother.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> Settareh’s stepmother and stepsisters treated her very unkindly. They took away her fine clothes and made her wear their old clothes. She had to do many of their chores. They let her eat only what was left after they had finished, so she often went hungry.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> One day the family was invited to the prince’s royal ball. The stepmother gave her daughters and Settareh money to buy new dresses in town. While Settareh looked for a dress to buy, she felt weak. As she bought something to eat, she thought, “I will still have enough money for a dress.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> “Please, can you spare some food?” a beggar asked. The beggar looked thin and weak from starvation. Without a thought Settareh spent the rest of her money on food for the beggar.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> “Please take this,” the beggar smiled, offering Settareh a small blue jug. Although it was cracked, Settareh accepted the old woman’s gift.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “Fool!” Settareh’s stepsisters laughed when she returned without a dress. Later they left for the ball without her.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> “If only I had a dress,” Settareh sighed, holding the jug. Suddenly she was wearing a beautiful dress and matching anklets</p>
        <p>around her ankles.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “But how will I get to the ball?” No sooner had Settareh spoken than she was there.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> Fearing her stepmother and stepsisters would see her new dress, Settareh stayed where they wouldn’t notice her. She was sitting alone when the prince walked up and introduced himself. She had a wonderful time talking and laughing with the prince. Then she noticed the time. She fled so she could be home to change before her stepmother and stepsisters arrived.</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> The prince was heartbroken as he watched Settareh leave. As he walked sadly outside the palace, he came across one of her anklets on the ground. He decided that he must find Settareh again and make her his wife. The next day he began his search.</p>
        <p>He asked every woman in the land to try on the anklet, but it was too small. Finally he came to Settareh’s house. Her stepsisters pushed and pushed, but the anklet would not fit. The prince was about to leave when he saw small footprints in the dirt. “Who made these?” he demanded.</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> “I did,” Settareh said from behind her stepsisters. Keeping her head down, she slipped on the anklet. When she looked up at the prince, he recognized the star on her cheek.</p>

            <strong>Rhodopis and the Slippers</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em>&nbsp;Long ago Rhodopis left her home in Greece and went far away to Egypt, where she worked as a housemaid. Rhodopis didn’t look like the other housemaids, so they often mistreated her.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em>&nbsp;“Rhodopis, make us something to eat! Wash our clothes!” the housemaids screamed. They also blamed Rhodopis for all their mistakes.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em>&nbsp;One day the master of the house saw Rhodopis dancing as she did her work. He was charmed by how gracefully Rhodopis danced, so he had a special pair of beautiful slippers made for her. Angered by the gift, the other housemaids treated Rhodopis even worse than before.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em>&nbsp;A month later, the pharaoh, or ruler, of Egypt announced a great feast. Even servants were invited, as long as they finished their work. However, the housemaids gave Rhodopis so much of their work that she wasn’t able to go.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em>&nbsp;Later, while everyone was at the feast, Rhodopis sat alone by the Nile River. “What good are these?” she asked as she pulled the slippers from her feet. Suddenly a falcon flew down and stole one slipper. With a heavy heart, Rhodopis watched as the falcon flew away.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>6&nbsp;At the same time that Rhodopis sat on the shore of the river, the pharaoh’s son Amasis sat alone at the great feast. To his surprise a falcon dropped a slipper onto his lap. Amasis knew this was a sign. The maiden who wore the slipper would be his princess.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em>&nbsp;The next day Amasis began his search. Women young and old tried on the slipper, but it fit none of them. Soon Amasis arrived at the house where Rhodopis lived. The other housemaids oiled their feet, but still the slipper wouldn’t fit. Then Amasis saw Rhodopis watching from a distance and called her over. The slipper fit perfectly.</p>

            <strong>Rhodopis and the Slippers</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em>&nbsp;Long ago Rhodopis left her home in Greece and went far away to Egypt, where she worked as a housemaid. Rhodopis didn’t look like the other housemaids, so they often mistreated her.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em>&nbsp;“Rhodopis, make us something to eat! Wash our clothes!” the housemaids screamed. They also blamed Rhodopis for all their mistakes.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em>&nbsp;One day the master of the house saw Rhodopis dancing as she did her work. He was charmed by how gracefully Rhodopis danced, so he had a special pair of beautiful slippers made for her. Angered by the gift, the other housemaids treated Rhodopis even worse than before.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em>&nbsp;A month later, the pharaoh, or ruler, of Egypt announced a great feast. Even servants were invited, as long as they finished their work. However, the housemaids gave Rhodopis so much of their work that she wasn’t able to go.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em>&nbsp;Later, while everyone was at the feast, Rhodopis sat alone by the Nile River. “What good are these?” she asked as she pulled the slippers from her feet. Suddenly a falcon flew down and stole one slipper. With a heavy heart, Rhodopis watched as the falcon flew away.</p>

        <p>6&nbsp;At the same time that Rhodopis sat on the shore of the river, the pharaoh’s son Amasis sat alone at the great feast. To his surprise a falcon dropped a slipper onto his lap. Amasis knew this was a sign. The maiden who wore the slipper would be his princess.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em>&nbsp;The next day Amasis began his search. Women young and old tried on the slipper, but it fit none of them. Soon Amasis arrived at the house where Rhodopis lived. The other housemaids oiled their feet, but still the slipper wouldn’t fit. Then Amasis saw Rhodopis watching from a distance and called her over. The slipper fit perfectly.</p>

            <strong>A Star for a Prince</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p><strong><em>1</em></strong> In Persia long ago a girl named Settareh, which means “star,” was born with a star-shaped mark on her cheek. Settareh’s mother died. Later her father married another woman who already had two daughters of her own. Shortly afterward Settareh’s father became ill and died, leaving Settareh to be raised by her stepmother.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> Settareh’s stepmother and stepsisters treated her very unkindly. They took away her fine clothes and made her wear their old clothes. She had to do many of their chores. They let her eat only what was left after they had finished, so she often went hungry.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> One day the family was invited to the prince’s royal ball. The stepmother gave her daughters and Settareh money to buy new dresses in town. While Settareh looked for a dress to buy, she felt weak. As she bought something to eat, she thought, “I will still have enough money for a dress.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> “Please, can you spare some food?” a beggar asked. The beggar looked thin and weak from starvation. Without a thought Settareh spent the rest of her money on food for the beggar.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> “Please take this,” the beggar smiled, offering Settareh a small blue jug. Although it was cracked, Settareh accepted the old woman’s gift.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “Fool!” Settareh’s stepsisters laughed when she returned without a dress. Later they left for the ball without her.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> “If only I had a dress,” Settareh sighed, holding the jug. Suddenly she was wearing a beautiful dress and matching anklets</p>
        <p>around her ankles.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “But how will I get to the ball?” No sooner had Settareh spoken than she was there.</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="95%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766047406/wqdcwzhmshtn1h2f1eta.png" alt="ASS_Y3_EN_12">


        </p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> Fearing her stepmother and stepsisters would see her new dress, Settareh stayed where they wouldn’t notice her. She was sitting alone when the prince walked up and introduced himself. She had a wonderful time talking and laughing with the prince. Then she noticed the time. She fled so she could be home to change before her stepmother and stepsisters arrived.</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> The prince was heartbroken as he watched Settareh leave. As he walked sadly outside the palace, he came across one of her anklets on the ground. He decided that he must find Settareh again and make her his wife. The next day he began his search.</p>
        <p>He asked every woman in the land to try on the anklet, but it was too small. Finally he came to Settareh’s house. Her stepsisters pushed and pushed, but the anklet would not fit. The prince was about to leave when he saw small footprints in the dirt. “Who made these?” he demanded.</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> “I did,” Settareh said from behind her stepsisters. Keeping her head down, she slipped on the anklet. When she looked up at the prince, he recognized the star on her cheek.</p>

          <strong>A School on Rails</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> Anne and Jim were visiting Grandpa. They liked the time after supper when they usually sat and talked. Grandpa often told them stories about the “old days,” when he was a boy. Sometimes his stories were funny. Other times they were sad. Most of his stories were about how things used to be.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> “Last week I found a picture of a school I went to when I was a boy. Let me show it to you.” Grandpa went to his desk and brought back an old, faded photograph.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> Jim looked at it and said, “But, Grandpa, this looks like a train!”</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> “It was my school for a while,” Grandpa said. “Would you like to hear about it?”</p>
        <p><strong><em>5</em></strong> “A school in a train?” asked Anne.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “I have to hear this!” exclaimed Jim.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> Grandpa looked at the picture silently for a moment. “When I was a boy, my father worked for the railroad in Canada,” he began. “His job was to take care of sections of railroad track in remote areas. The workers’ families lived along the tracks in small groups many miles from other towns or people. There was no school. Everyone knew this was a problem, but no one knew what to do about it.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “At last someone had an idea. A railroad car was turned into a schoolroom, and school was brought to us! It stopped at settlements where there were enough children to attend and stayed for several weeks. Then it moved on to the next settlement. There was a teacher on the train who taught the lessons.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> “Where did the teacher live?” asked Jim.</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> “The teacher lived in the railroad car! He had a small kitchen with a sink and stove and a living area with a dining room, bedroom, and bathroom. There was no electricity on the train. A small furnace burned coal to keep the school car warm.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> “It doesn’t look much like a school,” Anne said, looking at the picture again.</p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> “In many ways it was just an ordinary railroad car,” Grandpa said. “It had comfortable cushioned seats and wood-paneled walls lined with windows. However, they did modify some things. The seats were turned to face each other, and a table was put in between each pair. At the front of the car were chalkboards, maps, and a desk for the teacher. Rows of shelves held books and other supplies.</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="100%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766032528/rbwjxenhc2novqsm3uxe.png" alt="ASS_Y3_EN_29">


        </p>
        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> “Our parents didn’t have to make us go to school. We were happy for the chance to go. Any child who was able to get to the school car was allowed to attend, so the school car served the children of loggers, farmers, and miners in the area, too. I had 10 classmates.</p>
        <p><em><strong>14</strong></em> “School lasted from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M., with about an hour for lunch and recess. We learned most of the same lessons as students in regular schools did. The school car stayed for about six weeks. Then it was pushed back onto the main track, hitched to an engine, and pulled to the next settlement. While the school car was away, we did homework. When it returned, we were ready to continue to learn in our school on rails.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>15</strong></em> “Does it still exist?” Anne asked.</p>
        <p><em><strong>16</strong></em> “No,” Grandpa answered. “After a while, things changed. School cars aren’t around any longer. More people moved into the area. New roads were built, and towns were established. Schoolhouses were erected, too. My family moved to a small town. Other families sent their children to school in nearby towns. The school car wasn’t needed anymore.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>17</strong></em> “Too bad,” Jim muttered.</p>
        <p><em><strong>18</strong></em> “Oh, it’s probably for the best,” Grandpa added. “There was too much work for one teacher, and the time between visits was too long. Sometimes the homework was difficult, and no one could help. Still, while it was around, the school car was a special place for many of us.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>19</strong></em> “Do you remember the children in this picture?” Anne asked.</p>
        <p><em><strong>20</strong></em> “Some of them,” answered Grandpa. “But I remember all of those cold Canadian winters! After we do the dishes, I’ll tell you all about them.”</p>
