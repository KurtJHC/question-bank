Is it hard to become an actor? It’s important that you’re prepared for the reality of this business: As an actor, there’s no guarantee of success in the traditional sense. Sure, making it big is about talent—but it’s also about having good luck and the right connections. That’s why it’s vital to make sure you’re in show business for the right reasons. “Often actors are mainly focused on questions like, ‘How do I get representation?’ or ‘How do I get work?’ but perhaps the first question to ask oneself, if one is just beginning, is ‘Why do I want to act?’” says casting director Ilene Starger. “If it’s about the work and the process, terrific; if it’s about becoming famous, that is a far more elusive goal—and one which will lead to disappointment, most likely.” You’ll need patience and perspective if you’re going to make it as an actor. “Never, ever look to the prize,” Academy Award-winner Octavia Spencer says. “That’s something that you can’t control. What you can control is the work ethic and treating the material with respect. It took me 15 years to become an overnight success, so if you’re only at the three-year mark, honey, you’ve got some time.” Expect to put in years of hard work before you see real, tangible results. Rejection is a constant (yes, even for established actors!), so make sure that you can handle a long string of “no’s” before finally landing that coveted “yes.”<br>

There’s a reason the Alexander Technique is the only form of movement training that many drama schools require students to take. It’s an extremely powerful practice of body-mind integration that pays dividends on many levels. If you talk to an Alexander Technique teacher, they’re probably going to speak about the ease of movement and efficiency—both extremely important when it comes to acting. The ability to be vulnerable and fully engaged in a situation is essential to crafting a memorable performance. According to Wood, the Alexander Technique allows actors to do both—its tension-releasing methods prepare you before the performance and keep you open to physical spontaneity during it. “The characters we play have needs, and we need to embody these needs and then take up the character’s struggle to get those needs met,” Wood says. “The technique’s capacity to help us become more emotionally available on the one hand and to assert ourselves without overexerting on the other are gifts any actor can derive enormous benefit from for fuller, richer, more memorable work. It’s reason enough for budding actors to sign up for the training. I mean, why wouldn’t they?”<br>

Whether they started their career on our local shores or took the plunge in Hollywood, what you may not know about some of your favourites is that they do not come from America or Britain. In fact, they come from the land Down Under. Although Russell Crowe was born in New Zealand, he grew up in Australia and now identifies as a proud Aussie – sorry NZ! This actor, film producer, and musician is one of Australia’s most recognised actors, having received four major awards including the Academy Award and the Empire Award for Best Actor for his performance in Gladiator (2000). Crowe has also appeared in Robin Hood (2010) and 2016’s The Nice Guys. Since making her film debut in 1983, Nicole Kidman has amassed 80 acting credits including critically acclaimed roles in Moulin Rouge, The Others, The Hours and Cold Mountain. Most recently the Hawaiian born, Australian actress has been commended for her work in the biographical drama Lion and HBO mini-series Big Little Lies. The actress has received four Oscar nominations, and in 2002 she won an Oscar and a BAFTA award for her portrayal of Virginia Woolf in The Hours. Kidman currently has two films in post-production and is filming the crime thriller Destroyer.<br>

If I want to be an actor, should I take a survival job? You likely won’t be making a liveable wage as an actor straight out of the gate. That’s where a "survival job" comes in. Walking dogs, tutoring, babysitting, waiting tables—it’s unlikely these are your passions in life, but work with flexible schedules and non-set hours is key to finding time for auditions and casting calls. It’s also important that you don’t hate your survival job! If you spend most of your day dreading going back to work, that’s a mental drain that will make it more difficult to nail your auditions. The restaurant industry is an old standby for survival jobs—you could be a server, host, bartender, maître d', barback, cater waiter, or barista. But the growing gig economy has widened the possibilities when it comes to survival jobs. Driving for Uber or Lyft is one possibility, assuming you own a car; serving as a virtual assistant on Upwork or Fiverr are also options. But not every job is a survival job! Full-time jobs obviously offer more financial security, but if you’re working in a traditional 9-to-5 office, it’s going to be almost impossible to show up to daytime casting calls and auditions.</p>
