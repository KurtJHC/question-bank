          <strong>The Prison Healer <em>by Lynette Noni</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Kiva had been barely seven years old when she’d first arrived, but her age hadn’t protected her from the brutality of prison life. She more than anyone knew that her breaths were numbered. No one survived Zalindov. It was only a matter of time before she joined the multitudes who had gone before her.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She was lucky, she knew, compared to many. Those assigned to the hard labor rarely lasted six months. A year, at most. But she’d never had to suffer through such debilitating work. In the early weeks after her arrival, Kiva had been allocated a job in the entrance block, where she’d sorted through the clothes and possessions taken from new inmates.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Later, when a different position had needed filling — due to a lethal outbreak that took hundreds of lives — she was sent to the workrooms and tasked with cleaning and repairing the guards’ uniforms. Her fingers had bled and blistered from the unending laundry and needlecraft, but even then, she’d had little reason to complain, <span class="txt-underline"><strong>comparatively</strong></span>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Kiva had been dreading the order for her to join the laborers, but the summons never came. Instead, after saving the life of a guard with a blood infection by advising him to use a poultice she’d seen her father make countless times, she had earned herself a place in the infirmary as a healer. Nearly two years later, the only other inmate working in the infirmary died, leaving the then twelve-year-old Kiva to step into his role. With it came the responsibility of carving Zalindov’s symbol into the new arrivals, something that, to this day, Kiva despised. However, she knew that if she refused to mark them, both she and the new prisoners would suffer the wrath of the guards. She’d learned that early on — and bore the scars on her back as a reminder. She would have been flogged to death had there been anyone skilled enough to replace her at the time. Now, however, there were others who could take up her mantle.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She was expendable, just like everyone else at Zalindov.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The boy’s hair was a choppy mess when Kiva finally set the shears aside and reached for the razor. Sometimes it was enough to just cut away the tangles; other times, new arrivals came with matted, lice-infested locks, and it was best to shave it all off, rather than risk a plague of the small beasts spreading around the compound.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Don’t worry, it’ll grow back,” Kiva said gently, thinking of her own hair, black as night, that had been shorn upon her arrival yet now fell well down her back.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Despite her attempted comfort, the boy continued trembling, making it harder for her to avoid grazing him as she swiped the razor over his scalp.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Kiva wanted to tell him what he would face once he left the infirmary, but even if the guard hadn’t been watching closely from the doorway, she knew that wasn’t her place. New prisoners were partnered with another inmate for their first few days, and it was that person’s responsibility to offer an introduction to Zalindov, to share warnings and reveal ways to stay alive. If, of course, that was desired. Some people arrived wanting to die, their hope already crumbled before they stepped through the iron gates and into the soulless limestone walls.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Kiva hoped this boy still had some fight left in him. He would need it to get through all that was coming.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Done,” she said, lowering the razor and stepping around to face him. He looked younger without his hair, all wide eyes, hollowed cheeks, and protruding ears. “That wasn’t so bad, was it?”</p>

However, she knew that if she refused to mark them, both she and the new prisoners would suffer the wrath of the guards. She’d learned that early on — and bore the scars on her back as a reminder. She would have been flogged to death had there been anyone skilled enough to replace her at the time. Now, however, there were others who could take up her mantle.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She was expendable, just like everyone else at Zalindov.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The boy’s hair was a choppy mess when Kiva finally set the shears aside and reached for the razor. Sometimes it was enough to just cut away the tangles; other times, new arrivals came with matted, lice-infested locks, and it was best to shave it all off, rather than risk a plague of the small beasts spreading around the compound.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Don’t worry, it’ll grow back,” Kiva said gently, thinking of her own hair, black as night, that had been shorn upon her arrival yet now fell well down her back.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Despite her attempted comfort, the boy continued trembling, making it harder for her to avoid grazing him as she swiped the razor over his scalp.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Kiva wanted to tell him what he would face once he left the infirmary, but even if the guard hadn’t been watching closely from the doorway, she knew that wasn’t her place. New prisoners were partnered with another inmate for their first few days, and it was that person’s responsibility to offer an introduction to Zalindov, to share warnings and reveal ways to stay alive. If, of course, that was desired. Some people arrived wanting to die, their hope already crumbled before they stepped through the iron gates and into the soulless limestone walls.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Kiva hoped this boy still had some fight left in him. He would need it to get through all that was coming.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Done,” she said, lowering the razor and stepping around to face him. He looked younger without his hair, all wide eyes, hollowed cheeks, and protruding ears. “That wasn’t so bad, was it?”</p>

          <strong>The Prison Healer <em>by Lynette Noni</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Kiva had been barely seven years old when she’d first arrived, but her age hadn’t protected her from the brutality of prison life. She more than anyone knew that her breaths were numbered. No one survived Zalindov. It was only a matter of time before she joined the multitudes who had gone before her.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She was lucky, she knew, compared to many. Those assigned to the hard labor rarely lasted six months. A year, at most. But she’d never had to suffer through such debilitating work. In the early weeks after her arrival, Kiva had been allocated a job in the entrance block, where she’d sorted through the clothes and possessions taken from new inmates.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Later, when a different position had needed filling — due to a lethal outbreak that took hundreds of lives — she was sent to the workrooms and tasked with cleaning and repairing the guards’ uniforms. Her fingers had bled and blistered from the unending laundry and needlecraft, but even then, she’d had little reason to complain, <span class="txt-underline"><strong>comparatively</strong></span>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Kiva had been dreading the order for her to join the laborers, but the summons never came. Instead, after saving the life of a guard with a blood infection by advising him to use a poultice she’d seen her father make countless times, she had earned herself a place in the infirmary as a healer. Nearly two years later, the only other inmate working in the infirmary died, leaving the then twelve-year-old Kiva to step into his role. With it came the responsibility of carving Zalindov’s symbol into the new arrivals, something that, to this day, Kiva despised. However, she knew that if she refused to mark them, both she and the new prisoners would suffer the wrath of the guards. She’d learned that early on — and bore the scars on her back as a reminder. She would have been flogged to death had there been anyone skilled enough to replace her at the time. Now, however, there were others who could take up her mantle.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>In Summer&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Oh, summer has clothed the earth&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In a cloak from the loom of the sun!&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And a mantle, too, of the skies' soft blue,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And a belt where the rivers run.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And now for the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>kiss</strong></span> of the wind,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And the touch of the air's <span class="txt-underline"><strong>soft hands</strong></span>,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With the rest from strife and the heat of life,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With the freedom of lakes and lands.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I envy the farmer's boy&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Who sings as he follows the plow;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>While the shining green of the young blades lean&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To the breezes that cool his brow.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He sings to the dewy morn,&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span class="txt-underline"><strong>No thought of another's ear</strong></span>;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But the song he sings is a chant for kings&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And the whole wide world to hear.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He sings of the joys of life,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Of the pleasures of work and rest,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>From an o'erfull heart, without aim or art;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'T is a song of the merriest.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>O ye who toil in the town,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And ye who moil in the mart,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Hear the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>artless</strong></span> song, and your faith made strong&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Shall renew your joy of heart.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Oh, poor were the worth of the world&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If never a song were heard,—&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If the sting of grief had no relief,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And never a heart were stirred.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So, long as the streams run down,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And as long as the robins trill,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Let us taunt old Care with a merry air,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And sing in the face of ill.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>In Summer&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Oh, summer has clothed the earth&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In a cloak from the loom of the sun!&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And a mantle, too, of the skies' soft blue,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And a belt where the rivers run.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And now for the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>kiss</strong></span> of the wind,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And the touch of the air's <span class="txt-underline"><strong>soft hands</strong></span>,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With the rest from strife and the heat of life,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With the freedom of lakes and lands.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I envy the farmer's boy&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Who sings as he follows the plow;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>While the shining green of the young blades lean&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To the breezes that cool his brow.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He sings to the dewy morn,&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span class="txt-underline"><strong>No thought of another's ear</strong></span>;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But the song he sings is a chant for kings&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And the whole wide world to hear.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He sings of the joys of life,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Of the pleasures of work and rest,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>From an o'erfull heart, without aim or art;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'T is a song of the merriest.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>O ye who toil in the town,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And ye who moil in the mart,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Hear the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>artless</strong></span> song, and your faith made strong&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Shall renew your joy of heart.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Oh, poor were the worth of the world&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If never a song were heard,—&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If the sting of grief had no relief,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And never a heart were stirred.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So, long as the streams run down,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And as long as the robins trill,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Let us taunt old Care with a merry air,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And sing in the face of ill.</p>

          <em>Read the poem below by Paul Laurence Dunbar then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>In Summer&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Oh, summer has clothed the earth&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In a cloak from the loom of the sun!&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And a mantle, too, of the skies' soft blue,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And a belt where the rivers run.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And now for the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>kiss</strong></span> of the wind,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And the touch of the air's <span class="txt-underline"><strong>soft hands</strong></span>,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With the rest from strife and the heat of life,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With the freedom of lakes and lands.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I envy the farmer's boy&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Who sings as he follows the plow;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>While the shining green of the young blades lean&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To the breezes that cool his brow.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He sings to the dewy morn,&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span class="txt-underline"><strong>No thought of another's ear</strong></span>;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But the song he sings is a chant for kings&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And the whole wide world to hear.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He sings of the joys of life,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Of the pleasures of work and rest,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>From an o'erfull heart, without aim or art;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'T is a song of the merriest.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>O ye who toil in the town,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And ye who moil in the mart,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Hear the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>artless</strong></span> song, and your faith made strong&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Shall renew your joy of heart.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Oh, poor were the worth of the world&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If never a song were heard,—&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If the sting of grief had no relief,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And never a heart were stirred.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So, long as the streams run down,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And as long as the robins trill,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Let us taunt old Care with a merry air,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And sing in the face of ill.</p>

          <strong>How Are Blow Moulded Plastic Bottles Made?&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic is a durable, lightweight plastic often used to make containers for the food and beverage, pharmaceutical and personal care industries. <strong>12 ………. </strong>In 1941, PET was developed by chemists at DuPont, but it took until the 1970s for the plastic bottle to be popularised.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>An engineer for the DuPont Corporation, Nathaniel C. Wyeth, developed the first plastic bottle after years of experimenting. <strong>13 ………. </strong>Wyeth conquered long-running problems— <strong>14 ………. </strong>—with blow-molding plastics, and solidified a process that creates a wellstructured, durable plastic bottle.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Since then, billions of bottles are being manufactured each year, leading to an increase in community recycling programs around the United States to curb landfill growth and increase re-use of the material. <strong>15 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>PET bottles are typically created using one of the three blow molding processes listed below.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Injection Blow Moulding&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Ideal for smaller plastic bottles, the Injection Blow Moulding process can be used to mould a wide variety of polymers including PET and HDPE.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Extrusion Blow Moulding&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>The Extrusion Blow Moulding process involves extruding a melted plastic polymer, typically HDPE or LDPE into a hollow tube or “Parison”. During the Extrusion Shuttle Blow Moulding process two moulds shuttle back and forth to capture a continuously extruded parison.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Injection Stretch Blow Moulding Process&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>A wide variety of bottles, jars, and other containers can be moulded using the versatile Injection Stretch Blow Moulding Process. <strong>16 ………. </strong>or saved as stock for later use in the 2-Step method</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Inspection Process</p>
        <p>Rigorous testing is performed on PET bottles as the last step in the manufacturing line before packing, ensuring they meet industry standards. <strong>17 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;• Impact-resistance testing</p>
        <p>&nbsp;• Pressure testing</p>
        <p>&nbsp;• Permeability testing</p>
        <p>&nbsp;• Transparency inspection</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Manufacturers also test to ensure there is consistency in the size, shape, and finish of the end product before packaging and shipping to the final destination.</p>

          <strong>How Are Blow Moulded Plastic Bottles Made?&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic is a durable, lightweight plastic often used to make containers for the food and beverage, pharmaceutical and personal care industries. <strong>12 ………. </strong>In 1941, PET was developed by chemists at DuPont, but it took until the 1970s for the plastic bottle to be popularised.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>An engineer for the DuPont Corporation, Nathaniel C. Wyeth, developed the first plastic bottle after years of experimenting. <strong>13 ………. </strong>Wyeth conquered long-running problems— <strong>14 ………. </strong>—with blow-molding plastics, and solidified a process that creates a wellstructured, durable plastic bottle.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Since then, billions of bottles are being manufactured each year, leading to an increase in community recycling programs around the United States to curb landfill growth and increase re-use of the material. <strong>15 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>PET bottles are typically created using one of the three blow molding processes listed below.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Injection Blow Moulding&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Ideal for smaller plastic bottles, the Injection Blow Moulding process can be used to mould a wide variety of polymers including PET and HDPE.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Extrusion Blow Moulding&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>The Extrusion Blow Moulding process involves extruding a melted plastic polymer, typically HDPE or LDPE into a hollow tube or “Parison”. During the Extrusion Shuttle Blow Moulding process two moulds shuttle back and forth to capture a continuously extruded parison.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Injection Stretch Blow Moulding Process&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>A wide variety of bottles, jars, and other containers can be moulded using the versatile Injection Stretch Blow Moulding Process. <strong>16 ………. </strong>or saved as stock for later use in the 2-Step method</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Inspection Process</p>
        <p>Rigorous testing is performed on PET bottles as the last step in the manufacturing line before packing, ensuring they meet industry standards. <strong>17 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;• Impact-resistance testing</p>
        <p>&nbsp;• Pressure testing</p>
        <p>&nbsp;• Permeability testing</p>
        <p>&nbsp;• Transparency inspection</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Manufacturers also test to ensure there is consistency in the size, shape, and finish of the end product before packaging and shipping to the final destination.</p>

          <strong>How Are Blow Moulded Plastic Bottles Made?&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic is a durable, lightweight plastic often used to make containers for the food and beverage, pharmaceutical and personal care industries. <strong>12 ………. </strong>In 1941, PET was developed by chemists at DuPont, but it took until the 1970s for the plastic bottle to be popularised.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>An engineer for the DuPont Corporation, Nathaniel C. Wyeth, developed the first plastic bottle after years of experimenting. <strong>13 ………. </strong>Wyeth conquered long-running problems— <strong>14 ………. </strong>—with blow-molding plastics, and solidified a process that creates a wellstructured, durable plastic bottle.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Since then, billions of bottles are being manufactured each year, leading to an increase in community recycling programs around the United States to curb landfill growth and increase re-use of the material. <strong>15 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>PET bottles are typically created using one of the three blow molding processes listed below.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Injection Blow Moulding&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Ideal for smaller plastic bottles, the Injection Blow Moulding process can be used to mould a wide variety of polymers including PET and HDPE.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Extrusion Blow Moulding&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>The Extrusion Blow Moulding process involves extruding a melted plastic polymer, typically HDPE or LDPE into a hollow tube or “Parison”. During the Extrusion Shuttle Blow Moulding process two moulds shuttle back and forth to capture a continuously extruded parison.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Injection Stretch Blow Moulding Process&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>A wide variety of bottles, jars, and other containers can be moulded using the versatile Injection Stretch Blow Moulding Process. <strong>16 ………. </strong>or saved as stock for later use in the 2-Step method</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Inspection Process</p>
        <p>Rigorous testing is performed on PET bottles as the last step in the manufacturing line before packing, ensuring they meet industry standards. <strong>17 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;• Impact-resistance testing</p>
        <p>&nbsp;• Pressure testing</p>
        <p>&nbsp;• Permeability testing</p>
        <p>&nbsp;• Transparency inspection</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Manufacturers also test to ensure there is consistency in the size, shape, and finish of the end product before packaging and shipping to the final destination.</p>

          <strong>How Are Blow Moulded Plastic Bottles Made?&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic is a durable, lightweight plastic often used to make containers for the food and beverage, pharmaceutical and personal care industries. <strong>12 ………. </strong>In 1941, PET was developed by chemists at DuPont, but it took until the 1970s for the plastic bottle to be popularised.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>An engineer for the DuPont Corporation, Nathaniel C. Wyeth, developed the first plastic bottle after years of experimenting. <strong>13 ………. </strong>Wyeth conquered long-running problems— <strong>14 ………. </strong>—with blow-molding plastics, and solidified a process that creates a wellstructured, durable plastic bottle.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Since then, billions of bottles are being manufactured each year, leading to an increase in community recycling programs around the United States to curb landfill growth and increase re-use of the material. <strong>15 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>PET bottles are typically created using one of the three blow molding processes listed below.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Injection Blow Moulding&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Ideal for smaller plastic bottles, the Injection Blow Moulding process can be used to mould a wide variety of polymers including PET and HDPE.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Extrusion Blow Moulding&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>The Extrusion Blow Moulding process involves extruding a melted plastic polymer, typically HDPE or LDPE into a hollow tube or “Parison”. During the Extrusion Shuttle Blow Moulding process two moulds shuttle back and forth to capture a continuously extruded parison.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Injection Stretch Blow Moulding Process&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>A wide variety of bottles, jars, and other containers can be moulded using the versatile Injection Stretch Blow Moulding Process. <strong>16 ………. </strong>or saved as stock for later use in the 2-Step method</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Inspection Process</p>
        <p>Rigorous testing is performed on PET bottles as the last step in the manufacturing line before packing, ensuring they meet industry standards. <strong>17 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;• Impact-resistance testing</p>
        <p>&nbsp;• Pressure testing</p>
        <p>&nbsp;• Permeability testing</p>
        <p>&nbsp;• Transparency inspection</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Manufacturers also test to ensure there is consistency in the size, shape, and finish of the end product before packaging and shipping to the final destination.</p>

Chances are you’ve heard someone talk about an “authentic recipe” or an “authentic dish” at some point. In fact, during conversations about cooking, the word authenticity is usually hard to avoid. But what does “authentic cooking” really mean? Does the meaning change depending on who you talk to?<br>
<br>
Our recent research explored the meaning of “authentic cooking” across different cultural groups. We wanted to understand cooking behaviors and the role that authenticity plays in the kitchen. We also looked into food fusion and whether it affects the authenticity of a dish.<br>
<br>
{^ <strong>Extract B</strong> ^}<br>
Sixty-six percent of Hispanics cook authentic meals at least once a week, compared to 57% of Asians, 48% of African Americans and 43% of non-Hispanic white consumers. Non-Hispanic white and African American consumers tend to choose quick-prep dishes, especially during the week.<br>
<br>
Hispanics are also more likely to use clay pots, blenders, mortars and pestles, dry rubs and dehydrating methods. On the other hand, white consumers are more likely to use slow cookers, African Americans are more apt to use deep fryers and Asians tend to use rice cookers and fermentation methods more often.<br>
<br>
{^ <strong>Extract C</strong> ^}<br>
Multicultural consumers consider a brand to be authentic when it reminds them of their “home” culture or country. For Non-Hispanic white consumers, an authentic brand is one that has remained unchanged through time. However, it’s important for consumers to cook with brands that they trust.<br>
<br>
{^ <strong>Extract D</strong> ^}<br>
Most respondents, across ethnicities, aren’t cooking fusion dishes at home. When they do, however, they tend to fuse their culture with another one, rather than fusing two cuisines that are unrelated to them. Consumers seem to be open to trying fusion in food, but feel intimidated when it comes to actually cooking it. They find confidence in fusion recipes in packaging, showcasing recipes online, publishing online videos and tutorials.</div>

            <p>Chances are you’ve heard someone talk about an “authentic recipe” or an “authentic dish” at some point. In fact, during conversations about cooking, the word authenticity is usually hard to avoid. But what does “authentic cooking” really mean? Does the meaning change depending on who you talk to?&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Our recent research explored the meaning of “authentic cooking” across different cultural groups. We wanted to understand cooking behaviors and the role that authenticity plays in the kitchen. We also looked into food fusion and whether it affects the authenticity of a dish.</p>

            <p>Sixty-six percent of Hispanics cook authentic meals at least once a week, compared to 57% of Asians, 48% of African Americans and 43% of non-Hispanic white consumers.

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Hispanics are also more likely to use clay pots, blenders, mortars and pestles, dry rubs and dehydrating methods. On the other hand, white consumers are more likely to use slow cookers, African Americans are more apt to use deep fryers and Asians tend to use rice cookers and fermentation methods more often.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>The Prison Healer <em>by Lynette Noni</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Kiva had been barely seven years old when she’d first arrived, but her age hadn’t protected her from the brutality of prison life. She more than anyone knew that her breaths were numbered. No one survived Zalindov. It was only a matter of time before she joined the multitudes who had gone before her.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She was lucky, she knew, compared to many. Those assigned to the hard labor rarely lasted six months. A year, at most. But she’d never had to suffer through such debilitating work. In the early weeks after her arrival, Kiva had been allocated a job in the entrance block, where she’d sorted through the clothes and possessions taken from new inmates.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Later, when a different position had needed filling — due to a lethal outbreak that took hundreds of lives — she was sent to the workrooms and tasked with cleaning and repairing the guards’ uniforms. Her fingers had bled and blistered from the unending laundry and needlecraft, but even then, she’d had little reason to complain, <span class="txt-underline"><strong>comparatively</strong></span>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Kiva had been dreading the order for her to join the laborers, but the summons never came. Instead, after saving the life of a guard with a blood infection by advising him to use a poultice she’d seen her father make countless times, she had earned herself a place in the infirmary as a healer. Nearly two years later, the only other inmate working in the infirmary died, leaving the then twelve-year-old Kiva to step into his role. With it came the responsibility of carving Zalindov’s symbol into the new arrivals, something that, to this day, Kiva despised. However, she knew that if she refused to mark them, both she and the new prisoners would suffer the wrath of the guards. She’d learned that early on — and bore the scars on her back as a reminder. She would have been flogged to death had there been anyone skilled enough to replace her at the time. Now, however, there were others who could take up her mantle.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She was expendable, just like everyone else at Zalindov.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The boy’s hair was a choppy mess when Kiva finally set the shears aside and reached for the razor. Sometimes it was enough to just cut away the tangles; other times, new arrivals came with matted, lice-infested locks, and it was best to shave it all off, rather than risk a plague of the small beasts spreading around the compound.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Don’t worry, it’ll grow back,” Kiva said gently, thinking of her own hair, black as night, that had been shorn upon her arrival yet now fell well down her back.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Despite her attempted comfort, the boy continued trembling, making it harder for her to avoid grazing him as she swiped the razor over his scalp.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Kiva wanted to tell him what he would face once he left the infirmary, but even if the guard hadn’t been watching closely from the doorway, she knew that wasn’t her place. New prisoners were partnered with another inmate for their first few days, and it was that person’s responsibility to offer an introduction to Zalindov, to share warnings and reveal ways to stay alive. If, of course, that was desired. Some people arrived wanting to die, their hope already crumbled before they stepped through the iron gates and into the soulless limestone walls.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Kiva hoped this boy still had some fight left in him. He would need it to get through all that was coming.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Done,” she said, lowering the razor and stepping around to face him. He looked younger without his hair, all wide eyes, hollowed cheeks, and protruding ears. “That wasn’t so bad, was it?”</p>

          <strong>The Prison Healer <em>by Lynette Noni</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Kiva had been barely seven years old when she’d first arrived, but her age hadn’t protected her from the brutality of prison life. She more than anyone knew that her breaths were numbered. No one survived Zalindov. It was only a matter of time before she joined the multitudes who had gone before her.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She was lucky, she knew, compared to many. Those assigned to the hard labor rarely lasted six months. A year, at most. But she’d never had to suffer through such debilitating work. In the early weeks after her arrival, Kiva had been allocated a job in the entrance block, where she’d sorted through the clothes and possessions taken from new inmates.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Later, when a different position had needed filling — due to a lethal outbreak that took hundreds of lives — she was sent to the workrooms and tasked with cleaning and repairing the guards’ uniforms. Her fingers had bled and blistered from the unending laundry and needlecraft, but even then, she’d had little reason to complain, <span class="txt-underline"><strong>comparatively</strong></span>.</p>

          <strong>The Prison Healer <em>by Lynette Noni</em></strong>

        <p>Kiva had been barely seven years old when she’d first arrived, but her age hadn’t protected her from the brutality of prison life. She more than anyone knew that her breaths were numbered. No one survived Zalindov. It was only a matter of time before she joined the multitudes who had gone before her.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Kiva had been dreading the order for her to join the laborers, but the summons never came. Instead, after saving the life of a guard with a blood infection by advising him to use a poultice she’d seen her father make countless times, she had earned herself a place in the infirmary as a healer. Nearly two years later, the only other inmate working in the infirmary died, leaving the then twelve-year-old Kiva to step into his role. With it came the responsibility of carving Zalindov’s symbol into the new arrivals, something that, to this day, Kiva despised.

        <p>The boy’s hair was a choppy mess when Kiva finally set the shears aside and reached for the razor. Sometimes it was enough to just cut away the tangles; other times, new arrivals came with matted, lice-infested locks, and it was best to shave it all off, rather than risk a plague of the small beasts spreading around the compound.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>The Prison Healer <em>by Lynette Noni</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Kiva had been barely seven years old when she’d first arrived, but her age hadn’t protected her from the brutality of prison life. She more than anyone knew that her breaths were numbered. No one survived Zalindov. It was only a matter of time before she joined the multitudes who had gone before her.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She was lucky, she knew, compared to many. Those assigned to the hard labor rarely lasted six months. A year, at most. But she’d never had to suffer through such debilitating work. In the early weeks after her arrival, Kiva had been allocated a job in the entrance block, where she’d sorted through the clothes and possessions taken from new inmates.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Later, when a different position had needed filling — due to a lethal outbreak that took hundreds of lives — she was sent to the workrooms and tasked with cleaning and repairing the guards’ uniforms. Her fingers had bled and blistered from the unending laundry and needlecraft, but even then, she’d had little reason to complain, <span class="txt-underline"><strong>comparatively</strong></span>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Kiva had been dreading the order for her to join the laborers, but the summons never came. Instead, after saving the life of a guard with a blood infection by advising him to use a poultice she’d seen her father make countless times, she had earned herself a place in the infirmary as a healer. Nearly two years later, the only other inmate working in the infirmary died, leaving the then twelve-year-old Kiva to step into his role. With it came the responsibility of carving Zalindov’s symbol into the new arrivals, something that, to this day, Kiva despised. However, she knew that if she refused to mark them, both she and the new prisoners would suffer the wrath of the guards. She’d learned that early on — and bore the scars on her back as a reminder. She would have been flogged to death had there been anyone skilled enough to replace her at the time. Now, however, there were others who could take up her mantle.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She was expendable, just like everyone else at Zalindov.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The boy’s hair was a choppy mess when Kiva finally set the shears aside and reached for the razor. Sometimes it was enough to just cut away the tangles; other times, new arrivals came with matted, lice-infested locks, and it was best to shave it all off, rather than risk a plague of the small beasts spreading around the compound.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Don’t worry, it’ll grow back,” Kiva said gently, thinking of her own hair, black as night, that had been shorn upon her arrival yet now fell well down her back.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Despite her attempted comfort, the boy continued trembling, making it harder for her to avoid grazing him as she swiped the razor over his scalp.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Kiva wanted to tell him what he would face once he left the infirmary, but even if the guard hadn’t been watching closely from the doorway, she knew that wasn’t her place. New prisoners were partnered with another inmate for their first few days, and it was that person’s responsibility to offer an introduction to Zalindov, to share warnings and reveal ways to stay alive. If, of course, that was desired. Some people arrived wanting to die, their hope already crumbled before they stepped through the iron gates and into the soulless limestone walls.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Kiva hoped this boy still had some fight left in him. He would need it to get through all that was coming.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>The Prison Healer <em>by Lynette Noni</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Kiva had been barely seven years old when she’d first arrived, but her age hadn’t protected her from the brutality of prison life. She more than anyone knew that her breaths were numbered. No one survived Zalindov. It was only a matter of time before she joined the multitudes who had gone before her.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She was lucky, she knew, compared to many. Those assigned to the hard labor rarely lasted six months. A year, at most. But she’d never had to suffer through such debilitating work. In the early weeks after her arrival, Kiva had been allocated a job in the entrance block, where she’d sorted through the clothes and possessions taken from new inmates.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Later, when a different position had needed filling — due to a lethal outbreak that took hundreds of lives — she was sent to the workrooms and tasked with cleaning and repairing the guards’ uniforms. Her fingers had bled and blistered from the unending laundry and needlecraft, but even then, she’d had little reason to complain, <span class="txt-underline"><strong>comparatively</strong></span>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Kiva had been dreading the order for her to join the laborers, but the summons never came. Instead, after saving the life of a guard with a blood infection by advising him to use a poultice she’d seen her father make countless times, she had earned herself a place in the infirmary as a healer. Nearly two years later, the only other inmate working in the infirmary died, leaving the then twelve-year-old Kiva to step into his role. With it came the responsibility of carving Zalindov’s symbol into the new arrivals, something that, to this day, Kiva despised. However, she knew that if she refused to mark them, both she and the new prisoners would suffer the wrath of the guards. She’d learned that early on — and bore the scars on her back as a reminder. She would have been flogged to death had there been anyone skilled enough to replace her at the time. Now, however, there were others who could take up her mantle.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She was expendable, just like everyone else at Zalindov.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The boy’s hair was a choppy mess when Kiva finally set the shears aside and reached for the razor. Sometimes it was enough to just cut away the tangles; other times, new arrivals came with matted, lice-infested locks, and it was best to shave it all off, rather than risk a plague of the small beasts spreading around the compound.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Don’t worry, it’ll grow back,” Kiva said gently, thinking of her own hair, black as night, that had been shorn upon her arrival yet now fell well down her back.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Despite her attempted comfort, the boy continued trembling, making it harder for her to avoid grazing him as she swiped the razor over his scalp.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Kiva wanted to tell him what he would face once he left the infirmary, but even if the guard hadn’t been watching closely from the doorway, she knew that wasn’t her place. New prisoners were partnered with another inmate for their first few days, and it was that person’s responsibility to offer an introduction to Zalindov, to share warnings and reveal ways to stay alive. If, of course, that was desired. Some people arrived wanting to die, their hope already crumbled before they stepped through the iron gates and into the soulless limestone walls.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Kiva hoped this boy still had some fight left in him. He would need it to get through all that was coming.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Done,” she said, lowering the razor and stepping around to face him. He looked younger without his hair, all wide eyes, hollowed cheeks, and protruding ears. “That wasn’t so bad, was it?”</p>
