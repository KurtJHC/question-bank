          <strong>Shebu and the Long-Haired Goat</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> Shebu was a gentle young man who lived with his parents. He was very quiet and seemed to live in a world of his own. Though he was happy, his parents worried about him. They were growing old. How would he make his way in the world? The time had come to send him out on his own.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> On Shebu’s eighteenth birthday, his father gave him a beautiful goat named Moonlight. The goat had long, silky, white fur. Father said, “Take this goat. You must never hurt the goat or sell her—but, if you are wise, she can help you earn money. When you come home, you should have gold coins in your pocket.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> Shebu’s mother gave him a bundle of food. With tears in their eyes, Shebu’s parents sent him on his way. Shebu walked through the forest, Moonlight always at his side. In grassy fields Moonlight ate without worries, but Shebu could not live on grass. As his food ran out, Shebu became concerned. The time had come to think about earning money for his living. How could he earn his way in the world?</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> One day Shebu and Moonlight found a river, and beside the river were several young ladies. One of them approached Shebu and offered him water from a cup. Gratefully he drank the water and thanked her, asking her what her name was. She told him that her name was Junali, meaning “night of shining stars”.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> “Your goat has beautiful fur,” said Junali. “Its silky hairs are like the strands I have seen in the finest of rugs.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “Where do they make these rugs?” asked Shebu.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> “In the big village down the road,” she replied.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> Thanking her, Shebu took Moonlight several miles down the road to the big village. An idea had taken shape in the young man’s mind. Upon arriving in the town, he asked where he could find the barber. The barber cut off Moonlight’s fur, and Shebu gathered the silken hairs together and took them to the shop of the nearest weaver of rugs.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> As they made their way home, Moonlight danced and pranced in the meadows. Without her heavy coat, she felt cool and light. Shebu was not worried. He knew that by the time the cold of winter came, her long white hair would be regrown.</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> Shebu’s parents greeted him with great joy when he returned. Not only was he safe and wealthy, but he had proven he could take care of himself. They were happy about his new circumstances. He’d found his way and returned with gold too!</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> Shebu always remembered Junali, who had helped him simply by noticing the beauty of his goat’s fur. Later he would meet Junali again—but that, my friend, is another story.</p>

        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> On Shebu’s eighteenth birthday, his father gave him a beautiful goat named Moonlight. The goat had long, silky, white fur. Father said, “Take this goat.

        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> “In the big village down the road,” she replied.</p>

          <strong>Shebu and the Long-Haired Goat</strong>

Though he was happy, his parents worried about him. They were growing old. How would he make his way in the world? The time had come to send him out on his own.</p>

You must never hurt the goat or sell her—but, if you are wise, she can help you earn money. When you come home, you should have gold coins in your pocket.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> Shebu’s mother gave him a bundle of food. With tears in their eyes, Shebu’s parents sent him on his way. Shebu walked through the forest, Moonlight always at his side. In grassy fields Moonlight ate without worries, but Shebu could not live on grass. As his food ran out, Shebu became concerned. The time had come to think about earning money for his living. How could he earn his way in the world?</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> One day Shebu and Moonlight found a river, and beside the river were several young ladies. One of them approached Shebu and offered him water from a cup. Gratefully he drank the water and thanked her, asking her what her name was. She told him that her name was Junali, meaning “night of shining stars”.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> “Your goat has beautiful fur,” said Junali. “Its silky hairs are like the strands I have seen in the finest of rugs.”</p>

Upon arriving in the town, he asked where he could find the barber. The barber cut off Moonlight’s fur, and Shebu gathered the silken hairs together and took them to the shop of the nearest weaver of rugs.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> As they made their way home, Moonlight danced and pranced in the meadows. Without her heavy coat, she felt cool and light. Shebu was not worried. He knew that by the time the cold of winter came, her long white hair would be regrown.</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> Shebu’s parents greeted him with great joy when he returned. Not only was he safe and wealthy, but he had proven he could take care of himself. They were happy about his new circumstances. He’d found his way and returned with gold too!</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> Shebu always remembered Junali, who had helped him simply by noticing the beauty of his goat’s fur. Later he would meet Junali again—but that, my friend, is another story.</p>

          <strong>Shebu and the Long-Haired Goat</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> Shebu was a gentle young man who lived with his parents. He was very quiet and seemed to live in a world of his own. Though he was happy, his parents worried about him. They were growing old. How would he make his way in the world? The time had come to send him out on his own.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> On Shebu’s eighteenth birthday, his father gave him a beautiful goat named Moonlight. The goat had long, silky, white fur. Father said, “Take this goat. You must never hurt the goat or sell her—but, if you are wise, she can help you earn money. When you come home, you should have gold coins in your pocket.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> Shebu’s mother gave him a bundle of food. With tears in their eyes, Shebu’s parents sent him on his way. Shebu walked through the forest, Moonlight always at his side. In grassy fields Moonlight ate without worries, but Shebu could not live on grass. As his food ran out, Shebu became concerned. The time had come to think about earning money for his living. How could he earn his way in the world?</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> One day Shebu and Moonlight found a river, and beside the river were several young ladies. One of them approached Shebu and offered him water from a cup. Gratefully he drank the water and thanked her, asking her what her name was. She told him that her name was Junali, meaning “night of shining stars”.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> “Your goat has beautiful fur,” said Junali. “Its silky hairs are like the strands I have seen in the finest of rugs.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “Where do they make these rugs?” asked Shebu.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> “In the big village down the road,” she replied.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> Thanking her, Shebu took Moonlight several miles down the road to the big village. An idea had taken shape in the young man’s mind. Upon arriving in the town, he asked where he could find the barber. The barber cut off Moonlight’s fur, and Shebu gathered the silken hairs together and took them to the shop of the nearest weaver of rugs.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> As they made their way home, Moonlight danced and pranced in the meadows. Without her heavy coat, she felt cool and light. Shebu was not worried. He knew that by the time the cold of winter came, her long white hair would be regrown.</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> Shebu’s parents greeted him with great joy when he returned. Not only was he safe and wealthy, but he had proven he could take care of himself. They were happy about his new circumstances. He’d found his way and returned with gold too!</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> Shebu always remembered Junali, who had helped him simply by noticing the beauty of his goat’s fur. Later he would meet Junali again—but that, my friend, is another story.</p>

        <p>The method of cleaning which should generally be used is the space assignment method. Under this method, the buildings to be cleaned are divided into different sections. Within each section, each crew of Custodial Assistants is assigned to do one particular cleaning job. For example, within a section, one crew may be assigned to cleaning offices, another to scrubbing floors, a third to collecting trash, and so on. Other methods which may be used are the post-assignment method and the gang-cleaning method. Under the post-assignment method, a Custodial Assistant is assigned to one area of a building and performs all cleaning jobs in that area. This method is seldom used except where buildings are so small and distant from each other that it is not economical to use the space-assignment method. Under the gang-cleaning method, a Custodial Foremen takes a number of Custodial Assistants through a section of the building. These Custodial Assistants work as a group and complete the various cleaning jobs as they go. This method is generally used only where the building contains very large open areas.</p>

Within each section, each crew of Custodial Assistants is assigned to do one particular cleaning job. For example, within a section, one crew may be assigned to cleaning offices, another to scrubbing floors, a third to collecting trash, and so on. Other methods which may be used are the post-assignment method and the gang-cleaning method. Under the post-assignment method, a Custodial Assistant is assigned to one area of a building and performs all cleaning jobs in that area. This method is seldom used except where buildings are so small and distant from each other that it is not economical to use the space-assignment method. Under the gang-cleaning method, a Custodial Foremen takes a number of Custodial Assistants through a section of the building.
