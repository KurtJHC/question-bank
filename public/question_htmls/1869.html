  Arianna, Susan, Stephan and Jason are 4 friends who are shopping for clothes. They enter a shop that sells three different types of pants and shirts. The types of shirts are short-sleeves, long-sleeves and pattern shirts. The types of pants are shorts, jeans and canvas pants. Each person bought 1 type of shirt and 1 type of pants.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Arianna bought canvas pants and Jason bought jeans. The rest bought some shorts. Out of the 4 friends, not a single person bought pattern shirts. The only person who bought a long-sleeve shirt was female.<br>

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
During sustained periods of wet weather, one of the key safety messages is simple: don’t drive through floodwaters. Doing so will likely severely damage your vehicle and could also put your life at risk. The temptation is understandable – it’s been a tough drive and you’re within minutes of the comforts of home when you’re confronted with what looks like a relatively shallow and steady flow of water across the road. But the flow in front of you could pack a punch of a tonne per metric metre, which can tear away the road surface and result in a much deeper gully than is apparent. A typical car will lose power in depths greater than 15cm as water enters the exhaust and washes into the air intake, causing it to float once flood levels exceed 30cm. Modern cars with electrically powered windows and locks are almost impossible to escape from once water finds its way into wiring and motors, disabling switchgear and pressing on bodywork. Fast-flowing force can overcome four-wheel drive or any other tool at one’s disposal. Even if you survive the ordeal, the damage your vehicle will certainly suffer will make you regret taking the chance.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
The Hawkesbury-Nepean Valley has a long history of damaging and dangerous floods. They can happen with little warning. You may only have a few hours to get out following an evacuation order. You need to be prepared, know your evacuation routes, and follow evacuation orders to keep you safe. You will typically be asked to leave well before you see any sign of floodwater. It is not safe to stay and shelter in your home after this. Information will be found on local and ABC radio, the NSW SES website or Facebook, NSW Police Facebook and Twitter. Get familiar with the routes. There are 12 designated evacuation routes that provide the quickest and safest way to exit the Wallacia, Penrith-Emu Plains, Richmond, Windsor, South and Eastern Creek floodplains. You need to be aware of more than one route because each flood behaves differently and evacuation routes will get cut by floodwater at different points. Even high set evacuation routes can be affected by large floods. The Jim Anderson Bridge would be cut when floodwaters approach its road level at 17.3 metres at Windsor. Once you know your best routes, have a conversation with friends or relatives to organise a place to go to. Remember, as each flood can be different, it’s important to follow evacuation orders when they&nbsp;are&nbsp;given.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Australia is the driest inhabited continent on Earth. Nevertheless, significant floods occur in parts of Australia almost every year. Floods are a natural process that provide benefits to the Australian environment, but they can also be natural disasters, resulting in deaths and extensive property damage. The main cause is heavy or long-lasting rainfall, which can make rivers exceed their capacity and overflow. In coastal areas flooding can be caused by tsunamis, very high tides, or tropical cyclones, which cause surges of seawater. Floods can also result from the failure of natural or man-made barriers, such as dams or levees. The impact of floods on people and communities can be devastating. Between 1852 and 2011 more than 900 people died and more than 1,300 were injured in floods in Australia. The estimated cost of property damage during that period was nearly $5 billion (Australian). This total includes damage to houses and other buildings, damage to infrastructure such as communication, power, and transportation systems, and loss of crops and livestock. The economic impact of floods can reach far beyond the area directly affected by the floodwaters. Floods also pose public health risks by spreading waterborne diseases and carrying pollutants from land into waterways.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
After a night of heavy rain, a group of friends were on their way to school.<br>
<br>
They came to the river they had to cross every day.<br>
"Yoh! It's stopped raining, but look how full and fast the river is," said Siya.<br>
"Oh no," groaned Linda. "Do you think teacher will be angry if we miss our classes today?"<br>
<br>
Linda remembered what the Sea Rescue instructor had taught them in water safety lessons. "Never cross a flooded river. Even if you can't get to school," the instructor had said. Meanwhile, Lungi stepped straight into the river!&nbsp; "I know where the stepping stones are!" he yelled. But he soon fell into the water and the strong river began pulling him away.<br>
<br>
"Run and get help!" shouted Linda.<br>
"Tell them to call the free emergency number ‪112, like the Sea Rescue lady told us."<br>
"Help, help!" shouted Lungi as he struggled to keep his head above the water.<br>
"Hold on, Lungi!" shouted Phelelani, as he grabbed a branch he could use to help his friend. Phelelani's class had been taught that they should never go into the water to help someone as they might also be washed away. Luckily, Lungi could float. He managed to grab the branch that Phelelani held out to him. Phelelani pulled Lungi to the safety of the river bank. The children walked back to Lungi's home with him. He was soaking wet but relieved to be alive.<br>
<br>
His mother was very thankful that he was safe.<br>
<br>
"Thank you!" she said to Phelelani. "You saved my boy because you knew what to do!"<br>

This total includes damage to houses and other buildings, damage to infrastructure such as communication, power, and transportation systems, and loss of crops and livestock. The economic impact of floods can reach far beyond the area directly affected by the floodwaters. Floods also pose public health risks by spreading waterborne diseases and carrying pollutants from land into waterways.<br>

After a night of heavy rain, a group of friends were on their way to school.<br>
They came to the river they had to cross every day.<br>
"Yoh! It's stopped raining, but look how full and fast the river is," said Siya.<br>
"Oh no," groaned Linda. "Do you think teacher will be angry if we miss our classes today?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Linda remembered what the Sea Rescue instructor had taught them in water safety lessons. "Never cross a flooded river. Even if you can't get to school," the instructor had said. Meanwhile, Lungi stepped straight into the river!&nbsp; "I know where the stepping stones are!" he yelled. But he soon fell into the water and the strong river began pulling him away.<br>
"Run and get help!" shouted Linda.<br>
"Tell them to call the free emergency number ‪112, like the Sea Rescue lady told us."<br>
"Help, help!" shouted Lungi as he struggled to keep his head above the water.<br>
"Hold on, Lungi!" shouted Phelelani, as he grabbed a branch he could use to help his friend. Phelelani's class had been taught that they should never go into the water to help someone as they might also be washed away. Luckily, Lungi could float. He managed to grab the branch that Phelelani held out to him. Phelelani pulled Lungi to the safety of the river bank. The children walked back to Lungi's home with him. He was soaking wet but relieved to be alive.<br>
His mother was very thankful that he was safe.<br>
"Thank you!" she said to Phelelani. "You saved my boy because you knew what to do!"<br>

During sustained periods of wet weather, one of the key safety messages is simple: don’t drive through floodwaters. Doing so will likely severely damage your vehicle and could also put your life at risk. The temptation is understandable – it’s been a tough drive and you’re within minutes of the comforts of home when you’re confronted with what looks like a relatively shallow and steady flow of water across the road. But the flow in front of you could pack a punch of a tonne per metric metre, which can tear away the road surface and result in a much deeper gully than is apparent. A typical car will lose power in depths greater than 15cm as water enters the exhaust and washes into the air intake, causing it to float once flood levels exceed 30cm. Modern cars with electrically powered windows and locks are almost impossible to escape from once water finds its way into wiring and motors, disabling switchgear and pressing on bodywork. Fast-flowing force can overcome four-wheel drive or any other tool at one’s disposal. Even if you survive the ordeal, the damage your vehicle will certainly suffer will make you regret taking the chance.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong> ^}<br>
The Hawkesbury-Nepean Valley has a long history of damaging and dangerous floods. They can happen with little warning. You may only have a few hours to get out following an evacuation order. You need to be prepared, know your evacuation routes, and follow evacuation orders to keep you safe. You will typically be asked to leave well before you see any sign of floodwater. It is not safe to stay and shelter in your home after this. Information will be found on local and ABC radio, the NSW SES website or Facebook, NSW Police Facebook and Twitter. Get familiar with the routes. There are 12 designated evacuation routes that provide the quickest and safest way to exit the Wallacia, Penrith-Emu Plains, Richmond, Windsor, South and Eastern Creek floodplains. You need to be aware of more than one route because each flood behaves differently and evacuation routes will get cut by floodwater at different points. Even high set evacuation routes can be affected by large floods. The Jim Anderson Bridge would be cut when floodwaters approach its road level at 17.3 metres at Windsor. Once you know your best routes, have a conversation with friends or relatives to organise a place to go to. Remember, as each flood can be different, it’s important to follow evacuation orders when they&nbsp;are&nbsp;given.&nbsp;<br>

Australia is the driest inhabited continent on Earth. Nevertheless, significant floods occur in parts of Australia almost every year. Floods are a natural process that provide benefits to the Australian environment, but they can also be natural disasters, resulting in deaths and extensive property damage. The main cause is heavy or long-lasting rainfall, which can make rivers exceed their capacity and overflow. In coastal areas flooding can be caused by tsunamis, very high tides, or tropical cyclones, which cause surges of seawater. Floods can also result from the failure of natural or man-made barriers, such as dams or levees. The impact of floods on people and communities can be devastating. Between 1852 and 2011 more than 900 people died and more than 1,300 were injured in floods in Australia. The estimated cost of property damage during that period was nearly $5 billion (Australian).

This total includes damage to houses and other buildings, damage to infrastructure such as communication, power, and transportation systems, and loss of crops and livestock. The economic impact of floods can reach far beyond the area directly affected by the floodwaters. Floods also pose public health risks by spreading waterborne diseases and carrying pollutants from land into waterways.<br>

After a night of heavy rain, a group of friends were on their way to school.<br>
They came to the river they had to cross every day.<br>
"Yoh! It's stopped raining, but look how full and fast the river is," said Siya.<br>
"Oh no," groaned Linda. "Do you think teacher will be angry if we miss our classes today?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Linda remembered what the Sea Rescue instructor had taught them in water safety lessons. "Never cross a flooded river. Even if you can't get to school," the instructor had said. Meanwhile, Lungi stepped straight into the river!&nbsp; "I know where the stepping stones are!" he yelled. But he soon fell into the water and the strong river began pulling him away.<br>
"Run and get help!" shouted Linda.<br>
"Tell them to call the free emergency number ‪112, like the Sea Rescue lady told us."<br>
"Help, help!" shouted Lungi as he struggled to keep his head above the water.<br>
"Hold on, Lungi!" shouted Phelelani, as he grabbed a branch he could use to help his friend. Phelelani's class had been taught that they should never go into the water to help someone as they might also be washed away. Luckily, Lungi could float. He managed to grab the branch that Phelelani held out to him. Phelelani pulled Lungi to the safety of the river bank. The children walked back to Lungi's home with him. He was soaking wet but relieved to be alive.<br>
His mother was very thankful that he was safe.<br>
"Thank you!" she said to Phelelani. "You saved my boy because you knew what to do!"<br>

During sustained periods of wet weather, one of the key safety messages is simple: don’t drive through floodwaters. Doing so will likely severely damage your vehicle and could also put your life at risk. The temptation is understandable – it’s been a tough drive and you’re within minutes of the comforts of home when you’re confronted with what looks like a relatively shallow and steady flow of water across the road. But the flow in front of you could pack a punch of a tonne per metric metre, which can tear away the road surface and result in a much deeper gully than is apparent. A typical car will lose power in depths greater than 15cm as water enters the exhaust and washes into the air intake, causing it to float once flood levels exceed 30cm. Modern cars with electrically powered windows and locks are almost impossible to escape from once water finds its way into wiring and motors, disabling switchgear and pressing on bodywork. Fast-flowing force can overcome four-wheel drive or any other tool at one’s disposal. Even if you survive the ordeal, the damage your vehicle will certainly suffer will make you regret taking the chance.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong> ^}<br>
The Hawkesbury-Nepean Valley has a long history of damaging and dangerous floods. They can happen with little warning. You may only have a few hours to get out following an evacuation order. You need to be prepared, know your evacuation routes, and follow evacuation orders to keep you safe. You will typically be asked to leave well before you see any sign of floodwater. It is not safe to stay and shelter in your home after this. Information will be found on local and ABC radio, the NSW SES website or Facebook, NSW Police Facebook and Twitter. Get familiar with the routes. There are 12 designated evacuation routes that provide the quickest and safest way to exit the Wallacia, Penrith-Emu Plains, Richmond, Windsor, South and Eastern Creek floodplains. You need to be aware of more than one route because each flood behaves differently and evacuation routes will get cut by floodwater at different points. Even high set evacuation routes can be affected by large floods. The Jim Anderson Bridge would be cut when floodwaters approach its road level at 17.3 metres at Windsor. Once you know your best routes, have a conversation with friends or relatives to organise a place to go to. Remember, as each flood can be different, it’s important to follow evacuation orders when they&nbsp;are&nbsp;given.&nbsp;<br>

Australia is the driest inhabited continent on Earth. Nevertheless, significant floods occur in parts of Australia almost every year. Floods are a natural process that provide benefits to the Australian environment, but they can also be natural disasters, resulting in deaths and extensive property damage. The main cause is heavy or long-lasting rainfall, which can make rivers exceed their capacity and overflow. In coastal areas flooding can be caused by tsunamis, very high tides, or tropical cyclones, which cause surges of seawater. Floods can also result from the failure of natural or man-made barriers, such as dams or levees. The impact of floods on people and communities can be devastating. Between 1852 and 2011 more than 900 people died and more than 1,300 were injured in floods in Australia. The estimated cost of property damage during that period was nearly $5 billion (Australian).

The economic impact of floods can reach far beyond the area directly affected by the floodwaters. Floods also pose public health risks by spreading waterborne diseases and carrying pollutants from land into waterways.<br>

After a night of heavy rain, a group of friends were on their way to school.<br>
They came to the river they had to cross every day.<br>
"Yoh! It's stopped raining, but look how full and fast the river is," said Siya.<br>
"Oh no," groaned Linda. "Do you think teacher will be angry if we miss our classes today?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Linda remembered what the Sea Rescue instructor had taught them in water safety lessons. "Never cross a flooded river. Even if you can't get to school," the instructor had said. Meanwhile, Lungi stepped straight into the river!&nbsp; "I know where the stepping stones are!" he yelled. But he soon fell into the water and the strong river began pulling him away.<br>
"Run and get help!" shouted Linda.<br>
"Tell them to call the free emergency number ‪112, like the Sea Rescue lady told us."<br>
"Help, help!" shouted Lungi as he struggled to keep his head above the water.<br>
"Hold on, Lungi!" shouted Phelelani, as he grabbed a branch he could use to help his friend. Phelelani's class had been taught that they should never go into the water to help someone as they might also be washed away. Luckily, Lungi could float. He managed to grab the branch that Phelelani held out to him. Phelelani pulled Lungi to the safety of the river bank. The children walked back to Lungi's home with him. He was soaking wet but relieved to be alive.<br>
His mother was very thankful that he was safe.<br>
"Thank you!" she said to Phelelani. "You saved my boy because you knew what to do!"<br>

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
During sustained periods of wet weather, one of the key safety messages is simple: don’t drive through floodwaters. Doing so will likely severely damage your vehicle and could also put your life at risk. The temptation is understandable – it’s been a tough drive and you’re within minutes of the comforts of home when you’re confronted with what looks like a relatively shallow and steady flow of water across the road. But the flow in front of you could pack a punch of a tonne per metric metre, which can tear away the road surface and result in a much deeper gully than is apparent. A typical car will lose power in depths greater than 15cm as water enters the exhaust and washes into the air intake, causing it to float once flood levels exceed 30cm. Modern cars with electrically powered windows and locks are almost impossible to escape from once water finds its way into wiring and motors, disabling switchgear and pressing on bodywork. Fast-flowing force can overcome four-wheel drive or any other tool at one’s disposal. Even if you survive the ordeal, the damage your vehicle will certainly suffer will make you regret taking the chance.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong> ^}<br>
The Hawkesbury-Nepean Valley has a long history of damaging and dangerous floods. They can happen with little warning. You may only have a few hours to get out following an evacuation order. You need to be prepared, know your evacuation routes, and follow evacuation orders to keep you safe. You will typically be asked to leave well before you see any sign of floodwater. It is not safe to stay and shelter in your home after this. Information will be found on local and ABC radio, the NSW SES website or Facebook, NSW Police Facebook and Twitter. Get familiar with the routes. There are 12 designated evacuation routes that provide the quickest and safest way to exit the Wallacia, Penrith-Emu Plains, Richmond, Windsor, South and Eastern Creek floodplains. You need to be aware of more than one route because each flood behaves differently and evacuation routes will get cut by floodwater at different points. Even high set evacuation routes can be affected by large floods. The Jim Anderson Bridge would be cut when floodwaters approach its road level at 17.3 metres at Windsor. Once you know your best routes, have a conversation with friends or relatives to organise a place to go to. Remember, as each flood can be different, it’s important to follow evacuation orders when they&nbsp;are&nbsp;given.&nbsp;<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Australia is the driest inhabited continent on Earth. Nevertheless, significant floods occur in parts of Australia almost every year. Floods are a natural process that provide benefits to the Australian environment, but they can also be natural disasters, resulting in deaths and extensive property damage. The main cause is heavy or long-lasting rainfall, which can make rivers exceed their capacity and overflow. In coastal areas flooding can be caused by tsunamis, very high tides, or tropical cyclones, which cause surges of seawater. Floods can also result from the failure of natural or man-made barriers, such as dams or levees. The impact of floods on people and communities can be devastating. Between 1852 and 2011 more than 900 people died and more than 1,300 were injured in floods in Australia. The estimated cost of property damage during that period was nearly $5 billion (Australian). This total includes damage to houses and other buildings, damage to infrastructure such as communication, power, and transportation systems, and loss of crops and livestock. The economic impact of floods can reach far beyond the area directly affected by the floodwaters. Floods also pose public health risks by spreading waterborne diseases and carrying pollutants from land into waterways.<br>

<br>
<strong>Rahab</strong>: If our scores for the main course were different to each other, then our scores for the dessert must have been different as well.<br>
<br>
<strong>Bec</strong>: And if our scores in the dessert were the same, then our scores for the main course must have been the same too.<br>

        <p>George and Natalie are organising the food for their class’ end-of-year party. Their class has 25 people, and George and Natalie have a total of $50 for catering. Based on a survey they sent out, they decided to purchase crackers, carrots, juice, garlic bread and salad. After purchasing these items, they have $9.70 left and would like to use this amount to buy 4 containers of dips, choosing 2 flavours.<br>
George and Natalie sent out another survey to their class to find their favourite dip flavours and below are the results. Each person in their class voted for their two favourite flavours.&nbsp;</p>
