<strong>The Kangaroo</strong><br>
&nbsp;
<p>I am the kangaroo.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1<br>
Slate-grey, and red;<br>
And when, as oft I do,&nbsp;<br>
I lift my head<br>
Against the far-off blue<br>
Of sky and earth,<br>
I am a symbol too,<br>
of this land’s birth.</p>

<p>I am the rock and the tree,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2<br>
The wide plains dry,<br>
The gorges wild and free<br>
The blue-hot sky.<br>
The blue-grey greenery –&nbsp;<br>
Gully and rise,&nbsp;<br>
the Aboriginal<br>
And his far eyes.</p>

<p>The silence am I,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3<br>
The granite peak,&nbsp;<br>
The flood, the river high,<br>
The dried-up creek,<br>
The hot white clouds that lie<br>
Before the sun,&nbsp;<br>
The breeze that rustles by&nbsp;<br>
Where grasses run.</p>

<p>I lift my head, and so&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4<br>
Time there is writ,&nbsp;<br>
Ages of long ago<br>
Are held in it.<br>
I am a statue, oh,&nbsp;<br>
As old as stone:<br>
Grey boulder stooping low,&nbsp;<br>
Standing alone.</p>

<p>I am the dry, hot land,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5<br>
The sand, the clay,&nbsp;<br>
The burning wind that fanned&nbsp;<br>
Some far-off day:<br>
I, kangaroo, as planned,<br>
Still, still unspent,&nbsp;<br>
The breath, the bone, the strand<br>
Of our continent.</p>

          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Elvis Presley</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Elvis Aaron Presley was born to Vernon and Gladys Presley in a two-room house in Tupelo, Mississippi, on January 8, 1935. His twin brother, Jessie Garon, was stillborn, leaving Elvis to grow up as an only child. On Elvis' eleventh birthday, his parents bought him a guitar. With the help of his uncle Johnny (Smith) and pastor Frank Smith of the Assembly of God Church, which the Presleys were now attending, he learned some basic cords. However, while Elvis did play rhythm in the 1950's he never progressed further as a guitar player. <strong>1</strong> ………… .&nbsp; When you have a voice as good as Elvis Presley's, you are not motivated to learn more, instead he concentrated on improving his voice to get it where he wanted, to be able to sing the bigger songs like ‘Are You Lonesome Tonight?’, ‘It's Now Or Never’, both from 1960, and songs such as ‘My Way’ in the 1970s, just to name a few.</p>
        <p>Elvis and his parents moved to Memphis, Tennessee, in 1948. Elvis graduated from Humes High School there in 1953. Elvis' musical influences were the pop and country music of the time, the gospel music he heard in church, the all-night gospel events he frequently attended, and the black R&amp;B he absorbed on historic Beale Street as a Memphis teenager. In 1954, Elvis began his singing career with the legendary Sun Records label in Memphis. In late 1955, his recording contract was sold to RCA Victor. <strong>2</strong> ………… .</p>
        <p>Elvis had a sound and style that uniquely combined diverse musical influences and blurred and challenged the social and racial barriers of the time. <strong>3</strong> ………… .&nbsp; Elvis Presley's dynamic life story from his humble beginnings through his rise to stardom is a fascinating journey. It has earned Elvis his still undefeated title of the 'King of Rock 'N Roll'.</p>
        <p>His songs are unforgettable - they have stood the test of time, especially his singles of the 1950s, a decade in which he had a song at No. 1. for a full 6 months of a year. An even more incredible statistic is Elvis only started at RCA in January of 1956. <strong>4</strong> ………… .&nbsp; A testament to his incredible break-through is the fact that he managed to sell twice as many records in the entire decade of the 1950s (with only two years of recording) than any other performer at that time. (There were also the SUN years 1954-1955 but these were not huge for record sales, like when he became a national sensation in 1956).</p>
        <p><strong>5</strong> ………… .&nbsp; Who could know what the next one would be like? Elvis liberally altered his style to suit each song. There were the early country-boy rockabillies sung in a breathless high pitch, of which ‘My Baby Left Me’, ‘Milkcow Blues Boogie’ and ‘Money Honey’ are examples. His more mature, aggressive rock 'n' roll stance came out with songs such as ‘Blue Suede Shoes’, ‘One Night’ and ‘A Big Hunk O' Love’. His approach to ballads ranged from the ethereal vocal effects on the guitar-tapping version of ‘Blue Moon’ to smooth crooning on ‘As Long As I Have You’, ‘Can't Help Falling In Love’ and many other slow numbers and movie songs.</p>
        <p>Elvis Presley died of heart failure at his home, ‘Graceland’ in Memphis, Tennessee on August 16, 1977. He was 42 years old. Elvis starred in 33 movies, made history with his television appearances and live concert performances on tour and in Las Vegas. Globally, he has sold over one billion records, more than any other artist had ever done. His American sales have earned him gold, platinum or multi-platinum awards for 131 different albums and singles, far more than any other artist. Among his many awards were 14 Grammy nominations (3 wins) from the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences, the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, which he received at age 36. <strong>6</strong> ………… . Known the world over by his first name, he is regarded as one of the most important figures of twentieth century popular culture.&nbsp;<br>

          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Elvis Presley</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Elvis Aaron Presley was born to Vernon and Gladys Presley in a two-room house in Tupelo, Mississippi, on January 8, 1935. His twin brother, Jessie Garon, was stillborn, leaving Elvis to grow up as an only child. On Elvis' eleventh birthday, his parents bought him a guitar. With the help of his uncle Johnny (Smith) and pastor Frank Smith of the Assembly of God Church, which the Presleys were now attending, he learned some basic cords. However, while Elvis did play rhythm in the 1950's he never progressed further as a guitar player. <strong>1</strong> ………… .&nbsp; When you have a voice as good as Elvis Presley's, you are not motivated to learn more, instead he concentrated on improving his voice to get it where he wanted, to be able to sing the bigger songs like ‘Are You Lonesome Tonight?’, ‘It's Now Or Never’, both from 1960, and songs such as ‘My Way’ in the 1970s, just to name a few.</p>
        <p>Elvis and his parents moved to Memphis, Tennessee, in 1948. Elvis graduated from Humes High School there in 1953. Elvis' musical influences were the pop and country music of the time, the gospel music he heard in church, the all-night gospel events he frequently attended, and the black R&amp;B he absorbed on historic Beale Street as a Memphis teenager. In 1954, Elvis began his singing career with the legendary Sun Records label in Memphis. In late 1955, his recording contract was sold to RCA Victor. <strong>2</strong> ………… .</p>
        <p>Elvis had a sound and style that uniquely combined diverse musical influences and blurred and challenged the social and racial barriers of the time. <strong>3</strong> ………… .&nbsp; Elvis Presley's dynamic life story from his humble beginnings through his rise to stardom is a fascinating journey. It has earned Elvis his still undefeated title of the 'King of Rock 'N Roll'.</p>
        <p>His songs are unforgettable - they have stood the test of time, especially his singles of the 1950s, a decade in which he had a song at No. 1. for a full 6 months of a year. An even more incredible statistic is Elvis only started at RCA in January of 1956. <strong>4</strong> ………… .&nbsp; A testament to his incredible break-through is the fact that he managed to sell twice as many records in the entire decade of the 1950s (with only two years of recording) than any other performer at that time. (There were also the SUN years 1954-1955 but these were not huge for record sales, like when he became a national sensation in 1956).</p>
        <p><strong>5</strong> ………… .&nbsp; Who could know what the next one would be like? Elvis liberally altered his style to suit each song. There were the early country-boy rockabillies sung in a breathless high pitch, of which ‘My Baby Left Me’, ‘Milkcow Blues Boogie’ and ‘Money Honey’ are examples. His more mature, aggressive rock 'n' roll stance came out with songs such as ‘Blue Suede Shoes’, ‘One Night’ and ‘A Big Hunk O' Love’. His approach to ballads ranged from the ethereal vocal effects on the guitar-tapping version of ‘Blue Moon’ to smooth crooning on ‘As Long As I Have You’, ‘Can't Help Falling In Love’ and many other slow numbers and movie songs.</p>
        <p>Elvis Presley died of heart failure at his home, ‘Graceland’ in Memphis, Tennessee on August 16, 1977. He was 42 years old. Elvis starred in 33 movies, made history with his television appearances and live concert performances on tour and in Las Vegas. Globally, he has sold over one billion records, more than any other artist had ever done. His American sales have earned him gold, platinum or multi-platinum awards for 131 different albums and singles, far more than any other artist. Among his many awards were 14 Grammy nominations (3 wins) from the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences, the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, which he received at age 36. <strong>6</strong> ………… . Known the world over by his first name, he is regarded as one of the most important figures of twentieth century popular culture.&nbsp;<br>

          <strong>Elvis Presley</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Elvis Aaron Presley was born to Vernon and Gladys Presley in a two-room house in Tupelo, Mississippi, on January 8, 1935. His twin brother, Jessie Garon, was stillborn, leaving Elvis to grow up as an only child. On Elvis' eleventh birthday, his parents bought him a guitar. With the help of his uncle Johnny (Smith) and pastor Frank Smith of the Assembly of God Church, which the Presleys were now attending, he learned some basic cords. However, while Elvis did play rhythm in the 1950's he never progressed further as a guitar player. <strong>1</strong> ………… .&nbsp; When you have a voice as good as Elvis Presley's, you are not motivated to learn more, instead he concentrated on improving his voice to get it where he wanted, to be able to sing the bigger songs like ‘Are You Lonesome Tonight?’, ‘It's Now Or Never’, both from 1960, and songs such as ‘My Way’ in the 1970s, just to name a few.</p>
        <p>Elvis and his parents moved to Memphis, Tennessee, in 1948. Elvis graduated from Humes High School there in 1953. Elvis' musical influences were the pop and country music of the time, the gospel music he heard in church, the all-night gospel events he frequently attended, and the black R&amp;B he absorbed on historic Beale Street as a Memphis teenager. In 1954, Elvis began his singing career with the legendary Sun Records label in Memphis. In late 1955, his recording contract was sold to RCA Victor. <strong>2</strong> ………… .</p>
        <p>Elvis had a sound and style that uniquely combined diverse musical influences and blurred and challenged the social and racial barriers of the time. <strong>3</strong> ………… .&nbsp; Elvis Presley's dynamic life story from his humble beginnings through his rise to stardom is a fascinating journey. It has earned Elvis his still undefeated title of the 'King of Rock 'N Roll'.</p>
        <p>His songs are unforgettable - they have stood the test of time, especially his singles of the 1950s, a decade in which he had a song at No. 1. for a full 6 months of a year. An even more incredible statistic is Elvis only started at RCA in January of 1956. <strong>4</strong> ………… .&nbsp; A testament to his incredible break-through is the fact that he managed to sell twice as many records in the entire decade of the 1950s (with only two years of recording) than any other performer at that time. (There were also the SUN years 1954-1955 but these were not huge for record sales, like when he became a national sensation in 1956).</p>
        <p><strong>5</strong> ………… .&nbsp; Who could know what the next one would be like? Elvis liberally altered his style to suit each song. There were the early country-boy rockabillies sung in a breathless high pitch, of which ‘My Baby Left Me’, ‘Milkcow Blues Boogie’ and ‘Money Honey’ are examples. His more mature, aggressive rock 'n' roll stance came out with songs such as ‘Blue Suede Shoes’, ‘One Night’ and ‘A Big Hunk O' Love’. His approach to ballads ranged from the ethereal vocal effects on the guitar-tapping version of ‘Blue Moon’ to smooth crooning on ‘As Long As I Have You’, ‘Can't Help Falling In Love’ and many other slow numbers and movie songs.</p>
        <p>Elvis Presley died of heart failure at his home, ‘Graceland’ in Memphis, Tennessee on August 16, 1977. He was 42 years old. Elvis starred in 33 movies, made history with his television appearances and live concert performances on tour and in Las Vegas. Globally, he has sold over one billion records, more than any other artist had ever done. His American sales have earned him gold, platinum or multi-platinum awards for 131 different albums and singles, far more than any other artist. Among his many awards were 14 Grammy nominations (3 wins) from the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences, the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, which he received at age 36. <strong>6</strong> ………… . Known the world over by his first name, he is regarded as one of the most important figures of twentieth century popular culture.&nbsp;<br>

          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Elvis Presley</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Elvis Aaron Presley was born to Vernon and Gladys Presley in a two-room house in Tupelo, Mississippi, on January 8, 1935. His twin brother, Jessie Garon, was stillborn, leaving Elvis to grow up as an only child. On Elvis' eleventh birthday, his parents bought him a guitar. With the help of his uncle Johnny (Smith) and pastor Frank Smith of the Assembly of God Church, which the Presleys were now attending, he learned some basic cords. However, while Elvis did play rhythm in the 1950's he never progressed further as a guitar player. <strong>1</strong> ………… .&nbsp; When you have a voice as good as Elvis Presley's, you are not motivated to learn more, instead he concentrated on improving his voice to get it where he wanted, to be able to sing the bigger songs like ‘Are You Lonesome Tonight?’, ‘It's Now Or Never’, both from 1960, and songs such as ‘My Way’ in the 1970s, just to name a few.</p>
        <p>Elvis and his parents moved to Memphis, Tennessee, in 1948. Elvis graduated from Humes High School there in 1953. Elvis' musical influences were the pop and country music of the time, the gospel music he heard in church, the all-night gospel events he frequently attended, and the black R&amp;B he absorbed on historic Beale Street as a Memphis teenager. In 1954, Elvis began his singing career with the legendary Sun Records label in Memphis. In late 1955, his recording contract was sold to RCA Victor. <strong>2</strong> ………… .</p>
        <p>Elvis had a sound and style that uniquely combined diverse musical influences and blurred and challenged the social and racial barriers of the time. <strong>3</strong> ………… .&nbsp; Elvis Presley's dynamic life story from his humble beginnings through his rise to stardom is a fascinating journey. It has earned Elvis his still undefeated title of the 'King of Rock 'N Roll'.</p>
        <p>His songs are unforgettable - they have stood the test of time, especially his singles of the 1950s, a decade in which he had a song at No. 1. for a full 6 months of a year. An even more incredible statistic is Elvis only started at RCA in January of 1956. <strong>4</strong> ………… .&nbsp; A testament to his incredible break-through is the fact that he managed to sell twice as many records in the entire decade of the 1950s (with only two years of recording) than any other performer at that time. (There were also the SUN years 1954-1955 but these were not huge for record sales, like when he became a national sensation in 1956).</p>
        <p><strong>5</strong> ………… .&nbsp; Who could know what the next one would be like? Elvis liberally altered his style to suit each song. There were the early country-boy rockabillies sung in a breathless high pitch, of which ‘My Baby Left Me’, ‘Milkcow Blues Boogie’ and ‘Money Honey’ are examples. His more mature, aggressive rock 'n' roll stance came out with songs such as ‘Blue Suede Shoes’, ‘One Night’ and ‘A Big Hunk O' Love’. His approach to ballads ranged from the ethereal vocal effects on the guitar-tapping version of ‘Blue Moon’ to smooth crooning on ‘As Long As I Have You’, ‘Can't Help Falling In Love’ and many other slow numbers and movie songs.</p>
        <p>Elvis Presley died of heart failure at his home, ‘Graceland’ in Memphis, Tennessee on August 16, 1977. He was 42 years old. Elvis starred in 33 movies, made history with his television appearances and live concert performances on tour and in Las Vegas. Globally, he has sold over one billion records, more than any other artist had ever done. His American sales have earned him gold, platinum or multi-platinum awards for 131 different albums and singles, far more than any other artist. Among his many awards were 14 Grammy nominations (3 wins) from the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences, the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, which he received at age 36. <strong>6</strong> ………… . Known the world over by his first name, he is regarded as one of the most important figures of twentieth century popular culture.&nbsp;<br>

          <strong>Gallipoli</strong>
        </p>
        <p>On 25 April 1915, Australian soldiers landed at what is now called Anzac Cove on the Gallipoli Peninsula. For the vast majority of the 16,000 Australians and New Zealanders who landed on that first day, this was their first experience of combat. <strong>1</strong> ………… . The Gallipoli campaign was hence, a military failure. However, the traits that were shown there – bravery, ingenuity, endurance and mateship – have become enshrined as defining aspects of the Australian character. Official war correspondent, Charles Bean wrote that: “It lay in the mettle of the men themselves. To be the sort of man who would give way when his mates were trusting to his firmness … to live the rest of his life haunted by the knowledge that he had set his hand to a soldier’s task and had lacked the grit to carry it through – that was the prospect these men could not face. Life was very dear, but life was not worth living unless they could be true to their idea of Australian manhood.”</p>
        <p>The British had been trying to force their way through the narrow straits known as the Dardanelles to capture Istanbul in Turkey. This would relieve pressure on their Russian allies engaged with Ottoman (Turkish) forces in the Caucasus. Minefields and on-shore artillery batteries thwarted the early naval attempts to seize the strait. <strong>2</strong> ………… .&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
        <p>British and French forces landed at Cape Helles on the southern tip of the peninsula. The Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) included the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Australian Brigades along with the 1st New Zealand Brigade as well as artillery units from the British Indian Army.&nbsp; <strong>3</strong> ………… .&nbsp; &nbsp;However, in the early morning darkness it is possible that they were beached one kilometre or so north of their planned objective. This was an area of steep, rugged terrain.</p>
        <p>Once on the beach, many units became separated from one another as they began moving up the tangle of complex spurs and ravines in the darkness. Turkish resistance remained strong. As a result, the Anzacs were subjected to devastating artillery bombardments. By mid-morning Turkish reinforcements had arrived under Mustapha Kemal (later Kemal Ataturk, president of Turkey).<strong> 4</strong> ………… .&nbsp; In the time it takes us to die, other troops and commanders can come and take our places.” The Anzac position became progressively more precarious as the Anzacs failed to secure their high-ground objectives. The Turks then mounted a fierce counter-attack, regaining much of the ground the Anzacs had taken.</p>
        <p>That evening, Major-General William Bridges, commander of the 1st Australian Division, and Lieutenant-General Sir William Birdwood, commander of ANZAC, both advised General Sir Ian Hamilton, Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force, that the Allied force be withdrawn from the peninsula. After consultation with the Royal Navy, Hamilton decided against an evacuation, and ordered the troops to dig in. Falling back on improvised and shallow entrenchments, the Anzacs held on for a crucial first night. By that first evening 16,000 men had been landed but more than 2000 had been killed or wounded. <strong>5</strong> ………… .&nbsp; &nbsp;The British and French forces farther south were also unable to break out of their positions.</p>
        <p>By November, with more Turkish reinforcements and German equipment in place, it was obvious the stalemate would continue. <strong>6</strong> ………… .&nbsp; &nbsp;He recommended to the British Cabinet that a general evacuation take place. In late December, the Anzacs were successfully evacuated with barely any casualties, and by 20 January 1916, all Allied troops had withdrawn from the peninsula. The battles fought by the Australian Imperial Force at Gallipoli are widely regarded as the foundation legend of Australian military history, and a potent symbol of federated Australia. The Gallipoli campaign was a military failure but the characteristics that the Anzacs displayed throughout the campaign – bravery, ingenuity, endurance and mateship – have come to be celebrated as defining characteristics of the Australian personality.</p>

          <strong>Gallipoli</strong>
        </p>
        <p>On 25 April 1915, Australian soldiers landed at what is now called Anzac Cove on the Gallipoli Peninsula. For the vast majority of the 16,000 Australians and New Zealanders who landed on that first day, this was their first experience of combat. <strong>1</strong> ………… . The Gallipoli campaign was hence, a military failure. However, the traits that were shown there – bravery, ingenuity, endurance and mateship – have become enshrined as defining aspects of the Australian character. Official war correspondent, Charles Bean wrote that: “It lay in the mettle of the men themselves. To be the sort of man who would give way when his mates were trusting to his firmness … to live the rest of his life haunted by the knowledge that he had set his hand to a soldier’s task and had lacked the grit to carry it through – that was the prospect these men could not face. Life was very dear, but life was not worth living unless they could be true to their idea of Australian manhood.”</p>
        <p>The British had been trying to force their way through the narrow straits known as the Dardanelles to capture Istanbul in Turkey. This would relieve pressure on their Russian allies engaged with Ottoman (Turkish) forces in the Caucasus. Minefields and on-shore artillery batteries thwarted the early naval attempts to seize the strait. <strong>2</strong> ………… .&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
        <p>British and French forces landed at Cape Helles on the southern tip of the peninsula. The Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) included the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Australian Brigades along with the 1st New Zealand Brigade as well as artillery units from the British Indian Army.&nbsp; <strong>3</strong> ………… .&nbsp; &nbsp;However, in the early morning darkness it is possible that they were beached one kilometre or so north of their planned objective. This was an area of steep, rugged terrain.</p>
        <p>Once on the beach, many units became separated from one another as they began moving up the tangle of complex spurs and ravines in the darkness. Turkish resistance remained strong. As a result, the Anzacs were subjected to devastating artillery bombardments. By mid-morning Turkish reinforcements had arrived under Mustapha Kemal (later Kemal Ataturk, president of Turkey).<strong> 4</strong> ………… .&nbsp; In the time it takes us to die, other troops and commanders can come and take our places.” The Anzac position became progressively more precarious as the Anzacs failed to secure their high-ground objectives. The Turks then mounted a fierce counter-attack, regaining much of the ground the Anzacs had taken.</p>
        <p>That evening, Major-General William Bridges, commander of the 1st Australian Division, and Lieutenant-General Sir William Birdwood, commander of ANZAC, both advised General Sir Ian Hamilton, Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force, that the Allied force be withdrawn from the peninsula. After consultation with the Royal Navy, Hamilton decided against an evacuation, and ordered the troops to dig in. Falling back on improvised and shallow entrenchments, the Anzacs held on for a crucial first night. By that first evening 16,000 men had been landed but more than 2000 had been killed or wounded. <strong>5</strong> ………… .&nbsp; &nbsp;The British and French forces farther south were also unable to break out of their positions.</p>
        <p>By November, with more Turkish reinforcements and German equipment in place, it was obvious the stalemate would continue. <strong>6</strong> ………… .&nbsp; &nbsp;He recommended to the British Cabinet that a general evacuation take place. In late December, the Anzacs were successfully evacuated with barely any casualties, and by 20 January 1916, all Allied troops had withdrawn from the peninsula. The battles fought by the Australian Imperial Force at Gallipoli are widely regarded as the foundation legend of Australian military history, and a potent symbol of federated Australia. The Gallipoli campaign was a military failure but the characteristics that the Anzacs displayed throughout the campaign – bravery, ingenuity, endurance and mateship – have come to be celebrated as defining characteristics of the Australian personality.</p>

          <strong>Gallipoli</strong>
        </p>
        <p>On 25 April 1915, Australian soldiers landed at what is now called Anzac Cove on the Gallipoli Peninsula. For the vast majority of the 16,000 Australians and New Zealanders who landed on that first day, this was their first experience of combat. <strong>1</strong> ………… . The Gallipoli campaign was hence, a military failure. However, the traits that were shown there – bravery, ingenuity, endurance and mateship – have become enshrined as defining aspects of the Australian character. Official war correspondent, Charles Bean wrote that: “It lay in the mettle of the men themselves. To be the sort of man who would give way when his mates were trusting to his firmness … to live the rest of his life haunted by the knowledge that he had set his hand to a soldier’s task and had lacked the grit to carry it through – that was the prospect these men could not face. Life was very dear, but life was not worth living unless they could be true to their idea of Australian manhood.”</p>
        <p>The British had been trying to force their way through the narrow straits known as the Dardanelles to capture Istanbul in Turkey. This would relieve pressure on their Russian allies engaged with Ottoman (Turkish) forces in the Caucasus. Minefields and on-shore artillery batteries thwarted the early naval attempts to seize the strait. <strong>2</strong> ………… .&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
        <p>British and French forces landed at Cape Helles on the southern tip of the peninsula. The Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) included the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Australian Brigades along with the 1st New Zealand Brigade as well as artillery units from the British Indian Army.&nbsp; <strong>3</strong> ………… .&nbsp; &nbsp;However, in the early morning darkness it is possible that they were beached one kilometre or so north of their planned objective. This was an area of steep, rugged terrain.</p>
        <p>Once on the beach, many units became separated from one another as they began moving up the tangle of complex spurs and ravines in the darkness. Turkish resistance remained strong. As a result, the Anzacs were subjected to devastating artillery bombardments. By mid-morning Turkish reinforcements had arrived under Mustapha Kemal (later Kemal Ataturk, president of Turkey).<strong> 4</strong> ………… .&nbsp; In the time it takes us to die, other troops and commanders can come and take our places.” The Anzac position became progressively more precarious as the Anzacs failed to secure their high-ground objectives. The Turks then mounted a fierce counter-attack, regaining much of the ground the Anzacs had taken.</p>
        <p>That evening, Major-General William Bridges, commander of the 1st Australian Division, and Lieutenant-General Sir William Birdwood, commander of ANZAC, both advised General Sir Ian Hamilton, Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force, that the Allied force be withdrawn from the peninsula. After consultation with the Royal Navy, Hamilton decided against an evacuation, and ordered the troops to dig in. Falling back on improvised and shallow entrenchments, the Anzacs held on for a crucial first night. By that first evening 16,000 men had been landed but more than 2000 had been killed or wounded. <strong>5</strong> ………… .&nbsp; &nbsp;The British and French forces farther south were also unable to break out of their positions.</p>
        <p>By November, with more Turkish reinforcements and German equipment in place, it was obvious the stalemate would continue. <strong>6</strong> ………… .&nbsp; &nbsp;He recommended to the British Cabinet that a general evacuation take place. In late December, the Anzacs were successfully evacuated with barely any casualties, and by 20 January 1916, all Allied troops had withdrawn from the peninsula. The battles fought by the Australian Imperial Force at Gallipoli are widely regarded as the foundation legend of Australian military history, and a potent symbol of federated Australia. The Gallipoli campaign was a military failure but the characteristics that the Anzacs displayed throughout the campaign – bravery, ingenuity, endurance and mateship – have come to be celebrated as defining characteristics of the Australian personality.</p>

        <p>Once on the beach, many units became separated from one another as they began moving up the tangle of complex spurs and ravines in the darkness. Turkish resistance remained strong. As a result, the Anzacs were subjected to devastating artillery bombardments. By mid-morning Turkish reinforcements had arrived under Mustapha Kemal (later Kemal Ataturk, president of Turkey).<strong> 4</strong> ………… .&nbsp; In the time it takes us to die, other troops and commanders can come and take our places.” The Anzac position became progressively more precarious as the Anzacs failed to secure their high-ground objectives. The Turks then mounted a fierce counter-attack, regaining much of the ground the Anzacs had taken.</p>
        <p>That evening, Major-General William Bridges, commander of the 1st Australian Division, and Lieutenant-General Sir William Birdwood, commander of ANZAC, both advised General Sir Ian Hamilton, Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force, that the Allied force be withdrawn from the peninsula. After consultation with the Royal Navy, Hamilton decided against an evacuation, and ordered the troops to dig in. Falling back on improvised and shallow entrenchments, the Anzacs held on for a crucial first night. By that first evening 16,000 men had been landed but more than 2000 had been killed or wounded. <strong>5</strong> ………… .&nbsp; &nbsp;The British and French forces farther south were also unable to break out of their positions.</p>
        <p>By November, with more Turkish reinforcements and German equipment in place, it was obvious the stalemate would continue. <strong>6</strong> ………… .&nbsp; &nbsp;He recommended to the British Cabinet that a general evacuation take place. In late December, the Anzacs were successfully evacuated with barely any casualties, and by 20 January 1916, all Allied troops had withdrawn from the peninsula. The battles fought by the Australian Imperial Force at Gallipoli are widely regarded as the foundation legend of Australian military history, and a potent symbol of federated Australia. The Gallipoli campaign was a military failure but the characteristics that the Anzacs displayed throughout the campaign – bravery, ingenuity, endurance and mateship – have come to be celebrated as defining characteristics of the Australian personality.</p>

          <strong>Gallipoli</strong>
        </p>
        <p>On 25 April 1915, Australian soldiers landed at what is now called Anzac Cove on the Gallipoli Peninsula. For the vast majority of the 16,000 Australians and New Zealanders who landed on that first day, this was their first experience of combat. <strong>1</strong> ………… . The Gallipoli campaign was hence, a military failure. However, the traits that were shown there – bravery, ingenuity, endurance and mateship – have become enshrined as defining aspects of the Australian character. Official war correspondent, Charles Bean wrote that: “It lay in the mettle of the men themselves. To be the sort of man who would give way when his mates were trusting to his firmness … to live the rest of his life haunted by the knowledge that he had set his hand to a soldier’s task and had lacked the grit to carry it through – that was the prospect these men could not face. Life was very dear, but life was not worth living unless they could be true to their idea of Australian manhood.”</p>
        <p>The British had been trying to force their way through the narrow straits known as the Dardanelles to capture Istanbul in Turkey. This would relieve pressure on their Russian allies engaged with Ottoman (Turkish) forces in the Caucasus. Minefields and on-shore artillery batteries thwarted the early naval attempts to seize the strait. <strong>2</strong> ………… .&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
        <p>British and French forces landed at Cape Helles on the southern tip of the peninsula. The Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) included the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Australian Brigades along with the 1st New Zealand Brigade as well as artillery units from the British Indian Army.&nbsp; <strong>3</strong> ………… .&nbsp; &nbsp;However, in the early morning darkness it is possible that they were beached one kilometre or so north of their planned objective. This was an area of steep, rugged terrain.</p>
        <p>Once on the beach, many units became separated from one another as they began moving up the tangle of complex spurs and ravines in the darkness. Turkish resistance remained strong. As a result, the Anzacs were subjected to devastating artillery bombardments. By mid-morning Turkish reinforcements had arrived under Mustapha Kemal (later Kemal Ataturk, president of Turkey).<strong> 4</strong> ………… .&nbsp; In the time it takes us to die, other troops and commanders can come and take our places.” The Anzac position became progressively more precarious as the Anzacs failed to secure their high-ground objectives. The Turks then mounted a fierce counter-attack, regaining much of the ground the Anzacs had taken.</p>
        <p>That evening, Major-General William Bridges, commander of the 1st Australian Division, and Lieutenant-General Sir William Birdwood, commander of ANZAC, both advised General Sir Ian Hamilton, Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force, that the Allied force be withdrawn from the peninsula. After consultation with the Royal Navy, Hamilton decided against an evacuation, and ordered the troops to dig in. Falling back on improvised and shallow entrenchments, the Anzacs held on for a crucial first night. By that first evening 16,000 men had been landed but more than 2000 had been killed or wounded. <strong>5</strong> ………… .&nbsp; &nbsp;The British and French forces farther south were also unable to break out of their positions.</p>
        <p>By November, with more Turkish reinforcements and German equipment in place, it was obvious the stalemate would continue. <strong>6</strong> ………… .&nbsp; &nbsp;He recommended to the British Cabinet that a general evacuation take place. In late December, the Anzacs were successfully evacuated with barely any casualties, and by 20 January 1916, all Allied troops had withdrawn from the peninsula. The battles fought by the Australian Imperial Force at Gallipoli are widely regarded as the foundation legend of Australian military history, and a potent symbol of federated Australia. The Gallipoli campaign was a military failure but the characteristics that the Anzacs displayed throughout the campaign – bravery, ingenuity, endurance and mateship – have come to be celebrated as defining characteristics of the Australian personality.</p>

The most amazing discoveries of diamonds were mostly found by accident. The northern Cape in 1867 was a hot and desolate place where Erasmus Jacobs, 15, amused himself by playing with the 'klippies' (small stones) which abounded on their farm, De Kalk, not that far from Kimberley in South Africa. Erasmus was somewhat amused when a neighbour, Schalk van Niekerk, asked if he could borrow one of the play stones which he had found a year earlier - a particularly shiny one. It became known as the Eureka Diamond.&nbsp;<br>
Although Erasmus Jacobs never found another diamond, Schalk van Niekerk was luckier three years later. Having learned something of precious stones, Schalk traded a shepherd boy for a stone, giving him five hundred sheep, ten oxen and a horse. It was practically all of van Niekerk's possessions, but a few days later he sold the rough crystal in Hopetown for £11,200. In 1974, it was sold for 1.6 million Swiss Francs.<br>
InJuly 1871, a labourer, working for diggers from Colesberg, came to work one Monday morning. His boss told him to ‘run to that hill over there, and don’t come back until you have found diamonds. It wasn’t long before he was back with stones in his hat, among which were three diamonds. This small hillock came to be known, locally, as the Colesberg Kopje. A new rush of diggers descended on what later became known as the De Beers mine, which soon dug out the whole hill, and then continued mining underground the flat terrain.<br>

The greatest and most important adventure of our lives is discovering who we really are. Yet, so many of us walk around without asking the most important question we’ll ever ask: Who am I really? As Mary Oliver put it, “what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?” Finding yourself may sound like an inherently self-centred goal, but it is actually an unselfish process that is at the root of everything we do in life and that will benefit others. This personal journey is one every individual will benefit from taking. It is a process that involves breaking down – shedding layers that do not serve us in our lives and don’t reflect who we really are. Yet, it also involves a tremendous act of building up – recognising who we want to be and passionately going about fulfilling our unique destiny – whatever that may be. It’s a matter of recognising our personal power yet being open and vulnerable to our experiences. It isn’t something to fear or avoid, berating ourselves along the way, but rather something to seek out with the curiosity and compassion we would have toward a fascinating new friend.<br>

Science is all about facts and discoveries, with some of the remarkable breakthroughs coming from seemingly everyday occurrences and experiences. One of the oldest and well-known tales revolves around Archimedes' legendary “Eureka moment” while taking a bath in a tub. This was when he made a remarkable discovery, which is now known as the Archimedes Principle. Supposedly, Archimedes was so thrilled and excited with this discovery that he immediately hopped out of the bath and ran onto the streets to tell the ancient Greek king, shouting loudly 'Eureka! Eureka!' (I have found it! I have found it!), in delight. Archimedes went on to make a number of important contributions in science and mathematics. He was the first to realise that the number Pi features in the formula for the circumference of the circle, the area of the circle, and the volume and area of the sphere (notably, he determined an accurate estimation of the value of Pi).<br>

It’s time to dive into the film, ‘Finding Nemo’ - a hilarious adventure of discovery that takes you into the breathtaking underwater world of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. When Nemo, a young clownfish, is unexpectedly carried far from home, his overprotective father, Marlin, and Dory, a friendly but forgetful regal blue tang fish embark on an epic journey that leads to encounters with vegetarian sharks, surfer dude turtles, hypnotic jellyfish and hungry seagulls!&nbsp;<br>
‘Finding Nemo’ teaches the classic, cartoon Pixar/Disney lessons about the importance of family and discovering acceptance, kindness, and love, but it also an exciting tale of adventure, overcoming adversity, and teamwork. The film is beautiful from start to finish and a truly exceptional technical feat. Finding Nemo sets itself apart from other Disney films by having the whole package: tight storytelling, great characters, winning performances, technical brilliance, laughter, tears, and a very quotable script.<br>

The most amazing discoveries of diamonds were mostly found by accident. The northern Cape in 1867 was a hot and desolate place where Erasmus Jacobs, 15, amused himself by playing with the 'klippies' (small stones) which abounded on their farm, De Kalk, not that far from Kimberley in South Africa. Erasmus was somewhat amused when a neighbour, Schalk van Niekerk, asked if he could borrow one of the play stones which he had found a year earlier - a particularly shiny one. It became known as the Eureka Diamond.&nbsp;<br>
Although Erasmus Jacobs never found another diamond, Schalk van Niekerk was luckier three years later. Having learned something of precious stones, Schalk traded a shepherd boy for a stone, giving him five hundred sheep, ten oxen and a horse. It was practically all of van Niekerk's possessions, but a few days later he sold the rough crystal in Hopetown for £11,200. In 1974, it was sold for 1.6 million Swiss Francs.<br>
InJuly 1871, a labourer, working for diggers from Colesberg, came to work one Monday morning. His boss told him to ‘run to that hill over there, and don’t come back until you have found diamonds. It wasn’t long before he was back with stones in his hat, among which were three diamonds. This small hillock came to be known, locally, as the Colesberg Kopje. A new rush of diggers descended on what later became known as the De Beers mine, which soon dug out the whole hill, and then continued mining underground the flat terrain.<br>

The greatest and most important adventure of our lives is discovering who we really are. Yet, so many of us walk around without asking the most important question we’ll ever ask: Who am I really? As Mary Oliver put it, “what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?” Finding yourself may sound like an inherently self-centred goal, but it is actually an unselfish process that is at the root of everything we do in life and that will benefit others. This personal journey is one every individual will benefit from taking. It is a process that involves breaking down – shedding layers that do not serve us in our lives and don’t reflect who we really are. Yet, it also involves a tremendous act of building up – recognising who we want to be and passionately going about fulfilling our unique destiny – whatever that may be. It’s a matter of recognising our personal power yet being open and vulnerable to our experiences. It isn’t something to fear or avoid, berating ourselves along the way, but rather something to seek out with the curiosity and compassion we would have toward a fascinating new friend.<br>

Science is all about facts and discoveries, with some of the remarkable breakthroughs coming from seemingly everyday occurrences and experiences. One of the oldest and well-known tales revolves around Archimedes' legendary “Eureka moment” while taking a bath in a tub. This was when he made a remarkable discovery, which is now known as the Archimedes Principle. Supposedly, Archimedes was so thrilled and excited with this discovery that he immediately hopped out of the bath and ran onto the streets to tell the ancient Greek king, shouting loudly 'Eureka! Eureka!' (I have found it! I have found it!), in delight. Archimedes went on to make a number of important contributions in science and mathematics. He was the first to realise that the number Pi features in the formula for the circumference of the circle, the area of the circle, and the volume and area of the sphere (notably, he determined an accurate estimation of the value of Pi).<br>

It’s time to dive into the film, ‘Finding Nemo’ - a hilarious adventure of discovery that takes you into the breathtaking underwater world of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. When Nemo, a young clownfish, is unexpectedly carried far from home, his overprotective father, Marlin, and Dory, a friendly but forgetful regal blue tang fish embark on an epic journey that leads to encounters with vegetarian sharks, surfer dude turtles, hypnotic jellyfish and hungry seagulls!&nbsp;<br>
‘Finding Nemo’ teaches the classic, cartoon Pixar/Disney lessons about the importance of family and discovering acceptance, kindness, and love, but it also an exciting tale of adventure, overcoming adversity, and teamwork. The film is beautiful from start to finish and a truly exceptional technical feat. Finding Nemo sets itself apart from other Disney films by having the whole package: tight storytelling, great characters, winning performances, technical brilliance, laughter, tears, and a very quotable script.<br>

It’s a matter of recognising our personal power yet being open and vulnerable to our experiences. It isn’t something to fear or avoid, berating ourselves along the way, but rather something to seek out with the curiosity and compassion we would have toward a fascinating new friend.<br>

Science is all about facts and discoveries, with some of the remarkable breakthroughs coming from seemingly everyday occurrences and experiences. One of the oldest and well-known tales revolves around Archimedes' legendary “Eureka moment” while taking a bath in a tub. This was when he made a remarkable discovery, which is now known as the Archimedes Principle. Supposedly, Archimedes was so thrilled and excited with this discovery that he immediately hopped out of the bath and ran onto the streets to tell the ancient Greek king, shouting loudly 'Eureka! Eureka!' (I have found it! I have found it!), in delight. Archimedes went on to make a number of important contributions in science and mathematics. He was the first to realise that the number Pi features in the formula for the circumference of the circle, the area of the circle, and the volume and area of the sphere (notably, he determined an accurate estimation of the value of Pi).<br>

It’s time to dive into the film, ‘Finding Nemo’ - a hilarious adventure of discovery that takes you into the breathtaking underwater world of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. When Nemo, a young clownfish, is unexpectedly carried far from home, his overprotective father, Marlin, and Dory, a friendly but forgetful regal blue tang fish embark on an epic journey that leads to encounters with vegetarian sharks, surfer dude turtles, hypnotic jellyfish and hungry seagulls!&nbsp;<br>
‘Finding Nemo’ teaches the classic, cartoon Pixar/Disney lessons about the importance of family and discovering acceptance, kindness, and love, but it also an exciting tale of adventure, overcoming adversity, and teamwork. The film is beautiful from start to finish and a truly exceptional technical feat. Finding Nemo sets itself apart from other Disney films by having the whole package: tight storytelling, great characters, winning performances, technical brilliance, laughter, tears, and a very quotable script.<br>

The most amazing discoveries of diamonds were mostly found by accident. The northern Cape in 1867 was a hot and desolate place where Erasmus Jacobs, 15, amused himself by playing with the 'klippies' (small stones) which abounded on their farm, De Kalk, not that far from Kimberley in South Africa. Erasmus was somewhat amused when a neighbour, Schalk van Niekerk, asked if he could borrow one of the play stones which he had found a year earlier - a particularly shiny one. It became known as the Eureka Diamond.&nbsp;<br>
Although Erasmus Jacobs never found another diamond, Schalk van Niekerk was luckier three years later. Having learned something of precious stones, Schalk traded a shepherd boy for a stone, giving him five hundred sheep, ten oxen and a horse. It was practically all of van Niekerk's possessions, but a few days later he sold the rough crystal in Hopetown for £11,200. In 1974, it was sold for 1.6 million Swiss Francs.<br>
InJuly 1871, a labourer, working for diggers from Colesberg, came to work one Monday morning. His boss told him to ‘run to that hill over there, and don’t come back until you have found diamonds. It wasn’t long before he was back with stones in his hat, among which were three diamonds. This small hillock came to be known, locally, as the Colesberg Kopje. A new rush of diggers descended on what later became known as the De Beers mine, which soon dug out the whole hill, and then continued mining underground the flat terrain.<br>

The greatest and most important adventure of our lives is discovering who we really are. Yet, so many of us walk around without asking the most important question we’ll ever ask: Who am I really? As Mary Oliver put it, “what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?” Finding yourself may sound like an inherently self-centred goal, but it is actually an unselfish process that is at the root of everything we do in life and that will benefit others. This personal journey is one every individual will benefit from taking. It is a process that involves breaking down – shedding layers that do not serve us in our lives and don’t reflect who we really are. Yet, it also involves a tremendous act of building up – recognising who we want to be and passionately going about fulfilling our unique destiny – whatever that may be. It’s a matter of recognising our personal power yet being open and vulnerable to our experiences. It isn’t something to fear or avoid, berating ourselves along the way, but rather something to seek out with the curiosity and compassion we would have toward a fascinating new friend.<br>

On December 5, 1945, five Navy planes took off from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, USA, on a training mission. They flew over the Bermuda Triangle. The men, along with the planes, disappeared and were never seen again. From that day forward, people became fascinated with the Bermuda Triangle. Over the years, numerous ships and aircraft have vanished with no apparent explanation.&nbsp;<br>
Are you wondering what the Bermuda Triangle is all about? Can humans ever survive a trip to the Bermuda Triangle? There are many theories that try to explain the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle.&nbsp;<br>
The Bermuda Triangle is an area in the Atlantic Ocean that is twice the size of Texas. That's about 500,000 square miles. The Bermuda Triangle has a triangular shape with ends — geometry teachers would call them vertices — in Miami, Florida, Bermuda and Puerto Rico. Within this triangle of water, compasses often act strangely. Most compasses don't point directly north toward the North Pole. Instead, they point to something called “magnetic north", which is in Canada. In the Bermuda Triangle, however, a compass will often point directly to the North Pole. That's mysterious! There are many more mysterious incidents and unexplained disappearances besides these tragic stories. So far, scientists have not come up with clear reasons to explain the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle.<br>

Why do oceans and seas matter? We live on a blue planet, with oceans and seas covering more than 70 per cent of the Earth’s surface. Oceans feed us, regulate our climate and generate most of the oxygen we breathe. They also serve as the foundation for much of the world’s economy, supporting sectors from tourism to fisheries to international shipping.<br>
But despite their importance, oceans are facing unprecedented threats as a result of human activity. Every year, an estimated 8 million tonnes of plastic waste end up in the world’s oceans. At the same time, climate change is damaging coral reefs and other key ecosystems; overfishing is threatening the stability of fish stocks; nutrient pollution is contributing to the creation of dead zones; and nearly 80 per cent of the world’s wastewater is discharged without treatment. UN Environment is tackling these challenges head-on. They have initiated several campaigns and work with governments, businesses, universities and civil society groups around the world to promote the protection and sustainable management of our precious marine and coastal environments.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
What lies at the lowest point of the ocean? At the deepest point of the ocean, strange creatures, you have never seen before, thrive. As vast as the planet and undiscovered like space, are the depths of the ocean. While we continue to make progress in biological discoveries, some parts of the ocean are so inaccessible, that we have only discovered a sliver of the truth. But we do know something about the Mariana Trench, the lowest part of the ocean, which surrounds the Mariana islands near Japan.&nbsp;<br>
So, what lies in these treacherously deep, dark waters. Find out if you can afford a scare. Flappy ears, deep-set eyes and eight tiny tentacles; named after the Disney favourite, the Dumbo Octopus is arguably the most eye-soothing sight, found at least 9,800 metres under the sea in the Mariana trench. Hardly spooky, these adorable 8–12-inch creatures stream through the ocean by flapping their ears. Charming as they may be, the dumbo octopus is a predator that can swallow its prey in one gulp. Then, there’s the Black Seadevil Fish. Any fan of ‘Finding Nemo’ might quickly recognise this fish. Featured as a scary creature in the film, the Black Seadevil is just as terrifying in real life. Sharp teeth, gaping mouth and eyes exploding out of their sockets; this angler fish is known for its luminous antenna-like muscle protruding from its head. This light attracts its prey into close vicinity for an easy catch. These are only two of the amazing creatures of the deepest parts of the ocean.<br>

In our recent National Poetry Day poll, Samuel Coleridge's poetic ballad, "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" was enthusiastically mentioned by several pollsters. It's a poem most people read when young; quickly falling under the powerful spell of its simple ballad rhyme and rhythm, its dramatic storytelling and ever-shifting imagery. The Rime of the Ancient Mariner recounts the experiences of a sailor who has returned from a long sea voyage. The mariner (sailor) stops a man who is on his way to a wedding ceremony and begins to narrate a story. The story is about a man on a voyage by ship, who in one impulsive and terrible act, changes the course of his life – and death. The Mariner faces an inner struggle over the crime he has committed and he must understand his actions and perform his penance.&nbsp;<br>

On December 5, 1945, five Navy planes took off from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, USA, on a training mission. They flew over the Bermuda Triangle. The men, along with the planes, disappeared and were never seen again. From that day forward, people became fascinated with the Bermuda Triangle. Over the years, numerous ships and aircraft have vanished with no apparent explanation.&nbsp;<br>
Are you wondering what the Bermuda Triangle is all about? Can humans ever survive a trip to the Bermuda Triangle? There are many theories that try to explain the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle.&nbsp;<br>
The Bermuda Triangle is an area in the Atlantic Ocean that is twice the size of Texas. That's about 500,000 square miles. The Bermuda Triangle has a triangular shape with ends — geometry teachers would call them vertices — in Miami, Florida, Bermuda and Puerto Rico. Within this triangle of water, compasses often act strangely. Most compasses don't point directly north toward the North Pole. Instead, they point to something called “magnetic north", which is in Canada. In the Bermuda Triangle, however, a compass will often point directly to the North Pole. That's mysterious! There are many more mysterious incidents and unexplained disappearances besides these tragic stories. So far, scientists have not come up with clear reasons to explain the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle.<br>

Why do oceans and seas matter? We live on a blue planet, with oceans and seas covering more than 70 per cent of the Earth’s surface. Oceans feed us, regulate our climate and generate most of the oxygen we breathe. They also serve as the foundation for much of the world’s economy, supporting sectors from tourism to fisheries to international shipping.<br>
But despite their importance, oceans are facing unprecedented threats as a result of human activity. Every year, an estimated 8 million tonnes of plastic waste end up in the world’s oceans. At the same time, climate change is damaging coral reefs and other key ecosystems; overfishing is threatening the stability of fish stocks; nutrient pollution is contributing to the creation of dead zones; and nearly 80 per cent of the world’s wastewater is discharged without treatment. UN Environment is tackling these challenges head-on. They have initiated several campaigns and work with governments, businesses, universities and civil society groups around the world to promote the protection and sustainable management of our precious marine and coastal environments.&nbsp;<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
What lies at the lowest point of the ocean? At the deepest point of the ocean, strange creatures, you have never seen before, thrive. As vast as the planet and undiscovered like space, are the depths of the ocean. While we continue to make progress in biological discoveries, some parts of the ocean are so inaccessible, that we have only discovered a sliver of the truth. But we do know something about the Mariana Trench, the lowest part of the ocean, which surrounds the Mariana islands near Japan.&nbsp;<br>
So, what lies in these treacherously deep, dark waters. Find out if you can afford a scare. Flappy ears, deep-set eyes and eight tiny tentacles; named after the Disney favourite, the Dumbo Octopus is arguably the most eye-soothing sight, found at least 9,800 metres under the sea in the Mariana trench. Hardly spooky, these adorable 8–12-inch creatures stream through the ocean by flapping their ears. Charming as they may be, the dumbo octopus is a predator that can swallow its prey in one gulp. Then, there’s the Black Seadevil Fish. Any fan of ‘Finding Nemo’ might quickly recognise this fish. Featured as a scary creature in the film, the Black Seadevil is just as terrifying in real life. Sharp teeth, gaping mouth and eyes exploding out of their sockets; this angler fish is known for its luminous antenna-like muscle protruding from its head. This light attracts its prey into close vicinity for an easy catch. These are only two of the amazing creatures of the deepest parts of the ocean.<br>

In our recent National Poetry Day poll, Samuel Coleridge's poetic ballad, "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" was enthusiastically mentioned by several pollsters. It's a poem most people read when young; quickly falling under the powerful spell of its simple ballad rhyme and rhythm, its dramatic storytelling and ever-shifting imagery. The Rime of the Ancient Mariner recounts the experiences of a sailor who has returned from a long sea voyage. The mariner (sailor) stops a man who is on his way to a wedding ceremony and begins to narrate a story. The story is about a man on a voyage by ship, who in one impulsive and terrible act, changes the course of his life – and death. The Mariner faces an inner struggle over the crime he has committed and he must understand his actions and perform his penance.&nbsp;<br>
