        <p><em>Read the poem below by Kingsley Fairbridge then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>The Hunting of Shumba&nbsp;</strong><br>
The hairs about his muzzle tipped with wet;<br>
The last sun glinting on his tawny mane,<br>
And burnishing his hide; veiled eyes that yet<br>
So slumbrous-solemn flash and slowly wane.<br>
<br>
Veiled slumbrous-solemn eyes, that half-asleep<br>
Seem utter-careless of the wild around;<br>
Soft seeming-careless steps that seek the deep<br>
Gloomed bush, — but&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline"><strong>give no shadow of a sound</strong></span>.<br>
<br>
Loose-limbed, he slouches shambling in the cool;<br>
Head down, hide rippling over lazy might;<br>
Thoughtful and terrible he leaves the pool —<br>
Shumba the Lion, passing to the night.<br>
<br>
A grass-blade breaking!<br>
Swift, in awful calm,<br>
The mighty limbs at length along the ground;<br>
Steel muscles tightening —<br>
A sense of harm, Intangible... no shadow of a sound...<br>
<br>
But savage eyes unveiled,<br>
Intense as death;<br>
Pursed lips and lowered ears and bated breath,<br>
Dread vigour hailed<br>
From every nerve and tissue — crouching there<br>
Blent with grass, — incarnate, awful FEAR!&nbsp;<br>
<br>
A leap — a scream — a thud;<br>
And it is done.<br>
Silence awhile, and the hot smell of blood.<br>
Silence, then slowly, with the sinking sun,<br>
The rend of flesh.... The crickets wake and sing,<br>
The frogs take up their song, the night-jars wing<br>
Weird in the azure dusk. As had been willed,<br>
​Chance brought him food; and Fate has been fulfilled.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>The life of genius&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Antoni Gaudí was a Spanish architect who has become internationally recognised as one of the greatest experts in his discipline.<strong> 15 ……….</strong> His exceptional ground-breaking genius made him the inventor of a unique, personal and incomparable architectural language that defies classification.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Antoni Gaudí was born on the 25th of June 1852 in Reus. He came from a family of boilermakers. He helped his father and grandfather in the family workshop. <strong>16 ……….</strong> His talent for designing spaces and transforming materials grew and prospered until it eventually developed into a veritable genius for three-dimensional creation.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As a child, Gaudí’s health was delicate, which meant that he was obliged to spend long periods of time resting at the summer house in Riudoms, a small town near Reus. There, he passed many an hour contemplating and storing up in his mind the secrets of nature. <strong>17 ………. </strong>As such, Antoni Gaudí found the essence and the meaning of architecture by following the very patterns of nature and by always respecting its laws. In that context he created the most beautiful, sustainable and effective work possible through his architecture. Gaudí himself once said: “originality consists of going back to the origins.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In 1870, he moved to Barcelona to pursue his academic career in architecture, at the same time working at various jobs to enable him to pay for his studies. He was an inconsistent student. <strong>18 ………. </strong>When he completed his studies at the School of Architecture in 1878 the Director, Elies Rogent, declared: “I do not know if we have awarded this degree to a madman or to a genius; only time will tell.” Undeniably, however, the young architect’s ideas were not a mere repetition of things that had already been done up to that time, nor could anybody receive them with indifference.</p>
        <p>During his mature period, masterpieces followed one after another: the Bellesguard Tower, Park Güell, the restoration of Mallorca Cathedral, the church on the Güell Estate, Casa Batlló, La Pedrera, and lastly, the Church of the Sagrada Familia. Surprisingly, the magnificence of Antoni Gaudí’s architecture coincided, as the result of a personal decision by the architect, with a progressive withdrawal by the man himself. <strong>19 ………. </strong>But now went from being a young dandy with gourmet tastes to neglecting his personal appearance, eating frugally and distancing himself from social life. He simultaneously devoted himself ever more fervently to a religious and mystical sentiment.</p>
        <p>Gaudí died on the 10th of June 1926 after being knocked down by a tram while making his way, as he did every evening, to the Sagrada Família from the Church of Sant Felip Neri. After being struck, he lost consciousness. <strong>20 ………. </strong>He was taken to the Santa Cruz&nbsp;Hospital, where he was later recognised by the Priest of the Sagrada Família. He was buried two days later in that very church, following a funeral attended by throngs of people: most of the citizens of Barcelona came out to bid a final farewell to the most universal architect that the city had ever known.</p>

He helped his father and grandfather in the family workshop. <strong>16 ……….</strong> His talent for designing spaces and transforming materials grew and prospered until it eventually developed into a veritable genius for three-dimensional creation.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As a child, Gaudí’s health was delicate, which meant that he was obliged to spend long periods of time resting at the summer house in Riudoms, a small town near Reus. There, he passed many an hour contemplating and storing up in his mind the secrets of nature. <strong>17 ………. </strong>As such, Antoni Gaudí found the essence and the meaning of architecture by following the very patterns of nature and by always respecting its laws. In that context he created the most beautiful, sustainable and effective work possible through his architecture. Gaudí himself once said: “originality consists of going back to the origins.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In 1870, he moved to Barcelona to pursue his academic career in architecture, at the same time working at various jobs to enable him to pay for his studies. He was an inconsistent student. <strong>18 ………. </strong>When he completed his studies at the School of Architecture in 1878 the Director, Elies Rogent, declared: “I do not know if we have awarded this degree to a madman or to a genius; only time will tell.” Undeniably, however, the young architect’s ideas were not a mere repetition of things that had already been done up to that time, nor could anybody receive them with indifference.</p>
        <p>During his mature period, masterpieces followed one after another: the Bellesguard Tower, Park Güell, the restoration of Mallorca Cathedral, the church on the Güell Estate, Casa Batlló, La Pedrera, and lastly, the Church of the Sagrada Familia. Surprisingly, the magnificence of Antoni Gaudí’s architecture coincided, as the result of a personal decision by the architect, with a progressive withdrawal by the man himself. <strong>19 ………. </strong>But now went from being a young dandy with gourmet tastes to neglecting his personal appearance, eating frugally and distancing himself from social life. He simultaneously devoted himself ever more fervently to a religious and mystical sentiment.</p>
        <p>Gaudí died on the 10th of June 1926 after being knocked down by a tram while making his way, as he did every evening, to the Sagrada Família from the Church of Sant Felip Neri. After being struck, he lost consciousness. <strong>20 ………. </strong>He was taken to the Santa Cruz&nbsp;Hospital, where he was later recognised by the Priest of the Sagrada Família. He was buried two days later in that very church, following a funeral attended by throngs of people: most of the citizens of Barcelona came out to bid a final farewell to the most universal architect that the city had ever known.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>The life of genius&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Antoni Gaudí was a Spanish architect who has become internationally recognised as one of the greatest experts in his discipline.<strong> 15 ……….</strong> His exceptional ground-breaking genius made him the inventor of a unique, personal and incomparable architectural language that defies classification.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Antoni Gaudí was born on the 25th of June 1852 in Reus. He came from a family of boilermakers. He helped his father and grandfather in the family workshop. <strong>16 ……….</strong> His talent for designing spaces and transforming materials grew and prospered until it eventually developed into a veritable genius for three-dimensional creation.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As a child, Gaudí’s health was delicate, which meant that he was obliged to spend long periods of time resting at the summer house in Riudoms, a small town near Reus. There, he passed many an hour contemplating and storing up in his mind the secrets of nature. <strong>17 ………. </strong>As such, Antoni Gaudí found the essence and the meaning of architecture by following the very patterns of nature and by always respecting its laws. In that context he created the most beautiful, sustainable and effective work possible through his architecture. Gaudí himself once said: “originality consists of going back to the origins.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In 1870, he moved to Barcelona to pursue his academic career in architecture, at the same time working at various jobs to enable him to pay for his studies. He was an inconsistent student. <strong>18 ………. </strong>When he completed his studies at the School of Architecture in 1878 the Director, Elies Rogent, declared: “I do not know if we have awarded this degree to a madman or to a genius; only time will tell.” Undeniably, however, the young architect’s ideas were not a mere repetition of things that had already been done up to that time, nor could anybody receive them with indifference.</p>
        <p>During his mature period, masterpieces followed one after another: the Bellesguard Tower, Park Güell, the restoration of Mallorca Cathedral, the church on the Güell Estate, Casa Batlló, La Pedrera, and lastly, the Church of the Sagrada Familia. Surprisingly, the magnificence of Antoni Gaudí’s architecture coincided, as the result of a personal decision by the architect, with a progressive withdrawal by the man himself. <strong>19 ………. </strong>But now went from being a young dandy with gourmet tastes to neglecting his personal appearance, eating frugally and distancing himself from social life. He simultaneously devoted himself ever more fervently to a religious and mystical sentiment.</p>
        <p>Gaudí died on the 10th of June 1926 after being knocked down by a tram while making his way, as he did every evening, to the Sagrada Família from the Church of Sant Felip Neri. After being struck, he lost consciousness. <strong>20 ………. </strong>He was taken to the Santa Cruz&nbsp;Hospital, where he was later recognised by the Priest of the Sagrada Família. He was buried two days later in that very church, following a funeral attended by throngs of people: most of the citizens of Barcelona came out to bid a final farewell to the most universal architect that the city had ever known.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>The life of genius&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Antoni Gaudí was a Spanish architect who has become internationally recognised as one of the greatest experts in his discipline.<strong> 15 ……….</strong> His exceptional ground-breaking genius made him the inventor of a unique, personal and incomparable architectural language that defies classification.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Antoni Gaudí was born on the 25th of June 1852 in Reus. He came from a family of boilermakers. He helped his father and grandfather in the family workshop. <strong>16 ……….</strong> His talent for designing spaces and transforming materials grew and prospered until it eventually developed into a veritable genius for three-dimensional creation.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As a child, Gaudí’s health was delicate, which meant that he was obliged to spend long periods of time resting at the summer house in Riudoms, a small town near Reus. There, he passed many an hour contemplating and storing up in his mind the secrets of nature. <strong>17 ………. </strong>As such, Antoni Gaudí found the essence and the meaning of architecture by following the very patterns of nature and by always respecting its laws. In that context he created the most beautiful, sustainable and effective work possible through his architecture. Gaudí himself once said: “originality consists of going back to the origins.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In 1870, he moved to Barcelona to pursue his academic career in architecture, at the same time working at various jobs to enable him to pay for his studies. He was an inconsistent student. <strong>18 ………. </strong>When he completed his studies at the School of Architecture in 1878 the Director, Elies Rogent, declared: “I do not know if we have awarded this degree to a madman or to a genius; only time will tell.” Undeniably, however, the young architect’s ideas were not a mere repetition of things that had already been done up to that time, nor could anybody receive them with indifference.</p>
        <p>During his mature period, masterpieces followed one after another: the Bellesguard Tower, Park Güell, the restoration of Mallorca Cathedral, the church on the Güell Estate, Casa Batlló, La Pedrera, and lastly, the Church of the Sagrada Familia. Surprisingly, the magnificence of Antoni Gaudí’s architecture coincided, as the result of a personal decision by the architect, with a progressive withdrawal by the man himself. <strong>19 ………. </strong>But now went from being a young dandy with gourmet tastes to neglecting his personal appearance, eating frugally and distancing himself from social life. He simultaneously devoted himself ever more fervently to a religious and mystical sentiment.</p>
        <p>Gaudí died on the 10th of June 1926 after being knocked down by a tram while making his way, as he did every evening, to the Sagrada Família from the Church of Sant Felip Neri. After being struck, he lost consciousness. <strong>20 ………. </strong>He was taken to the Santa Cruz&nbsp;Hospital, where he was later recognised by the Priest of the Sagrada Família. He was buried two days later in that very church, following a funeral attended by throngs of people: most of the citizens of Barcelona came out to bid a final farewell to the most universal architect that the city had ever known.</p>

The Earth is divided into four main layers. The dense, hot inner core (yellow), the molten outer core (orange), the mantle (red), and the thin crust (brown), which supports all life in the known universe.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The hard, brittle crust extends from Earth's surface to the so-called Mohorovicic discontinuity, nicknamed the Moho. The Moho is not located at a uniform depth, but about 10 kilometers below the seafloor and about 35 kilometers beneath the surface of continents.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Beneath the Moho is the mantle, the viscous layer that makes up more than half of Earth's volume. The mantle is divided from the core by the Gutenberg discontinuity, about 2,880 kilometers beneath Earth's surface.

What does it take for an alien planet to host life as we know it on Earth? A lot, as it turns out. Despite a paper last year claiming that there may be 300 million planets in our galaxy that are “potentially habitable,” new research published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society confounds that view.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Suggesting that Earth-like conditions on potentially habitable planets may be much rarer than previously thought, this new analysis of known exoplanets focuses on photosynthesis. 4,422 exoplanets have been discovered thus far by astronomers, but only a handful are considered to be potentially habitable.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Photosynthesis is how plants use sunlight, water and carbon dioxide to create oxygen and energy. Given that photosynthesis has been critical in enabling complex biospheres of the type found on Earth, for an exoplanet to be potentially habitable therefore means it would develop an oxygen-based atmosphere. Photosynthesis requires liquid water. Only exoplanets that are the right temperature — not too hot, not too cold — could host such a thing on their surface. So how many rocky, Earth-sized exoplanets are in this so-called “Goldilock’s Zone?” Not many, suggests this research. The study reveals only one planet that comes close to receiving enough sunshine to sustain a large biosphere that could be detected — Kepler−442b<br>

When did humans first walk the surface of Planet Earth? The oldest Homo sapiens fossils that anthropologists have found thus far date to around 315,000 years ago. That means we can say that modern humans are at least that old.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But our lineage likely extends further back in time — we just don’t have the fossils to prove it. DNA evidence drawn from comparisons of different human genomes, as well as those of close cousins like Neanderthals and Denisovans, put the split between the three groups at least 400,000 years ago. So, it’s possible that Homo sapiens are over half a million years old.<br>

How serious will the Earth’s over-population problem be in the future? For the first time in modern history, the world’s population is expected to virtually stop growing by the end of this century, due in large part to falling global fertility rates, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of new data from the United Nations.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
By 2100, the world’s population is projected to reach approximately 10.9 billion, with annual growth of less than 0.1% – a steep decline from the current rate. Between 1950 and today, the world’s population grew between 1% and 2% each year, with the number of people rising from 2.5 billion to more than 7.7 billion.<br>

The Earth is divided into four main layers. The dense, hot inner core (yellow), the molten outer core (orange), the mantle (red), and the thin crust (brown), which supports all life in the known universe.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The hard, brittle crust extends from Earth's surface to the so-called Mohorovicic discontinuity, nicknamed the Moho. The Moho is not located at a uniform depth, but about 10 kilometers below the seafloor and about 35 kilometers beneath the surface of continents.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Beneath the Moho is the mantle, the viscous layer that makes up more than half of Earth's volume. The mantle is divided from the core by the Gutenberg discontinuity, about 2,880 kilometers beneath Earth's surface. The outer core is molten and liquid iron and nickel, while the inner core is solid and much more dense than either iron or nickel at the surface.<br>

What does it take for an alien planet to host life as we know it on Earth? A lot, as it turns out. Despite a paper last year claiming that there may be 300 million planets in our galaxy that are “potentially habitable,” new research published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society confounds that view.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Suggesting that Earth-like conditions on potentially habitable planets may be much rarer than previously thought, this new analysis of known exoplanets focuses on photosynthesis. 4,422 exoplanets have been discovered thus far by astronomers, but only a handful are considered to be potentially habitable.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Photosynthesis is how plants use sunlight, water and carbon dioxide to create oxygen and energy. Given that photosynthesis has been critical in enabling complex biospheres of the type found on Earth, for an exoplanet to be potentially habitable therefore means it would develop an oxygen-based atmosphere. Photosynthesis requires liquid water. Only exoplanets that are the right temperature — not too hot, not too cold — could host such a thing on their surface. So how many rocky, Earth-sized exoplanets are in this so-called “Goldilock’s Zone?” Not many, suggests this research. The study reveals only one planet that comes close to receiving enough sunshine to sustain a large biosphere that could be detected — Kepler−442b<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
When did humans first walk the surface of Planet Earth? The oldest Homo sapiens fossils that anthropologists have found thus far date to around 315,000 years ago. That means we can say that modern humans are at least that old.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But our lineage likely extends further back in time — we just don’t have the fossils to prove it. DNA evidence drawn from comparisons of different human genomes, as well as those of close cousins like Neanderthals and Denisovans, put the split between the three groups at least 400,000 years ago. So, it’s possible that Homo sapiens are over half a million years old.<br>

How serious will the Earth’s over-population problem be in the future? For the first time in modern history, the world’s population is expected to virtually stop growing by the end of this century, due in large part to falling global fertility rates, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of new data from the United Nations.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
​By 2100, the world’s population is projected to reach approximately 10.9 billion, with annual growth of less than 0.1% – a steep decline from the current rate. Between 1950 and today, the world’s population grew between 1% and 2% each year, with the number of people rising from 2.5 billion to more than 7.7 billion.<br>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>The Lion Children&nbsp;</strong><em>by Angus, Maisie and Travers McNeice&nbsp;</em><br><br>
[Mother, Kate takes her four children, Emily(16), Travers(10), Angus(9), Maisie(5) and Oakley(1) from England to the Okavanga Delta, one of the most beautiful wildernesses on Earth. There they meet Pieter and help him with his research on lions in the Delta.]&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Maisie (approx. 5yrs later)&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I am going to tell you about an amazing young female lion. She is not yet two and yet she is the bravest lion I have known. We have named her Mercier, and Angus has already told you how she disappeared for two and a half weeks. She was seven months old at the time and only as big as a border collie. She was defenceless against hyenas, leopards and maybe even animals like buffaloes and elephants. Can you imagine how scared she must have been all alone in the bush? Oakley won’t sleep in his tent alone because he gets scared of some of the night sounds.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We don’t know how Mercier got separated from the rest of the Santawani pride. She would have had no idea how to kill for herself yet, but during those two and a half weeks she would have been forced to fend for herself, and she might have scavenged or killed small animals.</p>
        <p>When Mercier found her pride again she was very thin and bony, and we watched her anxiously for weeks until she got strong again. For months all was well and the cubs grew more and more robust and became increasingly curious. Everything was fine until almost a year later when something terrible happened.</p>
        <p>One January afternoon, Mum and Pieter went out to find the lions by themselves. We stayed in the camp with Emily, who had come to spend Christmas with us. After a few hours, Mum radioed through that they had found the Santawani pride, which had been missing for three weeks. The pride looked like it had been attacked; two cubs had been badly mutilated and one of them was Mercier. The skin on her neck had been almost completely ripped off and there was only raw flesh and sinew holding it together. The adults looked fine, but some of the younger cubs were missing and some of the ten surviving cubs were badly wounded. We were horrified and waited by the radio for more news as Mum and Pieter tried to identify the remaining cubs.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They had been out for hours and it was getting dark, but still we had heard nothing. By nine o’clock we were getting worried. Our car in camp had something wrong with it and wasn’t safe to drive at night in case it broke down. At ten o’clock we all decided to go to Corrie and Ann at the Gomoti Camp and ask for help. We agreed that it would be silly to go out to search for them in the dark, as we wouldn’t be able to follow their tracks through the woods. At six the next morning, Corrie, Travers and Sophie (one of the students in the camp) formed a search party, leaving Emily, Gus and me with Oakley. In the night, Oakley&nbsp;had been crying and holding on to Emily saying, ‘Mummy’s dead.’ He and Emily had a big cry together but I knew things would turn out fine. After three hours of searching they found Mum and Pieter’s footprints on the road, and a short time later, much to their relief, saw them walking towards camp.</p>
        <p>What happened was simple. Their battery had died while they were with the lions and they couldn’t start the car or use the radio. The poor things had to spend the night in the small cab of the Land Rover in a rain storm with no food. They knew we would be desperately worried and therefore started to walk home at first light. At one point a male lion roared right beside them but they never saw him. They had to walk five miles before they were picked up. Those of us in camp had kept ourselves busy making a huge breakfast. At ten o’clock we heard a car and ran to see if it was them. We were worried when we saw only Corrie’s car drive into camp, but then we all burst out into joy when Mum and Pieter tumbled out of the car into our arms.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Over breakfast they told us about the lions. When Mum said that Pieter had cried when he saw them, we knew how bad it was. I was curious to see them, although Mum had warned us that it would be very distressing. That afternoon she took Emily and me to find the cubs. We left Oakley behind in camp, with the others, because Mum felt it was too much for him to take on.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The lions hadn’t moved far from where they had been the night before and when I was them, I couldn’t believe my eyes; it was gruesome. I said to myself, ‘they are definitely going to die’, and I couldn’t bear to watch as they licked each other’s raw wounds. Mercier was the most wounded and lay on her bad side, looking forlorn. I have seen lots of adult lions with very bad wounds and they all recovered. Their bodies are strong and can fight infection, but we couldn’t believe that such little lions could cope.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Over the next few weeks we could see them treating each other’s wounds by licking them and gradually we could see the wounds getting drier and start to close. Months went by and everyone was more confident about their chances of survival, even Mercier’s. Miraculously they all survived and are growing up even stronger than they might have been. It showed us that we must never interfere with lion immune systems by treating their wounds, because if we had, they would have less chance of surviving. This was, and is, very hard because we love these lions dearly and we hate to see them in pain. If they get wounded or sick naturally, we leave them alone to fight their own battles. They do very well without our help.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>The Lion Children&nbsp;</strong><em>by Angus, Maisie and Travers McNeice&nbsp;</em><br><br>
[Mother, Kate takes her four children, Emily(16), Travers(10), Angus(9), Maisie(5) and Oakley(1) from England to the Okavanga Delta, one of the most beautiful wildernesses on Earth. There they meet Pieter and help him with his research on lions in the Delta.]&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Maisie (approx. 5yrs later)&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I am going to tell you about an amazing young female lion. She is not yet two and yet she is the bravest lion I have known. We have named her Mercier, and Angus has already told you how she disappeared for two and a half weeks. She was seven months old at the time and only as big as a border collie. She was defenceless against hyenas, leopards and maybe even animals like buffaloes and elephants. Can you imagine how scared she must have been all alone in the bush? Oakley won’t sleep in his tent alone because he gets scared of some of the night sounds.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We don’t know how Mercier got separated from the rest of the Santawani pride. She would have had no idea how to kill for herself yet, but during those two and a half weeks she would have been forced to fend for herself, and she might have scavenged or killed small animals.</p>
        <p>When Mercier found her pride again she was very thin and bony, and we watched her anxiously for weeks until she got strong again. For months all was well and the cubs grew more and more robust and became increasingly curious. Everything was fine until almost a year later when something terrible happened.</p>
        <p>One January afternoon, Mum and Pieter went out to find the lions by themselves. We stayed in the camp with Emily, who had come to spend Christmas with us. After a few hours, Mum radioed through that they had found the Santawani pride, which had been missing for three weeks. The pride looked like it had been attacked; two cubs had been badly mutilated and one of them was Mercier. The skin on her neck had been almost completely ripped off and there was only raw flesh and sinew holding it together. The adults looked fine, but some of the younger cubs were missing and some of the ten surviving cubs were badly wounded. We were horrified and waited by the radio for more news as Mum and Pieter tried to identify the remaining cubs.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They had been out for hours and it was getting dark, but still we had heard nothing. By nine o’clock we were getting worried. Our car in camp had something wrong with it and wasn’t safe to drive at night in case it broke down. At ten o’clock we all decided to go to Corrie and Ann at the Gomoti Camp and ask for help. We agreed that it would be silly to go out to search for them in the dark, as we wouldn’t be able to follow their tracks through the woods. At six the next morning, Corrie, Travers and Sophie (one of the students in the camp) formed a search party, leaving Emily, Gus and me with Oakley. In the night, Oakley&nbsp;had been crying and holding on to Emily saying, ‘Mummy’s dead.’ He and Emily had a big cry together but I knew things would turn out fine. After three hours of searching they found Mum and Pieter’s footprints on the road, and a short time later, much to their relief, saw them walking towards camp.</p>
        <p>What happened was simple. Their battery had died while they were with the lions and they couldn’t start the car or use the radio. The poor things had to spend the night in the small cab of the Land Rover in a rain storm with no food. They knew we would be desperately worried and therefore started to walk home at first light. At one point a male lion roared right beside them but they never saw him. They had to walk five miles before they were picked up. Those of us in camp had kept ourselves busy making a huge breakfast. At ten o’clock we heard a car and ran to see if it was them. We were worried when we saw only Corrie’s car drive into camp, but then we all burst out into joy when Mum and Pieter tumbled out of the car into our arms.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Over breakfast they told us about the lions. When Mum said that Pieter had cried when he saw them, we knew how bad it was. I was curious to see them, although Mum had warned us that it would be very distressing. That afternoon she took Emily and me to find the cubs. We left Oakley behind in camp, with the others, because Mum felt it was too much for him to take on.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The lions hadn’t moved far from where they had been the night before and when I was them, I couldn’t believe my eyes; it was gruesome. I said to myself, ‘they are definitely going to die’, and I couldn’t bear to watch as they licked each other’s raw wounds. Mercier was the most wounded and lay on her bad side, looking forlorn. I have seen lots of adult lions with very bad wounds and they all recovered. Their bodies are strong and can fight infection, but we couldn’t believe that such little lions could cope.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Over the next few weeks we could see them treating each other’s wounds by licking them and gradually we could see the wounds getting drier and start to close. Months went by and everyone was more confident about their chances of survival, even Mercier’s. Miraculously they all survived and are growing up even stronger than they might have been. It showed us that we must never interfere with lion immune systems by treating their wounds, because if we had, they would have less chance of surviving. This was, and is, very hard because we love these lions dearly and we hate to see them in pain. If they get wounded or sick naturally, we leave them alone to fight their own battles. They do very well without our help.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>The Lion Children&nbsp;</strong><em>by Angus, Maisie and Travers McNeice&nbsp;</em><br><br>
[Mother, Kate takes her four children, Emily(16), Travers(10), Angus(9), Maisie(5) and Oakley(1) from England to the Okavanga Delta, one of the most beautiful wildernesses on Earth. There they meet Pieter and help him with his research on lions in the Delta.]&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Maisie (approx. 5yrs later)&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I am going to tell you about an amazing young female lion. She is not yet two and yet she is the bravest lion I have known. We have named her Mercier, and Angus has already told you how she disappeared for two and a half weeks. She was seven months old at the time and only as big as a border collie. She was defenceless against hyenas, leopards and maybe even animals like buffaloes and elephants. Can you imagine how scared she must have been all alone in the bush? Oakley won’t sleep in his tent alone because he gets scared of some of the night sounds.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We don’t know how Mercier got separated from the rest of the Santawani pride. She would have had no idea how to kill for herself yet, but during those two and a half weeks she would have been forced to fend for herself, and she might have scavenged or killed small animals.</p>
        <p>When Mercier found her pride again she was very thin and bony, and we watched her anxiously for weeks until she got strong again. For months all was well and the cubs grew more and more robust and became increasingly curious. Everything was fine until almost a year later when something terrible happened.</p>
        <p>One January afternoon, Mum and Pieter went out to find the lions by themselves. We stayed in the camp with Emily, who had come to spend Christmas with us. After a few hours, Mum radioed through that they had found the Santawani pride, which had been missing for three weeks. The pride looked like it had been attacked; two cubs had been badly mutilated and one of them was Mercier. The skin on her neck had been almost completely ripped off and there was only raw flesh and sinew holding it together. The adults looked fine, but some of the younger cubs were missing and some of the ten surviving cubs were badly wounded. We were horrified and waited by the radio for more news as Mum and Pieter tried to identify the remaining cubs.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They had been out for hours and it was getting dark, but still we had heard nothing. By nine o’clock we were getting worried. Our car in camp had something wrong with it and wasn’t safe to drive at night in case it broke down. At ten o’clock we all decided to go to Corrie and Ann at the Gomoti Camp and ask for help. We agreed that it would be silly to go out to search for them in the dark, as we wouldn’t be able to follow their tracks through the woods. At six the next morning, Corrie, Travers and Sophie (one of the students in the camp) formed a search party, leaving Emily, Gus and me with Oakley. In the night, Oakley&nbsp;had been crying and holding on to Emily saying, ‘Mummy’s dead.’ He and Emily had a big cry together but I knew things would turn out fine. After three hours of searching they found Mum and Pieter’s footprints on the road, and a short time later, much to their relief, saw them walking towards camp.</p>
        <p>What happened was simple. Their battery had died while they were with the lions and they couldn’t start the car or use the radio. The poor things had to spend the night in the small cab of the Land Rover in a rain storm with no food. They knew we would be desperately worried and therefore started to walk home at first light. At one point a male lion roared right beside them but they never saw him. They had to walk five miles before they were picked up. Those of us in camp had kept ourselves busy making a huge breakfast. At ten o’clock we heard a car and ran to see if it was them. We were worried when we saw only Corrie’s car drive into camp, but then we all burst out into joy when Mum and Pieter tumbled out of the car into our arms.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Over breakfast they told us about the lions. When Mum said that Pieter had cried when he saw them, we knew how bad it was. I was curious to see them, although Mum had warned us that it would be very distressing. That afternoon she took Emily and me to find the cubs. We left Oakley behind in camp, with the others, because Mum felt it was too much for him to take on.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The lions hadn’t moved far from where they had been the night before and when I was them, I couldn’t believe my eyes; it was gruesome. I said to myself, ‘they are definitely going to die’, and I couldn’t bear to watch as they licked each other’s raw wounds. Mercier was the most wounded and lay on her bad side, looking forlorn. I have seen lots of adult lions with very bad wounds and they all recovered. Their bodies are strong and can fight infection, but we couldn’t believe that such little lions could cope.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Over the next few weeks we could see them treating each other’s wounds by licking them and gradually we could see the wounds getting drier and start to close. Months went by and everyone was more confident about their chances of survival, even Mercier’s. Miraculously they all survived and are growing up even stronger than they might have been. It showed us that we must never interfere with lion immune systems by treating their wounds, because if we had, they would have less chance of surviving. This was, and is, very hard because we love these lions dearly and we hate to see them in pain. If they get wounded or sick naturally, we leave them alone to fight their own battles. They do very well without our help.</p>

        <p>[Mother, Kate takes her four children, Emily(16), Travers(10), Angus(9), Maisie(5) and Oakley(1) from England to the Okavanga Delta, one of the most beautiful wildernesses on Earth. There they meet Pieter and help him with his research on lions in the Delta.]&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Maisie (approx. 5yrs later)&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I am going to tell you about an amazing young female lion. She is not yet two and yet she is the bravest lion I have known. We have named her Mercier, and Angus has already told you how she disappeared for two and a half weeks. She was seven months old at the time and only as big as a border collie. She was defenceless against hyenas, leopards and maybe even animals like buffaloes and elephants. Can you imagine how scared she must have been all alone in the bush? Oakley won’t sleep in his tent alone because he gets scared of some of the night sounds.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We don’t know how Mercier got separated from the rest of the Santawani pride. She would have had no idea how to kill for herself yet, but during those two and a half weeks she would have been forced to fend for herself, and she might have scavenged or killed small animals.</p>
        <p>When Mercier found her pride again she was very thin and bony, and we watched her anxiously for weeks until she got strong again. For months all was well and the cubs grew more and more robust and became increasingly curious. Everything was fine until almost a year later when something terrible happened.</p>
        <p>One January afternoon, Mum and Pieter went out to find the lions by themselves. We stayed in the camp with Emily, who had come to spend Christmas with us. After a few hours, Mum radioed through that they had found the Santawani pride, which had been missing for three weeks. The pride looked like it had been attacked; two cubs had been badly mutilated and one of them was Mercier. The skin on her neck had been almost completely ripped off and there was only raw flesh and sinew holding it together. The adults looked fine, but some of the younger cubs were missing and some of the ten surviving cubs were badly wounded. We were horrified and waited by the radio for more news as Mum and Pieter tried to identify the remaining cubs.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They had been out for hours and it was getting dark, but still we had heard nothing. By nine o’clock we were getting worried. Our car in camp had something wrong with it and wasn’t safe to drive at night in case it broke down. At ten o’clock we all decided to go to Corrie and Ann at the Gomoti Camp and ask for help. We agreed that it would be silly to go out to search for them in the dark, as we wouldn’t be able to follow their tracks through the woods. At six the next morning, Corrie, Travers and Sophie (one of the students in the camp) formed a search party, leaving Emily, Gus and me with Oakley. In the night, Oakley&nbsp;had been crying and holding on to Emily saying, ‘Mummy’s dead.’ He and Emily had a big cry together but I knew things would turn out fine. After three hours of searching they found Mum and Pieter’s footprints on the road, and a short time later, much to their relief, saw them walking towards camp.</p>
        <p>What happened was simple. Their battery had died while they were with the lions and they couldn’t start the car or use the radio. The poor things had to spend the night in the small cab of the Land Rover in a rain storm with no food. They knew we would be desperately worried and therefore started to walk home at first light. At one point a male lion roared right beside them but they never saw him. They had to walk five miles before they were picked up. Those of us in camp had kept ourselves busy making a huge breakfast. At ten o’clock we heard a car and ran to see if it was them. We were worried when we saw only Corrie’s car drive into camp, but then we all burst out into joy when Mum and Pieter tumbled out of the car into our arms.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Over breakfast they told us about the lions. When Mum said that Pieter had cried when he saw them, we knew how bad it was. I was curious to see them, although Mum had warned us that it would be very distressing. That afternoon she took Emily and me to find the cubs. We left Oakley behind in camp, with the others, because Mum felt it was too much for him to take on.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The lions hadn’t moved far from where they had been the night before and when I was them, I couldn’t believe my eyes; it was gruesome. I said to myself, ‘they are definitely going to die’, and I couldn’t bear to watch as they licked each other’s raw wounds. Mercier was the most wounded and lay on her bad side, looking forlorn. I have seen lots of adult lions with very bad wounds and they all recovered. Their bodies are strong and can fight infection, but we couldn’t believe that such little lions could cope.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Over the next few weeks we could see them treating each other’s wounds by licking them and gradually we could see the wounds getting drier and start to close. Months went by and everyone was more confident about their chances of survival, even Mercier’s. Miraculously they all survived and are growing up even stronger than they might have been. It showed us that we must never interfere with lion immune systems by treating their wounds, because if we had, they would have less chance of surviving. This was, and is, very hard because we love these lions dearly and we hate to see them in pain. If they get wounded or sick naturally, we leave them alone to fight their own battles. They do very well without our help.</p>
