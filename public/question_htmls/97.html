          <strong>Marco Polo and the “Million Lies”</strong>

        <p>Marco Polo is one of the most famous explorers of all time. As a teenager, Marco went on a journey that lasted more than 20 years. He traveled to China, a distant land most Europeans had never seen. The story of his adventures is told in a book called<em> The Travels of Marco Polo</em>. It contains vivid descriptions of Marco’s journey, but some people wonder if all of the stories are true. When the book was first written, Europeans thought it was a collection of fables. This was probably because Marco described many things no one in Europe had ever seen. For many years, historians and explorers have tried to find out if Marco’s stories were fact or fiction.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Young Adventurer</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Marco Polo was born in Venice, Italy, in 1254. He was 17 when he set out for China with his father and uncle, a journey which lasted more than three years. The three travelers passed through vast deserts and across rugged mountain ranges. Marco met people from different lands and saw wondrous new places. He saw camels, which he called oxen with humps, and mountain goats, which he described as sheep with long curled horns. He heard the music of the sand dunes shifting in the wind. He climbed mountains so high that the thin air made him dizzy. Marco was fascinated by everything he saw.</p>
        <p>Marco Polo and his family reached China in 1275. At that time, Kublai Khan was the emperor. He was impressed with Marco and put the young man to work. Marco spent more than 16 years in Khan’s service. He went on missions to faraway lands and entertained Khan with stories of his travels. Then, in 1292, Marco asked for permission to return to Venice. Khan did not want to see Marco go, but he finally agreed. Marco and his family returned to Venice.</p>

          <em>
            <strong>The Travels of Marco Polo</strong>
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>Marco reached Venice in 1295. He found his hometown at war with the nearby city of Genoa. Marco joined the fight and was captured in 1298. He spent the next year in prison. There, he met a writer named Rustichello. Rustichello was fascinated by Marco’s stories and wrote them down in a book called <em>The Travels of Marco Polo</em>. Marco was finally released and returned to Venice in 1299. The book of his adventures was copied on vellum<sup>1</sup> and sold throughout Europe.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>“Marco Milione”</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>The Travels of Marco Polo</em> was a popular book, but it did not earn Marco much respect. It was often referred to as “Il Milione.” By this the Italians meant “the million lies.” Some people even called him “Marco Milione.” Many of Marco’s stories were hard to believe. Besides the unusual animals he described, Marco told of other things difficult for most Europeans to imagine. For example, Marco described how the Chinese people read books printed on paper and used paper money. At that time, paper was rare in Europe. To people reading about Marco’s adventures, paper money and books printed on paper sounded like something from a fable.</p>
        <p>Marco also described a system that Khan’s empire used to rapidly deliver messages to faraway places. Marco’s countrymen thought this sounded impossible too. Who could blame them? It would be hundreds of years before a mail system was used in Europe. Even details about daily life in China seemed made up. Marco told about delicate china serving bowls that ordinary people used. At a time when most Europeans did not have silverware, this seemed unbelievable. Everyday clothes made from silk sounded like a fairy tale to Europeans, since most of them had just one change of woolen clothes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Misread and Misunderstood</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Much of what Marco described in his stories was later proven true. However, there are some parts where Marco’s memory may have been foggy, or Rustichello may have <span class="txt-underline">embellished</span> the truth. Certainly no one else has ever seen any large birds that drop elephants from great heights and then eat the remains! It is also strange that Marco did not describe something as amazing as the Great Wall of China, which he must have seen.</p>
        <p>Whatever the complete truth about his book, one thing is certain: Marco Polo was a great explorer and adventurer.</p>

        <p>Marco Polo is one of the most famous explorers of all time. As a teenager, Marco went on a journey that lasted more than 20 years. He traveled to China, a distant land most Europeans had never seen. The story of his adventures is told in a book called<em> The Travels of Marco Polo</em>. It contains vivid descriptions of Marco’s journey, but some people wonder if all of the stories are true. When the book was first written, Europeans thought it was a collection of fables. This was probably because Marco described many things no one in Europe had ever seen. For many years, historians and explorers have tried to find out if Marco’s stories were fact or fiction.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Marco Polo was born in Venice, Italy, in 1254. He was 17 when he set out for China with his father and uncle, a journey which lasted more than three years. The three travelers passed through vast deserts and across rugged mountain ranges. Marco met people from different lands and saw wondrous new places. He saw camels, which he called oxen with humps, and mountain goats, which he described as sheep with long curled horns. He heard the music of the sand dunes shifting in the wind. He climbed mountains so high that the thin air made him dizzy. Marco was fascinated by everything he saw.</p>
        <p>Marco Polo and his family reached China in 1275. At that time, Kublai Khan was the emperor. He was impressed with Marco and put the young man to work. Marco spent more than 16 years in Khan’s service. He went on missions to faraway lands and entertained Khan with stories of his travels. Then, in 1292, Marco asked for permission to return to Venice. Khan did not want to see Marco go, but he finally agreed. Marco and his family returned to Venice.</p>

            <strong>The Travels of Marco Polo</strong>
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>Marco reached Venice in 1295. He found his hometown at war with the nearby city of Genoa. Marco joined the fight and was captured in 1298. He spent the next year in prison. There, he met a writer named Rustichello. Rustichello was fascinated by Marco’s stories and wrote them down in a book called <em>The Travels of Marco Polo</em>. Marco was finally released and returned to Venice in 1299. The book of his adventures was copied on vellum<sup>1</sup> and sold throughout Europe.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>“Marco Milione”</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>The Travels of Marco Polo</em> was a popular book, but it did not earn Marco much respect. It was often referred to as “Il Milione.” By this the Italians meant “the million lies.” Some people even called him “Marco Milione.” Many of Marco’s stories were hard to believe. Besides the unusual animals he described, Marco told of other things difficult for most Europeans to imagine. For example, Marco described how the Chinese people read books printed on paper and used paper money. At that time, paper was rare in Europe. To people reading about Marco’s adventures, paper money and books printed on paper sounded like something from a fable.</p>
        <p>Marco also described a system that Khan’s empire used to rapidly deliver messages to faraway places. Marco’s countrymen thought this sounded impossible too. Who could blame them? It would be hundreds of years before a mail system was used in Europe. Even details about daily life in China seemed made up. Marco told about delicate china serving bowls that ordinary people used. At a time when most Europeans did not have silverware, this seemed unbelievable. Everyday clothes made from silk sounded like a fairy tale to Europeans, since most of them had just one change of woolen clothes.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Misread and Misunderstood</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Much of what Marco described in his stories was later proven true. However, there are some parts where Marco’s memory may have been foggy, or Rustichello may have <span class="txt-underline">embellished</span> the truth. Certainly no one else has ever seen any large birds that drop elephants from great heights and then eat the remains! It is also strange that Marco did not describe something as amazing as the Great Wall of China, which he must have seen.</p>
        <p>Whatever the complete truth about his book, one thing is certain: Marco Polo was a great explorer and adventurer.</p>

        <p>Marco Polo was born in Venice, Italy, in 1254. He was 17 when he set out for China with his father and uncle, a journey which lasted more than three years. The three travelers passed through vast deserts and across rugged mountain ranges. Marco met people from different lands and saw wondrous new places. He saw camels, which he called oxen with humps, and mountain goats, which he described as sheep with long curled horns. He heard the music of the sand dunes shifting in the wind. He climbed mountains so high that the thin air made him dizzy. Marco was fascinated by everything he saw.</p>
        <p>Marco Polo and his family reached China in 1275. At that time, Kublai Khan was the emperor. He was impressed with Marco and put the young man to work. Marco spent more than 16 years in Khan’s service. He went on missions to faraway lands and entertained Khan with stories of his travels. Then, in 1292, Marco asked for permission to return to Venice. Khan did not want to see Marco go, but he finally agreed. Marco and his family returned to Venice.</p>

            <strong>The Travels of Marco Polo</strong>
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>Marco reached Venice in 1295. He found his hometown at war with the nearby city of Genoa. Marco joined the fight and was captured in 1298. He spent the next year in prison. There, he met a writer named Rustichello. Rustichello was fascinated by Marco’s stories and wrote them down in a book called <em>The Travels of Marco Polo</em>. Marco was finally released and returned to Venice in 1299. The book of his adventures was copied on vellum<sup>1</sup> and sold throughout Europe.</p>

          <strong>“Marco Milione”</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>The Travels of Marco Polo</em> was a popular book, but it did not earn Marco much respect. It was often referred to as “Il Milione.” By this the Italians meant “the million lies.” Some people even called him “Marco Milione.” Many of Marco’s stories were hard to believe. Besides the unusual animals he described, Marco told of other things difficult for most Europeans to imagine. For example, Marco described how the Chinese people read books printed on paper and used paper money. At that time, paper was rare in Europe. To people reading about Marco’s adventures, paper money and books printed on paper sounded like something from a fable.</p>
        <p>Marco also described a system that Khan’s empire used to rapidly deliver messages to faraway places. Marco’s countrymen thought this sounded impossible too. Who could blame them? It would be hundreds of years before a mail system was used in Europe. Even details about daily life in China seemed made up. Marco told about delicate china serving bowls that ordinary people used. At a time when most Europeans did not have silverware, this seemed unbelievable. Everyday clothes made from silk sounded like a fairy tale to Europeans, since most of them had just one change of woolen clothes.</p>

          <strong>Misread and Misunderstood</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Much of what Marco described in his stories was later proven true. However, there are some parts where Marco’s memory may have been foggy, or Rustichello may have <span class="txt-underline">embellished</span> the truth. Certainly no one else has ever seen any large birds that drop elephants from great heights and then eat the remains! It is also strange that Marco did not describe something as amazing as the Great Wall of China, which he must have seen.</p>
        <p>Whatever the complete truth about his book, one thing is certain: Marco Polo was a great explorer and adventurer.</p>

          <strong>Marco Polo and the “Million Lies”</strong>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Marco Polo is one of the most famous explorers of all time. As a teenager, Marco went on a journey that lasted more than 20 years. He traveled to China, a distant land most Europeans had never seen. The story of his adventures is told in a book called<em> The Travels of Marco Polo</em>. It contains vivid descriptions of Marco’s journey, but some people wonder if all of the stories are true. When the book was first written, Europeans thought it was a collection of fables. This was probably because Marco described many things no one in Europe had ever seen. For many years, historians and explorers have tried to find out if Marco’s stories were fact or fiction.</p>

          <strong>Animals in Unexpected Places</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <em>by Margaret S. Frezon</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Most of the time, we can easily guess a creature’s behaviour based on its species. For example, fish swim in the water, birds fly through the sky and almost all mammals walk on land. However, there are a few interesting exceptions to these general rules.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Owls Underground</strong>
        </p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In the western states of our country, you might see this unusual and amusing sight: fat little birds poking their heads up out of holes in the ground. Believe it or not, these birds are owls. Unlike other owls, however, they do not live in trees. Burrowing owls live in tunnels under the earth. They are found in deserts and open, dry grasslands where trees are scarce. By living underground, these owls manage to survive in the desert’s harsh, hot environment.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; These birds live in the same areas as prairie dogs. If a prairie dog abandons its burrow for any reason, the owl has a ready-made home. Researchers believe that burrowing owls, like prairie dogs, live in groupings called colonies.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Burrowing owls are small, growing only about 10 inches tall. They are sandy brown with some white markings on their faces and stomachs. The owls have a rounded head and lack the ear tufts that other owls have. Their long legs and sharp beaks are useful in moving dirt.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Active during both day and night hours, the owls feed on insects, spiders, mice, scorpions, and other small animals. They are sometimes also referred to as ground owls, prairie dog owls, tunnel owls, or hill owls.</p>

          <strong>Fish in the Air</strong>
        </p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Most fish spend almost all their time in the water. Some species leap out briefly after food or for other reasons. “Flying fish,” however, leave the water for longer periods. They can glide through the air as much as 10 feet above the surface.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Flying fish are found in parts of the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea and in other&nbsp; tropical waters. They live near the surface of the water, rather than deep in the sea. These fish usually swim, but at times they leap out of the water, soaring through the air above the waves. To do this, they move their tails, rapidly, <span class="txt-underline">accelerating</span> to speeds as fast as 30 miles per hour. Then the fish leap out of the water, high into the air. They have very large pectoral fins that help them glide for great distances. For these fish, flying is not only a hobby but also a matter of survival; it helps them escape from their enemies.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Flying fish are medium sized, measuring about 10 to 18 inches long, depending on the specific type of fish. Atlantic flying fish are usually greenish blue on top, with a lighter colour underneath. Their wings are actually enlarged pectoral fins. Some types of flying fish have one pair of wings, and others have two pairs.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A strong gust of wind will sometimes help to push the fish along, allowing them to cover as much as 30 feet in a single leap. Flying fish are able to glide, but they cannot steer. Some unlucky flying fish have actually leapt out of the water and landed on the decks of passing fishing boats.</p>

          <strong>Kangaroos Up a Tree</strong>
        </p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Many people know about large kangaroos bounding effortlessly across the Australian wilderness. However, there are different types of kangaroos. Some are so small they might remind you more of a monkey than a kangaroo. You would have to look up to see the Goodfellow’s kangaroo because it spends much of its life in the branches of trees.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Goodfellow’s kangaroos live in New Guinea, an island off the coast of Australia. They are at home in mountainous areas among the heavy vines and tree limbs of the area’s rainforests. They spend their time safely camouflaged in the dense foliage, where it is very difficult to see them. During the day, they sleep in the branches.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Goodfellow’s kangaroo is a marsupial, meaning that, like other kangaroos, it has a pouch. It is small, weighing about 15–20 pounds, or about as much as a small dog. Its body is approximately 30 inches long, and it has an equally long tail. Its brown fur is short and soft, with yellow markings. Its long curved claws help it hang onto branches.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A kangaroo that lives in a tree must be an agile climber. These kangaroos easily jump from branch to branch, eating leaves, berries, and fruit. A baby tree kangaroo stays in its mother’s pouch much longer than kangaroos that live on the ground. This is probably because it takes more skill to climb around in the trees.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After reading about underground owls, flying fish, and small kangaroos that live in trees, you know that some animals can be found in quite unexpected places!</p>

          <strong>Animals in Unexpected Places</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <em>by Margaret S. Frezon</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Most of the time, we can easily guess a creature’s behaviour based on its species. For example, fish swim in the water, birds fly through the sky and almost all mammals walk on land. However, there are a few interesting exceptions to these general rules.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Owls Underground</strong>
        </p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In the western states of our country, you might see this unusual and amusing sight: fat little birds poking their heads up out of holes in the ground. Believe it or not, these birds are owls. Unlike other owls, however, they do not live in trees. Burrowing owls live in tunnels under the earth. They are found in deserts and open, dry grasslands where trees are scarce. By living underground, these owls manage to survive in the desert’s harsh, hot environment.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; These birds live in the same areas as prairie dogs. If a prairie dog abandons its burrow for any reason, the owl has a ready-made home. Researchers believe that burrowing owls, like prairie dogs, live in groupings called colonies.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Burrowing owls are small, growing only about 10 inches tall. They are sandy brown with some white markings on their faces and stomachs. The owls have a rounded head and lack the ear tufts that other owls have. Their long legs and sharp beaks are useful in moving dirt.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Active during both day and night hours, the owls feed on insects, spiders, mice, scorpions, and other small animals. They are sometimes also referred to as ground owls, prairie dog owls, tunnel owls, or hill owls.</p>

They are found in deserts and open, dry grasslands where trees are scarce. By living underground, these owls manage to survive in the desert’s harsh, hot environment.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; These birds live in the same areas as prairie dogs. If a prairie dog abandons its burrow for any reason, the owl has a ready-made home. Researchers believe that burrowing owls, like prairie dogs, live in groupings called colonies.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Burrowing owls are small, growing only about 10 inches tall. They are sandy brown with some white markings on their faces and stomachs. The owls have a rounded head and lack the ear tufts that other owls have. Their long legs and sharp beaks are useful in moving dirt.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Active during both day and night hours, the owls feed on insects, spiders, mice, scorpions, and other small animals. They are sometimes also referred to as ground owls, prairie dog owls, tunnel owls, or hill owls.</p>

          <strong>Fish in the Air</strong>
        </p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Most fish spend almost all their time in the water. Some species leap out briefly after food or for other reasons. “Flying fish,” however, leave the water for longer periods. They can glide through the air as much as 10 feet above the surface.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Flying fish are found in parts of the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea and in other&nbsp; tropical waters. They live near the surface of the water, rather than deep in the sea. These fish usually swim, but at times they leap out of the water, soaring through the air above the waves. To do this, they move their tails, rapidly, <span class="txt-underline">accelerating</span> to speeds as fast as 30 miles per hour. Then the fish leap out of the water, high into the air. They have very large pectoral fins that help them glide for great distances. For these fish, flying is not only a hobby but also a matter of survival; it helps them escape from their enemies.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Flying fish are medium sized, measuring about 10 to 18 inches long, depending on the specific type of fish. Atlantic flying fish are usually greenish blue on top, with a lighter colour underneath. Their wings are actually enlarged pectoral fins. Some types of flying fish have one pair of wings, and others have two pairs.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A strong gust of wind will sometimes help to push the fish along, allowing them to cover as much as 30 feet in a single leap. Flying fish are able to glide, but they cannot steer. Some unlucky flying fish have actually leapt out of the water and landed on the decks of passing fishing boats.</p>

          <strong>Kangaroos Up a Tree</strong>
        </p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Many people know about large kangaroos bounding effortlessly across the Australian wilderness. However, there are different types of kangaroos. Some are so small they might remind you more of a monkey than a kangaroo. You would have to look up to see the Goodfellow’s kangaroo because it spends much of its life in the branches of trees.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Goodfellow’s kangaroos live in New Guinea, an island off the coast of Australia. They are at home in mountainous areas among the heavy vines and tree limbs of the area’s rainforests. They spend their time safely camouflaged in the dense foliage, where it is very difficult to see them. During the day, they sleep in the branches.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Goodfellow’s kangaroo is a marsupial, meaning that, like other kangaroos, it has a pouch. It is small, weighing about 15–20 pounds, or about as much as a small dog. Its body is approximately 30 inches long, and it has an equally long tail. Its brown fur is short and soft, with yellow markings. Its long curved claws help it hang onto branches.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A kangaroo that lives in a tree must be an agile climber. These kangaroos easily jump from branch to branch, eating leaves, berries, and fruit. A baby tree kangaroo stays in its mother’s pouch much longer than kangaroos that live on the ground. This is probably because it takes more skill to climb around in the trees.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After reading about underground owls, flying fish, and small kangaroos that live in trees, you know that some animals can be found in quite unexpected places!</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Most of the time, we can easily guess a creature’s behaviour based on its species. For example, fish swim in the water, birds fly through the sky and almost all mammals walk on land. However, there are a few interesting exceptions to these general rules.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Most of the time, we can easily guess a creature’s behaviour based on its species. For example, fish swim in the water, birds fly through the sky and almost all mammals walk on land. However, there are a few interesting exceptions to these general rules.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Owls Underground</strong>
        </p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In the western states of our country, you might see this unusual and amusing sight: fat little birds poking their heads up out of holes in the ground. Believe it or not, these birds are owls. Unlike other owls, however, they do not live in trees. Burrowing owls live in tunnels under the earth. They are found in deserts and open, dry grasslands where trees are scarce. By living underground, these owls manage to survive in the desert’s harsh, hot environment.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; These birds live in the same areas as prairie dogs. If a prairie dog abandons its burrow for any reason, the owl has a ready-made home. Researchers believe that burrowing owls, like prairie dogs, live in groupings called colonies.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Burrowing owls are small, growing only about 10 inches tall. They are sandy brown with some white markings on their faces and stomachs. The owls have a rounded head and lack the ear tufts that other owls have. Their long legs and sharp beaks are useful in moving dirt.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Active during both day and night hours, the owls feed on insects, spiders, mice, scorpions, and other small animals. They are sometimes also referred to as ground owls, prairie dog owls, tunnel owls, or hill owls.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Fish in the Air</strong>
        </p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Most fish spend almost all their time in the water. Some species leap out briefly after food or for other reasons. “Flying fish,” however, leave the water for longer periods. They can glide through the air as much as 10 feet above the surface.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Flying fish are found in parts of the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea and in other&nbsp; tropical waters. They live near the surface of the water, rather than deep in the sea. These fish usually swim, but at times they leap out of the water, soaring through the air above the waves. To do this, they move their tails, rapidly, <span class="txt-underline">accelerating</span> to speeds as fast as 30 miles per hour. Then the fish leap out of the water, high into the air. They have very large pectoral fins that help them glide for great distances. For these fish, flying is not only a hobby but also a matter of survival; it helps them escape from their enemies.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Flying fish are medium sized, measuring about 10 to 18 inches long, depending on the specific type of fish. Atlantic flying fish are usually greenish blue on top, with a lighter colour underneath. Their wings are actually enlarged pectoral fins. Some types of flying fish have one pair of wings, and others have two pairs.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A strong gust of wind will sometimes help to push the fish along, allowing them to cover as much as 30 feet in a single leap. Flying fish are able to glide, but they cannot steer. Some unlucky flying fish have actually leapt out of the water and landed on the decks of passing fishing boats.</p>

          <strong>Kangaroos Up a Tree</strong>
        </p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Many people know about large kangaroos bounding effortlessly across the Australian wilderness. However, there are different types of kangaroos. Some are so small they might remind you more of a monkey than a kangaroo. You would have to look up to see the Goodfellow’s kangaroo because it spends much of its life in the branches of trees.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Goodfellow’s kangaroos live in New Guinea, an island off the coast of Australia. They are at home in mountainous areas among the heavy vines and tree limbs of the area’s rainforests. They spend their time safely camouflaged in the dense foliage, where it is very difficult to see them. During the day, they sleep in the branches.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Goodfellow’s kangaroo is a marsupial, meaning that, like other kangaroos, it has a pouch. It is small, weighing about 15–20 pounds, or about as much as a small dog. Its body is approximately 30 inches long, and it has an equally long tail. Its brown fur is short and soft, with yellow markings. Its long curved claws help it hang onto branches.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A kangaroo that lives in a tree must be an agile climber. These kangaroos easily jump from branch to branch, eating leaves, berries, and fruit. A baby tree kangaroo stays in its mother’s pouch much longer than kangaroos that live on the ground. This is probably because it takes more skill to climb around in the trees.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After reading about underground owls, flying fish, and small kangaroos that live in trees, you know that some animals can be found in quite unexpected places!</p>

          <strong>Animals in Unexpected Places</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <em>by Margaret S. Frezon</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Most of the time, we can easily guess a creature’s behaviour based on its species. For example, fish swim in the water, birds fly through the sky and almost all mammals walk on land. However, there are a few interesting exceptions to these general rules.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Owls Underground</strong>
        </p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In the western states of our country, you might see this unusual and amusing sight: fat little birds poking their heads up out of holes in the ground. Believe it or not, these birds are owls. Unlike other owls, however, they do not live in trees. Burrowing owls live in tunnels under the earth. They are found in deserts and open, dry grasslands where trees are scarce. By living underground, these owls manage to survive in the desert’s harsh, hot environment.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; These birds live in the same areas as prairie dogs. If a prairie dog abandons its burrow for any reason, the owl has a ready-made home. Researchers believe that burrowing owls, like prairie dogs, live in groupings called colonies.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Burrowing owls are small, growing only about 10 inches tall. They are sandy brown with some white markings on their faces and stomachs. The owls have a rounded head and lack the ear tufts that other owls have. Their long legs and sharp beaks are useful in moving dirt.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Active during both day and night hours, the owls feed on insects, spiders, mice, scorpions, and other small animals. They are sometimes also referred to as ground owls, prairie dog owls, tunnel owls, or hill owls.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Fish in the Air</strong>
        </p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Most fish spend almost all their time in the water. Some species leap out briefly after food or for other reasons. “Flying fish,” however, leave the water for longer periods. They can glide through the air as much as 10 feet above the surface.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Flying fish are found in parts of the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea and in other&nbsp; tropical waters. They live near the surface of the water, rather than deep in the sea. These fish usually swim, but at times they leap out of the water, soaring through the air above the waves. To do this, they move their tails, rapidly, <span class="txt-underline">accelerating</span> to speeds as fast as 30 miles per hour. Then the fish leap out of the water, high into the air. They have very large pectoral fins that help them glide for great distances. For these fish, flying is not only a hobby but also a matter of survival; it helps them escape from their enemies.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Flying fish are medium sized, measuring about 10 to 18 inches long, depending on the specific type of fish. Atlantic flying fish are usually greenish blue on top, with a lighter colour underneath. Their wings are actually enlarged pectoral fins. Some types of flying fish have one pair of wings, and others have two pairs.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A strong gust of wind will sometimes help to push the fish along, allowing them to cover as much as 30 feet in a single leap. Flying fish are able to glide, but they cannot steer. Some unlucky flying fish have actually leapt out of the water and landed on the decks of passing fishing boats.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Kangaroos Up a Tree</strong>
        </p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Many people know about large kangaroos bounding effortlessly across the Australian wilderness. However, there are different types of kangaroos. Some are so small they might remind you more of a monkey than a kangaroo. You would have to look up to see the Goodfellow’s kangaroo because it spends much of its life in the branches of trees.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Goodfellow’s kangaroos live in New Guinea, an island off the coast of Australia. They are at home in mountainous areas among the heavy vines and tree limbs of the area’s rainforests. They spend their time safely camouflaged in the dense foliage, where it is very difficult to see them. During the day, they sleep in the branches.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Goodfellow’s kangaroo is a marsupial, meaning that, like other kangaroos, it has a pouch. It is small, weighing about 15–20 pounds, or about as much as a small dog. Its body is approximately 30 inches long, and it has an equally long tail. Its brown fur is short and soft, with yellow markings. Its long curved claws help it hang onto branches.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A kangaroo that lives in a tree must be an agile climber. These kangaroos easily jump from branch to branch, eating leaves, berries, and fruit. A baby tree kangaroo stays in its mother’s pouch much longer than kangaroos that live on the ground. This is probably because it takes more skill to climb around in the trees.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After reading about underground owls, flying fish, and small kangaroos that live in trees, you know that some animals can be found in quite unexpected places!</p>

        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Crow is walking</p>
        <p>to see things at ground level,</p>
        <p>the landscape as new under his feet</p>
        <p>as the air is old under his wings.</p>

        <p>it’s a given; it’ll always be there—</p>
        <p>and walks on down the dirt road,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>admires the pebbles,</p>
        <p>how they <span class="txt-underline">sparkle</span> in the sun;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;checks out his reflection</p>
        <p>in a puddle full of sky</p>
        <p>which reminds him</p>
        <p>of where he’s supposed to be,</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>but he’s beginning to like</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;the way the muscles move in his legs</p>
        <p>and the way his wings feel so comfortable</p>
        <p>folded back and resting.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He thinks he might be beautiful,</p>
        <p>the sun lighting his back</p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;with purple and green.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Faint voices from somewhere far ahead</p>
        <p>roll like dust down the road towards him.</p>
        <p>He hurries a little.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>His tongue moves in his mouth;</p>
        <p>25&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;legends of language move in his mind.</p>

          <strong>Painted Into a Corner</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <em>by Amy Bearce</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; I didn’t know which was more humiliating— watching all of the potential customers walk right past my table or seeing them line up at Julie’s table. I sat back and pretended I couldn’t care less, but the truth was I was hurt.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Two weeks ago my teacher began class by announcing a new project. We had to create a product to sell to the community at the Business Day Fair in the gym. All the students in the class had to design and create something to sell. We also had to keep track of the costs of the product as well as the profit we made. Whoever made the most profit would win the Young Business Leader award.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately my mind began soaring. Perhaps I could make beautiful jewelry that everyone would pay a fortune for. Or maybe I could sew pajamas and sell those. Of course, I’d have to learn how to sew first. I imagined myself with hundreds of customers lined up at my table, my Young Business Leader trophy sitting next to me, shining in the beautiful sunlight. . . .</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;That night I shared my ideas with my mom. Smiling, she broke the news to me that using silver wire and beads as the raw material for my proposed jewelry project would be expensive. Moreover, the idea for pajamas was flawed because I already had a reputation as someone who couldn’t even sew a button on a shirt.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;With cold water thrown on my first two ideas, I finally came up with a plan we both thought would work. I would create and sell decorative ceramic ornaments. I had been in a ceramics class all summer, so I knew that I could get plain ceramic ornaments and paint them. All I would have left to do would be to install a hook and—presto!</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning at school I ran up to Julie, my best friend, and said, “Hey, have you come up with an idea for Business Day?”</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes,” she said, “but I’m not telling anyone what it is before the sale.”</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I blinked and felt a pang in my stomach. Julie and I usually shared everything. Why was she being so cautious?</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Stiffly I replied, “Oh, well, I have an idea too,” and quickly walked away. I couldn’t believe that my best friend was keeping secrets from me.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A few days before the Business Day Fair, I purchased a few ceramic pieces on which to practice. After painting a few, I was pleased and put the pieces aside to dry. The next day I attached the hooks—or, at least, I <em>tried </em>to attach the hooks. To my horror, I discovered that the ceramic pieces were too heavy. I tried using a hot glue gun and even several varieties of glue that promised to bond anything together. Every effort failed, and I began to worry. Who would want an ornament that didn’t hang?</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I had visions of my utter humiliation. Not only would I fail class because I couldn’t demonstrate that I had made a profit, I couldn’t even make anything to sell in the first place. Julie would probably have some glorious product that would make a thousand dollars, and I’d have nothing.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Mom listened to my dilemma quietly and then asked, “What about paperweights? We have all those flat rocks out back . . . you could paint different scenes on them and sell them as paperweights.”</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I thought it was a terrible idea, but I really had no other choice. Time was running out. In despair, I finally said, “Fine, I’ll make paperweights.”</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;From five until midnight I painted sunrises, birds, horses and trees on rocks, knowing they wouldn’t sell for much but feeling it was better than nothing.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At the fair, I could barely look at the paperweights I was setting up on the table. I held my head up, though, and acted as if I were selling the finest china in the world. I watched Julie set up her display, but I didn’t go over to peek, even though that’s what I really wanted to do.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When the doors were opened, a line immediately formed at Julie’s table. My curiosity finally overwhelmed me, so I slyly craned my neck to see a little kid walk away from her table with something fuzzy and orange. I couldn’t believe it! Julie had made little furry puppets that were just strips of fuzz with googly eyes glued on, but she could barely keep up with the number of customers. It soon became obvious that she would win the Young Business Leader award.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Across the walkway, I had very few customers. Mom patted my arm, and my dad bought the biggest rock I had painted.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The crowds eventually dwindled, although my stack of rocks did not. When she was finished, Julie cleaned up her table and walked over to see my paperweights. “They’re so pretty, Amy,” she said as she examined my unsold rocks. “I’d like to buy this one with the&nbsp; paintbrush on it because it reminds me of you.” I must have given her a blank stare, because she added, ”Well, you’re such a good artist, and I’ve always wished I could paint like you.”</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I’d been jealous of her all day and she’d wished she could paint like me? The sick feeling in my stomach began to fade and I smiled, saying, “Well, let’s go get a soda and something to eat. However, you’re buying, since you’re the Young Business Leader who made the huge profits, and I’m only the poor starving artist!” We laughed, linked arms and walked out of the gym.</p>

          <strong>Painted Into a Corner</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <em>by Amy Bearce</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; I didn’t know which was more humiliating— watching all of the potential customers walk right past my table or seeing them line up at Julie’s table. I sat back and pretended I couldn’t care less, but the truth was I was hurt.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Two weeks ago my teacher began class by announcing a new project. We had to create a product to sell to the community at the Business Day Fair in the gym. All the students in the class had to design and create something to sell. We also had to keep track of the costs of the product as well as the profit we made. Whoever made the most profit would win the Young Business Leader award.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately my mind began soaring. Perhaps I could make beautiful jewelry that everyone would pay a fortune for. Or maybe I could sew pajamas and sell those. Of course, I’d have to learn how to sew first. I imagined myself with hundreds of customers lined up at my table, my Young Business Leader trophy sitting next to me, shining in the beautiful sunlight. . . .</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;That night I shared my ideas with my mom. Smiling, she broke the news to me that using silver wire and beads as the raw material for my proposed jewelry project would be expensive. Moreover, the idea for pajamas was flawed because I already had a reputation as someone who couldn’t even sew a button on a shirt.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;With cold water thrown on my first two ideas, I finally came up with a plan we both thought would work. I would create and sell decorative ceramic ornaments. I had been in a ceramics class all summer, so I knew that I could get plain ceramic ornaments and paint them. All I would have left to do would be to install a hook and—presto!</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning at school I ran up to Julie, my best friend, and said, “Hey, have you come up with an idea for Business Day?”</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes,” she said, “but I’m not telling anyone what it is before the sale.”</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I blinked and felt a pang in my stomach. Julie and I usually shared everything. Why was she being so cautious?</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Stiffly I replied, “Oh, well, I have an idea too,” and quickly walked away. I couldn’t believe that my best friend was keeping secrets from me.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A few days before the Business Day Fair, I purchased a few ceramic pieces on which to practice. After painting a few, I was pleased and put the pieces aside to dry. The next day I attached the hooks—or, at least, I <em>tried </em>to attach the hooks. To my horror, I discovered that the ceramic pieces were too heavy. I tried using a hot glue gun and even several varieties of glue that promised to bond anything together. Every effort failed, and I began to worry. Who would want an ornament that didn’t hang?</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I had visions of my utter humiliation. Not only would I fail class because I couldn’t demonstrate that I had made a profit, I couldn’t even make anything to sell in the first place. Julie would probably have some glorious product that would make a thousand dollars, and I’d have nothing.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Mom listened to my dilemma quietly and then asked, “What about paperweights? We have all those flat rocks out back . . . you could paint different scenes on them and sell them as paperweights.”</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I thought it was a terrible idea, but I really had no other choice. Time was running out. In despair, I finally said, “Fine, I’ll make paperweights.”</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;From five until midnight I painted sunrises, birds, horses and trees on rocks, knowing they wouldn’t sell for much but feeling it was better than nothing.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At the fair, I could barely look at the paperweights I was setting up on the table. I held my head up, though, and acted as if I were selling the finest china in the world. I watched Julie set up her display, but I didn’t go over to peek, even though that’s what I really wanted to do.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When the doors were opened, a line immediately formed at Julie’s table. My curiosity finally overwhelmed me, so I slyly craned my neck to see a little kid walk away from her table with something fuzzy and orange. I couldn’t believe it! Julie had made little furry puppets that were just strips of fuzz with googly eyes glued on, but she could barely keep up with the number of customers. It soon became obvious that she would win the Young Business Leader award.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Across the walkway, I had very few customers. Mom patted my arm, and my dad bought the biggest rock I had painted.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The crowds eventually dwindled, although my stack of rocks did not. When she was finished, Julie cleaned up her table and walked over to see my paperweights. “They’re so pretty, Amy,” she said as she examined my unsold rocks. “I’d like to buy this one with the&nbsp; paintbrush on it because it reminds me of you.” I must have given her a blank stare, because she added, ”Well, you’re such a good artist, and I’ve always wished I could paint like you.”</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I’d been jealous of her all day and she’d wished she could paint like me? The sick feeling in my stomach began to fade and I smiled, saying, “Well, let’s go get a soda and something to eat. However, you’re buying, since you’re the Young Business Leader who made the huge profits, and I’m only the poor starving artist!” We laughed, linked arms and walked out of the gym.</p>

        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The crowds eventually dwindled, although my stack of rocks did not. When she was finished, Julie cleaned up her table and walked over to see my paperweights. “They’re so pretty, Amy,” she said as she examined my unsold rocks. “I’d like to buy this one with the&nbsp; paintbrush on it because it reminds me of you.” I must have given her a blank stare, because she added, ”Well, you’re such a good artist, and I’ve always wished I could paint like you.”</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I’d been jealous of her all day and she’d wished she could paint like me? The sick feeling in my stomach began to fade and I smiled, saying, “Well, let’s go get a soda and something to eat. However, you’re buying, since you’re the Young Business Leader who made the huge profits, and I’m only the poor starving artist!” We laughed, linked arms and walked out of the gym.</p>

          <strong>Painted Into a Corner</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <em>by Amy Bearce</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; I didn’t know which was more humiliating— watching all of the potential customers walk right past my table or seeing them line up at Julie’s table. I sat back and pretended I couldn’t care less, but the truth was I was hurt.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Two weeks ago my teacher began class by announcing a new project. We had to create a product to sell to the community at the Business Day Fair in the gym. All the students in the class had to design and create something to sell. We also had to keep track of the costs of the product as well as the profit we made. Whoever made the most profit would win the Young Business Leader award.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately my mind began soaring. Perhaps I could make beautiful jewelry that everyone would pay a fortune for. Or maybe I could sew pajamas and sell those. Of course, I’d have to learn how to sew first. I imagined myself with hundreds of customers lined up at my table, my Young Business Leader trophy sitting next to me, shining in the beautiful sunlight. . . .</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;That night I shared my ideas with my mom. Smiling, she broke the news to me that using silver wire and beads as the raw material for my proposed jewelry project would be expensive. Moreover, the idea for pajamas was flawed because I already had a reputation as someone who couldn’t even sew a button on a shirt.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;With cold water thrown on my first two ideas, I finally came up with a plan we both thought would work. I would create and sell decorative ceramic ornaments. I had been in a ceramics class all summer, so I knew that I could get plain ceramic ornaments and paint them. All I would have left to do would be to install a hook and—presto!</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning at school I ran up to Julie, my best friend, and said, “Hey, have you come up with an idea for Business Day?”</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes,” she said, “but I’m not telling anyone what it is before the sale.”</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I blinked and felt a pang in my stomach. Julie and I usually shared everything. Why was she being so cautious?</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Stiffly I replied, “Oh, well, I have an idea too,” and quickly walked away. I couldn’t believe that my best friend was keeping secrets from me.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A few days before the Business Day Fair, I purchased a few ceramic pieces on which to practice. After painting a few, I was pleased and put the pieces aside to dry. The next day I attached the hooks—or, at least, I <em>tried </em>to attach the hooks. To my horror, I discovered that the ceramic pieces were too heavy. I tried using a hot glue gun and even several varieties of glue that promised to bond anything together. Every effort failed, and I began to worry. Who would want an ornament that didn’t hang?</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I had visions of my utter humiliation. Not only would I fail class because I couldn’t demonstrate that I had made a profit, I couldn’t even make anything to sell in the first place. Julie would probably have some glorious product that would make a thousand dollars, and I’d have nothing.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Mom listened to my dilemma quietly and then asked, “What about paperweights? We have all those flat rocks out back . . . you could paint different scenes on them and sell them as paperweights.”</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I thought it was a terrible idea, but I really had no other choice. Time was running out. In despair, I finally said, “Fine, I’ll make paperweights.”</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;From five until midnight I painted sunrises, birds, horses and trees on rocks, knowing they wouldn’t sell for much but feeling it was better than nothing.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At the fair, I could barely look at the paperweights I was setting up on the table. I held my head up, though, and acted as if I were selling the finest china in the world. I watched Julie set up her display, but I didn’t go over to peek, even though that’s what I really wanted to do.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When the doors were opened, a line immediately formed at Julie’s table. My curiosity finally overwhelmed me, so I slyly craned my neck to see a little kid walk away from her table with something fuzzy and orange. I couldn’t believe it! Julie had made little furry puppets that were just strips of fuzz with googly eyes glued on, but she could barely keep up with the number of customers. It soon became obvious that she would win the Young Business Leader award.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Across the walkway, I had very few customers. Mom patted my arm, and my dad bought the biggest rock I had painted.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The crowds eventually dwindled, although my stack of rocks did not. When she was finished, Julie cleaned up her table and walked over to see my paperweights. “They’re so pretty, Amy,” she said as she examined my unsold rocks. “I’d like to buy this one with the&nbsp; paintbrush on it because it reminds me of you.” I must have given her a blank stare, because she added, ”Well, you’re such a good artist, and I’ve always wished I could paint like you.”</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I’d been jealous of her all day and she’d wished she could paint like me? The sick feeling in my stomach began to fade and I smiled, saying, “Well, let’s go get a soda and something to eat. However, you’re buying, since you’re the Young Business Leader who made the huge profits, and I’m only the poor starving artist!” We laughed, linked arms and walked out of the gym.</p>

        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I thought it was a terrible idea, but I really had no other choice. Time was running out. In despair, I finally said, “Fine, I’ll make paperweights.”</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;From five until midnight I painted sunrises, birds, horses and trees on rocks, knowing they wouldn’t sell for much but feeling it was better than nothing.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At the fair, I could barely look at the paperweights I was setting up on the table. I held my head up, though, and acted as if I were selling the finest china in the world. I watched Julie set up her display, but I didn’t go over to peek, even though that’s what I really wanted to do.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When the doors were opened, a line immediately formed at Julie’s table. My curiosity finally overwhelmed me, so I slyly craned my neck to see a little kid walk away from her table with something fuzzy and orange. I couldn’t believe it! Julie had made little furry puppets that were just strips of fuzz with googly eyes glued on, but she could barely keep up with the number of customers. It soon became obvious that she would win the Young Business Leader award.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Across the walkway, I had very few customers. Mom patted my arm, and my dad bought the biggest rock I had painted.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The crowds eventually dwindled, although my stack of rocks did not. When she was finished, Julie cleaned up her table and walked over to see my paperweights. “They’re so pretty, Amy,” she said as she examined my unsold rocks. “I’d like to buy this one with the&nbsp; paintbrush on it because it reminds me of you.” I must have given her a blank stare, because she added, ”Well, you’re such a good artist, and I’ve always wished I could paint like you.”</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I’d been jealous of her all day and she’d wished she could paint like me? The sick feeling in my stomach began to fade and I smiled, saying, “Well, let’s go get a soda and something to eat. However, you’re buying, since you’re the Young Business Leader who made the huge profits, and I’m only the poor starving artist!” We laughed, linked arms and walked out of the gym.</p>

          <em>by Amy Bearce</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; I didn’t know which was more humiliating— watching all of the potential customers walk right past my table or seeing them line up at Julie’s table. I sat back and pretended I couldn’t care less, but the truth was I was hurt.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Two weeks ago my teacher began class by announcing a new project. We had to create a product to sell to the community at the Business Day Fair in the gym. All the students in the class had to design and create something to sell. We also had to keep track of the costs of the product as well as the profit we made. Whoever made the most profit would win the Young Business Leader award.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately my mind began soaring. Perhaps I could make beautiful jewelry that everyone would pay a fortune for. Or maybe I could sew pajamas and sell those. Of course, I’d have to learn how to sew first. I imagined myself with hundreds of customers lined up at my table, my Young Business Leader trophy sitting next to me, shining in the beautiful sunlight. . . .</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;That night I shared my ideas with my mom. Smiling, she broke the news to me that using silver wire and beads as the raw material for my proposed jewelry project would be expensive. Moreover, the idea for pajamas was flawed because I already had a reputation as someone who couldn’t even sew a button on a shirt.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;With cold water thrown on my first two ideas, I finally came up with a plan we both thought would work. I would create and sell decorative ceramic ornaments. I had been in a ceramics class all summer, so I knew that I could get plain ceramic ornaments and paint them. All I would have left to do would be to install a hook and—presto!</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning at school I ran up to Julie, my best friend, and said, “Hey, have you come up with an idea for Business Day?”</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes,” she said, “but I’m not telling anyone what it is before the sale.”</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I blinked and felt a pang in my stomach. Julie and I usually shared everything. Why was she being so cautious?</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Stiffly I replied, “Oh, well, I have an idea too,” and quickly walked away. I couldn’t believe that my best friend was keeping secrets from me.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A few days before the Business Day Fair, I purchased a few ceramic pieces on which to practice. After painting a few, I was pleased and put the pieces aside to dry. The next day I attached the hooks—or, at least, I <em>tried </em>to attach the hooks. To my horror, I discovered that the ceramic pieces were too heavy. I tried using a hot glue gun and even several varieties of glue that promised to bond anything together. Every effort failed, and I began to worry. Who would want an ornament that didn’t hang?</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I had visions of my utter humiliation. Not only would I fail class because I couldn’t demonstrate that I had made a profit, I couldn’t even make anything to sell in the first place. Julie would probably have some glorious product that would make a thousand dollars, and I’d have nothing.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Mom listened to my dilemma quietly and then asked, “What about paperweights? We have all those flat rocks out back . . . you could paint different scenes on them and sell them as paperweights.”</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I thought it was a terrible idea, but I really had no other choice. Time was running out. In despair, I finally said, “Fine, I’ll make paperweights.”</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;From five until midnight I painted sunrises, birds, horses and trees on rocks, knowing they wouldn’t sell for much but feeling it was better than nothing.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At the fair, I could barely look at the paperweights I was setting up on the table. I held my head up, though, and acted as if I were selling the finest china in the world. I watched Julie set up her display, but I didn’t go over to peek, even though that’s what I really wanted to do.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When the doors were opened, a line immediately formed at Julie’s table. My curiosity finally overwhelmed me, so I slyly craned my neck to see a little kid walk away from her table with something fuzzy and orange. I couldn’t believe it! Julie had made little furry puppets that were just strips of fuzz with googly eyes glued on, but she could barely keep up with the number of customers. It soon became obvious that she would win the Young Business Leader award.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Across the walkway, I had very few customers. Mom patted my arm, and my dad bought the biggest rock I had painted.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The crowds eventually dwindled, although my stack of rocks did not. When she was finished, Julie cleaned up her table and walked over to see my paperweights. “They’re so pretty, Amy,” she said as she examined my unsold rocks. “I’d like to buy this one with the&nbsp; paintbrush on it because it reminds me of you.” I must have given her a blank stare, because she added, ”Well, you’re such a good artist, and I’ve always wished I could paint like you.”</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I’d been jealous of her all day and she’d wished she could paint like me? The sick feeling in my stomach began to fade and I smiled, saying, “Well, let’s go get a soda and something to eat. However, you’re buying, since you’re the Young Business Leader who made the huge profits, and I’m only the poor starving artist!” We laughed, linked arms and walked out of the gym.</p>
