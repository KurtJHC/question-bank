          <strong>Should Olga buy the book?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Olga had always enjoyed the character-centered books written by Adele Kwan and wanted to read another one if it seemed interesting and was written in the same style. Olga wasn’t sure, however, whether she should spend part of her savings on Kwan’s latest book, <em>The Newcomer</em>. She hoped the following book reviews in her high school newspaper would help her make a decision<br>

          <strong>Novel Without &nbsp;a Plot</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Carlo Dante</em>
        </p>
        <p>I just finished reading Adele Kwan’s latest novel, <em>The Newcomer</em>, and was disappointed. In my opinion the book does not have enough plot to be considered a novel.</p>
        <p>The newcomer in this book is Violet Wang. She’s fifteen when her family moves from San Francisco’s Chinatown to a small town in Washington State. In this town everyone knows each other, and none of the other residents are Chinese. Violet’s challenge is to fit in. Sensitive and intelligent, she amuses those who know her well but is shy and reserved with strangers.</p>
        <p>These circumstances could have provided the basis for an interesting story. I particularly enjoyed learning about Chinese American culture and Violet’s strong family ties. However, this book has no real plot. There is no action to follow. Instead the author emphasizes what is happening in Violet’s head as she finds her way in her new home. We are introduced to new characters and situations only as they are viewed by the <span class="txt-underline">introspective</span> Violet. When she arrives at her new school, for example, the reader is forced to endure page after page describing Violet’s classrooms, classmates, and teachers, with no excitement to keep us involved in the story.</p>
        <p>If this had been a historical novel, at least the text could have elucidated what life was like during a past era. If it had been a mystery, I would have had a reason to move from one page to the next. Furthermore, Violet would have had a more intriguing way to demonstrate her intelligence and sensitivity.</p>
        <p>As it is, I found <em>The Newcomer</em> uninteresting. The lack of plot and the reliance on a single character to support the entire book make for a dull, slow-moving reading experience. Although Ms. Kwan writes well, she has failed to present a story worth reading.<br>

          <strong>A Book to Cherish</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Rachel Blythe</em>
        </p>
        <p>In last week’s edition I read “Novel Without a Plot,” an unflattering review of Adele Kwan’s latest novel. I, too, have read <em>The Newcomer</em>, and I strongly disagree with Carlo Dante’s evaluation of this fine novel.</p>
        <p>Dante claims <em>The Newcomer</em> lacks a plot. He fails to recognize that some novels are plot-driven and others are character-centered. Clearly Dante prefers to read the former and feels justified in imposing his preference on all of us. There are many readers who do not require a story to propel us feverishly from one action-packed moment to the next. We are content to get to know an interesting character who encounters challenges and tries various ways to overcome them.</p>
        <p>Violet Wang is a wonderful example of this type of character, and we are fortunate that the novel is told from her point of view. We first experience her world in San Francisco, where she is surrounded by Chinese American traditions and the support of an extended family. We feel her confusion and <span class="txt-underline">traumatic</span> sense of loss as she must leave all that is familiar to her.</p>
        <p>When Violet arrives in the area that will be her new home, we see its beauty and mystery through her eyes. As she tries to adjust to life in a place where she feels like an outsider, many of us may remember similar times in our own lives. We ache when she hurts and feel triumph in our hearts when she experiences progress.</p>
        <p>I won’t tell you why Violet has had to make such a drastic life change or how she comes to terms with it. Unlike Dante, I think that most readers would greatly enjoy this book. In these times of action-adventure movies and computer games, many have lost the patience to be readers, thinkers, and emotional beings. I think that someone who fails to see the value in this book is missing out on a lot.</p>

          <strong>Should Olga buy the book?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Olga had always enjoyed the character-centered books written by Adele Kwan and wanted to read another one if it seemed interesting and was written in the same style. Olga wasn’t sure, however, whether she should spend part of her savings on Kwan’s latest book, <em>The Newcomer</em>. She hoped the following book reviews in her high school newspaper would help her make a decision<br>
<br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Novel Without &nbsp;a Plot</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Carlo Dante</em>
        </p>
        <p>I just finished reading Adele Kwan’s latest novel, <em>The Newcomer</em>, and was disappointed. In my opinion the book does not have enough plot to be considered a novel.</p>
        <p>The newcomer in this book is Violet Wang. She’s fifteen when her family moves from San Francisco’s Chinatown to a small town in Washington State. In this town everyone knows each other, and none of the other residents are Chinese. Violet’s challenge is to fit in. Sensitive and intelligent, she amuses those who know her well but is shy and reserved with strangers.</p>
        <p>These circumstances could have provided the basis for an interesting story. I particularly enjoyed learning about Chinese American culture and Violet’s strong family ties. However, this book has no real plot. There is no action to follow. Instead the author emphasizes what is happening in Violet’s head as she finds her way in her new home. We are introduced to new characters and situations only as they are viewed by the <span class="txt-underline">introspective</span> Violet. When she arrives at her new school, for example, the reader is forced to endure page after page describing Violet’s classrooms, classmates, and teachers, with no excitement to keep us involved in the story.</p>
        <p>If this had been a historical novel, at least the text could have elucidated what life was like during a past era. If it had been a mystery, I would have had a reason to move from one page to the next. Furthermore, Violet would have had a more intriguing way to demonstrate her intelligence and sensitivity.</p>
        <p>As it is, I found <em>The Newcomer</em> uninteresting. The lack of plot and the reliance on a single character to support the entire book make for a dull, slow-moving reading experience. Although Ms. Kwan writes well, she has failed to present a story worth reading.<br>
<br>

        <p>
          <strong>A Book to Cherish</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Rachel Blythe</em>
        </p>
        <p>In last week’s edition I read “Novel Without a Plot,” an unflattering review of Adele Kwan’s latest novel. I, too, have read <em>The Newcomer</em>, and I strongly disagree with Carlo Dante’s evaluation of this fine novel.</p>
        <p>Dante claims <em>The Newcomer</em> lacks a plot. He fails to recognize that some novels are plot-driven and others are character-centered. Clearly Dante prefers to read the former and feels justified in imposing his preference on all of us. There are many readers who do not require a story to propel us feverishly from one action-packed moment to the next. We are content to get to know an interesting character who encounters challenges and tries various ways to overcome them.</p>
        <p>Violet Wang is a wonderful example of this type of character, and we are fortunate that the novel is told from her point of view. We first experience her world in San Francisco, where she is surrounded by Chinese American traditions and the support of an extended family. We feel her confusion and <span class="txt-underline">traumatic</span> sense of loss as she must leave all that is familiar to her.</p>
        <p>When Violet arrives in the area that will be her new home, we see its beauty and mystery through her eyes. As she tries to adjust to life in a place where she feels like an outsider, many of us may remember similar times in our own lives. We ache when she hurts and feel triumph in our hearts when she experiences progress.</p>
        <p>I won’t tell you why Violet has had to make such a drastic life change or how she comes to terms with it. Unlike Dante, I think that most readers would greatly enjoy this book. In these times of action-adventure movies and computer games, many have lost the patience to be readers, thinkers, and emotional beings. I think that someone who fails to see the value in this book is missing out on a lot.</p>

          <strong>December Moon</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by May Sarton</em><br><br>
Before going to bed<br>
After a fall of snow<br>
I look out on the field<br>
Shining there in the moonlight<br>
So calm, untouched and white<br>
Snow silence fills my head<br>
After I leave the window.<br>
<br>
Hours later near dawn<br>
When I look down again<br>
The whole landscape has changed<br>
The perfect surface gone<br>
Criss-crossed and written on<br>
Where the wild creatures ranged<br>
While the moon rose and shone.<br>
<br>
Why did my dog not bark?<br>
Why did I hear no sound<br>
There on the snow-locked ground<br>
In the tumultuous dark?<br>
<br>
How much can come, how much can go<br>
When the December moon is bright,<br>
What worlds of play we’ll never know<br>
Sleeping away the cold white night<br>
After a fall of snow.</p>

          <strong>December Moon</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by May Sarton</em><br><br>
Before going to bed<br>
After a fall of snow<br>
I look out on the field<br>
Shining there in the moonlight<br>
So calm, untouched and white<br>
Snow silence fills my head<br>
After I leave the window.<br>
<br>
Hours later near dawn<br>
When I look down again<br>
The whole landscape has changed<br>
The perfect surface gone<br>
Criss-crossed and written on<br>
Where the wild creatures ranged<br>
While the moon rose and shone.<br>
<br>
Why did my dog not bark?<br>
Why did I hear no sound<br>
There on the snow-locked ground<br>
In the tumultuous dark?<br>
<br>
How much can come, how much can go<br>
When the December moon is bright,<br>
What worlds of play we’ll never know<br>
Sleeping away the cold white night<br>
After a fall of snow.</p>

          <strong>The Father of Medicine</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Hippocrates was a doctor, surgeon, scientist and artist. He was born about 460 BC, on the Greek island of Cos. He was in charge of the medical school and hospital there. His writings and teachings helped to form much of our modern medicine.<br>
<br>
In ancient Greece, religion and magic were a part of medicine. But Hippocrates and his followers believed that a doctor should examine the patient carefully to identify and work out treatment for the illness. They did not look for religious and magic ‘signs’ as a cause of the illness.<br>
<br>
Hippocrates believed that the body has amazing powers to heal itself when the illness is not too serious. Unnecessary treatment could make the patient worse.<br>
<br>
<strong>The moral code</strong></p>
        <p>Hippocrates and his followers made guidelines about how doctors should think and act. They wrote that a doctor ’s main job is to help the patient. When a doctor gets personal information about a patient, this should not be told to others.</p>

          <strong>The Father of Medicine</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Hippocrates was a doctor, surgeon, scientist and artist. He was born about 460 BC, on the Greek island of Cos. He was in charge of the medical school and hospital there. His writings and teachings helped to form much of our modern medicine.<br>
<br>
In ancient Greece, religion and magic were a part of medicine. But Hippocrates and his followers believed that a doctor should examine the patient carefully to identify and work out treatment for the illness. They did not look for religious and magic ‘signs’ as a cause of the illness.<br>
<br>
Hippocrates believed that the body has amazing powers to heal itself when the illness is not too serious. Unnecessary treatment could make the patient worse.<br>
<br>
<strong>The moral code</strong></p>
        <p>Hippocrates and his followers made guidelines about how doctors should think and act. They wrote that a doctor ’s main job is to help the patient. When a doctor gets personal information about a patient, this should not be told to others.</p>

        <p><strong>At the end of a radio program on road safety, listeners were invited to submit responses on the radio’s website.</strong><br><br>
From: <strong>Quiet One</strong> 8/07/2005 4:57:47 PM</p>
        <p>Reducing the speed limit will have no effect on those who drive too fast. It is a totally cynical exercise which, if it is not solely designed to increase revenue, is meant to make politicians look as if they are doing something. Much more rigorous enforcement of existing laws and limits would be far more beneficial than creating new ones.<br>
<br>
From: <strong>Cork </strong>11/07/2005 5:41:15 PM</p>
        <p>I am not a great believer in speed limits as such, as I think that those drivers who are not “empathetic” to car control and traffic management tend to believe that the speed limit must be safe regardless of conditions. To say that speed causes accidents leaves out an important word – inappropriate! Advanced driving courses, night driving courses, skid control and so on, are essential for all drivers and not a profusion of speed cameras monitoring minor infringements in perfectly safe conditions, for revenue raising.<br>
<br>
From: <strong>Albert </strong>12/07/2005 9:39:12 PM</p>
        <p>I live in a rural area. The speed limit on the gravel road that I travel on every day is 100 kph, which is clearly not acceptable due to the road width and condition. I am often forced to take evasive action to avoid a collision. Cars frequently spin off and go through our farm fences. I feel the speed limit for such gravel roads must be reduced to 80 kph.<br>
<br>
From: <strong>Mac </strong>13/07/2005 1:22:43 PM</p>
        <p>Lack of driver training is the most prevalent cause of crashes. This is the root of all of the other “so called” causes. A properly trained driver does not speed or drive recklessly when conditions are poor.</p>
        <p>A properly trained driver will recognise when road or weather conditions warrant a lower speed and more concentration. I believe that all drivers should be forced to undergo re-examination on a regular basis to ensure they are competent in the manual and co-ordination skills required to drive a motor vehicle, and that they are fully up-to-date with the latest road traffic rules.</p>

        <p>Reducing the speed limit will have no effect on those who drive too fast. It is a totally cynical exercise which, if it is not solely designed to increase revenue, is meant to make politicians look as if they are doing something. Much more rigorous enforcement of existing laws and limits would be far more beneficial than creating new ones.<br>
<br>
From: <strong>Cork </strong>11/07/2005 5:41:15 PM</p>
        <p>I am not a great believer in speed limits as such, as I think that those drivers who are not “empathetic” to car control and traffic management tend to believe that the speed limit must be safe regardless of conditions. To say that speed causes accidents leaves out an important word – inappropriate! Advanced driving courses, night driving courses, skid control and so on, are essential for all drivers and not a profusion of speed cameras monitoring minor infringements in perfectly safe conditions, for revenue raising.<br>

        <p>I live in a rural area. The speed limit on the gravel road that I travel on every day is 100 kph, which is clearly not acceptable due to the road width and condition. I am often forced to take evasive action to avoid a collision. Cars frequently spin off and go through our farm fences. I feel the speed limit for such gravel roads must be reduced to 80 kph.<br>
<br>

        <p>Lack of driver training is the most prevalent cause of crashes. This is the root of all of the other “so called” causes. A properly trained driver does not speed or drive recklessly when conditions are poor.</p>
        <p>A properly trained driver will recognise when road or weather conditions warrant a lower speed and more concentration. I believe that all drivers should be forced to undergo re-examination on a regular basis to ensure they are competent in the manual and co-ordination skills required to drive a motor vehicle, and that they are fully up-to-date with the latest road traffic rules.</p>

        <p><strong>At the end of a radio program on road safety, listeners were invited to submit responses on the radio’s website.</strong><br><br>
From: <strong>Quiet One</strong> 8/07/2005 4:57:47 PM</p>
        <p>Reducing the speed limit will have no effect on those who drive too fast. It is a totally cynical exercise which, if it is not solely designed to increase revenue, is meant to make politicians look as if they are doing something. Much more rigorous enforcement of existing laws and limits would be far more beneficial than creating new ones.<br>
<br>
From: <strong>Cork </strong>11/07/2005 5:41:15 PM</p>
        <p>I am not a great believer in speed limits as such, as I think that those drivers who are not “empathetic” to car control and traffic management tend to believe that the speed limit must be safe regardless of conditions. To say that speed causes accidents leaves out an important word – inappropriate! Advanced driving courses, night driving courses, skid control and so on, are essential for all drivers and not a profusion of speed cameras monitoring minor infringements in perfectly safe conditions, for revenue raising.<br>
<br>
From: <strong>Albert </strong>12/07/2005 9:39:12 PM</p>
        <p>I live in a rural area. The speed limit on the gravel road that I travel on every day is 100 kph, which is clearly not acceptable due to the road width and condition. I am often forced to take evasive action to avoid a collision. Cars frequently spin off and go through our farm fences. I feel the speed limit for such gravel roads must be reduced to 80 kph.<br>
<br>
From: <strong>Mac </strong>13/07/2005 1:22:43 PM</p>
        <p>Lack of driver training is the most prevalent cause of crashes. This is the root of all of the other “so called” causes. A properly trained driver does not speed or drive recklessly when conditions are poor.</p>
        <p>A properly trained driver will recognise when road or weather conditions warrant a lower speed and more concentration. I believe that all drivers should be forced to undergo re-examination on a regular basis to ensure they are competent in the manual and co-ordination skills required to drive a motor vehicle, and that they are fully up-to-date with the latest road traffic rules.</p>
