“Joe, come here,” she said.</p>
        <p>The boy rose and stood by his mother. She put her plump arm around him and spoke, her head turned to the fire.</p>
        <p>“Look Joe, ye’re getting to be a big lad now, and ye can understand. Ye see—well, ye know things aren’t going so well for us these days. Ye know how it is. And we’ve got to have food on the table and we’ve got to pay our rent—and Lassie was worth a lot of money and—well, we couldn’t afford to keep her, that’s all. Now these are poor times and ye mustn’t— ye mustn’t upset thy father. He’s worrying enough as it is—and—well, that’s all. She’s gone.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Young Joe Carraclough stood by his mother in the cottage. He did understand. Even a boy of twelve years in Greenall Bridge knew what “poor times” were.</p>
        <p>For years, for as long as children could remember, their fathers had worked in the Wellington Pit beyond the village. They had gone on-shift, off-shift, carrying their snap boxes of food and their colliers’ lanterns; and they had worked at bringing up the rich coal. Then times had become “poor.” The pit went on “slack time,” and the men earned less. Sometimes the work had picked up, and the men had gone on full time.</p>
        <p>Then everyone was glad. It did not mean luxurious living for them, for in the coal-mining villages people lived a hard life at best. But it was a life of courage and family unity, at least, and if the food that was set on the tables was plain, there was enough of it to go round.</p>
        <p>Only a few months ago, the pit had closed down altogether. The big wheel at the top of the shaft spun no more. The men no longer flowed in a stream to the pit-yard at the shift changes. Instead, they signed on at the Labor Exchange. They stood on the corner by the Exchange, waiting for work. But no work came. It seemed that they were in what the newspapers called “the stricken areas”—sections of the country from which all industry had gone. Whole villages of people were out of work. There was no way of earning a living. The Government gave the people a “dole”—a weekly sum of money—so that they could stay alive.</p>
        <p>Joe knew this. He had heard people talking in the village. He had seen the men at the Labor Exchange. He knew that his father no longer went to work. He knew, too, that his father and mother never spoke of it before him—that in their rough, kind way they had tried to keep their burdens of living from bearing also on his young shoulders.<br>
Though his brain told him these things, his heart still cried for Lassie. But he silenced it. He stood steadily and then asked one question.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Couldn’t we buy her back some day, Mother?”</p>
        <p>“Now, Joe, she was a very valuable dog and she’s worth too much for us. But we’ll get another dog some day. Just wait. Times might pick up, and then we’ll get another pup. Wouldn’t ye like that?”</p>
        <p>Joe Carraclough bent his head and shook it slowly. His voice was only a whisper.</p>
        <p>“I don’t ever want another dog. Never! I only want—Lassie!”</p>

“Joe, come here,” she said.</p>
        <p>The boy rose and stood by his mother. She put her plump arm around him and spoke, her head turned to the fire.</p>
        <p>“Look Joe, ye’re getting to be a big lad now, and ye can understand. Ye see—well, ye know things aren’t going so well for us these days. Ye know how it is. And we’ve got to have food on the table and we’ve got to pay our rent—and Lassie was worth a lot of money and—well, we couldn’t afford to keep her, that’s all. Now these are poor times and ye mustn’t— ye mustn’t upset thy father. He’s worrying enough as it is—and—well, that’s all. She’s gone.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Young Joe Carraclough stood by his mother in the cottage. He did understand. Even a boy of twelve years in Greenall Bridge knew what “poor times” were.</p>
        <p>For years, for as long as children could remember, their fathers had worked in the Wellington Pit beyond the village. They had gone on-shift, off-shift, carrying their snap boxes of food and their colliers’ lanterns; and they had worked at bringing up the rich coal. Then times had become “poor.” The pit went on “slack time,” and the men earned less. Sometimes the work had picked up, and the men had gone on full time.</p>
        <p>Then everyone was glad. It did not mean luxurious living for them, for in the coal-mining villages people lived a hard life at best. But it was a life of courage and family unity, at least, and if the food that was set on the tables was plain, there was enough of it to go round.</p>
        <p>Only a few months ago, the pit had closed down altogether. The big wheel at the top of the shaft spun no more. The men no longer flowed in a stream to the pit-yard at the shift changes. Instead, they signed on at the Labor Exchange. They stood on the corner by the Exchange, waiting for work. But no work came. It seemed that they were in what the newspapers called “the stricken areas”—sections of the country from which all industry had gone. Whole villages of people were out of work. There was no way of earning a living. The Government gave the people a “dole”—a weekly sum of money—so that they could stay alive.</p>
        <p>Joe knew this. He had heard people talking in the village. He had seen the men at the Labor Exchange. He knew that his father no longer went to work. He knew, too, that his father and mother never spoke of it before him—that in their rough, kind way they had tried to keep their burdens of living from bearing also on his young shoulders.<br>
Though his brain told him these things, his heart still cried for Lassie. But he silenced it. He stood steadily and then asked one question.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Couldn’t we buy her back some day, Mother?”</p>
        <p>“Now, Joe, she was a very valuable dog and she’s worth too much for us. But we’ll get another dog some day. Just wait. Times might pick up, and then we’ll get another pup. Wouldn’t ye like that?”</p>
        <p>Joe Carraclough bent his head and shook it slowly. His voice was only a whisper.</p>
        <p>“I don’t ever want another dog. Never! I only want—Lassie!”</p>

“Joe, come here,” she said.</p>
        <p>The boy rose and stood by his mother. She put her plump arm around him and spoke, her head turned to the fire.</p>
        <p>“Look Joe, ye’re getting to be a big lad now, and ye can understand. Ye see—well, ye know things aren’t going so well for us these days. Ye know how it is. And we’ve got to have food on the table and we’ve got to pay our rent—and Lassie was worth a lot of money and—well, we couldn’t afford to keep her, that’s all. Now these are poor times and ye mustn’t— ye mustn’t upset thy father. He’s worrying enough as it is—and—well, that’s all. She’s gone.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Young Joe Carraclough stood by his mother in the cottage. He did understand. Even a boy of twelve years in Greenall Bridge knew what “poor times” were.</p>
        <p>For years, for as long as children could remember, their fathers had worked in the Wellington Pit beyond the village. They had gone on-shift, off-shift, carrying their snap boxes of food and their colliers’ lanterns; and they had worked at bringing up the rich coal. Then times had become “poor.” The pit went on “slack time,” and the men earned less. Sometimes the work had picked up, and the men had gone on full time.</p>
        <p>Then everyone was glad. It did not mean luxurious living for them, for in the coal-mining villages people lived a hard life at best. But it was a life of courage and family unity, at least, and if the food that was set on the tables was plain, there was enough of it to go round.</p>
        <p>Only a few months ago, the pit had closed down altogether. The big wheel at the top of the shaft spun no more. The men no longer flowed in a stream to the pit-yard at the shift changes. Instead, they signed on at the Labor Exchange. They stood on the corner by the Exchange, waiting for work. But no work came. It seemed that they were in what the newspapers called “the stricken areas”—sections of the country from which all industry had gone. Whole villages of people were out of work. There was no way of earning a living. The Government gave the people a “dole”—a weekly sum of money—so that they could stay alive.</p>
        <p>Joe knew this. He had heard people talking in the village. He had seen the men at the Labor Exchange. He knew that his father no longer went to work. He knew, too, that his father and mother never spoke of it before him—that in their rough, kind way they had tried to keep their burdens of living from bearing also on his young shoulders.<br>
Though his brain told him these things, his heart still cried for Lassie. But he silenced it. He stood steadily and then asked one question.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Couldn’t we buy her back some day, Mother?”</p>
        <p>“Now, Joe, she was a very valuable dog and she’s worth too much for us. But we’ll get another dog some day. Just wait. Times might pick up, and then we’ll get another pup. Wouldn’t ye like that?”</p>
        <p>Joe Carraclough bent his head and shook it slowly. His voice was only a whisper.</p>
        <p>“I don’t ever want another dog. Never! I only want—Lassie!”</p>

“Joe, come here,” she said.</p>
        <p>The boy rose and stood by his mother. She put her plump arm around him and spoke, her head turned to the fire.</p>
        <p>“Look Joe, ye’re getting to be a big lad now, and ye can understand. Ye see—well, ye know things aren’t going so well for us these days. Ye know how it is. And we’ve got to have food on the table and we’ve got to pay our rent—and Lassie was worth a lot of money and—well, we couldn’t afford to keep her, that’s all. Now these are poor times and ye mustn’t— ye mustn’t upset thy father. He’s worrying enough as it is—and—well, that’s all. She’s gone.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Young Joe Carraclough stood by his mother in the cottage. He did understand. Even a boy of twelve years in Greenall Bridge knew what “poor times” were.</p>
        <p>For years, for as long as children could remember, their fathers had worked in the Wellington Pit beyond the village. They had gone on-shift, off-shift, carrying their snap boxes of food and their colliers’ lanterns; and they had worked at bringing up the rich coal. Then times had become “poor.” The pit went on “slack time,” and the men earned less. Sometimes the work had picked up, and the men had gone on full time.</p>
        <p>Then everyone was glad. It did not mean luxurious living for them, for in the coal-mining villages people lived a hard life at best. But it was a life of courage and family unity, at least, and if the food that was set on the tables was plain, there was enough of it to go round.</p>
        <p>Only a few months ago, the pit had closed down altogether. The big wheel at the top of the shaft spun no more. The men no longer flowed in a stream to the pit-yard at the shift changes. Instead, they signed on at the Labor Exchange. They stood on the corner by the Exchange, waiting for work. But no work came. It seemed that they were in what the newspapers called “the stricken areas”—sections of the country from which all industry had gone. Whole villages of people were out of work. There was no way of earning a living. The Government gave the people a “dole”—a weekly sum of money—so that they could stay alive.</p>
        <p>Joe knew this. He had heard people talking in the village. He had seen the men at the Labor Exchange. He knew that his father no longer went to work. He knew, too, that his father and mother never spoke of it before him—that in their rough, kind way they had tried to keep their burdens of living from bearing also on his young shoulders.<br>
Though his brain told him these things, his heart still cried for Lassie. But he silenced it. He stood steadily and then asked one question.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Couldn’t we buy her back some day, Mother?”</p>
        <p>“Now, Joe, she was a very valuable dog and she’s worth too much for us. But we’ll get another dog some day. Just wait. Times might pick up, and then we’ll get another pup. Wouldn’t ye like that?”</p>
        <p>Joe Carraclough bent his head and shook it slowly. His voice was only a whisper.</p>
        <p>“I don’t ever want another dog. Never! I only want—Lassie!”</p>

          <strong>The Thought Fox&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>I imagine this midnight moment’s forest:<br>
Something else is alive<br>
Beside the clock’s loneliness<br>
And this blank page where my fingers move.</p>
        <p>Through the window I see no star:<br>
Something more near<br>
Though deeper within darkness<br>
Is entering the loneliness:</p>
        <p>Cold, delicately as the dark snow<br>
A fox’s nose touches twig, leaf;<br>
Two eyes serve a movement, that now<br>
And again now, and now, and now</p>
        <p>Sets neat prints into the snow<br>
Between trees, and warily a lame<br>
Shadow lags by stump and in hollow<br>
Of a body that is bold to come</p>
        <p>Across clearings, an eye,<br>
A widening deepening greenness,<br>
Brilliantly, concentratedly,<br>
Coming about its own business</p>
        <p>Till, with a sudden sharp hot stink of fox<br>
It enters the dark hole of the head.<br>
The window is starless still; the clock ticks,<br>
The page is printed.</p>

          <strong>The Thought Fox&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>I imagine this midnight moment’s forest:<br>
Something else is alive<br>
Beside the clock’s loneliness<br>
And this blank page where my fingers move.</p>
        <p>Through the window I see no star:<br>
Something more near<br>
Though deeper within darkness<br>
Is entering the loneliness:</p>
        <p>Cold, delicately as the dark snow<br>
A fox’s nose touches twig, leaf;<br>
Two eyes serve a movement, that now<br>
And again now, and now, and now</p>
        <p>Sets neat prints into the snow<br>
Between trees, and warily a lame<br>
Shadow lags by stump and in hollow<br>
Of a body that is bold to come</p>
        <p>Across clearings, an eye,<br>
A widening deepening greenness,<br>
Brilliantly, concentratedly,<br>
Coming about its own business</p>
        <p>Till, with a sudden sharp hot stink of fox<br>
It enters the dark hole of the head.<br>
The window is starless still; the clock ticks,<br>
The page is printed.</p>

A widening deepening greenness,<br>

          <br>
          <strong>Whale Migration</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Whale migration is one of nature’s most extraordinary events, marked by vast oceanic journeys that span thousands of kilometres. These movements are driven primarily by the need to feed and breed. During summer, whales migrate to cold, nutrient-rich waters like those near Antarctica to feast on krill, small fish, and plankton. In winter, they head to warmer tropical waters where they give birth and nurture their young. The warmer conditions are crucial for the survival of calves, which are not yet adapted to the harsh cold of polar seas. This cycle of movement demonstrates the whales’ remarkable endurance and highlights their vital role in maintaining the balance of marine ecosystems</p>
        <p>Several whale species undertake these long migrations, each with distinct routes and destinations. Humpback whales are among the most well-known migrators, travelling up to 10,000 km between Antarctic feeding grounds and breeding areas along the east and west coasts of Australia. Blue whales, the largest animals on Earth, also make these monumental journeys, as do grey whales, which travel between Alaska and Mexico. Southern right whales are another migratory species regularly spotted along Australian coastlines. Migration routes are specific to species, shaped by both geography and environmental conditions. <strong>(A)</strong>.................</p>
        <p>Whales use a variety of navigation methods to traverse the oceans with incredible precision. Scientists believe whales can detect the Earth’s magnetic field and may use it like a compass. In addition, they may navigate using the position of the sun and stars, similar to early human explorers. Echolocation and sound also play a crucial role; whales emit sounds and listen to the echoes, helping them to map their environment, locate other whales, and avoid obstacles. Male humpback whales are particularly famous for their long, complex songs that may serve as mating calls and help maintain contact between individuals during migration. <strong>(B)</strong>.................</p>
        <p>Throughout their migrations, whales face numerous threats from both natural changes and human activity. Climate change affects the availability of food, alters migration timing, and increases the frequency of extreme weather events. Ship strikes are a serious danger, especially in busy shipping lanes, while entanglement in fishing gear can cause injury or death. Pollution, particularly plastics and oil spills, harms both whales and their habitats. Additionally, noise pollution from shipping and underwater drilling interferes with whales’ ability to communicate and navigate. <strong>(C)</strong>.................</p>
        <p>Ocean currents are another important factor influencing whale migration. Whales often follow currents that help them conserve energy during long-distance travel. For instance, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current assists baleen whales moving from polar feeding zones to tropical breeding areas. Coastal currents also guide whales along predictable paths that researchers used to monitor their movements. Some whales feed opportunistically during migration, especially if they come across abundant prey. <strong>(D)</strong>................. The significance of whale migration extends far beyond their own survival—it plays a key role in the health of marine ecosystems. Through their feeding and movement patterns, whales help regulate prey populations and distribute nutrients across the ocean. Their waste acts as a fertiliser for plankton, forming the base of the marine food web, known as the “whale pump”. This process contributes to ocean productivity and supports biodiversity. <strong>(E)</strong>.................</p>
        <p>The future of whale migration depends on our collective efforts to protect their habitats, limit human impact, and address climate challenges. Through responsible tourism, community engagement, and international cooperation, we can ensure that these majestic creatures continue to make their spectacular journeys for generations to come. <strong>(F)</strong>.................</p>

<br>
Before the rise of modern linguistics, most European schoolmasters treated bilingualism as a defect to be corrected. In the late nineteenth century, classroom walls often displayed a single, solemn rule: “Speak the national tongue—or be punished.” Children from Breton, Basque, Gaelic, or Sorbian homes who slipped into their family language—even at recess—were handed a heavy “language stone” to wear around their necks all day or were made to stand in a corner wearing a tattered dunce‑cap. Administrators warned parents that two languages would “divide the intellect,” blaming multilingual households for everything from sloppy handwriting to moral slackness. Textbooks echoed the era’s social‑Darwinist anxieties, insisting that linguistic uniformity forged patriotic obedience and economic efficiency. Ironically, the same governments were proud to export diplomats fluent in half a dozen tongues; it was only the working class whose multi-language ability was condemned. The crackdown had lasting effects: by 1910, several regional languages reported sharp drops in being passed across generations, proving that using punishment in teaching could silence not only children but entire cultures.<br>

<br>
I grew up on a fishing boat that chased the herring from Icelandic fjords to Spanish coves. My father taught me sea‑weather, my mother Greek verbs. By fourteen I could curse the waves in five languages. The Atlantic became a polyglot classroom: Portuguese shouted across decks, Norwegian sung while mending nets, Arabic whispered in Morocco’s night bazaars. Every port added another phrase, another way to think.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
When gales battered the hull, I muttered Portuguese prayers I’d stolen from a Lisbon net‑mender; when the engine faltered, I calculated repairs in terse Norwegian. Five tongues lived in my mouth like nested birds—each borrowing feathers from the next. I learned that a language is not merely spoken; it is tasted, inhaled, and clenched between teeth when fear rises with the swell. The sea, in teaching me to survive, also taught me to translate myself.<br>

<br>
A growing body of interdisciplinary evidence now positions multilingualism as a cognitive, medical, and economic asset. Functional‑MRI scans from studies at the University of Barcelona reveals that adults fluent in at least two languages display heightened brain density in both the regions associated with task switching and sustained attention. Patterns tracked in Montreal and Zurich add a new dimension: participants who used two languages daily delayed the first medical signs of age‑related dementia by an average of four to six years compared with single-language users.&nbsp; A 2023 analysis, combining data from 27 countries, reports that competent bilinguals earn roughly 11 percent more in international industries, with trilingual netting up to 18 percent. Educational policy is beginning to respond; dual-language programs in public schools in Finland and Singapore now outpace traditional programs on standardised literacy metrics. Critics once warned that early exposure to multiple grammars would confuse children, but the consensus has flipped: simultaneous acquisition of languages strengthens—not fractures—understanding of grammar. In short, speaking several languages is no longer seen as a strange hobby; it is emerging as a cornerstone of people’s economic worth in the twenty‑first century.<br>

<br>
The United Nations now issues every newborn an implantable PolyChip—a quantum structure that streams real‑time translation directly to our hearing. Diplomatic messages proceed without interpreters; trade deals are signed in minutes. Yet, beneath the neon shimmer of megacities, an “Unplugged Guild” gathers in candlelit archives. They tape over their implants with copper foil, claiming the chip erodes nuance, compressing poetry into commodity. Twice a week they meet in abandoned libraries to learn languages the old way—scribbling unfamiliar alphabets, rolling strange phrases across uncertain tongues, stumbling into laughter when idioms misfire. The Ministry of Harmony brands them Romantics, yet their numbers swell with each cycle of the moon. Rumours swirl that the Guild is composing a manifesto in a hybrid tongue the chip cannot translate—a living reminder that language, like rebellion, thrives in the spaces that computers overlook.<br>
