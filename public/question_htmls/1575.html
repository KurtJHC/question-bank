      <div class="col-6"><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>My Childhood</strong><br><br><em>by Rebecca Priestley</em><br><br>
&nbsp;I started school in London. As a newly single mother with two pre-school children, my mother, Ruth, had embraced the freedoms of the 1970s, and had taken us to live in London for six months where she took sculpture and dance classes and sold hand-painted and embroidered clothes to north London boutiques. When we returned to our rented house on a hillside acre in the ‘semi-rural’ suburb of Korokoro in Wellington, a young family were living in one room of the house: Jane and Paul and baby Toby.<br>
&nbsp;
<p><span class="txt-underline">&nbsp;<strong>‘This is <em>our</em> house,’</strong></span> I proclaimed as they greeted us at the door. My hostility was short-lived—it was fun having a baby around and soon sharing a house with another family was what we did. We had returned to New Zealand in summer, but it was months before Rachel and I would venture further than the rectangle of cracked concrete outside the back door, the size of our London backyard. Once I was confident in our expanse of garden I would run from the house, past an enormous veggie patch, past an enormous kōwhai tree that always bloomed in time for Rachel’s birthday, past a high bank crawling with banana passionfruit and topped by damson trees. At the end of the garden, next to a line of trees that marked the next-door boundary, was an old wooden shed. If you dared look inside, you could see—through the darkness and the ubiquitous spiders’ webs—dead seagulls hanging from the ceiling. It was art, or somewhere in the process of becoming art.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Inside the house, in Jane and Paul’s room, was a large stuffed owl looking down from a high dresser. In the living room, more birds watched me: black-and white photographs of the birds and Paul’s own drawings, all safely behind glass.<br>
<br>
We were often taken to exhibition openings where we would inevitably have our photos taken. In the London scrapbooks Ruth made for us—they continued for a few months after our return—is a clipping from the front page of the Dominion from August 1973. It shows a large picture of Rachel, knees and hands on the floor, forehead resting on a <span class="txt-underline"><strong>block of rubber on top of two bricks</strong></span>. Beside the installation was a sign: <em>Kneel on pillow and bounce forehead against rubber until enlightened</em>. Sometimes it was Ruth’s art on show. In their coverage of a ‘preview to their exhibition of paintings’ by Ruth and Joanna Paul, the newspaper printed a photo of me, aged five, and Rachel, three, wearing embroidered clothes and looking straight at the camera. Rachel is smiling. ‘These wistful little girls attracted almost as much attention as their mum’s paintings,’ said the caption.<br>
<br>
Some of the openings I don’t need a picture of to remember. One time the architect, Ian Athfield, and another man — both grinning behind their beards — strode into a gallery, where the men all wore jeans and the women dresses and everyone had long hair, and poured a bucket of cold baked beans onto the floor. Straight away Rachel and Toby got down onto the floor and used their fingers to draw patterns in the beans. Toby put a few beans in his mouth. It was art. By now I knew the photographers were watching and I was too self-conscious to join in. Besides, I was the oldest. I didn’t do finger painting.<br>
<br>
Locals called our house ‘the commune’. My mother was a ‘Ms’, or just ‘Ruth’. I wore handmade or second-hand clothes and we ate brown rice and lentil curries. I didn’t even wish I was like the other kids; I just knew that I wasn’t. Being a white- socked, neat haired girl with a Mr and a Mrs for parents and Mallowpuffs in the kitchen and a colour TV in the living room was way beyond my reach.</p>

      <div class="col-6"><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>My Childhood</strong><br><br><em>by Rebecca Priestley</em><br><br>
&nbsp;I started school in London. As a newly single mother with two pre-school children, my mother, Ruth, had embraced the freedoms of the 1970s, and had taken us to live in London for six months where she took sculpture and dance classes and sold hand-painted and embroidered clothes to north London boutiques. When we returned to our rented house on a hillside acre in the ‘semi-rural’ suburb of Korokoro in Wellington, a young family were living in one room of the house: Jane and Paul and baby Toby.<br>
&nbsp;
<p><span class="txt-underline">&nbsp;<strong>‘This is <em>our</em> house,’</strong></span> I proclaimed as they greeted us at the door. My hostility was short-lived—it was fun having a baby around and soon sharing a house with another family was what we did. We had returned to New Zealand in summer, but it was months before Rachel and I would venture further than the rectangle of cracked concrete outside the back door, the size of our London backyard. Once I was confident in our expanse of garden I would run from the house, past an enormous veggie patch, past an enormous kōwhai tree that always bloomed in time for Rachel’s birthday, past a high bank crawling with banana passionfruit and topped by damson trees. At the end of the garden, next to a line of trees that marked the next-door boundary, was an old wooden shed. If you dared look inside, you could see—through the darkness and the ubiquitous spiders’ webs—dead seagulls hanging from the ceiling. It was art, or somewhere in the process of becoming art.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Inside the house, in Jane and Paul’s room, was a large stuffed owl looking down from a high dresser. In the living room, more birds watched me: black-and white photographs of the birds and Paul’s own drawings, all safely behind glass.<br>
<br>
We were often taken to exhibition openings where we would inevitably have our photos taken. In the London scrapbooks Ruth made for us—they continued for a few months after our return—is a clipping from the front page of the Dominion from August 1973. It shows a large picture of Rachel, knees and hands on the floor, forehead resting on a <span class="txt-underline"><strong>block of rubber on top of two bricks</strong></span>. Beside the installation was a sign: <em>Kneel on pillow and bounce forehead against rubber until enlightened</em>. Sometimes it was Ruth’s art on show. In their coverage of a ‘preview to their exhibition of paintings’ by Ruth and Joanna Paul, the newspaper printed a photo of me, aged five, and Rachel, three, wearing embroidered clothes and looking straight at the camera. Rachel is smiling. ‘These wistful little girls attracted almost as much attention as their mum’s paintings,’ said the caption.<br>
<br>
Some of the openings I don’t need a picture of to remember. One time the architect, Ian Athfield, and another man — both grinning behind their beards — strode into a gallery, where the men all wore jeans and the women dresses and everyone had long hair, and poured a bucket of cold baked beans onto the floor. Straight away Rachel and Toby got down onto the floor and used their fingers to draw patterns in the beans. Toby put a few beans in his mouth. It was art. By now I knew the photographers were watching and I was too self-conscious to join in. Besides, I was the oldest. I didn’t do finger painting.<br>
<br>
Locals called our house ‘the commune’. My mother was a ‘Ms’, or just ‘Ruth’. I wore handmade or second-hand clothes and we ate brown rice and lentil curries. I didn’t even wish I was like the other kids; I just knew that I wasn’t. Being a white- socked, neat haired girl with a Mr and a Mrs for parents and Mallowpuffs in the kitchen and a colour TV in the living room was way beyond my reach.</p>

We were often taken to exhibition openings where we would inevitably have our photos taken. In the London scrapbooks Ruth made for us—they continued for a few months after our return—is a clipping from the front page of the Dominion from August 1973. It shows a large picture of Rachel, knees and hands on the floor, forehead resting on a <span class="txt-underline"><strong>block of rubber on top of two bricks</strong></span>. Beside the installation was a sign: <em>Kneel on pillow and bounce forehead against rubber until enlightened</em>. Sometimes it was Ruth’s art on show. In their coverage of a ‘preview to their exhibition of paintings’ by Ruth and Joanna Paul, the newspaper printed a photo of me, aged five, and Rachel, three, wearing embroidered clothes and looking straight at the camera. Rachel is smiling. ‘These wistful little girls attracted almost as much attention as their mum’s paintings,’ said the caption.<br>
<br>
Some of the openings I don’t need a picture of to remember. One time the architect, Ian Athfield, and another man — both grinning behind their beards — strode into a gallery, where the men all wore jeans and the women dresses and everyone had long hair, and poured a bucket of cold baked beans onto the floor. Straight away Rachel and Toby got down onto the floor and used their fingers to draw patterns in the beans. Toby put a few beans in his mouth. It was art. By now I knew the photographers were watching and I was too self-conscious to join in. Besides, I was the oldest. I didn’t do finger painting.<br>
<br>
Locals called our house ‘the commune’. My mother was a ‘Ms’, or just ‘Ruth’. I wore handmade or second-hand clothes and we ate brown rice and lentil curries. I didn’t even wish I was like the other kids; I just knew that I wasn’t. Being a white- socked, neat haired girl with a Mr and a Mrs for parents and Mallowpuffs in the kitchen and a colour TV in the living room was way beyond my reach.</p>

      <div class="col-6"><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>My Childhood</strong><br><br><em>by Rebecca Priestley</em><br><br>
&nbsp;I started school in London. As a newly single mother with two pre-school children, my mother, Ruth, had embraced the freedoms of the 1970s, and had taken us to live in London for six months where she took sculpture and dance classes and sold hand-painted and embroidered clothes to north London boutiques. When we returned to our rented house on a hillside acre in the ‘semi-rural’ suburb of Korokoro in Wellington, a young family were living in one room of the house: Jane and Paul and baby Toby.<br>
&nbsp;
<p><span class="txt-underline">&nbsp;<strong>‘This is <em>our</em> house,’</strong></span> I proclaimed as they greeted us at the door. My hostility was short-lived—it was fun having a baby around and soon sharing a house with another family was what we did. We had returned to New Zealand in summer, but it was months before Rachel and I would venture further than the rectangle of cracked concrete outside the back door, the size of our London backyard. Once I was confident in our expanse of garden I would run from the house, past an enormous veggie patch, past an enormous kōwhai tree that always bloomed in time for Rachel’s birthday, past a high bank crawling with banana passionfruit and topped by damson trees. At the end of the garden, next to a line of trees that marked the next-door boundary, was an old wooden shed. If you dared look inside, you could see—through the darkness and the ubiquitous spiders’ webs—dead seagulls hanging from the ceiling. It was art, or somewhere in the process of becoming art.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Inside the house, in Jane and Paul’s room, was a large stuffed owl looking down from a high dresser. In the living room, more birds watched me: black-and white photographs of the birds and Paul’s own drawings, all safely behind glass.<br>
<br>
We were often taken to exhibition openings where we would inevitably have our photos taken. In the London scrapbooks Ruth made for us—they continued for a few months after our return—is a clipping from the front page of the Dominion from August 1973. It shows a large picture of Rachel, knees and hands on the floor, forehead resting on a <span class="txt-underline"><strong>block of rubber on top of two bricks</strong></span>. Beside the installation was a sign: <em>Kneel on pillow and bounce forehead against rubber until enlightened</em>. Sometimes it was Ruth’s art on show. In their coverage of a ‘preview to their exhibition of paintings’ by Ruth and Joanna Paul, the newspaper printed a photo of me, aged five, and Rachel, three, wearing embroidered clothes and looking straight at the camera. Rachel is smiling. ‘These wistful little girls attracted almost as much attention as their mum’s paintings,’ said the caption.<br>
<br>
Some of the openings I don’t need a picture of to remember. One time the architect, Ian Athfield, and another man — both grinning behind their beards — strode into a gallery, where the men all wore jeans and the women dresses and everyone had long hair, and poured a bucket of cold baked beans onto the floor. Straight away Rachel and Toby got down onto the floor and used their fingers to draw patterns in the beans. Toby put a few beans in his mouth. It was art. By now I knew the photographers were watching and I was too self-conscious to join in. Besides, I was the oldest. I didn’t do finger painting.<br>
<br>
Locals called our house ‘the commune’. My mother was a ‘Ms’, or just ‘Ruth’. I wore handmade or second-hand clothes and we ate brown rice and lentil curries. I didn’t even wish I was like the other kids; I just knew that I wasn’t. Being a white- socked, neat haired girl with a Mr and a Mrs for parents and Mallowpuffs in the kitchen and a colour TV in the living room was way beyond my reach.</p>

      <div class="col-6"><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>My Childhood</strong><br><br><em>by Rebecca Priestley</em><br><br>
&nbsp;I started school in London. As a newly single mother with two pre-school children, my mother, Ruth, had embraced the freedoms of the 1970s, and had taken us to live in London for six months where she took sculpture and dance classes and sold hand-painted and embroidered clothes to north London boutiques. When we returned to our rented house on a hillside acre in the ‘semi-rural’ suburb of Korokoro in Wellington, a young family were living in one room of the house: Jane and Paul and baby Toby.<br>
&nbsp;
<p><span class="txt-underline">&nbsp;<strong>‘This is <em>our</em> house,’</strong></span> I proclaimed as they greeted us at the door. My hostility was short-lived—it was fun having a baby around and soon sharing a house with another family was what we did. We had returned to New Zealand in summer, but it was months before Rachel and I would venture further than the rectangle of cracked concrete outside the back door, the size of our London backyard. Once I was confident in our expanse of garden I would run from the house, past an enormous veggie patch, past an enormous kōwhai tree that always bloomed in time for Rachel’s birthday, past a high bank crawling with banana passionfruit and topped by damson trees. At the end of the garden, next to a line of trees that marked the next-door boundary, was an old wooden shed. If you dared look inside, you could see—through the darkness and the ubiquitous spiders’ webs—dead seagulls hanging from the ceiling. It was art, or somewhere in the process of becoming art.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Inside the house, in Jane and Paul’s room, was a large stuffed owl looking down from a high dresser. In the living room, more birds watched me: black-and white photographs of the birds and Paul’s own drawings, all safely behind glass.<br>
<br>
We were often taken to exhibition openings where we would inevitably have our photos taken. In the London scrapbooks Ruth made for us—they continued for a few months after our return—is a clipping from the front page of the Dominion from August 1973. It shows a large picture of Rachel, knees and hands on the floor, forehead resting on a <span class="txt-underline"><strong>block of rubber on top of two bricks</strong></span>. Beside the installation was a sign: <em>Kneel on pillow and bounce forehead against rubber until enlightened</em>. Sometimes it was Ruth’s art on show. In their coverage of a ‘preview to their exhibition of paintings’ by Ruth and Joanna Paul, the newspaper printed a photo of me, aged five, and Rachel, three, wearing embroidered clothes and looking straight at the camera. Rachel is smiling. ‘These wistful little girls attracted almost as much attention as their mum’s paintings,’ said the caption.<br>
<br>
Some of the openings I don’t need a picture of to remember. One time the architect, Ian Athfield, and another man — both grinning behind their beards — strode into a gallery, where the men all wore jeans and the women dresses and everyone had long hair, and poured a bucket of cold baked beans onto the floor. Straight away Rachel and Toby got down onto the floor and used their fingers to draw patterns in the beans. Toby put a few beans in his mouth. It was art. By now I knew the photographers were watching and I was too self-conscious to join in. Besides, I was the oldest. I didn’t do finger painting.<br>
<br>
Locals called our house ‘the commune’. My mother was a ‘Ms’, or just ‘Ruth’. I wore handmade or second-hand clothes and we ate brown rice and lentil curries. I didn’t even wish I was like the other kids; I just knew that I wasn’t. Being a white- socked, neat haired girl with a Mr and a Mrs for parents and Mallowpuffs in the kitchen and a colour TV in the living room was way beyond my reach.</p>

Between what was and what can be.<br>
I am the pathway to a new life.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am made of mush,<br>
Because my heart melted when I saw you<br>
matted and sore, limping, depressed,<br>
Lonely, unwanted, afraid to love.<br>

For one little time you are mine.<br>
I will feed you with my own hand<br>
I will love you with my whole heart<br>
I will make you whole.<br>

<strong>How do ants communicate?</strong><br>
<br>
How does an ant society actually function? The ants are unable to talk to each other, and their eyes are nowhere near our human eyes. So how do they communicate with each other? When presented with the word communication, most humans would probably associate it with language or speech. <strong>15 .......... </strong>This way, we can create an infinite amount of words and as a result tell extremely complex stories.&nbsp; The communication of ants is not quite as advanced, but most people would probably agree that it is impressingly refined.<br>
<br>
An ant colony can consist of several millions of workers. How can such a large society be the well-organised machinery we’ve observed it to be? The ants solve the barriers of communication in several ways: scent (pheromones); touch; body language; and sound. <strong>16 .......... </strong>Using them and with the help of an advanced system of pheromones they can “smell” a wide range of topics, ranging from colony activity to territorial conquest. Through millions of years the ants have developed specific pheromone-cocktails to communicate different things to fellow ants. To receive the messages they use their antennas, much the same way we would use our nose if blind and deaf. Of course, all scents aren’t known by man, but we do know a lot about their system. For example, each colony carries their own unique set of pheromones, making it possible to tell friend from foe. For a human being it might seem odd that an ant can sort this out in a matter of milliseconds, but through scent it is possible, and it often comes in very handy.<br>
<br>
Ants communicate through motion and touch. Myrmecologists, Bert Hölldobler and Edward O. Wilson gives an account of observations of weaver ant communication (Oecophylla longinoda) in their book <em>Journey to the Ants</em>. It is clear that it is all actually quite advanced. For example, the ants tend to lay out scent trails to food sources, like breadcrumbs, for other workers to find and follow. When a single worker has found something they will run back to the colony whilst sprinkling small drops of pheromones on the ground for other workers to follow. The myrmecologists explains that there are five different ways the ants can mix and vary these signals. When a worker ant meets a member of the colony, they can tell it things by moving their body in a specific manner, or simply by the touching of antennas. <strong>17 ..........</strong> If the first ant has found something edible, they will most likely give the other ant a taste of it from a sample out of their mouth.<br>
<br>
Ants also communicate through body language. Just like humans, the ants use body language to communicate things. <strong>18 ..........</strong> This way, they can combine signals of pheromones with that of touch and body language, providing an advanced form of communication. One example of a peculiar dialogue is when the ants, by lightly pressing a section of another ant’s head, can produce a jaw reflex, giving the first ant the opportunity&nbsp;to taste the diet of the other ant. It is not uncommon for ants to save some of their food for later or for members of the colony. This dialogue might seem strange to us, but there is no reluctance involved in this from any of the two ants.<br>
<br>
Do ants speak to each other? Yes! Another peculiar way of how ants communicate is by sound. A majority of ant species can communicate by sound, although it is commonly unknown to most people because of its low resonance. The ants can procure different sounds by scraping their legs on a washboard-like part of their body, thus accomplishing different sounds. <strong>19 ..........</strong> The sound is actually possible for us to perceive if we hold an ant very close to the ear, listening carefully.<br>
<br>
The sounds are used in different ways, depending on the species. A great example of the use of sound is when a worker ant has been caught somewhere.<strong> 20 ..........</strong> The ant can use sound as a distress call, signalling their location to the other workers through the walls. This could not be achieved by pheromones.</div>

Six sentences have been removed from the text. Choose from the sentences (<strong>A – G</strong>) the one which fits each gap (<strong>15 – 20</strong>). There is one extra sentence which you do not need to use.<br>
<br>
<strong>How do ants communicate?</strong><br>
<br>
How does an ant society actually function? The ants are unable to talk to each other, and their eyes are nowhere near our human eyes. So how do they communicate with each other? When presented with the word communication, most humans would probably associate it with language or speech. <strong>15 .......... </strong>This way, we can create an infinite amount of words and as a result tell extremely complex stories.&nbsp; The communication of ants is not quite as advanced, but most people would probably agree that it is impressingly refined.<br>
<br>
An ant colony can consist of several millions of workers. How can such a large society be the well-organised machinery we’ve observed it to be? The ants solve the barriers of communication in several ways: scent (pheromones); touch; body language; and sound. <strong>16 .......... </strong>Using them and with the help of an advanced system of pheromones they can “smell” a wide range of topics, ranging from colony activity to territorial conquest. Through millions of years the ants have developed specific pheromone-cocktails to communicate different things to fellow ants. To receive the messages they use their antennas, much the same way we would use our nose if blind and deaf. Of course, all scents aren’t known by man, but we do know a lot about their system. For example, each colony carries their own unique set of pheromones, making it possible to tell friend from foe. For a human being it might seem odd that an ant can sort this out in a matter of milliseconds, but through scent it is possible, and it often comes in very handy.<br>
<br>
Ants communicate through motion and touch. Myrmecologists, Bert Hölldobler and Edward O. Wilson gives an account of observations of weaver ant communication (Oecophylla longinoda) in their book <em>Journey to the Ants</em>. It is clear that it is all actually quite advanced. For example, the ants tend to lay out scent trails to food sources, like breadcrumbs, for other workers to find and follow. When a single worker has found something they will run back to the colony whilst sprinkling small drops of pheromones on the ground for other workers to follow. The myrmecologists explains that there are five different ways the ants can mix and vary these signals. When a worker ant meets a member of the colony, they can tell it things by moving their body in a specific manner, or simply by the touching of antennas. <strong>17 ..........</strong> If the first ant has found something edible, they will most likely give the other ant a taste of it from a sample out of their mouth.<br>
<br>
Ants also communicate through body language. Just like humans, the ants use body language to communicate things. <strong>18 ..........</strong> This way, they can combine signals of pheromones with that of touch and body language, providing an advanced form of communication. One example of a peculiar dialogue is when the ants, by lightly pressing a section of another ant’s head, can produce a jaw reflex, giving the first ant the opportunity&nbsp;to taste the diet of the other ant. It is not uncommon for ants to save some of their food for later or for members of the colony. This dialogue might seem strange to us, but there is no reluctance involved in this from any of the two ants.<br>
<br>
Do ants speak to each other? Yes! Another peculiar way of how ants communicate is by sound. A majority of ant species can communicate by sound, although it is commonly unknown to most people because of its low resonance. The ants can procure different sounds by scraping their legs on a washboard-like part of their body, thus accomplishing different sounds. <strong>19 ..........</strong> The sound is actually possible for us to perceive if we hold an ant very close to the ear, listening carefully.<br>
<br>
The sounds are used in different ways, depending on the species. A great example of the use of sound is when a worker ant has been caught somewhere.<strong> 20 ..........</strong> The ant can use sound as a distress call, signalling their location to the other workers through the walls. This could not be achieved by pheromones.</div>

<br>
<strong>How do ants communicate?</strong><br>
<br>
How does an ant society actually function? The ants are unable to talk to each other, and their eyes are nowhere near our human eyes. So how do they communicate with each other? When presented with the word communication, most humans would probably associate it with language or speech. <strong>15 .......... </strong>This way, we can create an infinite amount of words and as a result tell extremely complex stories.&nbsp; The communication of ants is not quite as advanced, but most people would probably agree that it is impressingly refined.<br>
<br>
An ant colony can consist of several millions of workers. How can such a large society be the well-organised machinery we’ve observed it to be? The ants solve the barriers of communication in several ways: scent (pheromones); touch; body language; and sound. <strong>16 .......... </strong>Using them and with the help of an advanced system of pheromones they can “smell” a wide range of topics, ranging from colony activity to territorial conquest. Through millions of years the ants have developed specific pheromone-cocktails to communicate different things to fellow ants. To receive the messages they use their antennas, much the same way we would use our nose if blind and deaf. Of course, all scents aren’t known by man, but we do know a lot about their system. For example, each colony carries their own unique set of pheromones, making it possible to tell friend from foe. For a human being it might seem odd that an ant can sort this out in a matter of milliseconds, but through scent it is possible, and it often comes in very handy.<br>
<br>
Ants communicate through motion and touch. Myrmecologists, Bert Hölldobler and Edward O. Wilson gives an account of observations of weaver ant communication (Oecophylla longinoda) in their book <em>Journey to the Ants</em>. It is clear that it is all actually quite advanced. For example, the ants tend to lay out scent trails to food sources, like breadcrumbs, for other workers to find and follow. When a single worker has found something they will run back to the colony whilst sprinkling small drops of pheromones on the ground for other workers to follow. The myrmecologists explains that there are five different ways the ants can mix and vary these signals. When a worker ant meets a member of the colony, they can tell it things by moving their body in a specific manner, or simply by the touching of antennas. <strong>17 ..........</strong> If the first ant has found something edible, they will most likely give the other ant a taste of it from a sample out of their mouth.<br>
<br>
Ants also communicate through body language. Just like humans, the ants use body language to communicate things. <strong>18 ..........</strong> This way, they can combine signals of pheromones with that of touch and body language, providing an advanced form of communication. One example of a peculiar dialogue is when the ants, by lightly pressing a section of another ant’s head, can produce a jaw reflex, giving the first ant the opportunity&nbsp;to taste the diet of the other ant. It is not uncommon for ants to save some of their food for later or for members of the colony. This dialogue might seem strange to us, but there is no reluctance involved in this from any of the two ants.<br>
<br>
Do ants speak to each other? Yes! Another peculiar way of how ants communicate is by sound. A majority of ant species can communicate by sound, although it is commonly unknown to most people because of its low resonance. The ants can procure different sounds by scraping their legs on a washboard-like part of their body, thus accomplishing different sounds. <strong>19 ..........</strong> The sound is actually possible for us to perceive if we hold an ant very close to the ear, listening carefully.<br>
<br>
The sounds are used in different ways, depending on the species. A great example of the use of sound is when a worker ant has been caught somewhere.<strong> 20 ..........</strong> The ant can use sound as a distress call, signalling their location to the other workers through the walls. This could not be achieved by pheromones.</div>

For a human being it might seem odd that an ant can sort this out in a matter of milliseconds, but through scent it is possible, and it often comes in very handy.<br>
<br>
Ants communicate through motion and touch. Myrmecologists, Bert Hölldobler and Edward O. Wilson gives an account of observations of weaver ant communication (Oecophylla longinoda) in their book <em>Journey to the Ants</em>. It is clear that it is all actually quite advanced. For example, the ants tend to lay out scent trails to food sources, like breadcrumbs, for other workers to find and follow. When a single worker has found something they will run back to the colony whilst sprinkling small drops of pheromones on the ground for other workers to follow. The myrmecologists explains that there are five different ways the ants can mix and vary these signals. When a worker ant meets a member of the colony, they can tell it things by moving their body in a specific manner, or simply by the touching of antennas. <strong>17 ..........</strong> If the first ant has found something edible, they will most likely give the other ant a taste of it from a sample out of their mouth.<br>
<br>
Ants also communicate through body language. Just like humans, the ants use body language to communicate things. <strong>18 ..........</strong> This way, they can combine signals of pheromones with that of touch and body language, providing an advanced form of communication. One example of a peculiar dialogue is when the ants, by lightly pressing a section of another ant’s head, can produce a jaw reflex, giving the first ant the opportunity&nbsp;to taste the diet of the other ant. It is not uncommon for ants to save some of their food for later or for members of the colony. This dialogue might seem strange to us, but there is no reluctance involved in this from any of the two ants.<br>
<br>
Do ants speak to each other? Yes! Another peculiar way of how ants communicate is by sound. A majority of ant species can communicate by sound, although it is commonly unknown to most people because of its low resonance. The ants can procure different sounds by scraping their legs on a washboard-like part of their body, thus accomplishing different sounds. <strong>19 ..........</strong> The sound is actually possible for us to perceive if we hold an ant very close to the ear, listening carefully.<br>
<br>
The sounds are used in different ways, depending on the species. A great example of the use of sound is when a worker ant has been caught somewhere.<strong> 20 ..........</strong> The ant can use sound as a distress call, signalling their location to the other workers through the walls. This could not be achieved by pheromones.</div>

<strong>How do ants communicate?</strong><br>
<br>
How does an ant society actually function? The ants are unable to talk to each other, and their eyes are nowhere near our human eyes. So how do they communicate with each other? When presented with the word communication, most humans would probably associate it with language or speech. <strong>15 .......... </strong>This way, we can create an infinite amount of words and as a result tell extremely complex stories.&nbsp; The communication of ants is not quite as advanced, but most people would probably agree that it is impressingly refined.<br>
<br>
An ant colony can consist of several millions of workers. How can such a large society be the well-organised machinery we’ve observed it to be? The ants solve the barriers of communication in several ways: scent (pheromones); touch; body language; and sound. <strong>16 .......... </strong>Using them and with the help of an advanced system of pheromones they can “smell” a wide range of topics, ranging from colony activity to territorial conquest. Through millions of years the ants have developed specific pheromone-cocktails to communicate different things to fellow ants. To receive the messages they use their antennas, much the same way we would use our nose if blind and deaf. Of course, all scents aren’t known by man, but we do know a lot about their system. For example, each colony carries their own unique set of pheromones, making it possible to tell friend from foe.

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Drought has significantly affected farmers in East Gippsland, Northern Victoria and parts of New South Wales and Queensland, while all other farmers are also affected by the drought to some degree because of increased feed and water costs. Drought can increase the price of feed and deplete water stores for animals and other farm uses. During these times farmers often need to make tough decisions which can affect their health and wellbeing. Climatic variability such as drought presents significant challenges for Australian farmers and their communities, including dairy farmers. Dry conditions can reduce the ability of farmers to grow feed and can also impact the availability and cost of bought in feed. Drought can also deplete water stores for animals and other farm uses. Current dry seasonal conditions across much of Australia have driven up feed and water prices, due to high demand and limited availability. This is impacting all farmers with the cost of grain alone being felt in all agricultural regions. During challenging seasonal conditions, farmers are encouraged to plan ahead and take action to prepare for the season ahead.<br>

Secretary of Agriculture, Claude R. Wickard, himself a farmer, told a meeting of the Future Farmers of America on October 10, 1944: “I like farming. It is a good life. After more than 30 years of it, I still would rather farm than do anything else. I envy you future farmers who have such great things ahead.” Dr. Baker - who may be regarded as a spokesman for the school of farming enthusiasts - said, “I have a son now less than 5 years old, and I hope when he grows up that he will decide to be a farmer.” Dr. Baker’s reasons for wanting his son to be a farmer were as follows. Firstly, a farmer has more and better food to eat than most people who live in cities. Secondly, he is healthier and will probably live longer. Thirdly, he is likely to enjoy his work more than most city people do. And fourthly, he is more likely to rear a family and thereby promote the future welfare of the nation.<br>

Enough food is produced today to feed everyone on the planet, but hunger is on the rise in some parts of the world, and some 821 million people are considered to be “chronically undernourished”. What steps are being taken to ensure that everyone, worldwide, receives sufficient food? Whilst there is no silver bullet to solving hunger, the World Food Programme has outlined a vision that breaks the issue down into five steps. We will look at three of them that focus on food production. Firstly, reduce food waste. Around one third of the food produced each year is loss or wasted, costing the global economy some $1 trillion per year. Secondly, grow a wider variety of crops. Around 60 per cent of all calories consumed come from just four crops: rice, wheat, corn and soy. Ensuring food access and availability in the face of climate change will require the production of a wider range of foods by farmers. And thirdly, focus on using food for child nutrition. Good health and nutrition in a child’s first 1,000 days is essential to prevent stunting and promote healthy development.<br>

So, why and how did I become a farmer? With each passing day, I had a strong urge to break free of the consumerist shackles binding us in its vicious cycle. With every new learning I was moving towards slowly blending my carefully built modern lifestyle with more of the sensible tried and tested ways of life; with just a dash of modern comforts of course, which I can’t live without. When it came to farming, I wanted to do everything with an expert along my side, as we were novices in this field. But I guess that wasn’t part of the grand plan. We would wait and wait for the perfect timing to have an expert by our side to guide us step by step, and somehow it would never materialise. This happened quite a few times before we decided to take things in our own hands and to learn by doing, learn by making mistakes, if that’s what it takes.<br>

Enough food is produced today to feed everyone on the planet, but hunger is on the rise in some parts of the world, and some 821 million people are considered to be “chronically undernourished”. What steps are being taken to ensure that everyone, worldwide, receives sufficient food? Whilst there is no silver bullet to solving hunger, the World Food Programme has outlined a vision that breaks the issue down into five steps. We will look at three of them that focus on food production. Firstly, reduce food waste. Around one third of the food produced each year is loss or wasted, costing the global economy some $1 trillion per year. Secondly, grow a wider variety of crops. Around 60 per cent of all calories consumed come from just four crops: rice, wheat, corn and soy. Ensuring food access and availability in the face of climate change will require the production of a wider range of foods by farmers. And thirdly, focus on using food for child nutrition. Good health and nutrition in a child’s first 1,000 days is essential to prevent stunting and promote healthy development.<br>

So, why and how did I become a farmer? With each passing day, I had a strong urge to break free of the consumerist shackles binding us in its vicious cycle. With every new learning I was moving towards slowly blending my carefully built modern lifestyle with more of the sensible tried and tested ways of life; with just a dash of modern comforts of course, which I can’t live without. When it came to farming, I wanted to do everything with an expert along my side, as we were novices in this field. But I guess that wasn’t part of the grand plan. We would wait and wait for the perfect timing to have an expert by our side to guide us step by step, and somehow it would never materialise. This happened quite a few times before we decided to take things in our own hands and to learn by doing, learn by making mistakes, if that’s what it takes.<br>

Drought has significantly affected farmers in East Gippsland, Northern Victoria and parts of New South Wales and Queensland, while all other farmers are also affected by the drought to some degree because of increased feed and water costs. Drought can increase the price of feed and deplete water stores for animals and other farm uses. During these times farmers often need to make tough decisions which can affect their health and wellbeing. Climatic variability such as drought presents significant challenges for Australian farmers and their communities, including dairy farmers. Dry conditions can reduce the ability of farmers to grow feed and can also impact the availability and cost of bought in feed. Drought can also deplete water stores for animals and other farm uses. Current dry seasonal conditions across much of Australia have driven up feed and water prices, due to high demand and limited availability. This is impacting all farmers with the cost of grain alone being felt in all agricultural regions. During challenging seasonal conditions, farmers are encouraged to plan ahead and take action to prepare for the season ahead.<br>

Secretary of Agriculture, Claude R. Wickard, himself a farmer, told a meeting of the Future Farmers of America on October 10, 1944: “I like farming. It is a good life. After more than 30 years of it, I still would rather farm than do anything else. I envy you future farmers who have such great things ahead.” Dr. Baker - who may be regarded as a spokesman for the school of farming enthusiasts - said, “I have a son now less than 5 years old, and I hope when he grows up that he will decide to be a farmer.” Dr. Baker’s reasons for wanting his son to be a farmer were as follows. Firstly, a farmer has more and better food to eat than most people who live in cities. Secondly, he is healthier and will probably live longer. Thirdly, he is likely to enjoy his work more than most city people do. And fourthly, he is more likely to rear a family and thereby promote the future welfare of the nation.<br>
