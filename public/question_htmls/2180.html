<br>
So how do volcanoes erupt? Deep within the Earth it is so hot that some rocks slowly melt and become a thick flowing substance called magma. Since it is lighter than the solid rock around it, magma rises and collects in magma chambers. Eventually, some of the magma pushes through vents and fissures to the Earth's surface. Magma that has erupted is called lava.<br>
<br>
Some volcanic eruptions are explosive and others are not. If magma is thin and runny, gases can escape easily from it. When this type of magma erupts, it flows out of the volcano. A good example is the eruptions at Hawaii’s volcanoes. Lava flows rarely kill people because they move slowly enough for people to get out of their way. If magma is thick and sticky, gases cannot escape easily. Pressure builds up until the gases escape violently and explode. A good example is the eruption of Washington’s Mount St. Helens. In this type of eruption, the magma blasts into the air and breaks apart into pieces called tephra. Tephra can range in size from tiny particles of ash to house-size boulders.<br>
<br>
Explosive volcanic eruptions can be dangerous and deadly. They can blast out clouds of hot tephra from the side or top of a volcano. These fiery clouds race down mountainsides destroying almost everything in their path. Ash erupted into the sky falls back to Earth like powdery snow. If thick enough, blankets of ash can suffocate plants, animals, and humans. When hot volcanic materials mix with water from streams or melted snow and ice, mudflows form. Mudflows have buried entire communities located near erupting volcanoes.<br>

<br>
The ancient cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum thrived near the base of Mount Vesuvius at the Bay of Naples in the modern-day Italy. In the time of the early Roman Empire, 20,000 people lived in Pompeii, including merchants, manufacturers, and farmers who exploited the rich soil of the region with numerous vineyards and orchards. None suspected that the black fertile earth was the legacy of earlier eruptions of Mount Vesuvius.<br>
<br>
On August 24, 79 AD, after centuries of dormancy, Mount Vesuvius erupted in southern Italy, devastating the prosperous Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum and killing thousands. The cities, buried under a thick layer of volcanic material and mud, were never rebuilt and largely forgotten in the course of history. In the 18th century, Pompeii and Herculaneum were rediscovered and excavated, providing an archaeological record of everyday life in ancient civilisation, startlingly preserved in sudden death.<br>
<br>
Today, Mount Vesuvius is the only active volcano on the European mainland. Its last eruption was in 1944 and its last major eruption in 1631. Another eruption is expected in the near future, which could be devastating for 700,000 people who live in “death zones” around Vesuvius.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

<br>
Diamonds are brought to the surface from the Earth’s mantle in a rare type of volcanic magma called kimberlite and erupted at a rare type of volcanic vent called a diatreme or pipe. Kimberlite is a gas-rich igneous rock that contains diamonds and other upper mantle minerals. The source depth for kimberlite magmas is estimated at 200 km, more than twice as deep as the source region for most magmas. At a depth of 200 km the pressure is 60,000 times greater than the surface and the temperature is about 1500 C. Kimberlite magmas are rich in carbon dioxide and water which brings the magma quickly and violently to the surface. Kimberlite was named for the rock associated with diamonds in Kimberley, South Africa. Kimberlite magmas form "pipes" as they erupt. A tuff cone is at the surface and formed by base-surge deposits. In the subsurface, a funnel-shaped body narrows to a depth of hundreds of meters. The pipe (also called a diatreme) is filled with kimberlite, with or without diamonds (only 1 in 5 of the pipes at Kimberley contain diamonds).<br>

<br>
On Aug. 27, 1883, just after 10 a.m., the eruption of the Krakatoa volcano in Indonesia made the loudest sound known to history — a terrifying roar that sent sound waves around the world four times and could be heard 3,000 miles away on the island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean. That, for purpose of comparison, is the same as Californians hearing a noise made in New York. In Rodrigues, as in other distant places, the noise was taken to be cannon fire. In western Australia, 2,000 miles distant, people thought war had erupted. In Batavia (now Jakarta), a gas works barometer spiked to an equivalent of 172 decibels, meaning the sound, even 100 miles from its origin, was still many times louder than a jet engine. The devastation from the explosion — which packed power equivalent to 10,000 Hiroshima-sized atomic bombs — made the Krakatoa eruption one of history’s deadliest natural disasters. More than 36,400 people died, from lava flows that raced at 60 miles per hour and tsunamis that reached a height of 120 feet and wiped out some 165 coastal villages. Little was left of the Krakatoa Island in the wake of the explosion. In 1927, a volcanic island known as Anak Krakatoa (child of Krakatoa) emerged from the caldera left behind by the big blast.<br>

<br>
Imperial vs Metric</strong><br><br>
The Metric system started in France during the 1700’s. It is based on the metre (length), gram (weight, or more properly “mass”) and litre (volume). “Metric” comes from the word “metre.”&nbsp;<br>
There is also a system of prefixes for making things bigger (kilo- , mega- , giga- , tera- ) or smaller (milli- , micro- , nano- ) in multiples of 1000: think of your milligrams of medicines or your gigabytes of computing power. <strong>(A)</strong>&nbsp;……….<br>
The Imperial system, on the other hand, is based on the inch / foot / yard / mile (length), the ounce / pound / stone / hundredweight (weight / mass) and the fluid ounce / pint / quart / gallon (volume). The Imperial system is generally not decimal:</p><ul><li>LENGTH: There are 12 inches in a foot, 3 feet in a yard, and 1760 yards in a mile – a curious choice of number with a long and confusing history based on even older lengths called the FURLONG, POLE and CHAIN.</li><li>WEIGHT / MASS: There are 16 ounces in a pound, 14 pounds in a stone, and 8 stones in a hundredweight (or 7 stone 2 pounds if you’re in North America – somewhat confusingly!).</li><li>CAPACITY: <strong>(B)</strong> ……….</li></ul>
These bizarre conversion factors and cross-continental differences are confusing for countries that use the imperial system, whereas the metric system of prefixes deals effortlessly with the miniscule and enormous quantities of modern living – like microns or megabytes. <strong>(C)</strong> ………. : one cm3 is exactly equal to one ml (millilitre), and a litre of water weighs precisely one kilogram. Now, that’s beautiful!<br>
<br>
<strong>Which is more intuitive?</strong><br>
Let’s take length: Most everyday objects we measure are either something you use (a book, a door) or a person (how tall do you think she is?). The inch and foot are just the right size for these measurements!&nbsp;<br>
Most of us can imagine someone who’s 5 foot 4 quite easily: a foot is, well, about the length of an adult’s foot, and the inch is the distance between your thumb and forefinger when you hold them parallel as if to say “about this big”. But “one point six three metres” or “163cm” are both harder for us to process – <strong>(D)</strong> ……….<br>
Now, take weight: Again, the Imperial units were designed with everyday objects in mind – “four ounces of butter” is easier to handle than “114 grams”: the grams are too accurate! So although ingredients such as flour, sugar and butter are now sold by the kilo, many of us still use ounces to weigh them. When weighing ourselves, compare these three equal values: 159lbs, 11 and a bit stone, or 72kg. <strong>(E)</strong> ………. And finally, volume: now both systems are easy to picture: we all know what one pint and one litre look like (if you don’t then look for a pint glass and a one litre bottle of juice in your kitchen). <strong>(F)</strong> ……….<br>

<br>
In modern clothing and fashion design, a button is a small fastener, now most commonly made of plastic but also may be made of metal, wood, or seashell, that joins two pieces of fabric together. In archaeology, a button can be a significant artifact. In the applied arts and craft, a button can be an example of folk art, studio craft, or even a miniature work of art.<br>
<br>
Buttons are most often attached to articles of clothing, but can also be used on containers such as wallets and bags. However, buttons may be sewn onto garments and similar items exclusively for purposes of ornamentation. Buttons serving as fasteners work by slipping through a fabric or thread loop or by sliding through a buttonhole.&nbsp;<br>

<br>
A zipper, zip, fly, or zip fastener, formerly known as a clasp locker, is a commonly used device for binding the edges of an opening of fabric or other flexible material, such as on a garment or a bag. It is used in clothing (e.g., jackets and jeans), luggage and other bags, sporting goods, camping gear (e.g. tents and sleeping bags), and other items.<br>
<br>
Zippers come in all different sizes, shapes, and colours. Whitcomb L. Judson, who was an American inventor from Chicago, is sometimes given credit as the inventor of the zipper, but his device was used for footwear not clothing. The method, still in use today, is based on interlocking teeth. Initially, it was titled the "hookless fastener" and was later redesigned to become more reliable.&nbsp;<br>
<br>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of clothing fasteners. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
A snap fastener (also called press stud, dome fastener, popper, snap or tich) is a pair of interlocking discs, made out of a metal or plastic, commonly used in place of traditional buttons to fasten clothing and for similar purposes. A circular lip under one disc fits into a groove on the top of the other, holding them fast until a certain amount of force is applied. Different types of snaps can be attached to fabric or leather by riveting with a punch and die set specific to the type of rivet snaps used (striking the punch with a hammer to splay the tail), sewing, or plying with special snap pliers.<br>
<br>
Snap fasteners are a noted detail in American Western wear and are also often chosen for children's clothing, as they are relatively easy for children to use compared with traditional buttons.<br>
<br>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of clothing fasteners. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Hook-and-loop fasteners, hook-and-pile fasteners or touch fasteners (often referred to by the genericised trademark velcro, due to the prominence of the Velcro Brand) consist of two components: typically, two lineal fabric strips (or, alternatively, round "dots" or squares) which are attached (sewn or otherwise adhered) to the opposing surfaces to be fastened. The first component features tiny hooks; the second features smaller loops. When the two are pressed together the hooks catch in the loops and the two pieces fasten or bind temporarily. When separated, by pulling or peeling the two surfaces apart, the strips make a distinctive ripping sound.<br>

<br>
Madrid is a cosmopolitan city and is the economic, administrative and financial center of Spain. The city offers vast artistic and cultural legacies and heritage. Whether you're visiting Madrid for business or pleasure, you'll find a pleasing blend of old and new, past and present throughout the streets.<br>
<br>
Madrid is also famous for its sightseeing tours, monuments, and exquisite architectural cathedrals and buildings. While in Madrid, don't pass up an opportunity to visit the 17<sup>th</sup> century <em>Cuchilleros Arch</em> or the <em>San Francisco El Grande Basilica</em>. The Cibeles Fountain is one of the most famous symbols of Madrid, also constructed in the 17<sup>th</sup> century.<br>
<br>

<br>
Barcelona, nestled along the western shores of the Mediterranean, is also a modern and cosmopolitan city, but one rich in history. Visitors to Barcelona can roam among Roman remains, medieval quarters, and 20th century architecture. Barcelona is home to several World Heritage Sites, including architectural wonders by Catalan architects Gaud and Montaner.
<p><br>
Like Madrid, Barcelona offers a variety of parks and gardens, museums, monuments, and other entertainments. The younger crowd may enjoy its beaches. Spanish architecture is at its finest in Barcelona, and visitors to the area shouldn't pass up the opportunity to visit the <em>Picasso Museum</em> or the <em>Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art</em>.<br>
<br>
One cannot visit Barcelona without visiting at least one beach. You have plenty to choose from, <em>La Barceloneta</em> beach to <em>Playa del Paseo Martimo</em> and <em>La Mar Bella</em>, each offering beautiful stretches of beachfront, glistening and warm Mediterranean waters, and easy access.<br>
<br>

<br>
Seville is one of the oldest cities in Spain, and one of the most beautiful. Seville is rich in the heritage of the Moors, located on the banks of the Guadalquivir River. Located in Andalusia, the Southern city is filled with squares, historic quarters and lively streets. The city boasts a large number of theme parks, art centres, museums, and theatres that cater to just about every age and fancy.<br>
<br>
While in Seville, take an afternoon and visit the<em> Seville Museum of Art and Popular Customs</em>, the <em>Andalusia Contemporary Art Center</em>, or the <em>Seville Archaeological Museum</em>.<br>
<br>
View and stroll through the impressive <em>Seville Cathedral</em>, which stands on the side of the great Mosque from the 12<sup>th</sup> century. Or visit the <em>Casa de Pilatos House</em>, whose construction began near the end of the 15<sup>th</sup> century and has become the prototype of Andalusian palaces. One of the most beautiful sights in Seville is the <em>Santa Paula Convent</em>, where nuns still live and sell their unique sweets. No visit to Seville would be complete without visiting the <em>Torre del Oro Tower</em>, one of the most famous symbols of Seville.<br>
<br>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of Spanish Cities. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
If your travels or business ventures happen to take you outside of Madrid, Barcelona, or Seville, see if you can sneak a side trip into a variety of other Spanish destinations including the Canary Islands. Alternatively, take a drive through the Pyrenees Mountains, or take an afternoon drive along the thousands of miles of beachfront roads.<br>
<br>
Cities such as Valencia, Cordoba, and Salamanca offer visitors additional delights, sites, and tourist attractions. Travel the route of the Knights Templar or follow the path of St. James through Spain.<br>
<br>
Spain is home of the second-largest number of World Heritage Sites around the globe. These UNESCO sites are scattered throughout Spain, a majority of them found in Central Spain and along the Mediterranean coastline, from Barcelona to Gibraltar.<br>

The string section itself is divided further into four or five sections, depending on how you break it down. <strong>(C)</strong> ………. violin, viola, cello and bass. The wrinkle comes in since the violin section is divided once more into Violin I and Violin II, or first and second violin sections.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Early compositions, including many during the Baroque era, often used the four string instruments in a soprano-alto-tenor-bass (SATB) arrangement. <strong>(D)</strong> ……….</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Violins = soprano<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Violas = alto<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cellos = tenor<br>

<br>
We took strolls in the musty smelling bazaars of the Shar-e-Nau section of Kabul, or the new city, west of the Wazir Akbar Khan district. We talked about whatever film we had just seen and walked amid the bustling crowds of bazarris. We snaked our way among the merchants and the beggars, wandered through narrow alleys cramped with rows of tiny, tightly packed stalls. Baba gave us each a weekly allowance of ten Afghanis and we spent it on warm Coca-Cola and rosewater ice cream topped with crushed pistachios.<br>

<br>
People went to work Saturday through Thursday and gathered for picnics on Fridays in parks, on the banks of Ghargha Lake, in the gardens of Paghman. Multicoloured buses and lorries filled with passengers rolled through the narrow streets of Kabul, led by the constant shouts of the driver assistants who straddled the vehicles’ rear bumpers and yelped directions to the driver in their thick Kabuli accent. On Eid, the three days of celebration after the holy month of Ramadan, Kabulis dressed in their best and newest clothes and visited their families. People hugged and kissed and greeted each other with “Eid Mubarak” (Happy Eid). Children opened gifts and played with dyed hardboiled eggs.<br>
<br>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme about Afghanistan. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
If Peshawar was the city that reminded me of what Kabul used to be, then Islamabad was the city Kabul could have become someday. The streets were wider than Peshawar’s, cleaner, and lined with rows of hibiscus and flame trees. The bazaars were more organised and not nearly as clogged with rickshaws and pedestrians. The architecture was more elegant too, more modern, and I saw parks where roses and jasmine bloomed in the shadows of trees.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme about Afghanistan. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
In Kabul, it rarely rained in the summer. Blue skies stood tall and far, the sun like a branding iron searing the back of your neck. Creeks where Hassan and I skipped stones all spring turned dry, and rickshaws stirred dust when they sputtered by. People went to mosques for their ten raka’ts of noon time prayer then retreated to whatever shade they could find to nap in, waiting for the cool of early evening. Summer meant long school days sweating in tightly packed, poorly ventilated classrooms learning to recite ayats from the Koran, struggling with those tongue twisting, exotic Arab words. It meant catching flies in your palm while the mullah droned on and a hot breeze brought with it the smell of excrement from the outhouse across the schoolyard, churning dust around the lone rickety basketball hoop.<br>

Wisdom Teeth</strong><br><br>
Wisdom teeth were once an extremely valuable asset to our ancestors. When a typical diet consisted of chewy plants and uncooked meat, third molars (wisdom teeth), which fit easily into our ancestors’ larger jaws, were absolutely necessary. <strong>(A)</strong> ……….</p>
        <p>Today, our diets are not as rough as those of our ancestors. <strong>(B)</strong> ……….&nbsp; And yet, on average, about 65% of the human population is born with wisdom teeth which usually erupt between the ages of 17 and 25.</p>
        <p>Although wisdom teeth were incredibly advantageous for our ancestors, they pose a bit of a problem for the modern mouth. <strong>(C)</strong> ………., and so wisdom teeth are often either too big for the jaw or the jaws themselves are just too small. <strong>(D)</strong> ………. Because of this lack of space, molars often grow sideways, only partially emerging from the gums, or actually get trapped inside the gums and jawbone.</p>
        <p>These impacted wisdom teeth can be chronically contaminated with bacteria associated with infection, tooth decay, inflammation, and gum disease. <strong>(E)</strong> ……….&nbsp; Even when wisdom teeth come in fully, they are so far back in the mouth that it’s just too easy for food to get trapped, leading to plaque, cavities, and gum disease.<br>
<strong>(F)</strong> ………., nowadays, they pose a serious problem to oral health.&nbsp;</p>

<br>
The Commonwealth Bank of Australia was established by the <em>Commonwealth Bank Act 1911</em>, introduced by the Andrew Fisher Labour Government, which favoured bank nationalisation, with effect on 22 December 1911. In a rare move for the time, the bank was to have both savings and general bank business. The bank was also the first bank in Australia to receive a federal government guarantee. The bank's earliest and most strenuous proponent was the flamboyant American-Australian Labour politician, King O'Malley, and its first Governor was Sir Denison Miller.<br>
<br>
The bank opened its first branch in Melbourne on 15 July 1912. In an agreement with Australia Post that exists to this day, the bank also traded through post office agencies. In 1912, it took over the State Savings Bank of Tasmania, and by 1913 it had branches in all six states.<br>
<br>
In 1916, the bank moved its head office to Sydney. It also followed the Australian army into New Guinea, where it opened a branch in Rabaul and agencies elsewhere.<br>

<br>
Westpac has a long and proud history as Australia's first and oldest bank. It was established in 1817 as the Bank of New South Wales under a charter of incorporation provided by Governor Lachlan Macquarie. In October 1982, it changed its name to Westpac Banking Corporation following the acquisition of the Commercial Bank of Australia. When Westpac opened its doors for business, the first employee was Joseph Hyde Potts. As a porter and servant, he received a weekly ration from the King's stores and an annual salary of 25 pounds.<br>

ANZ has a proud heritage of more than 180 years. We operate in 33 markets globally with representation in Australia, New Zealand, Asia, Pacific, Europe, America and the Middle East. ANZ is among the top 4 banks in Australia, the largest banking group in New Zealand and the Pacific, and among the top 50 banks in the world. ANZ world headquarters is located in Melbourne. It first opened as the Bank of Australasia in Sydney in 1835 and in Melbourne from 1838 and our history involves many different banks.<br>

<br>
National Bank Limited was formed in 1893 and, until 1 October 1981, it traded as The National Bank of Australasia Limited, before merging with the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Limited and changing its name to the National Australia Bank (NAB).<br>
<br>
An early branch established in Mauritius (1859) closed within a year, but a London branch (1864) was established to handle financing and payment for Australian exports of wool, gold, other commodities, and imports to Australia, which was more successful.<br>
<br>
National Bank of Australasia was one of many banks that closed its doors during the banking crisis of 1893. Director John Grice was active in the crisis, from which the bank re-emerged as a public limited company, incorporated on 23 June 1893.<br>

<br>
Why You Should Take Your Children Camping</strong><br><br><strong>1. Camping helps children to develop a sense of adventure</strong> - Going camping, even if it’s just for one night is fun. A new environment, unfamiliar sights and sounds, other kids to meet and play with, a tent to help put up and sleeping under the stars all make for a fun-filled adventure. <strong>(A)</strong> ……….; promoting the positive outlook that underpins good mental health.<br>
<br>
<strong>2. Camping builds resilience </strong>- Children rarely move out of their comfort zone these days. With more children spending time indoors than ever before, their environment, for many, is predictable, secure and closely monitored. <strong>(B)</strong> ……….&nbsp; Working out where to pitch, helping to put up a tent, finding the campsite shop and being sent to pick up supplies, dealing with adversity (broken poles, forgotten tent pegs, bad weather), by comparison are all great ways of building resilience. <strong>(C)</strong> ……….&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>3. Camping gives children the freedom to explore, boosting creativity</strong> - Having the freedom to play, explore and generally behave the way children should is one of the vital elements missing from modern life for many children. <strong>(D)</strong> ……….&nbsp; Family-friendly campsites provide a safe, and relatively secure environment for children to play and explore in, giving them a sense of freedom. This freedom, combined with a more natural environment is a great way to boost creativity; instead of relying on a tablet or smartphone for entertainment, children use their imagination to play games and entertain themselves; something they typically don’t need to do when they’re at home.<br>
<br>
<strong>4. Camping&nbsp; brings children closer to nature</strong> - There is compelling evidence to support the claim that many children are now suffering from ‘nature deficit disorder‘, with many being unable to identify the most basic flora and fauna. <strong>(E)</strong> ……….; but I’m willing to bet that all of them would be able to correctly identify the McDonalds or Facebook logo. Spending time outdoors brings children closer to the natural world, and if they live in an urban environment, it is particularly important to ensure that a proportion of their free-time activities provide the chance to experience some of the wonder and beauty of nature. <strong>(F)</strong> ………., and camping is an excellent way to immerse children in the natural world.</p>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of fast food. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
The truth is that it’s extremely difficult to follow a healthy diet when you’re eating regularly at fast food restaurants. Fast food is typically loaded with calories, sodium and unhealthy fat—often enough in one meal for an entire day. It also tends to be low in nutrients and almost totally lacking in fruit, vegetables and fibre.<br>
<br>
That doesn’t mean you have to avoid fast food entirely. When you’re hungry and on the run, fast food can really hit the spot. It’s cheap, tasty and, best of all, convenient. But while it’s okay to indulge a craving every now and then, to stay healthy you can’t make it a regular habit. The key is moderation—both in how often you frequent fast food chains and what you order once you’re there.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of fast food. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
High sodium intake is a major contributor to cardiovascular disease. The American Heart Association recommends that adults stay under 1500 mg of sodium per day, and never take in more than 2,300 mg a day. Unfortunately, that’s tough to do when eating fast food, even when you’re eating lower calorie meals. Your best bet: plan ahead if possible and eat low sodium in the meals leading up to and following your fast-food meal. However, you can minimise some of the damage by requesting that your burger or meat be cooked without added salt.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of fast food. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Chicken may sound healthier than beef, but when it comes to fast food, that’s not always the case. Many menu items at chicken chains are higher in fat and sodium than a burger. That’s not to say that you can’t find healthier options, but don’t assume that chicken means “healthy”.<br>
<br>
What kind of meat you order also matters? Chicken breast is highest in calories, followed closely by the thigh. Chicken wings and drumsticks are much lower in calories, making them smarter choices. If you prefer breast meat, you can make it healthier by taking off the skin.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of fast food. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Thanks to Subway, sub sandwiches come to mind for many people when they think of “healthy” fast food. And while it is true that you can find relatively healthy choices at the top sandwich chains, their menus are not without their pitfalls. While sandwich shop ads promote their health benefits, studies have found that many people eat more calories per meal at a sub shop than at McDonald’s. This may be because people feel so virtuous eating “healthy” as the ads suggest, they reward themselves with chips, sodas, or extra condiments that can turn a healthy meal into an unhealthy one. You can make healthier choices at a deli or sub shop but you need to use some common sense.<br>
