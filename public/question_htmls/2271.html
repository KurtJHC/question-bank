        <p><em>Read the following paragraphs to answer the next five questions (Question 1 ~ 5).</em><br><br>
The phrase “trench warfare” immediately conjures images of the mud and slaughter of the Western Front during World War I. Millions died in fruitless offensives that saw men “go over the top” into withering machine gun fire. Ultimately, inventions such as tanks and airplanes allowed troops to move through or over No Man’s Land, and new technologies and doctrines would usher in the mobile warfare that characterized World War II in Europe. The German blitzkrieg flew over and drove around the Maginot Line, perhaps the most formidable static defensive barrier ever constructed, and that would seem to have spelled the end of trench warfare.</p>
        <p>For this reason, and because trench warfare is so closely associated with primitive black-and-white footage of men struggling to cross the pockmarked battlefields of Belgium and France, it is commonly assumed that this military strategy is a relic of a bygone age, as likely to reappear as catapults or cavalry charges. In fact, trench warfare remains arguably the most effective strategy for infantry where, for whatever reason, armour and air support are lacking. During the Iran-Iraq War (1980–88), after initial gains by the Iraqi army, the fighting settled into years of trench warfare. Iran even engaged in World War I–style human wave attacks; such offensives were as unsuccessful and bloody as they had been 70 years earlier. The Syrian Civil War (2011– ) <strong>recapitulated </strong>World War I in a different fashion, with Bashar al-Assad’s army assaulting opposition-held areas with chemical weapons. The lines in that war remained relatively static, with opposition groups using trench systems that exhibited varying degrees of permanence and sophistication, until Russian airpower dramatically shifted the balance in favour of the Syrian government. In eastern Ukraine, where a mixed force of Russian troops, mercenaries, and Russian-backed militants were engaging in a proxy war against the government in Kiev (2014– ), trench systems and hardened fortifications marked a front line some 250 miles long. Airpower was largely absent from the “contact line” in Ukraine, because of the presence of sophisticated Russian antiaircraft systems on the pro-Russian side (one such system was used in the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight 17) and Russia’s desire to maintain plausible deniability of its direct involvement in the conflict. Drones may have replaced carrier pigeons in the skies above the battlefield, but the use of trenches has changed little since Verdun and the Somme.<br>

There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. “Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,” thought Alice; “only, as it’s asleep, I suppose it doesn’t mind.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it: “No room! No room!” they cried out when they saw Alice coming. “There’s <em>plenty </em>of room!” said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Have some wine,” the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Alice looked all-round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea. “I don’t see any wine,” she remarked.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“There isn’t any,” said the March Hare.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,” said Alice angrily.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“It wasn’t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,” said the March Hare.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I didn’t know it was <em>your </em>table,” said Alice; “it’s laid for a great many more than three.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Your hair wants cutting,” said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“You should learn not to make personal remarks,” Alice said with some severity; “it’s very rude.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he <em>said </em>was, “Why is a raven like a writing-desk?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Come, we shall have some fun now!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they’ve begun asking riddles.—I believe I can guess that,” she added aloud.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?” said the March Hare.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Exactly so,” said Alice.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Then you should say what you mean,” the March Hare went on.&nbsp;</p>

There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. “Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,” thought Alice; “only, as it’s asleep, I suppose it doesn’t mind.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it: “No room! No room!” they cried out when they saw Alice coming. “There’s <em>plenty </em>of room!” said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>“You should learn not to make personal remarks,” Alice said with some severity; “it’s very rude.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he <em>said </em>was, “Why is a raven like a writing-desk?”&nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the following paragraphs to answer the next four questions (Question 12 ~ 16).&nbsp;</em><br><br>
We drink water, we swim in it, we wash with it, and we cool things down with it.&nbsp; Because water is so common, many of us fail to notice just how strange it is compared to other substances. When we plop an ice cube or two into our drink during the warmer months, we watch it float above the liquid in our glass without a second thought. But why does ice do this, and, more importantly, why does water freeze from the top to the bottom, when most other substances freeze from the bottom up?</p>
        <p>Water freezes from the top down—which allows ice to float—because of a strange quirk in how water’s density behaves at falling temperatures. Density is the mass of a unit volume of a material substance; it is essentially a measure of how tightly packed the atoms and molecules of a substance are. For most compounds, falling temperatures cause the compound’s volume to decrease while its density increases—with the atoms and molecules becoming more tightly packed together. For example, a pocket of warm air rises and expands because it is less dense than the cooler air around it. Conversely, a pocket of cool air descends and contracts, becoming slightly thicker and denser as it falls. Water behaves similarly but only down to a certain temperature. The density of cooling water will increase until the water’s temperature reaches 4 °C .If the water continues to cool, its density will begin to increase again, and water (now in its solid state) will expand. It is this property of water that allows ice to wedge open cracks in sidewalks and rocks and causes cans and bottles of soft drinks to explode in the freezer.</p>
        <p>At 4 °C water is still in its liquid form. In lakes and rivers, this water will cool at the surface, grow denser, and descend. As water approaches its freezing point (0 °C), it will become less dense than the water around it, and it will rise to the top of the water column. If water instead froze from the bottom of a lake or river to the top, there would be profound ecological consequences. Shallow lakes would freeze solid; unless the plants, animals, and other organisms living there had some sort of adaptation that would keep their tissues from freezing, they would die. In larger lakes, a floor of ice and slush would cool the water above, possibly slowing the metabolism and growth rate of organisms that survived in the lake’s liquid upper reaches. Under these circumstances, Earth would look very different; the planet’s polar regions would be nearly devoid of life, and every year midaltitude plants, animals, and other organisms would face the prospect of unobtainable liquid water in frozen-solid habitats.</p>

        <p><em>Read the following paragraphs to answer the next four questions (Question 12 ~ 16).&nbsp;</em><br><br>
We drink water, we swim in it, we wash with it, and we cool things down with it.&nbsp; Because water is so common, many of us fail to notice just how strange it is compared to other substances. When we plop an ice cube or two into our drink during the warmer months, we watch it float above the liquid in our glass without a second thought. But why does ice do this, and, more importantly, why does water freeze from the top to the bottom, when most other substances freeze from the bottom up?</p>
        <p>Water freezes from the top down—which allows ice to float—because of a strange quirk in how water’s density behaves at falling temperatures. Density is the mass of a unit volume of a material substance; it is essentially a measure of how tightly packed the atoms and molecules of a substance are. For most compounds, falling temperatures cause the compound’s volume to decrease while its density increases—with the atoms and molecules becoming more tightly packed together. For example, a pocket of warm air rises and expands because it is less dense than the cooler air around it. Conversely, a pocket of cool air descends and contracts, becoming slightly thicker and denser as it falls. Water behaves similarly but only down to a certain temperature. The density of cooling water will increase until the water’s temperature reaches 4 °C .If the water continues to cool, its density will begin to increase again, and water (now in its solid state) will expand. It is this property of water that allows ice to wedge open cracks in sidewalks and rocks and causes cans and bottles of soft drinks to explode in the freezer.</p>
        <p>At 4 °C water is still in its liquid form. In lakes and rivers, this water will cool at the surface, grow denser, and descend. As water approaches its freezing point (0 °C), it will become less dense than the water around it, and it will rise to the top of the water column. If water instead froze from the bottom of a lake or river to the top, there would be profound ecological consequences. Shallow lakes would freeze solid; unless the plants, animals, and other organisms living there had some sort of adaptation that would keep their tissues from freezing, they would die. In larger lakes, a floor of ice and slush would cool the water above, possibly slowing the metabolism and growth rate of organisms that survived in the lake’s liquid upper reaches. Under these circumstances, Earth would look very different; the planet’s polar regions would be nearly devoid of life, and every year midaltitude plants, animals, and other organisms would face the prospect of unobtainable liquid water in frozen-solid habitats.</p>

Conversely, a pocket of cool air descends and contracts, becoming slightly thicker and denser as it falls. Water behaves similarly but only down to a certain temperature. The density of cooling water will increase until the water’s temperature reaches 4 °C .If the water continues to cool, its density will begin to increase again, and water (now in its solid state) will expand. It is this property of water that allows ice to wedge open cracks in sidewalks and rocks and causes cans and bottles of soft drinks to explode in the freezer.</p>
        <p>At 4 °C water is still in its liquid form. In lakes and rivers, this water will cool at the surface, grow denser, and descend. As water approaches its freezing point (0 °C), it will become less dense than the water around it, and it will rise to the top of the water column. If water instead froze from the bottom of a lake or river to the top, there would be profound ecological consequences. Shallow lakes would freeze solid; unless the plants, animals, and other organisms living there had some sort of adaptation that would keep their tissues from freezing, they would die. In larger lakes, a floor of ice and slush would cool the water above, possibly slowing the metabolism and growth rate of organisms that survived in the lake’s liquid upper reaches. Under these circumstances, Earth would look very different; the planet’s polar regions would be nearly devoid of life, and every year midaltitude plants, animals, and other organisms would face the prospect of unobtainable liquid water in frozen-solid habitats.</p>

I wandered lonely as a cloud<br>
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,<br>
When all at once I saw a crowd,<br>
A host, of golden daffodils;<br>
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,<br>
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.</p>
        <p>Continuous as the stars that shine<br>
And twinkle on the milky way,<br>
They stretched in never-ending line<br>
Along the margin of a bay:<br>
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,<br>
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.</p>
        <p>The waves beside them danced; but they<br>
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:<br>
A poet could not but be gay,<br>
In such a <strong>jocund </strong>company:<br>
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought<br>
What wealth the show to me had brought:</p>
        <p>For oft, when on my couch I lie<br>
In vacant or in pensive mood,<br>
They flash upon that inward eye<br>
Which is the bliss of solitude;<br>
And then my heart with pleasure fills,<br>
And dances with the daffodils.</p>

What wealth the show to me had brought:</p>
        <p>For oft, when on my couch I lie<br>
In vacant or in pensive mood,<br>
They flash upon that inward eye<br>
Which is the bliss of solitude;<br>
And then my heart with pleasure fills,<br>
And dances with the daffodils.</p>

I wandered lonely as a cloud<br>
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,<br>
When all at once I saw a crowd,<br>
A host, of golden daffodils;<br>
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,<br>
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.</p>
        <p>Continuous as the stars that shine<br>
And twinkle on the milky way,<br>
They stretched in never-ending line<br>
Along the margin of a bay:<br>
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,<br>
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.</p>
        <p>The waves beside them danced; but they<br>
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:<br>
A poet could not but be gay,<br>
In such a <strong>jocund </strong>company:<br>
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought<br>
What wealth the show to me had brought:</p>

And twinkle on the milky way,<br>
They stretched in never-ending line<br>
Along the margin of a bay:<br>
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,<br>
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.</p>
        <p>The waves beside them danced; but they<br>
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:<br>
A poet could not but be gay,<br>
In such a <strong>jocund </strong>company:<br>
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought<br>
What wealth the show to me had brought:</p>
        <p>For oft, when on my couch I lie<br>
In vacant or in pensive mood,<br>
They flash upon that inward eye<br>
Which is the bliss of solitude;<br>
And then my heart with pleasure fills,<br>
And dances with the daffodils.</p>
