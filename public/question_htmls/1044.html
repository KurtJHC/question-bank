          <strong>The Snow Goose</strong>
          <em>by Paul Gallico&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One November afternoon, three years after Rhayader had come to the Great Marsh, a child approached the lighthouse studio by means of the sea wall. In her arms she carried a burden. She was no more than twelve, slender, dirty, nervous and timid as a bird, but beneath the grime as eerily beautiful as a marsh faery. She was pure Saxon, large-boned, fair, with a head to which her body was yet to grow, and deep-set, violet-coloured eyes. She was desperately frightened of the ugly man she had come to see, for legend had already begun to gather about Rhayader, and the native wild-fowlers hated him for interfering with their sport. But greater than her fear was the need of that which she bore. For locked in her child’s heart was the knowledge, picked up somewhere in the swampland, that this ogre who lived in the lighthouse had magic that could heal injured things.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She had never seen Rhayader before and was close to fleeing in panic at the dark apparition that appeared at the studio door, drawn by her footsteps - the black head and beard, the sinister hump, and the crooked claw. She stood there staring, poised like a disturbed marsh bird for instant flight.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But his voice was deep and kind when he spoke to her,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘What is it, child?’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She stood her ground, and then edged timidly forward. The thing she carried in her arms was a large white bird, and it was quite still. There were stains of blood on its whiteness and on her kirtle where she had held it to her.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The girl placed it in his arms. ‘I found it, sir. It’s hurted. Is it still alive?’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Yes. Yes, I think so. Come in, child, come in.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Rhayader went inside, bearing the bird, which he placed upon a table, where it moved feebly. Curiosity overcame fear. The girl followed and found herself in a room warmed by a coal fire, shining with many coloured pictures that covered the walls, and full of a strange but pleasant smell.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The bird fluttered. With his good hand Rhayader spread one of its immense white pinions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The end was beautifully tipped with black. Rhayader looked and marvelled, and said:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Child, where did you find it?’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘In t’ marsh, sir, where fowlers had been. What -what is it, sir?’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘It’s a snow goose from Canada. But how in all heaven came it here?’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The name seemed to mean nothing to the little girl. Her deep violet eyes, shining out of the dirt on her thin face, were fixed with concern on the injured bird.</p>
        <p>She said: ‘Can’ ee heal it, sir?’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Yes, yes,’ said Rhayader. ‘We will try. Come, you shall help me.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There were scissors and bandages and splints on a shelf, and he was marvelously deft,&nbsp;even with the crooked claw that managed to hold things.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He said; ‘Ah, she has been shot, poor thing. Her leg is broken, and the wing tip. But not badly. See, we will clip her primaries, so that we can bandage it, but in the spring the feathers will grow and she will be able to fly again. We’ll bandage it close to her body, so that she cannot move it until it has set, and then make a splint for the poor leg.’ Her fears forgotten, the child watched, fascinated, as he worked, and all the more so because while he fixed a fine splint to the shattered leg he told her <span class="txt-underline"><strong>the most wonderful story</strong></span>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The bird was a young one, no more than a year old. She was born in a northern land far, far across the seas, a land belonging to England. Flying to the south to escape the snow and ice and bitter cold, a great storm had seized her and whirled and buffeted her about. It was a truly terrible storm, stronger than her great wings, stronger than anything. For days and nights it held her in its grip and there was nothing she could do but fly before it. When finally it had blown itself out and her sure instincts took her south again, she was over a different land and surrounded by strange birds that she had never seen before. At last, exhausted by her ordeal, she had sunk to rest in a friendly green marsh, only to be met by the blast from the hunter’s gun.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘A bitter reception for a visiting princess,’ concluded Rhayader. ‘We will call her “La Princesse Perdue,” the Lost Princess. And in a few days she will be feeling much better. See!’ He reached into his pocket and produced a handful of grain. The snow goose opened its round yellow eyes and nibbled at it.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The child laughed with delight, and then suddenly caught her breath with alarm, as the full import of where she was pressed in upon her, and without a word she turned and fled out of the door.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Wait, wait!’ cried Rhayader, and went to the entrance, where he stopped so that it framed his dark bulk. The girl was already fleeing down the sea wall, but she paused at his voice and looked back.</p>
        <p>‘What is your name, child?’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Frith.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Eh?’ said Rhayader. ‘Fritha, I suppose. Where do you live?’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Wi’ t’ fisherfolk at Wickaeldroth.’ She gave the name the old Saxon pronunciation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Will you come back tomorrow, or the next day, to see how the Princess is getting along?’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She paused, and again Rhayader must have thought of the wild water birds caught motion-less in that split second of alarm before they took to flight.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But her thin voice came back to him: ‘Ay!’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And then she was gone, with her fair hair streaming out behind her.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Being Brave At Night&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The other night 'bout two o'clock, or maybe it was three,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>An elephant with shining tusks came chasing after me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>His trunk was wavin' in the air an' spoutin' jets of steam&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>An' he was out to eat me up, but still I didn't scream&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Or let him see that I was scared - a better thought I had,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I just escaped from where I was and crawled in bed with dad.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One time there was a giant who was horrible to see,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He had three heads and twenty arms, an' he came after me&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And red hot fire came from his mouths and every hand was red&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And he declared he'd grind my bones and make them into bread.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But I was just too smart for him, I fooled him mighty bad,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Before his hands could collar me I crawled in bed with dad.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I ain't scared of nothin’ that comes pesterin' me at night.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Once I was chased by forty ghosts all shimmery an' white.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>An' I just raced 'em round the room an' let 'em think maybe&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I'd have to stop an' rest awhile, when they could capture me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then when they leapt onto my bed, Oh Gee! But they were mad&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To find that I had slipped away an' crawled in bed with dad.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>No giants, ghosts or elephants have dared to come in there&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Coz if they did he'd beat 'em up and chase 'em to their lair.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They just hang 'round the children's rooms&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>an' snap an' snarl an' bite&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>An' laugh if they can make 'em yell&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>for help with all their might.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But I don't ever yell out loud. I'm not that sort of lad,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I slip from out the covers and I crawl in bed with dad.</p>

        <p>An elephant with shining tusks came chasing after me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>His trunk was wavin' in the air an' spoutin' jets of steam&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>An' he was out to eat me up, but still I didn't scream&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Or let him see that I was scared - a better thought I had,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I just escaped from where I was and crawled in bed with dad.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One time there was a giant who was horrible to see,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He had three heads and twenty arms, an' he came after me&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And red hot fire came from his mouths and every hand was red&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And he declared he'd grind my bones and make them into bread.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But I was just too smart for him, I fooled him mighty bad,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Before his hands could collar me I crawled in bed with dad.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I ain't scared of nothin’ that comes pesterin' me at night.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Once I was chased by forty ghosts all shimmery an' white.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>An' I just raced 'em round the room an' let 'em think maybe&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I'd have to stop an' rest awhile, when they could capture me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then when they leapt onto my bed, Oh Gee! But they were mad&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To find that I had slipped away an' crawled in bed with dad.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>No giants, ghosts or elephants have dared to come in there&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Coz if they did he'd beat 'em up and chase 'em to their lair.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They just hang 'round the children's rooms&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>an' snap an' snarl an' bite&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>An' laugh if they can make 'em yell&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>for help with all their might.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But I don't ever yell out loud. I'm not that sort of lad,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I slip from out the covers and I crawl in bed with dad.</p>

          <em>Read the poem below by Edgar Guest then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Being Brave At Night&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The other night 'bout two o'clock, or maybe it was three,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>An elephant with shining tusks came chasing after me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>His trunk was wavin' in the air an' spoutin' jets of steam&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>An' he was out to eat me up, but still I didn't scream&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Or let him see that I was scared - a better thought I had,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I just escaped from where I was and crawled in bed with dad.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One time there was a giant who was horrible to see,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He had three heads and twenty arms, an' he came after me&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And red hot fire came from his mouths and every hand was red&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And he declared he'd grind my bones and make them into bread.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But I was just too smart for him, I fooled him mighty bad,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Before his hands could collar me I crawled in bed with dad.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I ain't scared of nothin’ that comes pesterin' me at night.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Once I was chased by forty ghosts all shimmery an' white.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>An' I just raced 'em round the room an' let 'em think maybe&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I'd have to stop an' rest awhile, when they could capture me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then when they leapt onto my bed, Oh Gee! But they were mad&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To find that I had slipped away an' crawled in bed with dad.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>No giants, ghosts or elephants have dared to come in there&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Coz if they did he'd beat 'em up and chase 'em to their lair.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They just hang 'round the children's rooms&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>an' snap an' snarl an' bite&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>An' laugh if they can make 'em yell&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>for help with all their might.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But I don't ever yell out loud. I'm not that sort of lad,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I slip from out the covers and I crawl in bed with dad.</p>

          <strong>Ways to Improve Your Surfing&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Equipment: be honest with yourself. If you’re an average surfer and the water line is at your chest when sitting on your board, it’s too small. Find a board that catches waves without struggling and doesn’t sink when the wave slows down. <strong>12 ……….</strong> Keep trying new stuff. Your perfect board is out there, but you have to look to find it.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Fitness: finding a training routine is up to the individual. It may just be surfing every day. One thing I would caution against is training for “mirror muscles” and pushing a bunch of metal around the gym. This tends to stiffen you up a bit and doesn’t do your surfing any favors. Surfing is short bursts of speed and explosiveness. Like flexibility, training for speed and power takes time and there are no shortcuts. <strong>13 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Lining up your peak: too many people paddle out blind and chase the spot where they last saw a wave break. <strong>14 ……….</strong> Before you paddle out, assess the peak or specific spot where you want to surf. Walk to that spot and look directly behind you and find an easily recognisable landmark. You will be amazed how many more waves you will catch if you stick to that spot.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Approach: try to surf the top two-thirds of the wave.<strong> 15 ……….</strong> It’s best to take off at an angle parallel to the beach and try to stay as high as you can. From there, when you see the section you want to turn on, drop down to just below the middle of the wave, bottom turn and hit it. Going too far to the bottom usually slows you down and often makes you mistime your turn. Using this as a guideline should help you get off more turns and carry more speed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Low stance / Low arms / Ready position: try to stay low throughout the entire wave. It’s not as easy as the pros make it look, it takes a certain amount of discipline and strength that is hard to maintain. Staying low has the obvious benefits of stability and power. <strong>16 ………. </strong>Another thing that helps the body stay connected is holding your arms low and close to your sides. (For backside, have front arm close and back arm straight behind you).&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Heel to toe: all right, you have your foot on the tail with weight slightly on your back foot. You’re at the top of the wave, waiting for your opportunity. You’re low, with arms hanging at your sides. Now, start doing little turns from heel to toe to create a rhythm.<strong> 17 ………. </strong>Use the same principle for surfing and you will have more speed, be centred over your feet and on your way to smoother and better surfing.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Good luck — Gally</p>

          <strong>Ways to Improve Your Surfing&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Equipment: be honest with yourself. If you’re an average surfer and the water line is at your chest when sitting on your board, it’s too small. Find a board that catches waves without struggling and doesn’t sink when the wave slows down. <strong>12 ……….</strong> Keep trying new stuff. Your perfect board is out there, but you have to look to find it.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Fitness: finding a training routine is up to the individual. It may just be surfing every day. One thing I would caution against is training for “mirror muscles” and pushing a bunch of metal around the gym. This tends to stiffen you up a bit and doesn’t do your surfing any favors. Surfing is short bursts of speed and explosiveness. Like flexibility, training for speed and power takes time and there are no shortcuts. <strong>13 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Lining up your peak: too many people paddle out blind and chase the spot where they last saw a wave break. <strong>14 ……….</strong> Before you paddle out, assess the peak or specific spot where you want to surf. Walk to that spot and look directly behind you and find an easily recognisable landmark. You will be amazed how many more waves you will catch if you stick to that spot.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Approach: try to surf the top two-thirds of the wave. <strong>15 ……….</strong> It’s best to take off at an angle parallel to the beach and try to stay as high as you can. From there, when you see the section you want to turn on, drop down to just below the middle of the wave, bottom turn and hit it. Going too far to the bottom usually slows you down and often makes you mistime your turn. Using this as a guideline should help you get off more turns and carry more speed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Low stance / Low arms / Ready position: try to stay low throughout the entire wave. It’s not as easy as the pros make it look, it takes a certain amount of discipline and strength that is hard to maintain. Staying low has the obvious benefits of stability and power. <strong>16 ………. </strong>Another thing that helps the body stay connected is holding your arms low and close to your sides. (For backside, have front arm close and back arm straight behind you).&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Heel to toe: all right, you have your foot on the tail with weight slightly on your back foot. You’re at the top of the wave, waiting for your opportunity. You’re low, with arms hanging at your sides. Now, start doing little turns from heel to toe to create a rhythm.<strong> 17 ………. </strong>Use the same principle for surfing and you will have more speed, be centred over your feet and on your way to smoother and better surfing.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Ways to Improve Your Surfing&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Equipment: be honest with yourself. If you’re an average surfer and the water line is at your chest when sitting on your board, it’s too small. Find a board that catches waves without struggling and doesn’t sink when the wave slows down. <strong>12 ……….</strong> Keep trying new stuff. Your perfect board is out there, but you have to look to find it.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Fitness: finding a training routine is up to the individual. It may just be surfing every day. One thing I would caution against is training for “mirror muscles” and pushing a bunch of metal around the gym. This tends to stiffen you up a bit and doesn’t do your surfing any favors. Surfing is short bursts of speed and explosiveness. Like flexibility, training for speed and power takes time and there are no shortcuts. <strong>13 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Lining up your peak: too many people paddle out blind and chase the spot where they last saw a wave break. <strong>14 ……….</strong> Before you paddle out, assess the peak or specific spot where you want to surf. Walk to that spot and look directly behind you and find an easily recognisable landmark. You will be amazed how many more waves you will catch if you stick to that spot.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Approach: try to surf the top two-thirds of the wave. <strong>15 ……….</strong> It’s best to take off at an angle parallel to the beach and try to stay as high as you can. From there, when you see the section you want to turn on, drop down to just below the middle of the wave, bottom turn and hit it. Going too far to the bottom usually slows you down and often makes you mistime your turn. Using this as a guideline should help you get off more turns and carry more speed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Low stance / Low arms / Ready position: try to stay low throughout the entire wave. It’s not as easy as the pros make it look, it takes a certain amount of discipline and strength that is hard to maintain. Staying low has the obvious benefits of stability and power. <strong>16 ………. </strong>Another thing that helps the body stay connected is holding your arms low and close to your sides. (For backside, have front arm close and back arm straight behind you).&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Heel to toe: all right, you have your foot on the tail with weight slightly on your back foot. You’re at the top of the wave, waiting for your opportunity. You’re low, with arms hanging at your sides. Now, start doing little turns from heel to toe to create a rhythm.<strong> 17 ………. </strong>Use the same principle for surfing and you will have more speed, be centred over your feet and on your way to smoother and better surfing.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Good luck — Gally</p>

          <strong>Ways to Improve Your Surfing&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Equipment: be honest with yourself. If you’re an average surfer and the water line is at your chest when sitting on your board, it’s too small. Find a board that catches waves without struggling and doesn’t sink when the wave slows down. <strong>12 ……….</strong> Keep trying new stuff. Your perfect board is out there, but you have to look to find it.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Fitness: finding a training routine is up to the individual. It may just be surfing every day. One thing I would caution against is training for “mirror muscles” and pushing a bunch of metal around the gym. This tends to stiffen you up a bit and doesn’t do your surfing any favors. Surfing is short bursts of speed and explosiveness. Like flexibility, training for speed and power takes time and there are no shortcuts. <strong>13 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Lining up your peak: too many people paddle out blind and chase the spot where they last saw a wave break. <strong>14 ……….</strong> Before you paddle out, assess the peak or specific spot where you want to surf. Walk to that spot and look directly behind you and find an easily recognisable landmark. You will be amazed how many more waves you will catch if you stick to that spot.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Approach: try to surf the top two-thirds of the wave. <strong>15 ……….</strong> It’s best to take off at an angle parallel to the beach and try to stay as high as you can. From there, when you see the section you want to turn on, drop down to just below the middle of the wave, bottom turn and hit it. Going too far to the bottom usually slows you down and often makes you mistime your turn. Using this as a guideline should help you get off more turns and carry more speed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Low stance / Low arms / Ready position: try to stay low throughout the entire wave. It’s not as easy as the pros make it look, it takes a certain amount of discipline and strength that is hard to maintain. Staying low has the obvious benefits of stability and power. <strong>16 ………. </strong>Another thing that helps the body stay connected is holding your arms low and close to your sides. (For backside, have front arm close and back arm straight behind you).&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Heel to toe: all right, you have your foot on the tail with weight slightly on your back foot. You’re at the top of the wave, waiting for your opportunity. You’re low, with arms hanging at your sides. Now, start doing little turns from heel to toe to create a rhythm.<strong> 17 ………. </strong>Use the same principle for surfing and you will have more speed, be centred over your feet and on your way to smoother and better surfing.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>At 11:30 a.m. on May 29, 1953, Edmund Hillary of New Zealand and Tenzing Norgay, a Sherpa of Nepal, become the first explorers to reach the summit of Mount Everest, which at 29,035 feet above sea level is the highest point on earth. The two made their final assault on the summit after spending a fitful night at 27,900 feet. News of their achievement broke around the world on June 2, the day of Queen Elizabeth II’s coronation, and Britons hailed it as a good omen for their country’s future. Mount Everest sits on the crest of the Great Himalayas in Asia, lying on the border between Nepal and Tibet. Called Chomo-Lungma, or “Mother Goddess of the Land,” by the Tibetans, the English named the mountain after Sir George Everest, a 19th-century British surveyor of South Asia. The summit of Everest sits two-thirds of the way through the earth’s atmosphere–at the cruising altitude of jet airliners – oxygen levels there are very low, temperatures are extremely cold, and weather is unpredictable and dangerous.</p>

            <p>Inscribed on the World Heritage List for its natural values in 1987, and as a cultural landscape in 1994, Uluru has come to be a symbol of Australia: the vastness and ancient beauty of our land; the uniqueness of our Aboriginal cultures; and the problems of black and white Australia. It reassures us that ancient cultures and languages are still alive. The Governor-General couldn’t have known how hard it was to find a dozen Anangu to dance a welcome that warm January morning in 1994. Most of the community were away in the western desert region participating in their own, private ceremonies – inma that have&nbsp;changed little for thousands of years. While we will never know the lives and languages of those who painted extinct animals on the walls of European caves some 10,000 years ago, Australia has living ceremonies and songs as ancient as those and older still, with verses that tell of our history, of morality, of law, of creation, and which are literally set in stone. Etched into the very surface of our national icon are features that tell not just of the tortured geology that has created this unique sculpture and of the unfathomable time since the Rock’s origins, but also preserve some of the world’s oldest memories. Those stories and songs are ours. If we want them to be.</p>

            <p>Claudius Ptolemy, the Greco-Roman mathematician, astronomer and father of geography, called the Rwenzori range the Mountains of the Moon, and I think he got it about right. Starlight beamed down on the convex glaciers surrounding our camp near Uganda’s western border, causing them to glow like resting lunar crescents. Little-known and less frequently climbed, the 120km-long Rwenzori range, on the border of Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), isn’t as high as Kilimanjaro but requires greater technical skills and an endurance I wondered if I possessed. The name Rwenzori means “rainmaker” and the mountain can be notoriously muddy and tiring to climb, though this was the relatively dry season, from December to February. Rwenzori national park, nine hours’ drive west of Kampala, offers crowd-free hiking and a sense of wilderness absent on Kilimanjaro. Statistics show that between January and October 2017, just 693 people trekked its higher reaches. During this eight-day trek with a friend, we met just 10 other hikers – and not one tearful celebrity doing their bit for charity.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Climbing mountains is an experience hard to put into words. You are in a beautiful environment and, when you reach the top, you feel incredible. But also you have to climb down, when most accidents happen – people are tired, it gets dark, it’s harder. I don’t climb mountains that I am not ready for. I wouldn’t climb K2 tomorrow, but each one I climb takes me to the next step. I don’t have many friends who like to climb, and sometimes you want to have someone to share the experience with. I work as a fashion photographer and most of my friends won’t even come to the climbing gym in case they ruin their nails. I had a few moments that were sketchy, but not super scary; I never feared for my life or got injured.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Climbing mountains is an experience hard to put into words. You are in a beautiful environment and, when you reach the top, you feel incredible. But also you have to climb down, when most accidents happen – people are tired, it gets dark, it’s harder. I don’t climb mountains that I am not ready for. I wouldn’t climb K2 tomorrow, but each one I climb takes me to the next step. I don’t have many friends who like to climb, and sometimes you want to have someone to share the experience with. I work as a fashion photographer and most of my friends won’t even come to the climbing gym in case they ruin their nails. I had a few moments that were sketchy, but not super scary; I never feared for my life or got injured.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>At 11:30 a.m. on May 29, 1953, Edmund Hillary of New Zealand and Tenzing Norgay, a Sherpa of Nepal, become the first explorers to reach the summit of Mount Everest, which at 29,035 feet above sea level is the highest point on earth. The two made their final assault on the summit after spending a fitful night at 27,900 feet. News of their achievement broke around the world on June 2, the day of Queen Elizabeth II’s coronation, and Britons hailed it as a good omen for their country’s future. Mount Everest sits on the crest of the Great Himalayas in Asia, lying on the border between Nepal and Tibet. Called Chomo-Lungma, or “Mother Goddess of the Land,” by the Tibetans, the English named the mountain after Sir George Everest, a 19th-century British surveyor of South Asia. The summit of Everest sits two-thirds of the way through the earth’s atmosphere–at the cruising altitude of jet airliners – oxygen levels there are very low, temperatures are extremely cold, and weather is unpredictable and dangerous.</p>

            <p>Inscribed on the World Heritage List for its natural values in 1987, and as a cultural landscape in 1994, Uluru has come to be a symbol of Australia: the vastness and ancient beauty of our land; the uniqueness of our Aboriginal cultures; and the problems of black and white Australia. It reassures us that ancient cultures and languages are still alive. The Governor-General couldn’t have known how hard it was to find a dozen Anangu to dance a welcome that warm January morning in 1994. Most of the community were away in the western desert region participating in their own, private ceremonies – inma that have&nbsp;changed little for thousands of years. While we will never know the lives and languages of those who painted extinct animals on the walls of European caves some 10,000 years ago, Australia has living ceremonies and songs as ancient as those and older still, with verses that tell of our history, of morality, of law, of creation, and which are literally set in stone. Etched into the very surface of our national icon are features that tell not just of the tortured geology that has created this unique sculpture and of the unfathomable time since the Rock’s origins, but also preserve some of the world’s oldest memories. Those stories and songs are ours. If we want them to be.</p>

            <p>Claudius Ptolemy, the Greco-Roman mathematician, astronomer and father of geography, called the Rwenzori range the Mountains of the Moon, and I think he got it about right. Starlight beamed down on the convex glaciers surrounding our camp near Uganda’s western border, causing them to glow like resting lunar crescents. Little-known and less frequently climbed, the 120km-long Rwenzori range, on the border of Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), isn’t as high as Kilimanjaro but requires greater technical skills and an endurance I wondered if I possessed. The name Rwenzori means “rainmaker” and the mountain can be notoriously muddy and tiring to climb, though this was the relatively dry season, from December to February. Rwenzori national park, nine hours’ drive west of Kampala, offers crowd-free hiking and a sense of wilderness absent on Kilimanjaro. Statistics show that between January and October 2017, just 693 people trekked its higher reaches. During this eight-day trek with a friend, we met just 10 other hikers – and not one tearful celebrity doing their bit for charity.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>At 11:30 a.m. on May 29, 1953, Edmund Hillary of New Zealand and Tenzing Norgay, a Sherpa of Nepal, become the first explorers to reach the summit of Mount Everest, which at 29,035 feet above sea level is the highest point on earth. The two made their final assault on the summit after spending a fitful night at 27,900 feet. News of their achievement broke around the world on June 2, the day of Queen Elizabeth II’s coronation, and Britons hailed it as a good omen for their country’s future. Mount Everest sits on the crest of the Great Himalayas in Asia, lying on the border between Nepal and Tibet. Called Chomo-Lungma, or “Mother Goddess of the Land,” by the Tibetans, the English named the mountain after Sir George Everest, a 19th-century British surveyor of South Asia. The summit of Everest sits two-thirds of the way through the earth’s atmosphere–at the cruising altitude of jet airliners – oxygen levels there are very low, temperatures are extremely cold, and weather is unpredictable and dangerous.</p>

            <p>Inscribed on the World Heritage List for its natural values in 1987, and as a cultural landscape in 1994, Uluru has come to be a symbol of Australia: the vastness and ancient beauty of our land; the uniqueness of our Aboriginal cultures; and the problems of black and white Australia. It reassures us that ancient cultures and languages are still alive. The Governor-General couldn’t have known how hard it was to find a dozen Anangu to dance a welcome that warm January morning in 1994. Most of the community were away in the western desert region participating in their own, private ceremonies – inma that have&nbsp;changed little for thousands of years. While we will never know the lives and languages of those who painted extinct animals on the walls of European caves some 10,000 years ago, Australia has living ceremonies and songs as ancient as those and older still, with verses that tell of our history, of morality, of law, of creation, and which are literally set in stone. Etched into the very surface of our national icon are features that tell not just of the tortured geology that has created this unique sculpture and of the unfathomable time since the Rock’s origins, but also preserve some of the world’s oldest memories. Those stories and songs are ours. If we want them to be.</p>

            <p>Claudius Ptolemy, the Greco-Roman mathematician, astronomer and father of geography, called the Rwenzori range the Mountains of the Moon, and I think he got it about right. Starlight beamed down on the convex glaciers surrounding our camp near Uganda’s western border, causing them to glow like resting lunar crescents. Little-known and less frequently climbed, the 120km-long Rwenzori range, on the border of Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), isn’t as high as Kilimanjaro but requires greater technical skills and an endurance I wondered if I possessed. The name Rwenzori means “rainmaker” and the mountain can be notoriously muddy and tiring to climb, though this was the relatively dry season, from December to February. Rwenzori national park, nine hours’ drive west of Kampala, offers crowd-free hiking and a sense of wilderness absent on Kilimanjaro. Statistics show that between January and October 2017, just 693 people trekked its higher reaches. During this eight-day trek with a friend, we met just 10 other hikers – and not one tearful celebrity doing their bit for charity.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Climbing mountains is an experience hard to put into words. You are in a beautiful environment and, when you reach the top, you feel incredible. But also you have to climb down, when most accidents happen – people are tired, it gets dark, it’s harder. I don’t climb mountains that I am not ready for. I wouldn’t climb K2 tomorrow, but each one I climb takes me to the next step. I don’t have many friends who like to climb, and sometimes you want to have someone to share the experience with. I work as a fashion photographer and most of my friends won’t even come to the climbing gym in case they ruin their nails. I had a few moments that were sketchy, but not super scary; I never feared for my life or got injured.&nbsp;</p>

Called Chomo-Lungma, or “Mother Goddess of the Land,” by the Tibetans, the English named the mountain after Sir George Everest, a 19th-century British surveyor of South Asia. The summit of Everest sits two-thirds of the way through the earth’s atmosphere–at the cruising altitude of jet airliners – oxygen levels there are very low, temperatures are extremely cold, and weather is unpredictable and dangerous.</p>

            <p>Inscribed on the World Heritage List for its natural values in 1987, and as a cultural landscape in 1994, Uluru has come to be a symbol of Australia: the vastness and ancient beauty of our land; the uniqueness of our Aboriginal cultures; and the problems of black and white Australia. It reassures us that ancient cultures and languages are still alive. The Governor-General couldn’t have known how hard it was to find a dozen Anangu to dance a welcome that warm January morning in 1994. Most of the community were away in the western desert region participating in their own, private ceremonies – inma that have&nbsp;changed little for thousands of years. While we will never know the lives and languages of those who painted extinct animals on the walls of European caves some 10,000 years ago, Australia has living ceremonies and songs as ancient as those and older still, with verses that tell of our history, of morality, of law, of creation, and which are literally set in stone. Etched into the very surface of our national icon are features that tell not just of the tortured geology that has created this unique sculpture and of the unfathomable time since the Rock’s origins, but also preserve some of the world’s oldest memories. Those stories and songs are ours. If we want them to be.</p>

            <p>Claudius Ptolemy, the Greco-Roman mathematician, astronomer and father of geography, called the Rwenzori range the Mountains of the Moon, and I think he got it about right. Starlight beamed down on the convex glaciers surrounding our camp near Uganda’s western border, causing them to glow like resting lunar crescents. Little-known and less frequently climbed, the 120km-long Rwenzori range, on the border of Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), isn’t as high as Kilimanjaro but requires greater technical skills and an endurance I wondered if I possessed. The name Rwenzori means “rainmaker” and the mountain can be notoriously muddy and tiring to climb, though this was the relatively dry season, from December to February. Rwenzori national park, nine hours’ drive west of Kampala, offers crowd-free hiking and a sense of wilderness absent on Kilimanjaro. Statistics show that between January and October 2017, just 693 people trekked its higher reaches. During this eight-day trek with a friend, we met just 10 other hikers – and not one tearful celebrity doing their bit for charity.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Climbing mountains is an experience hard to put into words. You are in a beautiful environment and, when you reach the top, you feel incredible. But also you have to climb down, when most accidents happen – people are tired, it gets dark, it’s harder. I don’t climb mountains that I am not ready for. I wouldn’t climb K2 tomorrow, but each one I climb takes me to the next step. I don’t have many friends who like to climb, and sometimes you want to have someone to share the experience with. I work as a fashion photographer and most of my friends won’t even come to the climbing gym in case they ruin their nails. I had a few moments that were sketchy, but not super scary; I never feared for my life or got injured.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>At 11:30 a.m. on May 29, 1953, Edmund Hillary of New Zealand and Tenzing Norgay, a Sherpa of Nepal, become the first explorers to reach the summit of Mount Everest, which at 29,035 feet above sea level is the highest point on earth. The two made their final assault on the summit after spending a fitful night at 27,900 feet. News of their achievement broke around the world on June 2, the day of Queen Elizabeth II’s coronation, and Britons hailed it as a good omen for their country’s future. Mount Everest sits on the crest of the Great Himalayas in Asia, lying on the border between Nepal and Tibet.
