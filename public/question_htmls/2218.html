        <p><strong>Read the text below. Six Sentances have been removed from this text so that there are six gaps.</strong><br><br>
Spanish Bullfighting <strong>(A)</strong> ………. The Spanish people consider types of bullfighting as art forms which are intimately linked with their country’s history, art and culture. Pressure groups attempt to lobby against bullfighting yet the King of Spain himself has allegedly stated that the day the EU bans bullfighting is the day Spain leaves the EU.</p>
        <p><strong>(B)</strong> ………. They were popular spectacles in ancient Rome, but it was in the Iberian Peninsula that these contests were fully developed by the Moors from North Africa who overran Andalucia in AD 711. Bullfighting developed into a ritualistic occasion observed in connection with feast days, on which the conquering Moors, mounted on highly trained horses, confronted and killed the bulls. Whilst bullfighting maintains strong support in its heartlands of Madrid, Andalucia and Extremadura it has been banned in Catalonia.</p>
        <p><strong>(C)</strong> ………. All major Spanish cities have impressive bullrings but probably the most outstanding are those in Madrid, Seville, and Ronda. The Madrid’s Bullring is La Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas which was built in 1929 and was first used in 1931. It is the most important bullring in the world with a capacity of 25,000. Every seat is taken every evening during the world-renowned San Isidro Bullfighting festival in June. The Seville Bullring is very old Building of the Maestranza Bullring in Seville began in 1758 making it Spain’s oldest Plaza de Toros. The origin of modern-day bullfighting on foot (rather than horseback) can be traced back to here and Ronda. It is one of the most charming bullrings in the country and although its capacity is only 12,500, it attracts the top bullfighters. You can see bullfights in Seville from April (during Seville’s Feria de Abril) through to October. Check the bullfight calendar as they don’t take place every weekend.</p>
        <p><strong>(D)</strong> ………. It is one of the oldest and most beautiful in Spain. Previously it had been Philip II’s centre for horsemanship training (Real Maestranza de Caballeria). Bulls were used in this training and when one day an aristocrat fell from his horse one Francisco&nbsp;Romero came to his help by using his hat to distract it. The hat was replaced by a cape and modern day bullfighting was born. Romero’s grandson, Pedro Romero, developed all the passes and moves which to this day are seen at a bullfight. He retired in his eighties after killing more than 5,600 bulls without ever being hurt. Thus Ronda is considered the home of bullfighting. You can visit the bullring in Ronda which houses a small bullfighting museum. The bullfighting season in Ronda is from April to October though fights are quite infrequent. Check with the tourist office next to the bullring.</p>
        <p><strong>(E)</strong>………. It depends on their position in the bullfighting arena. The ones in the shade (sombra) are more expensive than the ones in the sun (sol). Some seats are designated as sun and shade (sol y sombra) because they begin in the sun but move to shade as the afternoon progresses. Seats located closest to the bullfight are also more expensive than those near the back. So ones near the ringside barrier (barrera) which are also in the shade are the most expensive. Buying tickets at the actual arena can prove a major hassle as it is difficult to work out which ticket window (taquilla) you should go to and without a very good level of Spanish it is almost impossible to explain or find out which tickets you wish to buy. Just study the poster of the event in advance to decide where you want to sit then ask for those seats or simply copy the name of the seating area and show it to the ticket seller.</p>
        <p><strong>(F)</strong> ………. Bulls can suffer a severe and tortuous death. Many animal rights activists often protest bullfighting in Spain and other countries, citing the needless endangerment of the bull and bullfighter. Some cities around the world where bullfighting was once popular, including Coslada (Spain), Mouans-Sartoux (France), and Teocelo (Mexico), have even declared themselves to be anti-bullfighting cities. Other places, including some towns in Catalonia (Spain), have ceased killing the bull in the fight, but continue bullfighting.</p>

For the past few months, your local community has been lobbying for more entertainment options for teenagers such as skate parks, dance halls, fields and sports courts. The community believes that by offering teenagers fun and active outlets, that childhood obesity, antisocial behaviour, graffiti, gang activity, petty theft and muggings might go down.<br>
<br>
<strong>As a resident of this community, write a letter to your local MP (Member of Parliament) explaining your thoughts on this situation.&nbsp;</strong><br>
<br>
In your letter, you might:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Explain why you do, or do not, believe your local area needs more youth activities</li>
          <li>Explain the positive or negative consequences of providing more youth activities</li>
          <li>Explain the current situation in your community and suggest other ways it could be improved&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Remember, you do not have to write about your&nbsp;actual&nbsp;community. You can create a fictional community and make up some of the issues that may exist within it.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Nomads of the North&nbsp;</strong><br><em>by James Oliver Curwood&nbsp;</em><br><br><em><strong>[Neewa, the black bear cub has been captured by a hunter who killed his mother the day before.]</strong></em><br><br>
It was the cub who first saw the man-beast, and for a brief space before the pup roused himself Neewa's shining eyes were fixed on the strange enemy who had so utterly changed his world for him. Exhaustion had made him sleep through the long hours of that first night of captivity, and in sleep he had forgotten many things. But now it all came back to him as he cringed deeper into his shelter under the root, and so softly that only Miki heard him as he whimpered for his mother.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was the whimper that roused Miki, the hunter’s dog. Slowly, he untangled himself from the ball into which he had rolled, stretched his long and overgrown legs, and yawned so loudly that the sound reached Challoner's ears. The man turned and saw two pairs of eyes fixed upon him from the sheltered hollow under the root. The pup's one good ear and the other that was half gone stood up alertly, as he greeted his master with the boundless good cheer of an irrepressible comradeship. Challoner's face, wet with the drizzle of the gray skies and bronzed by the wind and storm of fourteen months in the north land, lighted up with a responsive grin, and <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Miki wriggled forth weaving and twisting himself</strong></span> into grotesque contortions expressive of happiness at being thus directly smiled at by his master.</p>
        <p>With all the room under the root left to him, Neewa pulled himself back until only his round head was showing, and from this fortress of temporary safety his bright little eyes glared forth at his mother's murderer.</p>
        <p>Vividly, the tragedy of yesterday was before him again—the warm, sun-filled creek bottom in which he and Noozak, his mother, were hunting a breakfast of crawfish when the manbeast came; the crash of strange thunder, their flight into the timber and the end of it all when his mother turned to confront their enemy. And yet it was not the death of his mother that remained with him most poignantly this morning. It was the memory of his own terrific fight with the white man, and his struggle afterward in the black and suffocating depths of the bag in which Challoner had brought him to his camp. Even now, Challoner was looking at the scratches on his hands. He advanced a few steps, and grinned down at Neewa, just as he had grinned good-humouredly at Miki, the angular pup.</p>
        <p>Neewa's little eyes blazed.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"I told you last night that I was sorry," said Challoner, speaking as if to one of his own kind.</p>
        <p>In several ways Challoner was unusual, an out-of-the-ordinary type in the northland. He believed, for instance, in a certain specific psychology of the animal mind, and had proven to his own satisfaction that animals treated and conversed with in a matter-of-fact human way frequently developed an understanding which he, in his unscientific way, called reason.</p>
        <p>"I told you I was sorry," he repeated, squatting on his heels within a yard of the root from under which Neewa's eyes were glaring at him, "And I am. I'm sorry I killed your mother. But we had to have meat and fat. Besides, Miki and I are going to make it up to you. We're going to take you along with us down to the Girl, and if you don't learn to love her, you're the meanest, lowest-down little cuss in all creation and don't deserve a mother. You and Miki are going to be brothers. His mother is dead, too — plum starved to death, which is worse than dying with a bullet in your lung. And I found Miki just as I found you, hugging up close to her an' crying as if there wasn't any world left for him. So, cheer up, and give us your paw. Let's shake!"</p>
        <p>Challoner held out his hand. Neewa was as motionless as a stone. A few moments before he would have snarled and bared his teeth. But now he was dead still. This was by all odds the strangest beast he had ever seen. Yesterday it had not harmed him, except to put him into the bag. And now it did not offer to harm him. More than that, the talk it made was not unpleasant, or threatening. His eyes took in Miki. The pup had squeezed himself squarely between Challoner's knees and was looking at him in a puzzled, questioning sort of way, as if to ask: "Why don't you come out from under that root and help get breakfast?"</p>

        <p>"I told you I was sorry," he repeated, squatting on his heels within a yard of the root from under which Neewa's eyes were glaring at him, "And I am. I'm sorry I killed your mother. But we had to have meat and fat. Besides, Miki and I are going to make it up to you. We're going to take you along with us down to the Girl, and if you don't learn to love her, you're the meanest, lowest-down little cuss in all creation and don't deserve a mother. You and Miki are going to be brothers. His mother is dead, too — plum starved to death, which is worse than dying with a bullet in your lung. And I found Miki just as I found you, hugging up close to her an' crying as if there wasn't any world left for him. So, cheer up, and give us your paw. Let's shake!"</p>
        <p>Challoner held out his hand. Neewa was as motionless as a stone. A few moments before he would have snarled and bared his teeth. But now he was dead still. This was by all odds the strangest beast he had ever seen. Yesterday it had not harmed him, except to put him into the bag. And now it did not offer to harm him. More than that, the talk it made was not unpleasant, or threatening. His eyes took in Miki. The pup had squeezed himself squarely between Challoner's knees and was looking at him in a puzzled, questioning sort of way, as if to ask: "Why don't you come out from under that root and help get breakfast?"</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Nomads of the North&nbsp;</strong><br><em>by James Oliver Curwood&nbsp;</em><br><br><em><strong>[Neewa, the black bear cub has been captured by a hunter who killed his mother the day before.]</strong></em><br><br>
It was the cub who first saw the man-beast, and for a brief space before the pup roused himself Neewa's shining eyes were fixed on the strange enemy who had so utterly changed his world for him. Exhaustion had made him sleep through the long hours of that first night of captivity, and in sleep he had forgotten many things. But now it all came back to him as he cringed deeper into his shelter under the root, and so softly that only Miki heard him as he whimpered for his mother.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was the whimper that roused Miki, the hunter’s dog. Slowly, he untangled himself from the ball into which he had rolled, stretched his long and overgrown legs, and yawned so loudly that the sound reached Challoner's ears. The man turned and saw two pairs of eyes fixed upon him from the sheltered hollow under the root. The pup's one good ear and the other that was half gone stood up alertly, as he greeted his master with the boundless good cheer of an irrepressible comradeship. Challoner's face, wet with the drizzle of the gray skies and bronzed by the wind and storm of fourteen months in the north land, lighted up with a responsive grin, and <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Miki wriggled forth weaving and twisting himself</strong></span> into grotesque contortions expressive of happiness at being thus directly smiled at by his master.</p>
        <p>With all the room under the root left to him, Neewa pulled himself back until only his round head was showing, and from this fortress of temporary safety his bright little eyes glared forth at his mother's murderer.</p>
        <p>Vividly, the tragedy of yesterday was before him again—the warm, sun-filled creek bottom in which he and Noozak, his mother, were hunting a breakfast of crawfish when the manbeast came; the crash of strange thunder, their flight into the timber and the end of it all when his mother turned to confront their enemy. And yet it was not the death of his mother that remained with him most poignantly this morning. It was the memory of his own terrific fight with the white man, and his struggle afterward in the black and suffocating depths of the bag in which Challoner had brought him to his camp. Even now, Challoner was looking at the scratches on his hands. He advanced a few steps, and grinned down at Neewa, just as he had grinned good-humouredly at Miki, the angular pup.</p>
        <p>Neewa's little eyes blazed.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"I told you last night that I was sorry," said Challoner, speaking as if to one of his own kind.</p>
        <p>In several ways Challoner was unusual, an out-of-the-ordinary type in the northland. He believed, for instance, in a certain specific psychology of the animal mind, and had proven to his own satisfaction that animals treated and conversed with in a matter-of-fact human way frequently developed an understanding which he, in his unscientific way, called reason.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Nomads of the North&nbsp;</strong><br><em>by James Oliver Curwood&nbsp;</em><br><br><em><strong>[Neewa, the black bear cub has been captured by a hunter who killed his mother the day before.]</strong></em><br><br>
It was the cub who first saw the man-beast, and for a brief space before the pup roused himself Neewa's shining eyes were fixed on the strange enemy who had so utterly changed his world for him. Exhaustion had made him sleep through the long hours of that first night of captivity, and in sleep he had forgotten many things. But now it all came back to him as he cringed deeper into his shelter under the root, and so softly that only Miki heard him as he whimpered for his mother.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was the whimper that roused Miki, the hunter’s dog. Slowly, he untangled himself from the ball into which he had rolled, stretched his long and overgrown legs, and yawned so loudly that the sound reached Challoner's ears. The man turned and saw two pairs of eyes fixed upon him from the sheltered hollow under the root. The pup's one good ear and the other that was half gone stood up alertly, as he greeted his master with the boundless good cheer of an irrepressible comradeship. Challoner's face, wet with the drizzle of the gray skies and bronzed by the wind and storm of fourteen months in the north land, lighted up with a responsive grin, and <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Miki wriggled forth weaving and twisting himself</strong></span> into grotesque contortions expressive of happiness at being thus directly smiled at by his master.</p>
        <p>With all the room under the root left to him, Neewa pulled himself back until only his round head was showing, and from this fortress of temporary safety his bright little eyes glared forth at his mother's murderer.</p>
        <p>Vividly, the tragedy of yesterday was before him again—the warm, sun-filled creek bottom in which he and Noozak, his mother, were hunting a breakfast of crawfish when the manbeast came; the crash of strange thunder, their flight into the timber and the end of it all when his mother turned to confront their enemy. And yet it was not the death of his mother that remained with him most poignantly this morning. It was the memory of his own terrific fight with the white man, and his struggle afterward in the black and suffocating depths of the bag in which Challoner had brought him to his camp. Even now, Challoner was looking at the scratches on his hands. He advanced a few steps, and grinned down at Neewa, just as he had grinned good-humouredly at Miki, the angular pup.</p>
        <p>Neewa's little eyes blazed.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"I told you last night that I was sorry," said Challoner, speaking as if to one of his own kind.</p>
        <p>In several ways Challoner was unusual, an out-of-the-ordinary type in the northland. He believed, for instance, in a certain specific psychology of the animal mind, and had proven to his own satisfaction that animals treated and conversed with in a matter-of-fact human way frequently developed an understanding which he, in his unscientific way, called reason.</p>
        <p>"I told you I was sorry," he repeated, squatting on his heels within a yard of the root from under which Neewa's eyes were glaring at him, "And I am. I'm sorry I killed your mother. But we had to have meat and fat. Besides, Miki and I are going to make it up to you. We're going to take you along with us down to the Girl, and if you don't learn to love her, you're the meanest, lowest-down little cuss in all creation and don't deserve a mother. You and Miki are going to be brothers. His mother is dead, too — plum starved to death, which is worse than dying with a bullet in your lung. And I found Miki just as I found you, hugging up close to her an' crying as if there wasn't any world left for him. So, cheer up, and give us your paw. Let's shake!"</p>
        <p>Challoner held out his hand. Neewa was as motionless as a stone. A few moments before he would have snarled and bared his teeth. But now he was dead still. This was by all odds the strangest beast he had ever seen. Yesterday it had not harmed him, except to put him into the bag. And now it did not offer to harm him. More than that, the talk it made was not unpleasant, or threatening. His eyes took in Miki. The pup had squeezed himself squarely between Challoner's knees and was looking at him in a puzzled, questioning sort of way, as if to ask: "Why don't you come out from under that root and help get breakfast?"</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Nomads of the North&nbsp;</strong><br><em>by James Oliver Curwood&nbsp;</em><br><br><em><strong>[Neewa, the black bear cub has been captured by a hunter who killed his mother the day before.]</strong></em><br><br>
It was the cub who first saw the man-beast, and for a brief space before the pup roused himself Neewa's shining eyes were fixed on the strange enemy who had so utterly changed his world for him. Exhaustion had made him sleep through the long hours of that first night of captivity, and in sleep he had forgotten many things. But now it all came back to him as he cringed deeper into his shelter under the root, and so softly that only Miki heard him as he whimpered for his mother.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was the whimper that roused Miki, the hunter’s dog. Slowly, he untangled himself from the ball into which he had rolled, stretched his long and overgrown legs, and yawned so loudly that the sound reached Challoner's ears. The man turned and saw two pairs of eyes fixed upon him from the sheltered hollow under the root. The pup's one good ear and the other that was half gone stood up alertly, as he greeted his master with the boundless good cheer of an irrepressible comradeship. Challoner's face, wet with the drizzle of the gray skies and bronzed by the wind and storm of fourteen months in the north land, lighted up with a responsive grin, and <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Miki wriggled forth weaving and twisting himself</strong></span> into grotesque contortions expressive of happiness at being thus directly smiled at by his master.</p>
        <p>With all the room under the root left to him, Neewa pulled himself back until only his round head was showing, and from this fortress of temporary safety his bright little eyes glared forth at his mother's murderer.</p>
        <p>Vividly, the tragedy of yesterday was before him again—the warm, sun-filled creek bottom in which he and Noozak, his mother, were hunting a breakfast of crawfish when the manbeast came; the crash of strange thunder, their flight into the timber and the end of it all when his mother turned to confront their enemy. And yet it was not the death of his mother that remained with him most poignantly this morning. It was the memory of his own terrific fight with the white man, and his struggle afterward in the black and suffocating depths of the bag in which Challoner had brought him to his camp. Even now, Challoner was looking at the scratches on his hands. He advanced a few steps, and grinned down at Neewa, just as he had grinned good-humouredly at Miki, the angular pup.</p>
        <p>Neewa's little eyes blazed.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"I told you last night that I was sorry," said Challoner, speaking as if to one of his own kind.</p>
        <p>In several ways Challoner was unusual, an out-of-the-ordinary type in the northland. He believed, for instance, in a certain specific psychology of the animal mind, and had proven to his own satisfaction that animals treated and conversed with in a matter-of-fact human way frequently developed an understanding which he, in his unscientific way, called reason.</p>
        <p>"I told you I was sorry," he repeated, squatting on his heels within a yard of the root from under which Neewa's eyes were glaring at him, "And I am. I'm sorry I killed your mother. But we had to have meat and fat. Besides, Miki and I are going to make it up to you. We're going to take you along with us down to the Girl, and if you don't learn to love her, you're the meanest, lowest-down little cuss in all creation and don't deserve a mother. You and Miki are going to be brothers. His mother is dead, too — plum starved to death, which is worse than dying with a bullet in your lung. And I found Miki just as I found you, hugging up close to her an' crying as if there wasn't any world left for him. So, cheer up, and give us your paw. Let's shake!"</p>
        <p>Challoner held out his hand. Neewa was as motionless as a stone. A few moments before he would have snarled and bared his teeth. But now he was dead still. This was by all odds the strangest beast he had ever seen. Yesterday it had not harmed him, except to put him into the bag. And now it did not offer to harm him. More than that, the talk it made was not unpleasant, or threatening. His eyes took in Miki. The pup had squeezed himself squarely between Challoner's knees and was looking at him in a puzzled, questioning sort of way, as if to ask: "Why don't you come out from under that root and help get breakfast?"</p>

        <p>Should children have a fixed bed time?</p>
        <p>Is there anything wrong with a more creative response where children can go to bed when they are ready to?</p>
        <p>It seems there is.</p>
        <p>The University College in London has investigated the effects of bedtime routine on child development. They asked children to complete a number of tests on number skills, reading and constructing shapes. Children having no set bed time often led to them obtaining lower scores. The result of lower scores in the tests for children with less rigid bed times was most striking amongst three-year-old boys and girls.&nbsp;</p>

THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF BODY LANGUAGE</strong><br><br>
Geoffrey Beattie, at the University of Manchester, found that a woman is instinctively four times more likely to mirror another woman than a man is to mirror another man. <strong>(A)</strong> ………, but men are reluctant to mirror a woman’s gestures or posture – unless he is in courtship mode.</p>
        <p>When a woman says she can ‘see’ that someone doesn’t agree with the group opinion, she is actually ‘seeing’ the disagreement. <strong>(B)</strong> ………. and they are showing their disagreement by not mirroring the group’s body language. How women can ‘see’ disagreement, anger, lying or feeling hurt has always been a source of amazement to most men. <strong>(C)</strong> ………. and don’t consciously notice mirroring discrepancies.</p>
        <p>Men and women’s brains are programmed differently to express different emotions through facial expressions and body language. Typically, a woman can use an average of six main facial expressions in a ten-second listening period to reflect and then feedback the speaker’s emotions. <strong>(D)</strong> ………. To someone watching, it can look as if the events being discussed are happening to both women.</p>
        <p>A woman reads the meaning of what is being said through the speaker’s voice and tone and his emotional condition through his body language. <strong>(E)</strong> ………. Most men are daunted by the prospect of using facial feedback while listening, but it pays big dividends for the man who becomes good at it.</p>
        <p>Some men say, <strong>(F)</strong> ………. but research with these techniques shows that when a man mirrors a woman’s facial expressions as she talks, she will describe him as caring, intelligent, interesting and attractive.</p>
