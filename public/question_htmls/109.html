          <strong>Our American Trees</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <em>by Robert C. Birkby</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The largest and oldest living things on earth are trees. Over a thousand kinds grow in the United States, and thousands more flourish in other parts of the world. Trees play a very important role in the health of the environment and in the lives of people. The following are a few of the benefits we enjoy from trees:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Trees pump oxygen into the air. The great forests of the world are essential for purifying the air and maintaining the right balance of oxygen in the atmosphere.</li>
          <li>Leaves on branches and on the ground slow falling rain so that it can seep into the earth. Roots keep dirt from washing away. Fallen leaves decay in the soil and enrich it.</li>
          <li>Trees provide shelter and food for wildlife. A forest is a complicated web of relationships among hundreds of types of plants and animals. That diversity helps all species survive. Strong forests increase the stability of the environment.</li>
          <li>Trees provide shelter and food for humans, too. Lumber goes into homes. Fruits, berries, nuts, and oils feed us. Other products of trees include paper, rubber, spices, and medicines.</li>
          <li>Shaded yards and city parks offer us places close to home where we can relax and play. Hiking and camping let us explore vast forests and wilderness areas.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Parts of a Tree</strong>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Roots</strong>. Much of a tree is out of sight beneath the ground. Growing very quickly, thousands of tiny root hairs push through the earth, absorbing moisture and sending it up into the tree. A root system is also the anchor holding a tree upright even in storms and high winds.</p>
        <p><strong>Trunks</strong>. The <em>bark </em>on a tree trunk gives the plant a tough outer armor. <em>Sapwood </em>underneath the bark transports moisture from the roots up to the leaves. Between the sapwood and bark is a thin layer of tissue called the <em>cambium </em>layer. It channels food produced by the leaves down into the tree trunk and the roots. In the center of the trunk is hardened sapwood called <em>heartwood </em>that gives the tree strength. Each year the cambium builds a new layer of sapwood around the trunk. Count the rings formed by the layers and you’ll know how many years a tree was alive.</p>
        <p><strong>Leaves</strong>. The green chlorophyll in the leaves draws power from sunlight and converts carbon dioxide in the air into nutrients for the tree. Called <em>photosynthesis</em>, this process returns oxygen to the atmosphere. It is an important way for the air to be cleaned and refreshed with oxygen.</p>
        <p>The two large groups of American trees are <em>conifer </em>trees and <em>broadleaf </em>trees. Conifers, also known as <em>evergreens</em>, have needlelike or scalelike leaves that usually stay on the trees for several years. Broadleaf trees have flat leaves that generally fall off in the autumn.</p>

          <strong>The Colour of Sunshine</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <em>By David Metzenthen&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It rains all day. I go to Treymouth State School, but Stewie, my brother, is in the navy. Stewie's ship is grey, the colour of this sky. His ship is a destroyer. Stewie is a cook. Sometimes I wish he was something better than a cook. If I was on a destroyer, I would not be a cook. I would shoot the guns or steer the ship. I would not be a cook.</p>
        <p>On the wall of my classroom there's a map of the world hanging like a picture. Australia is yellow on the map. That's the last colour I think Australia is. Australia is not yellow. Not where I live it isn't, anyway. Yellow is the colour of happiness. Yellow is the colour of the sun. Yellow is the colour of balloons or flowers. Where I live is not yellow. Treymouth is not yellow. Treymouth is grey and grey is the colour of unhappiness, as far as I can see.</p>
        <p>Outside it's raining. Again.</p>
        <p>After school I walk back through town past the shops. Some shops are open, some shops are empty and shut - but one that was empty and shut this morning is now sort of open. There's someone in it, anyway. This shop used to sell presents like tea towels, china horses, and dolls, but it closed down months ago. I stop and look in the window, past my reflection. There's a tall man up a ladder fixing a light. He's put up quite a few lights. And there's a wooden wall standing where there wasn't one this morning, although it's not finished yet. It's a framework.</p>
        <p>The man sees me and climbs down the ladder. He's wearing these coloured baggy pants and old red shoes. He walks to the door and opens it with a key that was already in the lock. I guess he's going to tell me to go away, but I don't move. He doesn't look angry. I would like to know what he's doing.</p>
        <p>'Gidday, mate', he says, as if we already know each other. He looks out past me to the river. 'Geez, she's a rainy, rainy, chilly old day.'</p>
        <p>He smiles above me, at the sky. 'I hope it doesn't rain like this every day.'</p>
        <p>Mostly it does, but new people in town don't want to hear that.</p>
        <p>'No, not every day,' I say. 'Sometimes in summer it's hot.' But summer feels a long way off. It's not even spring yet. Summer feels as if it's lost somewhere over the other side of the world.</p>
        <p>I don't turn to look at the river. I look at the new wood and the tools lying on the shop floor. I can smell sawdust. It's good to look at something new being built. Mostly things around here just get old, fall down, and are never put back up again.</p>
        <p>The man stops looking at the river. He takes a step back into the shop.</p>
        <p>'This is going to be a pet shop,' he tells me and waves his hands around. ' A beautiful pet shop! Soon she'll be full of fish, lizards, birds. All sorts of things.' He smiles. I see a small black hole where one of his side teeth is missing. 'You like animals, don't you? I can tell you do.'</p>
        <p>I nod. I do like animals.</p>
        <p>On his coloured pants the man has pictures of fruit: slices of pink watermelon with black pips, yellow pineapples and stripy bananas. He's wearing a green jumper full of holes and has silver earrings in both his ears. He looks quite old with wrinkles on his face and hands, but he seems quite young. He has long straight pale hair and leathery gold skin. I can tell he's not from around here. He looks different. He looks like he might be from somewhere sunny or strange.</p>
        <p>'I'm Clarence John Sellew,' he says, 'by the way.' He puts out his hand. 'Call me Clarence.'</p>
        <p>I shake his hand. It's dry, creased like old newspaper, and warm. His eyes are bright and brown.</p>
        <p>'I'm Davey Collins,' I say, and put my hand back in my pocket. I can still feel the warmth from Clarence's hand. 'There's never been a pet shop here before,' I tell him. 'I don't remember one, anyway. I'm glad there will be, though. It'll be good.'</p>
        <p>Clarence seems happy to hear that. He lights half a cigarette that he takes out of a matchbox, and waves it at the stack of wood and the box of tools.</p>
        <p>'And the pets will be here soon.' He smiles, showing the black tooth-hole again. 'Soon as the girls and my brother Ezra bring the stock over, there'll be birds, fish, snakes, lizards, pups - all sorts of things. You tell your friends.'</p>
        <p>'I will,' I say, although I don't have many friends. Just kids at school. 'Bye.' I walk away from Clarence's door.</p>
        <p>A new shop. A pet shop. Good! But there's always a new shop opening up, and hardly any of them last. After a while they have plenty of special bargains, then a Final Sale, then they're gone, and the letters and newspapers pile up for the snails.</p>
        <p>I look around. It's still raining.</p>

          <strong>The Colour of Sunshine</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <em>By David Metzenthen&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It rains all day. I go to Treymouth State School, but Stewie, my brother, is in the navy. Stewie's ship is grey, the colour of this sky. His ship is a destroyer. Stewie is a cook. Sometimes I wish he was something better than a cook. If I was on a destroyer, I would not be a cook. I would shoot the guns or steer the ship. I would not be a cook.</p>
        <p>On the wall of my classroom there's a map of the world hanging like a picture. Australia is yellow on the map. That's the last colour I think Australia is. Australia is not yellow. Not where I live it isn't, anyway. Yellow is the colour of happiness. Yellow is the colour of the sun. Yellow is the colour of balloons or flowers. Where I live is not yellow. Treymouth is not yellow. Treymouth is grey and grey is the colour of unhappiness, as far as I can see.</p>
        <p>Outside it's raining. Again.</p>
        <p>After school I walk back through town past the shops. Some shops are open, some shops are empty and shut - but one that was empty and shut this morning is now sort of open. There's someone in it, anyway. This shop used to sell presents like tea towels, china horses, and dolls, but it closed down months ago. I stop and look in the window, past my reflection. There's a tall man up a ladder fixing a light. He's put up quite a few lights. And there's a wooden wall standing where there wasn't one this morning, although it's not finished yet. It's a framework.</p>
        <p>The man sees me and climbs down the ladder. He's wearing these coloured baggy pants and old red shoes. He walks to the door and opens it with a key that was already in the lock. I guess he's going to tell me to go away, but I don't move. He doesn't look angry. I would like to know what he's doing.</p>
        <p>'Gidday, mate', he says, as if we already know each other. He looks out past me to the river. 'Geez, she's a rainy, rainy, chilly old day.'</p>
        <p>He smiles above me, at the sky. 'I hope it doesn't rain like this every day.'</p>
        <p>Mostly it does, but new people in town don't want to hear that.</p>
        <p>'No, not every day,' I say. 'Sometimes in summer it's hot.' But summer feels a long way off. It's not even spring yet. Summer feels as if it's lost somewhere over the other side of the world.</p>
        <p>I don't turn to look at the river. I look at the new wood and the tools lying on the shop floor. I can smell sawdust. It's good to look at something new being built. Mostly things around here just get old, fall down, and are never put back up again.</p>
        <p>The man stops looking at the river. He takes a step back into the shop.</p>
        <p>'This is going to be a pet shop,' he tells me and waves his hands around. ' A beautiful pet shop! Soon she'll be full of fish, lizards, birds. All sorts of things.' He smiles. I see a small black hole where one of his side teeth is missing. 'You like animals, don't you? I can tell you do.'</p>
        <p>I nod. I do like animals.</p>
        <p>On his coloured pants the man has pictures of fruit: slices of pink watermelon with black pips, yellow pineapples and stripy bananas. He's wearing a green jumper full of holes and has silver earrings in both his ears. He looks quite old with wrinkles on his face and hands, but he seems quite young. He has long straight pale hair and leathery gold skin. I can tell he's not from around here. He looks different. He looks like he might be from somewhere sunny or strange.</p>
        <p>'I'm Clarence John Sellew,' he says, 'by the way.' He puts out his hand. 'Call me Clarence.'</p>
        <p>I shake his hand. It's dry, creased like old newspaper, and warm. His eyes are bright and brown.</p>
        <p>'I'm Davey Collins,' I say, and put my hand back in my pocket. I can still feel the warmth from Clarence's hand. 'There's never been a pet shop here before,' I tell him. 'I don't remember one, anyway. I'm glad there will be, though. It'll be good.'</p>
        <p>Clarence seems happy to hear that. He lights half a cigarette that he takes out of a matchbox, and waves it at the stack of wood and the box of tools.</p>
        <p>'And the pets will be here soon.' He smiles, showing the black tooth-hole again. 'Soon as the girls and my brother Ezra bring the stock over, there'll be birds, fish, snakes, lizards, pups - all sorts of things. You tell your friends.'</p>
        <p>'I will,' I say, although I don't have many friends. Just kids at school. 'Bye.' I walk away from Clarence's door.</p>
        <p>A new shop. A pet shop. Good! But there's always a new shop opening up, and hardly any of them last. After a while they have plenty of special bargains, then a Final Sale, then they're gone, and the letters and newspapers pile up for the snails.</p>
        <p>I look around. It's still raining.</p>

          <strong>The Colour of Sunshine</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <em>By David Metzenthen&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It rains all day. I go to Treymouth State School, but Stewie, my brother, is in the navy. Stewie's ship is grey, the colour of this sky. His ship is a destroyer. Stewie is a cook. Sometimes I wish he was something better than a cook. If I was on a destroyer, I would not be a cook. I would shoot the guns or steer the ship. I would not be a cook.</p>
        <p>On the wall of my classroom there's a map of the world hanging like a picture. Australia is yellow on the map. That's the last colour I think Australia is. Australia is not yellow. Not where I live it isn't, anyway. Yellow is the colour of happiness. Yellow is the colour of the sun. Yellow is the colour of balloons or flowers. Where I live is not yellow. Treymouth is not yellow. Treymouth is grey and grey is the colour of unhappiness, as far as I can see.</p>
        <p>Outside it's raining. Again.</p>
        <p>After school I walk back through town past the shops. Some shops are open, some shops are empty and shut - but one that was empty and shut this morning is now sort of open. There's someone in it, anyway. This shop used to sell presents like tea towels, china horses, and dolls, but it closed down months ago. I stop and look in the window, past my reflection. There's a tall man up a ladder fixing a light. He's put up quite a few lights. And there's a wooden wall standing where there wasn't one this morning, although it's not finished yet. It's a framework.</p>
        <p>The man sees me and climbs down the ladder. He's wearing these coloured baggy pants and old red shoes. He walks to the door and opens it with a key that was already in the lock. I guess he's going to tell me to go away, but I don't move. He doesn't look angry. I would like to know what he's doing.</p>
        <p>'Gidday, mate', he says, as if we already know each other. He looks out past me to the river. 'Geez, she's a rainy, rainy, chilly old day.'</p>
        <p>He smiles above me, at the sky. 'I hope it doesn't rain like this every day.'</p>
        <p>Mostly it does, but new people in town don't want to hear that.</p>
        <p>'No, not every day,' I say. 'Sometimes in summer it's hot.' But summer feels a long way off. It's not even spring yet. Summer feels as if it's lost somewhere over the other side of the world.</p>
        <p>I don't turn to look at the river. I look at the new wood and the tools lying on the shop floor. I can smell sawdust. It's good to look at something new being built. Mostly things around here just get old, fall down, and are never put back up again.</p>
        <p>The man stops looking at the river. He takes a step back into the shop.</p>
        <p>'This is going to be a pet shop,' he tells me and waves his hands around. ' A beautiful pet shop! Soon she'll be full of fish, lizards, birds. All sorts of things.' He smiles. I see a small black hole where one of his side teeth is missing. 'You like animals, don't you? I can tell you do.'</p>
        <p>I nod. I do like animals.</p>
        <p>On his coloured pants the man has pictures of fruit: slices of pink watermelon with black pips, yellow pineapples and stripy bananas. He's wearing a green jumper full of holes and has silver earrings in both his ears. He looks quite old with wrinkles on his face and hands, but he seems quite young. He has long straight pale hair and leathery gold skin. I can tell he's not from around here. He looks different. He looks like he might be from somewhere sunny or strange.</p>
        <p>'I'm Clarence John Sellew,' he says, 'by the way.' He puts out his hand. 'Call me Clarence.'</p>
        <p>I shake his hand. It's dry, creased like old newspaper, and warm. His eyes are bright and brown.</p>
        <p>'I'm Davey Collins,' I say, and put my hand back in my pocket. I can still feel the warmth from Clarence's hand. 'There's never been a pet shop here before,' I tell him. 'I don't remember one, anyway. I'm glad there will be, though. It'll be good.'</p>
        <p>Clarence seems happy to hear that. He lights half a cigarette that he takes out of a matchbox, and waves it at the stack of wood and the box of tools.</p>
        <p>'And the pets will be here soon.' He smiles, showing the black tooth-hole again. 'Soon as the girls and my brother Ezra bring the stock over, there'll be birds, fish, snakes, lizards, pups - all sorts of things. You tell your friends.'</p>
        <p>'I will,' I say, although I don't have many friends. Just kids at school. 'Bye.' I walk away from Clarence's door.</p>
        <p>A new shop. A pet shop. Good! But there's always a new shop opening up, and hardly any of them last. After a while they have plenty of special bargains, then a Final Sale, then they're gone, and the letters and newspapers pile up for the snails.</p>
        <p>I look around. It's still raining.</p>

        <p>The distant talking drum</p>

        <p>The sound of a distant talking drum I hear–</p>
        <p>Far away, far away.</p>
        <p>For me it calls.</p>
        <p>Clearly it calls</p>
        <p>For me to dance,</p>
        <p>For men to dance,</p>

        <p>For children to dance.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And the sound of the distant drum</p>
        <p>Echoes through the rain forest.</p>
        <p>The distant talking drum</p>
        <p>Is calling across the mighty rain forest</p>
        <p>For me to come,</p>
        <p>For me to dance.</p>
        <p>Now the sound of sweet songs</p>
        <p>I hear.</p>
        <p>Beautifully they flow!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And the distant talking drum</p>
        <p>Is still calling</p>
        <p>Far away, far away.</p>
        <p>Clearly it calls</p>
        <p>For me to come,</p>
        <p>For me to dance.</p>
        <p>So across the rain forest,</p>

          <strong>Pluto</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <em>by James Trefil</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Pluto is in many ways the strangest of the planets. It is small and has a large moon (called Charon). Its orbit is eccentric, which may cause it to have seasons in the sense that when it is close to the sun, the liquid methane on its surface boils to form a kind of atmospheric haze. When the planet moves farther away from the sun, it starts to snow solid methane.</p>
        <p>Pluto is not dark. Despite its great distance from the sun, the surface of Pluto is probably as bright as a moonlit night on Earth. The reason is all that methane, which is as white as newly fallen snow.</p>
        <p>The discovery of Pluto was more accident than design. The American astronomer Percival Lowell had predicted the existence of a ninth planet (he called it Planet X) based on what he took to be irregularities in the orbit of Neptune. Today astronomers argue that these “irregularities” weren’t real, but the result of instrumental error. Nevertheless, Lowell produced predictions about where Planet X ought to be (although, to be honest, the predictions changed occasionally when he redid the calculations). In any case, in 1930 Clyde Tombaugh, doing a systemic sky survey that would have found the planet no matter where it was, discovered the planet we now call Pluto. By coincidence, its position was pretty close to where Lowell’s last prediction said it should be. Was it just luck? We’ll never know.</p>

        <p>Pluto is in many ways the strangest of the planets. It is small and has a large moon (called Charon). Its orbit is eccentric, which may cause it to have seasons in the sense that when it is close to the sun, the liquid methane on its surface boils to form a kind of atmospheric haze. When the planet moves farther away from the sun, it starts to snow solid methane.</p>
        <p>Pluto is not dark. Despite its great distance from the sun, the surface of Pluto is probably as bright as a moonlit night on Earth. The reason is all that methane, which is as white as newly fallen snow.</p>
        <p>The discovery of Pluto was more accident than design. The American astronomer Percival Lowell had predicted the existence of a ninth planet (he called it Planet X) based on what he took to be irregularities in the orbit of Neptune. Today astronomers argue that these “irregularities” weren’t real, but the result of instrumental error. Nevertheless, Lowell produced predictions about where Planet X ought to be (although, to be honest, the predictions changed occasionally when he redid the calculations). In any case, in 1930 Clyde Tombaugh, doing a systemic sky survey that would have found the planet no matter where it was, discovered the planet we now call Pluto. By coincidence, its position was pretty close to where Lowell’s last prediction said it should be. Was it just luck? We’ll never know.</p>

          <strong>Pluto</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <em>by James Trefil</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Pluto is in many ways the strangest of the planets. It is small and has a large moon (called Charon). Its orbit is eccentric, which may cause it to have seasons in the sense that when it is close to the sun, the liquid methane on its surface boils to form a kind of atmospheric haze. When the planet moves farther away from the sun, it starts to snow solid methane.</p>
        <p>Pluto is not dark. Despite its great distance from the sun, the surface of Pluto is probably as bright as a moonlit night on Earth. The reason is all that methane, which is as white as newly fallen snow.</p>
        <p>The discovery of Pluto was more accident than design. The American astronomer Percival Lowell had predicted the existence of a ninth planet (he called it Planet X) based on what he took to be irregularities in the orbit of Neptune. Today astronomers argue that these “irregularities” weren’t real, but the result of instrumental error. Nevertheless, Lowell produced predictions about where Planet X ought to be (although, to be honest, the predictions changed occasionally when he redid the calculations). In any case, in 1930 Clyde Tombaugh, doing a systemic sky survey that would have found the planet no matter where it was, discovered the planet we now call Pluto. By coincidence, its position was pretty close to where Lowell’s last prediction said it should be. Was it just luck? We’ll never know.</p>

          <strong>Lou Gehrig</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <em>by Lawrence S. Ritter</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Lou Gehrig was the classic case of playing in Babe Ruth’s shadow. As the New York Yankees’ first baseman from 1925 through 1938, there was no way he could escape the big man behind him in right field. However, this never seemed to bother Gehrig. He was a shy, modest person who was content to leave the spotlight to Ruth.</p>
        <p>Gehrig was born in New York City in 1903. After attending Columbia University, where he waited on tables to pay his way through school, he joined the Yankees in 1925 and soon became one of baseball’s outstanding hitters.* He is remembered by the public mainly as the durable Iron Horse who played in 2,130 consecutive games between 1925 and 1939. His teammates and opponents, however, remember him more for his blistering line drives and his ability to drive in runs.</p>
        <p>For thirteen consecutive seasons, he batted in over 100 runs, seven of those times over 150. In 1931, when he drove in 184 runs, he set an American League record. He batted in a lifetime total of 1,990 runs, more than anyone in baseball history except Hank Aaron (who had 2,297) and Babe Ruth (who had 2,213). Had illness not cut him down prematurely, he probably would have added another 308, enough to top them both.</p>
        <p>One indication of his effectiveness when he came to bat with men on base is the twenty-three home runs he hit with the bases loaded, an all-time major league record.</p>
        <p>He hit over forty home runs five times and batted over .340 eight times. A left-handed hitter, his lifetime batting average was a notable .340, tenth highest in the twentieth century.</p>
        <p>Gehrig usually batted fourth in the Yankee batting order, right behind Babe Ruth. A reporter once mentioned to him that no matter what Gehrig did, he seemed to get almost no publicity.</p>
        <p>Lou laughed and said, “I’m not a headline guy, and we might as well face it. When the Babe’s turn at bat is over, whether he belted a homer or struck out, the fans are still talking about it when I come up. Heck, nobody would notice if I stood on my head at home plate.”</p>
        <p>On May 1, 1939, after playing in 2,130 consecutive games stretching over fourteen years, Lou Gehrig took himself out of the Yankee lineup for the good of the team. He felt weak and uncoordinated. Doctors discovered that he was suffering from an incurable rare illness, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, now called Lou Gehrig’s disease, which destroys the central nervous system. The gentle first baseman died two years later, a couple of weeks before his thirty-eighth birthday.</p>
        <p>A widely praised 1942 movie about Lou Gehrig’s life, starring Gary Cooper, was named The Pride of the Yankees. The dictionary defines “pride” in this sense as “someone to be proud of . . . the best in a group.” The movie could not have been better named.</p>

          <strong>Lou Gehrig</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <em>by Lawrence S. Ritter</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Lou Gehrig was the classic case of playing in Babe Ruth’s shadow. As the New York Yankees’ first baseman from 1925 through 1938, there was no way he could escape the big man behind him in right field. However, this never seemed to bother Gehrig. He was a shy, modest person who was content to leave the spotlight to Ruth.</p>
        <p>Gehrig was born in New York City in 1903. After attending Columbia University, where he waited on tables to pay his way through school, he joined the Yankees in 1925 and soon became one of baseball’s outstanding hitters.* He is remembered by the public mainly as the durable Iron Horse who played in 2,130 consecutive games between 1925 and 1939. His teammates and opponents, however, remember him more for his blistering line drives and his ability to drive in runs.</p>
        <p>For thirteen consecutive seasons, he batted in over 100 runs, seven of those times over 150. In 1931, when he drove in 184 runs, he set an American League record. He batted in a lifetime total of 1,990 runs, more than anyone in baseball history except Hank Aaron (who had 2,297) and Babe Ruth (who had 2,213). Had illness not cut him down prematurely, he probably would have added another 308, enough to top them both.</p>
        <p>One indication of his effectiveness when he came to bat with men on base is the twenty-three home runs he hit with the bases loaded, an all-time major league record.</p>
        <p>He hit over forty home runs five times and batted over .340 eight times. A left-handed hitter, his lifetime batting average was a notable .340, tenth highest in the twentieth century.</p>
        <p>Gehrig usually batted fourth in the Yankee batting order, right behind Babe Ruth. A reporter once mentioned to him that no matter what Gehrig did, he seemed to get almost no publicity.</p>
        <p>Lou laughed and said, “I’m not a headline guy, and we might as well face it. When the Babe’s turn at bat is over, whether he belted a homer or struck out, the fans are still talking about it when I come up. Heck, nobody would notice if I stood on my head at home plate.”</p>
        <p>On May 1, 1939, after playing in 2,130 consecutive games stretching over fourteen years, Lou Gehrig took himself out of the Yankee lineup for the good of the team. He felt weak and uncoordinated. Doctors discovered that he was suffering from an incurable rare illness, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, now called Lou Gehrig’s disease, which destroys the central nervous system. The gentle first baseman died two years later, a couple of weeks before his thirty-eighth birthday.</p>
        <p>A widely praised 1942 movie about Lou Gehrig’s life, starring Gary Cooper, was named The Pride of the Yankees. The dictionary defines “pride” in this sense as “someone to be proud of . . . the best in a group.” The movie could not have been better named.</p>

          <strong>Lou Gehrig</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <em>by Lawrence S. Ritter</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Lou Gehrig was the classic case of playing in Babe Ruth’s shadow. As the New York Yankees’ first baseman from 1925 through 1938, there was no way he could escape the big man behind him in right field. However, this never seemed to bother Gehrig. He was a shy, modest person who was content to leave the spotlight to Ruth.</p>
        <p>Gehrig was born in New York City in 1903. After attending Columbia University, where he waited on tables to pay his way through school, he joined the Yankees in 1925 and soon became one of baseball’s outstanding hitters.* He is remembered by the public mainly as the durable Iron Horse who played in 2,130 consecutive games between 1925 and 1939. His teammates and opponents, however, remember him more for his blistering line drives and his ability to drive in runs.</p>
        <p>For thirteen consecutive seasons, he batted in over 100 runs, seven of those times over 150. In 1931, when he drove in 184 runs, he set an American League record. He batted in a lifetime total of 1,990 runs, more than anyone in baseball history except Hank Aaron (who had 2,297) and Babe Ruth (who had 2,213). Had illness not cut him down prematurely, he probably would have added another 308, enough to top them both.</p>
        <p>One indication of his effectiveness when he came to bat with men on base is the twenty-three home runs he hit with the bases loaded, an all-time major league record.</p>
        <p>He hit over forty home runs five times and batted over .340 eight times. A left-handed hitter, his lifetime batting average was a notable .340, tenth highest in the twentieth century.</p>
        <p>Gehrig usually batted fourth in the Yankee batting order, right behind Babe Ruth. A reporter once mentioned to him that no matter what Gehrig did, he seemed to get almost no publicity.</p>
        <p>Lou laughed and said, “I’m not a headline guy, and we might as well face it. When the Babe’s turn at bat is over, whether he belted a homer or struck out, the fans are still talking about it when I come up. Heck, nobody would notice if I stood on my head at home plate.”</p>
        <p>On May 1, 1939, after playing in 2,130 consecutive games stretching over fourteen years, Lou Gehrig took himself out of the Yankee lineup for the good of the team. He felt weak and uncoordinated. Doctors discovered that he was suffering from an incurable rare illness, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, now called Lou Gehrig’s disease, which destroys the central nervous system. The gentle first baseman died two years later, a couple of weeks before his thirty-eighth birthday.</p>
        <p>A widely praised 1942 movie about Lou Gehrig’s life, starring Gary Cooper, was named The Pride of the Yankees. The dictionary defines “pride” in this sense as “someone to be proud of . . . the best in a group.” The movie could not have been better named.</p>
