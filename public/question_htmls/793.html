  Cats can become stressed by being in a confined environment, with unfamiliar people constantly coming in and out, wanting to stroke and handle them. Having a large number of cats together in one place could have effects on the cats’ mental health. Cat cafes are also usually indoors, while cats would benefit from being outdoors and exhibiting natural behaviours. In the United Kingdom, as of 2016, cat cafes only had to meet food safety requirements, and could set their own animal welfare standards.<br>

Which of the following most strengthens the above argument?

I am trying to obtain the mirror image of the grid across the dotted line, but I do not want to draw the whole grid again. If each square is able to be rotated, but not swapped with any other square, how many squares would I need to rotate to obtain the reflected grid across the dotted line?

  Jon and his family wanted to go to an amusement park. Jon was the middle child at age ten, his older brother Tate was fourteen, and his younger sister Lily had just learned to talk (2 years later than expected). His dad was unemployed, and his mum was working as a lawyer. His grandma and grandpa also wanted to come. They were fifty and fifty-eight when Tate was born. If the table shows the standard rates of entry for the amusement park, what is the cheapest price his family could pay to get into the Amusement park?<br>

  Periodical cicadas are found in North America. Once cicadas hatch from their eggs, they burrow into the ground, living off the sap of plant roots for 13-17 years. After this period of time, they emerge from the ground, mature into adults, and shed their skin. Adult cicadas die after a few weeks.<br>

  The thyroid gland is located around the neck region of the human body. In embryos, the thyroid is formed at the base of the tongue, known as the foramen caecum. The primary purpose of the thyroid gland is to release the thyroid hormones, which travel to certain portions of the body and stimulate other effects. The most common thyroid disorder results in excessive secretions of thyroid hormones, such as Graves’ disease. Some of these ailments can cause immense impact on the quality of the individual life, thus necessary precautions are required to remove such problems beforehand.<br>

  Crows are able to remember the faces of individual humans for up to two years. A study occurred in 2011 where a group of trainers fed crows while a second group did not. After a period of time, the same crows were observed to prefer taking food from the trainers who fed them the first time.<br>

  Sleepwalking, also known as somnambulism, is a sleep disorder. Arising from the slow wave sleep stage, sleepwalkers in a state of low consciousness perform activities usually performed during full consciousness. Activities performed range from sitting up in bed to driving and cooking. Generally, sleepwalking consists of simple repeated behaviours, though some disputed reports have been made on complex behaviours performed by individuals while asleep.<br>
