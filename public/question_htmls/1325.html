            <p>The only total lunar (moon) eclipse of 2021 occurs this week and for families looking to enjoy the “Super Flower Blood Moon” eclipse, here’s everything you need to know.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>On May 26, there will be a total lunar eclipse. During a lunar eclipse, the Moon travels through Earth’s shadow as our planet is directly in between the sun and our moon. In a total lunar eclipse, the Moon is completely covered by the Earth’s shadow, while a partial lunar eclipse occurs when only a part of the Moon moves into Earth’s shadow. This eclipse will occur at the same time as a “super-moon,” an informal term that describes times when the full moon is at its closest point to Earth, making it look extra big and bright in the night sky. Depending on where you live, you will need to wake up early (America) or stay up late (Australia) to see the eclipse.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The Moon, so bright and large in the sky compared to other celestial objects, has captured the attention of humans at least since ancient times. Over these eras, mankind’s view of the Moon has changed, from the more mystical image of it as a god, to the thought it was covered in seas and vegetation. Most recently, it’s been viewed as a dry and dusty wasteland. Recent findings of water on the lunar surface could change the way we see our orbiting companion.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The Moon has even been blamed for some of the darker forces of human nature, such as temporary insanity. The term lunatic (and “loony”) comes from the Latin name for the Moon. Many criminal and insane behaviours were once blamed on the presence of a full moon. The full moon was also thought to change afflicted humans into fearsome werewolves, a mythological creature most common in European tales. Full moons and lunar eclipses were also seen by some cultures as bad omens.</p>

            <p>If you have looked into the night sky, you may have noticed the Moon appears to change shape each night. The different shapes of the Moon that we see are called the Moon’s&nbsp;<em><strong>phases</strong></em>.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Why does this happen? The shape of the Moon isn’t changing throughout the month. But our view of the Moon does change. The Moon does not produce its own light. There is only one source of light in our solar system, and that is the Sun. “Moonlight” is actually just sunlight reflecting off of the Moon’s surface. The Sun’s light comes from one direction, and it always illuminates, or lights up, one half of the Moon – the side of the Moon that is facing the Sun at that time. The other side of the Moon is dark. On Earth, our view of the shiny part of the Moon changes each night, depending on where the Moon is in its orbit around Earth. When we have a full view of the completely illuminated side of the Moon, that phase is known as a full moon. But following that, we start to see less of the Moon lit by the Sun each night. Eventually, the Moon reaches a point in its orbit when we don’t see any of the Moon illuminated. This phase is called a new moon.</p>

            <p>In 1504 the famous explorer, Christopher Columbus had been stranded with his men on the island of Jamaica. Columbus awaited rescue, but their food had run out, and the Jamaican tribesmen, who had been pleased to provision them when they first arrived, were tired of it.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Luckily Columbus had astronomical tables with him, which indicated a lunar eclipse was due on February 29. Calling the local chiefs together, Columbus unscrupulously tricked them by telling them that his God was all-powerful, and very displeased with the Jamaicans’ refusal to keep them fed, and as a sign of his anger the Moon would be darkened and turned the colour of blood that evening. Many of the natives laughed, but all were convinced when the eclipse began as Columbus had told them it would. To add to the effect, Columbus retired to his cabin, to consult with God and ask Him to withdraw His sign. In fact, he was timing the eclipse, re-emerging at the appropriate time. Convinced of the power of this God, the Jamaicans fell to their knees begging forgiveness. The stranded Europeans did not need anything again before their rescue six months later.</p>

            <p>The only total lunar (moon) eclipse of 2021 occurs this week and for families looking to enjoy the “Super Flower Blood Moon” eclipse, here’s everything you need to know.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>On May 26, there will be a total lunar eclipse. During a lunar eclipse, the Moon travels through Earth’s shadow as our planet is directly in between the sun and our moon. In a total lunar eclipse, the Moon is completely covered by the Earth’s shadow, while a partial lunar eclipse occurs when only a part of the Moon moves into Earth’s shadow. This eclipse will occur at the same time as a “super-moon,” an informal term that describes times when the full moon is at its closest point to Earth, making it look extra big and bright in the night sky. Depending on where you live, you will need to wake up early (America) or stay up late (Australia) to see the eclipse.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The Moon, so bright and large in the sky compared to other celestial objects, has captured the attention of humans at least since ancient times. Over these eras, mankind’s view of the Moon has changed, from the more mystical image of it as a god, to the thought it was covered in seas and vegetation. Most recently, it’s been viewed as a dry and dusty wasteland. Recent findings of water on the lunar surface could change the way we see our orbiting companion.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The Moon has even been blamed for some of the darker forces of human nature, such as temporary insanity. The term lunatic (and “loony”) comes from the Latin name for the Moon. Many criminal and insane behaviours were once blamed on the presence of a full moon. The full moon was also thought to change afflicted humans into fearsome werewolves, a mythological creature most common in European tales. Full moons and lunar eclipses were also seen by some cultures as bad omens.</p>

            <p>If you have looked into the night sky, you may have noticed the Moon appears to change shape each night. The different shapes of the Moon that we see are called the Moon’s&nbsp;<em><strong>phases</strong></em>.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Why does this happen? The shape of the Moon isn’t changing throughout the month. But our view of the Moon does change. The Moon does not produce its own light. There is only one source of light in our solar system, and that is the Sun. “Moonlight” is actually just sunlight reflecting off of the Moon’s surface. The Sun’s light comes from one direction, and it always illuminates, or lights up, one half of the Moon – the side of the Moon that is facing the Sun at that time. The other side of the Moon is dark. On Earth, our view of the shiny part of the Moon changes each night, depending on where the Moon is in its orbit around Earth. When we have a full view of the completely illuminated side of the Moon, that phase is known as a full moon. But following that, we start to see less of the Moon lit by the Sun each night. Eventually, the Moon reaches a point in its orbit when we don’t see any of the Moon illuminated. This phase is called a new moon.</p>

            <p>In 1504 the famous explorer, Christopher Columbus had been stranded with his men on the island of Jamaica. Columbus awaited rescue, but their food had run out, and the Jamaican tribesmen, who had been pleased to provision them when they first arrived, were tired of it.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Luckily Columbus had astronomical tables with him, which indicated a lunar eclipse was due on February 29. Calling the local chiefs together, Columbus unscrupulously tricked them by telling them that his God was all-powerful, and very displeased with the Jamaicans’ refusal to keep them fed, and as a sign of his anger the Moon would be darkened and turned the colour of blood that evening. Many of the natives laughed, but all were convinced when the eclipse began as Columbus had told them it would. To add to the effect, Columbus retired to his cabin, to consult with God and ask Him to withdraw His sign. In fact, he was timing the eclipse, re-emerging at the appropriate time. Convinced of the power of this God, the Jamaicans fell to their knees begging forgiveness. The stranded Europeans did not need anything again before their rescue six months later.</p>

            <p>The Moon, so bright and large in the sky compared to other celestial objects, has captured the attention of humans at least since ancient times. Over these eras, mankind’s view of the Moon has changed, from the more mystical image of it as a god, to the thought it was covered in seas and vegetation. Most recently, it’s been viewed as a dry and dusty wasteland. Recent findings of water on the lunar surface could change the way we see our orbiting companion.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The Moon has even been blamed for some of the darker forces of human nature, such as temporary insanity. The term lunatic (and “loony”) comes from the Latin name for the Moon. Many criminal and insane behaviours were once blamed on the presence of a full moon. The full moon was also thought to change afflicted humans into fearsome werewolves, a mythological creature most common in European tales. Full moons and lunar eclipses were also seen by some cultures as bad omens.</p>

            <p>If you have looked into the night sky, you may have noticed the Moon appears to change shape each night. The different shapes of the Moon that we see are called the Moon’s&nbsp;<em><strong>phases</strong></em>.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Why does this happen? The shape of the Moon isn’t changing throughout the month. But our view of the Moon does change. The Moon does not produce its own light. There is only one source of light in our solar system, and that is the Sun. “Moonlight” is actually just sunlight reflecting off of the Moon’s surface. The Sun’s light comes from one direction, and it always illuminates, or lights up, one half of the Moon – the side of the Moon that is facing the Sun at that time. The other side of the Moon is dark. On Earth, our view of the shiny part of the Moon changes each night, depending on where the Moon is in its orbit around Earth. When we have a full view of the completely illuminated side of the Moon, that phase is known as a full moon. But following that, we start to see less of the Moon lit by the Sun each night. Eventually, the Moon reaches a point in its orbit when we don’t see any of the Moon illuminated. This phase is called a new moon.</p>

            <p>In 1504 the famous explorer, Christopher Columbus had been stranded with his men on the island of Jamaica. Columbus awaited rescue, but their food had run out, and the Jamaican tribesmen, who had been pleased to provision them when they first arrived, were tired of it.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Luckily Columbus had astronomical tables with him, which indicated a lunar eclipse was due on February 29. Calling the local chiefs together, Columbus unscrupulously tricked them by telling them that his God was all-powerful, and very displeased with the Jamaicans’ refusal to keep them fed, and as a sign of his anger the Moon would be darkened and turned the colour of blood that evening. Many of the natives laughed, but all were convinced when the eclipse began as Columbus had told them it would. To add to the effect, Columbus retired to his cabin, to consult with God and ask Him to withdraw His sign. In fact, he was timing the eclipse, re-emerging at the appropriate time. Convinced of the power of this God, the Jamaicans fell to their knees begging forgiveness. The stranded Europeans did not need anything again before their rescue six months later.</p>

            <p>The only total lunar (moon) eclipse of 2021 occurs this week and for families looking to enjoy the “Super Flower Blood Moon” eclipse, here’s everything you need to know.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>On May 26, there will be a total lunar eclipse. During a lunar eclipse, the Moon travels through Earth’s shadow as our planet is directly in between the sun and our moon. In a total lunar eclipse, the Moon is completely covered by the Earth’s shadow, while a partial lunar eclipse occurs when only a part of the Moon moves into Earth’s shadow. This eclipse will occur at the same time as a “super-moon,” an informal term that describes times when the full moon is at its closest point to Earth, making it look extra big and bright in the night sky. Depending on where you live, you will need to wake up early (America) or stay up late (Australia) to see the eclipse.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The only total lunar (moon) eclipse of 2021 occurs this week and for families looking to enjoy the “Super Flower Blood Moon” eclipse, here’s everything you need to know.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>On May 26, there will be a total lunar eclipse. During a lunar eclipse, the Moon travels through Earth’s shadow as our planet is directly in between the sun and our moon. In a total lunar eclipse, the Moon is completely covered by the Earth’s shadow, while a partial lunar eclipse occurs when only a part of the Moon moves into Earth’s shadow. This eclipse will occur at the same time as a “super-moon,” an informal term that describes times when the full moon is at its closest point to Earth, making it look extra big and bright in the night sky. Depending on where you live, you will need to wake up early (America) or stay up late (Australia) to see the eclipse.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The Moon, so bright and large in the sky compared to other celestial objects, has captured the attention of humans at least since ancient times. Over these eras, mankind’s view of the Moon has changed, from the more mystical image of it as a god, to the thought it was covered in seas and vegetation. Most recently, it’s been viewed as a dry and dusty wasteland. Recent findings of water on the lunar surface could change the way we see our orbiting companion.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The Moon has even been blamed for some of the darker forces of human nature, such as temporary insanity. The term lunatic (and “loony”) comes from the Latin name for the Moon. Many criminal and insane behaviours were once blamed on the presence of a full moon. The full moon was also thought to change afflicted humans into fearsome werewolves, a mythological creature most common in European tales. Full moons and lunar eclipses were also seen by some cultures as bad omens.</p>

            <p>If you have looked into the night sky, you may have noticed the Moon appears to change shape each night. The different shapes of the Moon that we see are called the Moon’s&nbsp;<em><strong>phases</strong></em>.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Why does this happen? The shape of the Moon isn’t changing throughout the month. But our view of the Moon does change. The Moon does not produce its own light. There is only one source of light in our solar system, and that is the Sun. “Moonlight” is actually just sunlight reflecting off of the Moon’s surface. The Sun’s light comes from one direction, and it always illuminates, or lights up, one half of the Moon – the side of the Moon that is facing the Sun at that time. The other side of the Moon is dark. On Earth, our view of the shiny part of the Moon changes each night, depending on where the Moon is in its orbit around Earth. When we have a full view of the completely illuminated side of the Moon, that phase is known as a full moon. But following that, we start to see less of the Moon lit by the Sun each night. Eventually, the Moon reaches a point in its orbit when we don’t see any of the Moon illuminated. This phase is called a new moon.</p>

            <p>In 1504 the famous explorer, Christopher Columbus had been stranded with his men on the island of Jamaica. Columbus awaited rescue, but their food had run out, and the Jamaican tribesmen, who had been pleased to provision them when they first arrived, were tired of it.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Luckily Columbus had astronomical tables with him, which indicated a lunar eclipse was due on February 29. Calling the local chiefs together, Columbus unscrupulously tricked them by telling them that his God was all-powerful, and very displeased with the Jamaicans’ refusal to keep them fed, and as a sign of his anger the Moon would be darkened and turned the colour of blood that evening. Many of the natives laughed, but all were convinced when the eclipse began as Columbus had told them it would. To add to the effect, Columbus retired to his cabin, to consult with God and ask Him to withdraw His sign. In fact, he was timing the eclipse, re-emerging at the appropriate time. Convinced of the power of this God, the Jamaicans fell to their knees begging forgiveness. The stranded Europeans did not need anything again before their rescue six months later.</p>

            <p>In 1504 the famous explorer, Christopher Columbus had been stranded with his men on the island of Jamaica. Columbus awaited rescue, but their food had run out, and the Jamaican tribesmen, who had been pleased to provision them when they first arrived, were tired of it.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Luckily Columbus had astronomical tables with him, which indicated a lunar eclipse was due on February 29. Calling the local chiefs together, Columbus unscrupulously tricked them by telling them that his God was all-powerful, and very displeased with the Jamaicans’ refusal to keep them fed, and as a sign of his anger the Moon would be darkened and turned the colour of blood that evening. Many of the natives laughed, but all were convinced when the eclipse began as Columbus had told them it would. To add to the effect, Columbus retired to his cabin, to consult with God and ask Him to withdraw His sign. In fact, he was timing the eclipse, re-emerging at the appropriate time. Convinced of the power of this God, the Jamaicans fell to their knees begging forgiveness. The stranded Europeans did not need anything again before their rescue six months later.</p>

            <p>The only total lunar (moon) eclipse of 2021 occurs this week and for families looking to enjoy the “Super Flower Blood Moon” eclipse, here’s everything you need to know.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>On May 26, there will be a total lunar eclipse. During a lunar eclipse, the Moon travels through Earth’s shadow as our planet is directly in between the sun and our moon. In a total lunar eclipse, the Moon is completely covered by the Earth’s shadow, while a partial lunar eclipse occurs when only a part of the Moon moves into Earth’s shadow. This eclipse will occur at the same time as a “super-moon,” an informal term that describes times when the full moon is at its closest point to Earth, making it look extra big and bright in the night sky. Depending on where you live, you will need to wake up early (America) or stay up late (Australia) to see the eclipse.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The Moon, so bright and large in the sky compared to other celestial objects, has captured the attention of humans at least since ancient times. Over these eras, mankind’s view of the Moon has changed, from the more mystical image of it as a god, to the thought it was covered in seas and vegetation. Most recently, it’s been viewed as a dry and dusty wasteland. Recent findings of water on the lunar surface could change the way we see our orbiting companion.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The Moon has even been blamed for some of the darker forces of human nature, such as temporary insanity. The term lunatic (and “loony”) comes from the Latin name for the Moon. Many criminal and insane behaviours were once blamed on the presence of a full moon. The full moon was also thought to change afflicted humans into fearsome werewolves, a mythological creature most common in European tales. Full moons and lunar eclipses were also seen by some cultures as bad omens.</p>

            <p>If you have looked into the night sky, you may have noticed the Moon appears to change shape each night. The different shapes of the Moon that we see are called the Moon’s&nbsp;<em><strong>phases</strong></em>.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Why does this happen? The shape of the Moon isn’t changing throughout the month. But our view of the Moon does change. The Moon does not produce its own light. There is only one source of light in our solar system, and that is the Sun. “Moonlight” is actually just sunlight reflecting off of the Moon’s surface. The Sun’s light comes from one direction, and it always illuminates, or lights up, one half of the Moon – the side of the Moon that is facing the Sun at that time. The other side of the Moon is dark. On Earth, our view of the shiny part of the Moon changes each night, depending on where the Moon is in its orbit around Earth. When we have a full view of the completely illuminated side of the Moon, that phase is known as a full moon. But following that, we start to see less of the Moon lit by the Sun each night. Eventually, the Moon reaches a point in its orbit when we don’t see any of the Moon illuminated. This phase is called a new moon.</p>

            <p>The only total lunar (moon) eclipse of 2021 occurs this week and for families looking to enjoy the “Super Flower Blood Moon” eclipse, here’s everything you need to know.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>On May 26, there will be a total lunar eclipse. During a lunar eclipse, the Moon travels through Earth’s shadow as our planet is directly in between the sun and our moon. In a total lunar eclipse, the Moon is completely covered by the Earth’s shadow, while a partial lunar eclipse occurs when only a part of the Moon moves into Earth’s shadow. This eclipse will occur at the same time as a “super-moon,” an informal term that describes times when the full moon is at its closest point to Earth, making it look extra big and bright in the night sky. Depending on where you live, you will need to wake up early (America) or stay up late (Australia) to see the eclipse.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The Moon, so bright and large in the sky compared to other celestial objects, has captured the attention of humans at least since ancient times. Over these eras, mankind’s view of the Moon has changed, from the more mystical image of it as a god, to the thought it was covered in seas and vegetation. Most recently, it’s been viewed as a dry and dusty wasteland. Recent findings of water on the lunar surface could change the way we see our orbiting companion.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The Moon has even been blamed for some of the darker forces of human nature, such as temporary insanity. The term lunatic (and “loony”) comes from the Latin name for the Moon. Many criminal and insane behaviours were once blamed on the presence of a full moon. The full moon was also thought to change afflicted humans into fearsome werewolves, a mythological creature most common in European tales. Full moons and lunar eclipses were also seen by some cultures as bad omens.</p>

            <p>If you have looked into the night sky, you may have noticed the Moon appears to change shape each night. The different shapes of the Moon that we see are called the Moon’s&nbsp;<em><strong>phases</strong></em>.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Why does this happen? The shape of the Moon isn’t changing throughout the month. But our view of the Moon does change. The Moon does not produce its own light. There is only one source of light in our solar system, and that is the Sun. “Moonlight” is actually just sunlight reflecting off of the Moon’s surface. The Sun’s light comes from one direction, and it always illuminates, or lights up, one half of the Moon – the side of the Moon that is facing the Sun at that time. The other side of the Moon is dark. On Earth, our view of the shiny part of the Moon changes each night, depending on where the Moon is in its orbit around Earth. When we have a full view of the completely illuminated side of the Moon, that phase is known as a full moon. But following that, we start to see less of the Moon lit by the Sun each night. Eventually, the Moon reaches a point in its orbit when we don’t see any of the Moon illuminated. This phase is called a new moon.</p>

            <p>In 1504 the famous explorer, Christopher Columbus had been stranded with his men on the island of Jamaica. Columbus awaited rescue, but their food had run out, and the Jamaican tribesmen, who had been pleased to provision them when they first arrived, were tired of it.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The only total lunar (moon) eclipse of 2021 occurs this week and for families looking to enjoy the “Super Flower Blood Moon” eclipse, here’s everything you need to know.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>On May 26, there will be a total lunar eclipse. During a lunar eclipse, the Moon travels through Earth’s shadow as our planet is directly in between the sun and our moon. In a total lunar eclipse, the Moon is completely covered by the Earth’s shadow, while a partial lunar eclipse occurs when only a part of the Moon moves into Earth’s shadow. This eclipse will occur at the same time as a “super-moon,” an informal term that describes times when the full moon is at its closest point to Earth, making it look extra big and bright in the night sky. Depending on where you live, you will need to wake up early (America) or stay up late (Australia) to see the eclipse.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The Moon, so bright and large in the sky compared to other celestial objects, has captured the attention of humans at least since ancient times. Over these eras, mankind’s view of the Moon has changed, from the more mystical image of it as a god, to the thought it was covered in seas and vegetation. Most recently, it’s been viewed as a dry and dusty wasteland. Recent findings of water on the lunar surface could change the way we see our orbiting companion.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The Moon has even been blamed for some of the darker forces of human nature, such as temporary insanity. The term lunatic (and “loony”) comes from the Latin name for the Moon. Many criminal and insane behaviours were once blamed on the presence of a full moon. The full moon was also thought to change afflicted humans into fearsome werewolves, a mythological creature most common in European tales. Full moons and lunar eclipses were also seen by some cultures as bad omens.</p>

            <p>If you have looked into the night sky, you may have noticed the Moon appears to change shape each night. The different shapes of the Moon that we see are called the Moon’s&nbsp;<em><strong>phases</strong></em>.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Why does this happen? The shape of the Moon isn’t changing throughout the month. But our view of the Moon does change. The Moon does not produce its own light. There is only one source of light in our solar system, and that is the Sun. “Moonlight” is actually just sunlight reflecting off of the Moon’s surface. The Sun’s light comes from one direction, and it always illuminates, or lights up, one half of the Moon – the side of the Moon that is facing the Sun at that time. The other side of the Moon is dark. On Earth, our view of the shiny part of the Moon changes each night, depending on where the Moon is in its orbit around Earth. When we have a full view of the completely illuminated side of the Moon, that phase is known as a full moon. But following that, we start to see less of the Moon lit by the Sun each night. Eventually, the Moon reaches a point in its orbit when we don’t see any of the Moon illuminated. This phase is called a new moon.</p>

            <p>In 1504 the famous explorer, Christopher Columbus had been stranded with his men on the island of Jamaica. Columbus awaited rescue, but their food had run out, and the Jamaican tribesmen, who had been pleased to provision them when they first arrived, were tired of it.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Luckily Columbus had astronomical tables with him, which indicated a lunar eclipse was due on February 29. Calling the local chiefs together, Columbus unscrupulously tricked them by telling them that his God was all-powerful, and very displeased with the Jamaicans’ refusal to keep them fed, and as a sign of his anger the Moon would be darkened and turned the colour of blood that evening. Many of the natives laughed, but all were convinced when the eclipse began as Columbus had told them it would. To add to the effect, Columbus retired to his cabin, to consult with God and ask Him to withdraw His sign. In fact, he was timing the eclipse, re-emerging at the appropriate time. Convinced of the power of this God, the Jamaicans fell to their knees begging forgiveness. The stranded Europeans did not need anything again before their rescue six months later.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>On May 26, there will be a total lunar eclipse. During a lunar eclipse, the Moon travels through Earth’s shadow as our planet is directly in between the sun and our moon. In a total lunar eclipse, the Moon is completely covered by the Earth’s shadow, while a partial lunar eclipse occurs when only a part of the Moon moves into Earth’s shadow. This eclipse will occur at the same time as a “super-moon,” an informal term that describes times when the full moon is at its closest point to Earth, making it look extra big and bright in the night sky. Depending on where you live, you will need to wake up early (America) or stay up late (Australia) to see the eclipse.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The Moon, so bright and large in the sky compared to other celestial objects, has captured the attention of humans at least since ancient times. Over these eras, mankind’s view of the Moon has changed, from the more mystical image of it as a god, to the thought it was covered in seas and vegetation. Most recently, it’s been viewed as a dry and dusty wasteland. Recent findings of water on the lunar surface could change the way we see our orbiting companion.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The Moon has even been blamed for some of the darker forces of human nature, such as temporary insanity. The term lunatic (and “loony”) comes from the Latin name for the Moon. Many criminal and insane behaviours were once blamed on the presence of a full moon. The full moon was also thought to change afflicted humans into fearsome werewolves, a mythological creature most common in European tales. Full moons and lunar eclipses were also seen by some cultures as bad omens.</p>

            <p>If you have looked into the night sky, you may have noticed the Moon appears to change shape each night. The different shapes of the Moon that we see are called the Moon’s&nbsp;<em><strong>phases</strong></em>.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Why does this happen? The shape of the Moon isn’t changing throughout the month. But our view of the Moon does change. The Moon does not produce its own light. There is only one source of light in our solar system, and that is the Sun. “Moonlight” is actually just sunlight reflecting off of the Moon’s surface. The Sun’s light comes from one direction, and it always illuminates, or lights up, one half of the Moon – the side of the Moon that is facing the Sun at that time. The other side of the Moon is dark. On Earth, our view of the shiny part of the Moon changes each night, depending on where the Moon is in its orbit around Earth. When we have a full view of the completely illuminated side of the Moon, that phase is known as a full moon. But following that, we start to see less of the Moon lit by the Sun each night. Eventually, the Moon reaches a point in its orbit when we don’t see any of the Moon illuminated. This phase is called a new moon.</p>

            <p>In 1504 the famous explorer, Christopher Columbus had been stranded with his men on the island of Jamaica. Columbus awaited rescue, but their food had run out, and the Jamaican tribesmen, who had been pleased to provision them when they first arrived, were tired of it.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Luckily Columbus had astronomical tables with him, which indicated a lunar eclipse was due on February 29. Calling the local chiefs together, Columbus unscrupulously tricked them by telling them that his God was all-powerful, and very displeased with the Jamaicans’ refusal to keep them fed, and as a sign of his anger the Moon would be darkened and turned the colour of blood that evening. Many of the natives laughed, but all were convinced when the eclipse began as Columbus had told them it would. To add to the effect, Columbus retired to his cabin, to consult with God and ask Him to withdraw His sign. In fact, he was timing the eclipse, re-emerging at the appropriate time. Convinced of the power of this God, the Jamaicans fell to their knees begging forgiveness. The stranded Europeans did not need anything again before their rescue six months later.</p>

          <strong>Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>by J. K. Rowling&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon’s car and crushed it into a trash can -- but at the moment it didn’t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils. “Make it move,” he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn’t budge. “Do it again,” Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on. “This is boring,” Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn’t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself – no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry’s. It winked. Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren’t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: “I get that all the time.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I know,” Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn’t sure the snake could hear him. “It must be really annoying.” The snake nodded vigorously. “Where do you come from, anyway?” Harry asked. The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it. Boa Constrictor, Brazil. “Was it nice there?” The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. “Oh, I see -- so you’ve never been to Brazil?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of&nbsp;them jump. “DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU&nbsp;WON’T BELIEVE WHAT IT’S DOING!”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dudley came <strong><span class="txt-underline">waddling</span></strong>&nbsp;toward them as fast as he could. “Out of the way, you,” he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened -- one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor’s tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits. As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, “Brazil, here I come.... Thanksss, amigo.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. “But the glass,” he kept saying, “where did the glass go?” The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologised over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn’t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, “Harry was talking to it, weren’t you, Harry?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, “Go -- cupboard -- stay -- no meals,” before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.</p>

          <strong>Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>by J. K. Rowling&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon’s car and crushed it into a trash can -- but at the moment it didn’t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils. “Make it move,” he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn’t budge. “Do it again,” Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on. “This is boring,” Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn’t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself – no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry’s. It winked. Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren’t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: “I get that all the time.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I know,” Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn’t sure the snake could hear him. “It must be really annoying.” The snake nodded vigorously. “Where do you come from, anyway?” Harry asked. The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it. Boa Constrictor, Brazil. “Was it nice there?” The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. “Oh, I see -- so you’ve never been to Brazil?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of&nbsp;them jump. “DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU&nbsp;WON’T BELIEVE WHAT IT’S DOING!”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dudley came <strong><span class="txt-underline">waddling</span></strong>&nbsp;toward them as fast as he could. “Out of the way, you,” he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened -- one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor’s tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits. As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, “Brazil, here I come.... Thanksss, amigo.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. “But the glass,” he kept saying, “where did the glass go?” The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologised over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn’t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, “Harry was talking to it, weren’t you, Harry?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, “Go -- cupboard -- stay -- no meals,” before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.</p>
