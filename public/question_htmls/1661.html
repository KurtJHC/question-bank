Step right up to see The Greatest Showman which hit theatres Dec. 20 after seven years in development. In a series of whimsical and colourful musical numbers, The Greatest Showman brings the menagerie of P.T. Barnum's travelling three-ring circus to life on the big screen. The musical biopic was inspired by the imagination and innovation of Phineas Taylor Barnum, who "helped invent show business," according to Hugh Jackman. Loosely based on the real-life visionary, the film shows how Barnum (Jackman), a family man, turned his misfortune into a world of mystique and magic that would become the "Greatest Show on Earth." The release of the film seems timely after the Ringling Bros. Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus broke down its wonder-filled tents for the last time in May.<br>

{^ <strong>Extract B</strong> ^}<br>
The concession stand in the centre of the tent had been flattened, and in its place was a roiling mass of spots and stripes—of haunches, heels, tails, and claws, all of it roaring, screeching, bellowing, or whinnying. A polar bear towered above it all, slashing blindly with skillet-sized paws. It made contact with a llama and knocked it flat—BOOM. The llama hit the ground, its neck and legs splayed like the five points of a star. Chimps screamed and chattered, swinging on ropes to stay above the cats. A wild-eyed zebra zigzagged too close to a crouching lion, who swiped, missed, and darted away, his belly close to the ground.<br>
<br>
My eyes swept the tent, desperate to find Marlena. Instead I saw a cat slide through the connection leading to the big top—it was a panther, and as its lithe black body disappeared into the canvas tunnel I braced myself. If the rubes didn't know, they were about to find out. It took several seconds to come, but come it did—one prolonged shriek followed by another, and then another, and then the whole place exploded with the thunderous sound of bodies trying to shove past other bodies and off the stands. The band screeched to a halt for a second time, and this time stayed silent. I shut my eyes: Please God let them leave by the back end. Please God don't let them try to come through here.<br>

In circuses, animals are made to perform unnatural tricks which no individual would willingly carry out.<br>
<br>
Elephants are made to stand on one leg and spin in circles – often while standing on top of small stools. These are actions elephants have never been observed carrying out in the wild precisely because they cause long-term damage to the animals’ physiology.<br>
<br>
It is well documented that elephants are forced to perform these actions by being beaten with bullhooks, while young elephants are savagely constrained and beaten in a process known as “the crush”, which breaks their spirit and forces them to comply.<br>
<br>
Big cats are popular in the circus, but many have their teeth and claws removed rendering them harmless to their abusers. They are “trained” with whips which teach them to fear the ringmaster and not attack.<br>
<br>
Our investigations in Asia have uncovered moon bears riding motorbikes, macaques riding dogs and orangutans spinning plates. These actions are so unnatural that no animal can be encouraged or instructed to carry them out – they must be forced. Initially this is done with violence, then with the promise of food. As a result, many circus animals are also underfed to keep them hungry and eager to please.<br>

Eight camels and a llama were found walking the streets of Madrid in the early hours of Friday after escaping from a circus, police said. Quiros Circus, their owner, blamed "sabotage" by animal rights activists. They were spotted at about 05:00 local time in the southern district of Carabranchel, near where the circus is based. Officers took care of them so they could be returned "safe and sound", police said.<br>
<br>
Circus manager Mati Munoz told AFP that the electric fence around the animals' enclosure had been cut. He pointed the finger at activists who he said protested against the circus every year. He said he was relieved the llama and Bactrian camels, which have two humps and thick shaggy coats, had been found. "Nothing happened, thank God," he said. Bactrian camels originally came from the deserts of central and eastern Asia and can survive in extreme conditions. However, the majority of them are now domesticated.<br>

Step right up to see The Greatest Showman which hit theatres Dec. 20 after seven years in development. In a series of whimsical and colourful musical numbers, The Greatest Showman brings the menagerie of P.T. Barnum's travelling three-ring circus to life on the big screen. The musical biopic was inspired by the imagination and innovation of Phineas Taylor Barnum, who "helped invent show business," according to Hugh Jackman. Loosely based on the real-life visionary, the film shows how Barnum (Jackman), a family man, turned his misfortune into a world of mystique and magic that would become the "Greatest Show on Earth." The release of the film seems timely after the Ringling Bros. Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus broke down its wonder-filled tents for the last time in May.<br>

{^ <strong>Extract B</strong> ^}<br>
The concession stand in the centre of the tent had been flattened, and in its place was a roiling mass of spots and stripes—of haunches, heels, tails, and claws, all of it roaring, screeching, bellowing, or whinnying. A polar bear towered above it all, slashing blindly with skillet-sized paws. It made contact with a llama and knocked it flat—BOOM. The llama hit the ground, its neck and legs splayed like the five points of a star. Chimps screamed and chattered, swinging on ropes to stay above the cats. A wild-eyed zebra zigzagged too close to a crouching lion, who swiped, missed, and darted away, his belly close to the ground.<br>
<br>
My eyes swept the tent, desperate to find Marlena. Instead I saw a cat slide through the connection leading to the big top—it was a panther, and as its lithe black body disappeared into the canvas tunnel I braced myself. If the rubes didn't know, they were about to find out. It took several seconds to come, but come it did—one prolonged shriek followed by another, and then another, and then the whole place exploded with the thunderous sound of bodies trying to shove past other bodies and off the stands. The band screeched to a halt for a second time, and this time stayed silent. I shut my eyes: Please God let them leave by the back end. Please God don't let them try to come through here.<br>

In circuses, animals are made to perform unnatural tricks which no individual would willingly carry out.<br>
<br>
Elephants are made to stand on one leg and spin in circles – often while standing on top of small stools. These are actions elephants have never been observed carrying out in the wild precisely because they cause long-term damage to the animals’ physiology.<br>
<br>
It is well documented that elephants are forced to perform these actions by being beaten with bullhooks, while young elephants are savagely constrained and beaten in a process known as “the crush”, which breaks their spirit and forces them to comply.<br>
<br>
Big cats are popular in the circus, but many have their teeth and claws removed rendering them harmless to their abusers. They are “trained” with whips which teach them to fear the ringmaster and not attack.<br>
<br>
Our investigations in Asia have uncovered moon bears riding motorbikes, macaques riding dogs and orangutans spinning plates. These actions are so unnatural that no animal can be encouraged or instructed to carry them out – they must be forced. Initially this is done with violence, then with the promise of food. As a result, many circus animals are also underfed to keep them hungry and eager to please.<br>

Eight camels and a llama were found walking the streets of Madrid in the early hours of Friday after escaping from a circus, police said. Quiros Circus, their owner, blamed "sabotage" by animal rights activists. They were spotted at about 05:00 local time in the southern district of Carabranchel, near where the circus is based. Officers took care of them so they could be returned "safe and sound", police said.<br>
<br>
Circus manager Mati Munoz told AFP that the electric fence around the animals' enclosure had been cut. He pointed the finger at activists who he said protested against the circus every year. He said he was relieved the llama and Bactrian camels, which have two humps and thick shaggy coats, had been found. "Nothing happened, thank God," he said. Bactrian camels originally came from the deserts of central and eastern Asia and can survive in extreme conditions. However, the majority of them are now domesticated.<br>
