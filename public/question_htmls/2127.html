        <p><em>Read the text below and answer the questions that follow.</em><br><br><strong>Tthe Car</strong><br><br>
I had a new car. It was an exciting toy, a big BMW 3.3 Li, which means 3.3 litre, long wheelbase, fuel injection. It had a top speed of 129 mph and terrific acceleration. The body was pale blue. The seats inside were darker blue and they were made of leather, genuine soft leather of the finest quality. The windows were electrically operated and so was the sunroof. The radio aerial popped up when I switched on the radio, and disappeared when I switched it off. The powerful engine growled and grunted impatiently at slow speeds, but at sixty miles an hour the growling stopped and the motor began to purr with pleasure… I was whispering along at 70 mph, leaning back comfortably in my seat, with no more than a couple of fingers resting lightly on the wheel to keep her steady. Ahead of me I saw a man thumbing a lift. I touched the brake and brought the car to a stop beside him …………………</p>
        <p>We came out of the circle onto the highway and I pressed my foot hard down on the accelerator. The big car leaped forward as though she'd been stung. In ten seconds or so, we were doing ninety.</p>
        <p>"Lovely!" he [the hitchhiker] cried. "Beautiful! Keep goin’!" I had the accelerator jammed right down against the floor and I held it there. "One hundred!" he shouted. "A hundred and five! A hundred and ten! A hundred and fifteen! Go on! Don't slack off!" &nbsp;</p>
        <p>I was in the outside lane and we flashed past several cars as though they were standing still.</p>
        <p><strong>The Policeman</strong><br>
The cop got off his motorcycle and leaned the machine sideways onto its prop stand. Then he took off his gloves and placed them carefully on the seat. He was in no hurry now. He had us where he wanted us and he knew it… Like an executioner approaching his victim, the cop came strolling slowly toward us. He was a big meaty man with a belly, and his blue breeches were skin-tight around his enormous thighs. His goggles were pulled up onto the helmet showing a smouldering red face with wide cheeks. We sat there like guilty schoolboys, waiting for him to arrive,&nbsp;"Watch out for this man," my passenger whispered, 'e looks mean as the devil."&nbsp;<br>
The cop came around to my open window and placed one meaty hand on the sill…</p>
        <p>"You've got yourself into a nasty mess, haven't you? Do you know what the speed limit is in this country?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Seventy,” I said.</p>
        <p>"And do you mind telling me exactly what speed you were doing just now?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I shrugged and didn't say anything. When he spoke next, he raised his voice so loud that I jumped.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"One hundred and twenty miles per hour!" he barked. "That's fifty miles an hour over the limit!" He turned his head and spat out a big gob of spit. It landed on the wing of my car and started sliding down over my beautiful blue paint. Then he turned back again and stared hard at my passenger.</p>
        <p>"And who are you?" he asked sharply.<br>
