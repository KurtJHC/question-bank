        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><br>
Leonardo da Vinci was born on 15 April 1452 near the Tuscan town of Vinci, the illegitimate son of a local lawyer. He was apprenticed to the sculptor and painter Andrea del Verrocchio in Florence and in 1478 became an independent master. In about 1483, he moved to Milan to work for the ruling Sforza family as an engineer, sculptor, painter and architect. From 1495 to 1497 he produced a mural of 'The Last Supper' in the refectory of the Monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie, Milan.</p>
        <p>The fame of Da Vinci's surviving paintings has meant that he has been regarded primarily as an artist, but the thousands of surviving pages of his notebooks reveal the most eclectic and brilliant of minds. He wrote and drew on subjects including geology, anatomy (which he studied in order to paint the human form more accurately), flight, gravity and optics, often flitting from subject to subject on a single page, and writing in left-handed mirror script. He 'invented' the bicycle, airplane, helicopter, and parachute some 500 years ahead of their time.</p>
        <p>If all this work had been published in an intelligible form, da Vinci's place as a pioneering scientist would have been beyond dispute. Yet his true genius was not as a scientist or an artist, but as a combination of the two: an 'artist-engineer'. His painting was scientific, based on a deep understanding of the workings of the human body and the physics of light and shade. His science was expressed through art, and his drawings and diagrams show what he meant, and how he understood the world to work.</p>

          <strong>The Never-Ending Daylight Savings Time (DST) Debate</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Daylight Saving Time&nbsp;(DST) has been used for more than 100 years. But do the pros really outweigh the cons?</p>
        <p>According to a 2014&nbsp;Rasmussen Report, only 33% of Americans see the purpose of DST. So why do&nbsp;more than 70 countries&nbsp;in the world still use DST today?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Pro: Longer Evenings</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Changing the clocks does not create extra daylight, but it causes the sun to&nbsp;rise and set&nbsp;at a later time by the clock. So, when we&nbsp;jump&nbsp;an hour in spring, we add one hour of natural daylight to our afternoon.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Proponents of DST argue that longer evenings motivate people to get out of the house. The extra hour of daylight can be used for outdoor recreation like golf, soccer, baseball, running, etc. That way, DST may counteract the sedentary lifestyle of modern living.</li>
          <li>The&nbsp;tourism industry&nbsp;profits from brighter evenings. Longer nights give people more time to go shopping, to restaurants, or other events, boosting the local economy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Con: Doesn't Save Energy</strong>
        </p>
        <p>A century ago, when&nbsp;DST was introduced, more daylight was a good thing because it meant less use of artificial light, helping to save energy. Modern society, with its computers, TV-screens, and air conditioning units uses more energy, no matter if the Sun is up or not. Today, the amount of energy saved from DST is&nbsp;negligible.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Pro: Less Artificial Light</strong>
        </p>
        <p>One of the aims of DST is to make sure that peoples’ active hours coincide with daylight hours so that less artificial light is needed. This makes less sense close to the equator where the amount of daylight does not vary much in a year, or near the poles where the difference between winter and summer daylight hours is very large.</p>
        <p>However, at&nbsp;latitudes&nbsp;between these extremes, adjusting daily routines to the shifting day length during summer may indeed help to save energy. A German analysis of 44 studies on energy use and DST found a positive relationship between&nbsp;latitude and energy savings.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Con: Can Make People Sick</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Changing the time, even if it is only by one hour, disrupts our body clocks or circadian rhythm. For most people, the resulting tiredness is simply an inconvenience. For some, however, the time change can have more&nbsp;serious consequences.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Studies link the lack of sleep at the start of DST to&nbsp;car accidents,&nbsp;workplace injuries,&nbsp;suicide, and&nbsp;miscarriages.</li>
          <li>The early evening darkness after the end of the DST period is linked to&nbsp;depression.</li>
          <li>The risk of suffering a&nbsp;heart attack&nbsp;is also increased when DST begins. However, the extra hour of sleep we get at the end of DST has in turn been linked to&nbsp;fewer heart attacks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, based on these reasons, why do more than 70 countries in the world continue to use DST?</p>

          <strong>The Never-Ending Daylight Savings Time (DST) Debate</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Daylight Saving Time&nbsp;(DST) has been used for more than 100 years. But do the pros really outweigh the cons?</p>
        <p>According to a 2014&nbsp;Rasmussen Report, only 33% of Americans see the purpose of DST. So why do&nbsp;more than 70 countries&nbsp;in the world still use DST today?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Pro: Longer Evenings</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Changing the clocks does not create extra daylight, but it causes the sun to&nbsp;rise and set&nbsp;at a later time by the clock. So, when we&nbsp;jump&nbsp;an hour in spring, we add one hour of natural daylight to our afternoon.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Proponents of DST argue that longer evenings motivate people to get out of the house. The extra hour of daylight can be used for outdoor recreation like golf, soccer, baseball, running, etc. That way, DST may counteract the sedentary lifestyle of modern living.</li>
          <li>The&nbsp;tourism industry&nbsp;profits from brighter evenings. Longer nights give people more time to go shopping, to restaurants, or other events, boosting the local economy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Con: Doesn't Save Energy</strong>
        </p>
        <p>A century ago, when&nbsp;DST was introduced, more daylight was a good thing because it meant less use of artificial light, helping to save energy. Modern society, with its computers, TV-screens, and air conditioning units uses more energy, no matter if the Sun is up or not. Today, the amount of energy saved from DST is&nbsp;negligible.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Pro: Less Artificial Light</strong>
        </p>
        <p>One of the aims of DST is to make sure that peoples’ active hours coincide with daylight hours so that less artificial light is needed. This makes less sense close to the equator where the amount of daylight does not vary much in a year, or near the poles where the difference between winter and summer daylight hours is very large.</p>
        <p>However, at&nbsp;latitudes&nbsp;between these extremes, adjusting daily routines to the shifting day length during summer may indeed help to save energy. A German analysis of 44 studies on energy use and DST found a positive relationship between&nbsp;latitude and energy savings.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Con: Can Make People Sick</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Changing the time, even if it is only by one hour, disrupts our body clocks or circadian rhythm. For most people, the resulting tiredness is simply an inconvenience. For some, however, the time change can have more&nbsp;serious consequences.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Studies link the lack of sleep at the start of DST to&nbsp;car accidents,&nbsp;workplace injuries,&nbsp;suicide, and&nbsp;miscarriages.</li>
          <li>The early evening darkness after the end of the DST period is linked to&nbsp;depression.</li>
          <li>The risk of suffering a&nbsp;heart attack&nbsp;is also increased when DST begins. However, the extra hour of sleep we get at the end of DST has in turn been linked to&nbsp;fewer heart attacks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, based on these reasons, why do more than 70 countries in the world continue to use DST?</p>

          <strong>The Never-Ending Daylight Savings Time (DST) Debate</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Daylight Saving Time&nbsp;(DST) has been used for more than 100 years. But do the pros really outweigh the cons?</p>
        <p>According to a 2014&nbsp;Rasmussen Report, only 33% of Americans see the purpose of DST. So why do&nbsp;more than 70 countries&nbsp;in the world still use DST today?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Pro: Longer Evenings</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Changing the clocks does not create extra daylight, but it causes the sun to&nbsp;rise and set&nbsp;at a later time by the clock. So, when we&nbsp;jump&nbsp;an hour in spring, we add one hour of natural daylight to our afternoon.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Proponents of DST argue that longer evenings motivate people to get out of the house. The extra hour of daylight can be used for outdoor recreation like golf, soccer, baseball, running, etc. That way, DST may counteract the sedentary lifestyle of modern living.</li>
          <li>The&nbsp;tourism industry&nbsp;profits from brighter evenings. Longer nights give people more time to go shopping, to restaurants, or other events, boosting the local economy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Con: Doesn't Save Energy</strong>
        </p>
        <p>A century ago, when&nbsp;DST was introduced, more daylight was a good thing because it meant less use of artificial light, helping to save energy. Modern society, with its computers, TV-screens, and air conditioning units uses more energy, no matter if the Sun is up or not. Today, the amount of energy saved from DST is&nbsp;negligible.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Pro: Less Artificial Light</strong>
        </p>
        <p>One of the aims of DST is to make sure that peoples’ active hours coincide with daylight hours so that less artificial light is needed. This makes less sense close to the equator where the amount of daylight does not vary much in a year, or near the poles where the difference between winter and summer daylight hours is very large.</p>
        <p>However, at&nbsp;latitudes&nbsp;between these extremes, adjusting daily routines to the shifting day length during summer may indeed help to save energy. A German analysis of 44 studies on energy use and DST found a positive relationship between&nbsp;latitude and energy savings.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Con: Can Make People Sick</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Changing the time, even if it is only by one hour, disrupts our body clocks or circadian rhythm. For most people, the resulting tiredness is simply an inconvenience. For some, however, the time change can have more&nbsp;serious consequences.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Studies link the lack of sleep at the start of DST to&nbsp;car accidents,&nbsp;workplace injuries,&nbsp;suicide, and&nbsp;miscarriages.</li>
          <li>The early evening darkness after the end of the DST period is linked to&nbsp;depression.</li>
          <li>The risk of suffering a&nbsp;heart attack&nbsp;is also increased when DST begins. However, the extra hour of sleep we get at the end of DST has in turn been linked to&nbsp;fewer heart attacks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, based on these reasons, why do more than 70 countries in the world continue to use DST?</p>

        <p><em>A&nbsp;woman describes the changes she and her husband are facing as he battles depression.</em> When everything seemed like it was going to completely fall apart, things started to fall back together again when I least expected it. My husband has been battling depression for almost 2 years now and it certainly has changed everything in our lives. It’s changed our lifestyle, our finances, our responsibilities, our relationships. The first year he started going to the clinic was especially hard. It felt like we would never see the light at the end of the tunnel. There were no improvements and it just felt too hard to keep going when you don’t see the fruits.</p>
        <p>But, for some reason, he kept going back and followed through with the treatments. I can see that there have been little changes in him the last few months; he seemed much happier and more alive than he has been in a long time. I know that it’s been a difficult battle for him and all of us but I think it was so brave of him and I’m thankful that he decided to keep trying.</p>

        <p><em>A</em>&nbsp;<em>woman describes the changes she and her husband are facing as he battles depression.</em>&nbsp;When everything seemed like it was going to completely fall apart, things started to fall back together again when I least expected it. My husband has been battling depression for almost 2 years now and it certainly has changed everything in our lives. It’s changed our lifestyle, our finances, our responsibilities, our relationships. The first year he started going to the clinic was especially hard. It felt like we would never see the light at the end of the tunnel. There were no improvements and it just felt too hard to keep going when you don’t see the fruits.</p>
        <p>But, for some reason, he kept going back and followed through with the treatments. I can see that there have been little changes in him the last few months; he seemed much happier and more alive than he has been in a long time. I know that it’s been a difficult battle for him and all of us but I think it was so brave of him and I’m thankful that he decided to keep trying.</p>

        <p>“What I’m feeling, I think, is joy. And it’s been some time since I’ve felt that blinkered rush of happiness. This might be one of those rare events that lasts, one that’ll be remembered and recalled as months and years wind and ravel. One of those sweet, significant moments that leaves a footprint in your mind. A photograph couldn’t ever tell its story. It’s like something you have to live to understand. One of those freak collisions of fizzing meteors and looming celestial bodies and floating debris and one single beautiful red ball that bursts into your life and through your body like an enormous firework. Where things shift into focus for a moment, and everything makes sense. And it becomes one of those things inside you, a pearl among sludge, one of those big exaggerated memories you can invoke at any moment to peel away a little layer of how you felt, like a lick of ice cream.”</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“What I’m feeling, I think, is joy. And it’s been some time since I’ve felt that blinkered rush of happiness. This might be one of those rare events that lasts, one that’ll be remembered and recalled as months and years wind and ravel. One of those sweet, significant moments that leaves a footprint in your mind. A photograph couldn’t ever tell its story. It’s like something you have to live to understand. One of those freak collisions of fizzing meteors and looming celestial bodies and floating debris and one single beautiful red ball that bursts into your life and through your body like an enormous firework. Where things shift into focus for a moment, and everything makes sense. And it becomes one of those things inside you, a pearl among sludge, one of those big exaggerated memories you can invoke at any moment to peel away a little layer of how you felt, like a lick of ice cream.”</p>

          <strong>• What role does the media play in brand loyalty?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>The agency “The Kids Group” analysed, among other things, the attitudes of children and parents towards brand loyalty. More than 500 children under the age of 14 and more than 1,100 parents took part. First, the experts looked into the question of where children get to know brands. At kindergarten age, television is the most important source with a good 50 percent. For many brands – whether from the toy, food or clothing industry – it is therefore important&nbsp;to advertise on television. When young customers of primary or secondary school age have access to the Internet, this digital medium becomes increasingly important for getting to know brands. At the age of twelve, the World Wide Web has overtaken television in terms of encouraging brand loyalty.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>•&nbsp;Prominent advocates are becoming increasingly important in adolescence</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Closely related persons also play a major role in brand loyalty. Even at kindergarten age, boys and girls get to know new products much more often through their friends than at home. At primary school age, friends are becoming more and more important. When the children are 14 years old, celebrities and stars have the same level of influence as their parents. It is therefore particularly important for manufacturers of children’s products and toys to convince parents of their offers. On the threshold to puberty, on the other hand, it is important to focus more on cooperation with prominent advocates.&nbsp;Influencers and social media channels are becoming increasingly important here. According to the study, almost 80 percent of children between the ages of 11 and 14 use YouTube for information.</p>
