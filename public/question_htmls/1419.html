<strong>The Railway Children</strong><br>
<br>
by Edith Nesbit<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When they had finished singing, they cried, “Three cheers for our Bobbie!” and said them very loudly. Bobbie felt exactly as though she were going to cry — you know that odd feeling in the bridge of your nose and the pricking in your eyelids? But before she had time to begin, they were all kissing and hugging her.<br>
<br>
“Now,” said Mother, “look at your presents.” They were very nice presents. There was a green and red needle-book that Phyllis had made herself in secret moments. There was a darling little silver brooch of Mother's shaped like a buttercup, which Bobbie had known and loved for years, but which she had never, never thought would come to be her very own. There was also a pair of blue glass vases from Mrs. Viney. Roberta had seen and admired them in the village shop. And there were three birthday cards with pretty pictures and wishes. Mother fitted the forget-me-not crown on Bobbie's brown head. “And now look at the table,” she said. There was a cake on the table covered with white sugar, with 'Dear Bobbie' on it in pink sweets, and there were buns and jam; but the nicest thing was that the big table was almost covered with flowers — wallflowers were laid all around the tea-tray — there was a ring of forget-me-nots round each plate. The cake had a wreath of white lilac round it, and in the middle was something that looked like a pattern all done with single blooms of lilac and wall-flower and laburnum. “It's a map — a map of the railway!” cried Peter. “Look — those lilac lines are the metals — and there's the station done in brown wallflowers. The lilac is the train, and there are the signal-boxes, and the road up to here — and those fat red daisies are us three waving to the old gentleman — that's him, the pansy in the laburnum train.” “And there's 'Three Chimneys' done in the purple primroses,” said Phyllis. “And that little, tiny rose-bud is Mother looking out for us when we're late for tea. Peter invented it all, and we got all the flowers from the station. We thought you'd like it better.” “That's my present,” said Peter, suddenly dumping down his adored train engine on the table in front of her. Its tender* had been lined with fresh white paper and was full of sweets. [tender - a rail truck linked to the engine carrying coal to heat the steam boiler] “Oh, Peter!” cried Bobbie, quite overcome by this munificence, “not your own dear little engine that you're so fond of?” “Oh, no,” said Peter, very promptly, “not the engine. Only the sweets.” Bobbie couldn't help her face changing a little — not so much because she was disappointed at not getting the engine, as because she had thought it so very noble of Peter, and now she felt she had been silly to think it. Also, she felt she must have seemed greedy to expect the engine as well as the sweets. So her face changed. Peter saw it.</div>

<strong>The Railway Children</strong><br>
<br>
by Edith Nesbit<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When they had finished singing, they cried, “Three cheers for our Bobbie!” and said them very loudly. Bobbie felt exactly as though she were going to cry — you know that odd feeling in the bridge of your nose and the pricking in your eyelids? But before she had time to begin, they were all kissing and hugging her.<br>
<br>
“Now,” said Mother, “look at your presents.” They were very nice presents. There was a green and red needle-book that Phyllis had made herself in secret moments. There was a darling little silver brooch of Mother's shaped like a buttercup, which Bobbie had known and loved for years, but which she had never, never thought would come to be her very own. There was also a pair of blue glass vases from Mrs. Viney. Roberta had seen and admired them in the village shop. And there were three birthday cards with pretty pictures and wishes. Mother fitted the forget-me-not crown on Bobbie's brown head. “And now look at the table,” she said. There was a cake on the table covered with white sugar, with 'Dear Bobbie' on it in pink sweets, and there were buns and jam; but the nicest thing was that the big table was almost covered with flowers — wallflowers were laid all around the tea-tray — there was a ring of forget-me-nots round each plate. The cake had a wreath of white lilac round it, and in the middle was something that looked like a pattern all done with single blooms of lilac and wall-flower and laburnum. “It's a map — a map of the railway!” cried Peter. “Look — those lilac lines are the metals — and there's the station done in brown wallflowers. The lilac is the train, and there are the signal-boxes, and the road up to here — and those fat red daisies are us three waving to the old gentleman — that's him, the pansy in the laburnum train.” “And there's 'Three Chimneys' done in the purple primroses,” said Phyllis. “And that little, tiny rose-bud is Mother looking out for us when we're late for tea. Peter invented it all, and we got all the flowers from the station. We thought you'd like it better.” “That's my present,” said Peter, suddenly dumping down his adored train engine on the table in front of her. Its tender* had been lined with fresh white paper and was full of sweets. [tender - a rail truck linked to the engine carrying coal to heat the steam boiler] “Oh, Peter!” cried Bobbie, quite overcome by this munificence, “not your own dear little engine that you're so fond of?” “Oh, no,” said Peter, very promptly, “not the engine. Only the sweets.” Bobbie couldn't help her face changing a little — not so much because she was disappointed at not getting the engine, as because she had thought it so very noble of Peter, and now she felt she had been silly to think it. Also, she felt she must have seemed greedy to expect the engine as well as the sweets. So her face changed. Peter saw it.</div>

        <p>[^cstable^]It is time to change the meaning of the word “love”. The word is mostly used according to the definition given in the dictionary: “an intense feeling of deep affection”. In other words, love is what one feels. But love should be seen not as a feeling but as an enacted emotion. To love is to feel <span class="txt-underline"><strong>and</strong></span> to act lovingly.[^/cstable^]<br>
<br>
<strong>Ariana</strong>: “So the words of the song that say ‘Don’t talk to me of love; show me!’ has a clear idea of what love really is.”<br>
<br>
<strong>Jackson</strong>: “‘Love is like the wind. You can’t see it, but you can feel it.’ What you are telling me is that this quote is quite true.”<br>

It’s good for you to learn how to drive now because you might become even busier after graduating. Learning how to drive might make it more accessible to visit family and friends later, and you can even drive others around.”</p>
