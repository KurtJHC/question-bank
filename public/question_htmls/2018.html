        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Michelangelo was a sculptor, painter and architect widely considered to be one of the greatest artists of the Renaissance — and arguably of all time. His work demonstrated a blend of psychological insight, physical realism and intensity never seen before.<br>
<br>
Michelangelo needed very little sleep and was usually so drawn up in his work that he would spend weeks in the same clothes and shoes. His servant reported that when Michelangelo did take off his shoes, the skin on his feet would peel off like a snake’s.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Michelangelo was a highly focused artist, but his creativity wasn’t something he took for granted. He wrote, “Critique by creating.” Michelangelo felt that he could respond to others by doing a better job than they could.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Being creative means solving a problem in a new way. It means changing your perspective.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Being creative means taking risks and ignoring doubt and facing fears. It means breaking with routine and doing something different for the sake of doing something different. It means mapping out a thousand different routes to reach one destination. It means challenging yourself every day by applying extensive thought processes in many scenarios.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Being creative means searching for inspiration in even the most mundane places. It means you’re asking stupid questions. It means creating without critiquing.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Being creative means you know how to find the similarities and differences between two completely random ideas. Being creative means you’re thinking.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
How did songwriters John Lennon and Paul McCartney make music magic together? On the surface, it seems simple — they covered for each other's deficits and created outlets for each other's strengths. Paul's melodic sunshine smoothed out John's bluesy growls, while John's soulful depth gave stability to Paul and kept him from floating away.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But images of completion and balance miss an essential energy between Lennon and McCartney — the potential energy of creative partnerships that they, as much as any pair in history, exemplify and illustrate. We tend to think of them in terms of arithmetic: Two people added together yield magnificence. This is the idea of partnership as chocolate and peanut butter — tasty, obvious, easy. But Lennon and McCartney were more like an oyster and a grain of sand. Their power together didn't derive simply from individual ingredients but from a dynamic of constant mutual influence.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Creative writing, a form of artistic expression, draws on the imagination to convey meaning through the use of imagery, narrative, and drama. This is in contrast with analytic or pragmatic forms of writing.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
This genre includes poetry, fiction (novels, short stories), scripts, screenplays and creative non-fiction. You should be able to recognise an author’s written voice the way you recognise a person’s spoken voice.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
In creative writing, one goal is to develop your written voice. Character development is the art of imagining and portraying characters in enough detail that they seem real both to the author and the audience.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Consider the narrator’s perspective on the characters and occurrences in the piece of writing. Whose voice is telling the story? Most fiction is written in first person, an eyewitness account, or in third person, where the narrator describes things that happened to other people.<br>

How did songwriters John Lennon and Paul McCartney make music magic together? On the surface, it seems simple — they covered for each other's deficits and created outlets for each other's strengths. Paul's melodic sunshine smoothed out John's bluesy growls, while John's soulful depth gave stability to Paul and kept him from floating away.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But images of completion and balance miss an essential energy between Lennon and McCartney — the potential energy of creative partnerships that they, as much as any pair in history, exemplify and illustrate. We tend to think of them in terms of arithmetic: Two people added together yield magnificence. This is the idea of partnership as chocolate and peanut butter — tasty, obvious, easy. But Lennon and McCartney were more like an oyster and a grain of sand. Their power together didn't derive simply from individual ingredients but from a dynamic of constant mutual influence.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Creative writing, a form of artistic expression, draws on the imagination to convey meaning through the use of imagery, narrative, and drama. This is in contrast with analytic or pragmatic forms of writing.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
This genre includes poetry, fiction (novels, short stories), scripts, screenplays and creative non-fiction. You should be able to recognise an author’s written voice the way you recognise a person’s spoken voice.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
In creative writing, one goal is to develop your written voice. Character development is the art of imagining and portraying characters in enough detail that they seem real both to the author and the audience.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Consider the narrator’s perspective on the characters and occurrences in the piece of writing. Whose voice is telling the story? Most fiction is written in first person, an eyewitness account, or in third person, where the narrator describes things that happened to other people.<br>

Michelangelo was a sculptor, painter and architect widely considered to be one of the greatest artists of the Renaissance — and arguably of all time. His work demonstrated a blend of psychological insight, physical realism and intensity never seen before.<br>
<br>
Michelangelo needed very little sleep and was usually so drawn up in his work that he would spend weeks in the same clothes and shoes. His servant reported that when Michelangelo did take off his shoes, the skin on his feet would peel off like a snake’s.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Michelangelo was a highly focused artist, but his creativity wasn’t something he took for granted. He wrote, “Critique by creating.” Michelangelo felt that he could respond to others by doing a better job than they could.<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Being creative means solving a problem in a new way. It means changing your perspective.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Being creative means taking risks and ignoring doubt and facing fears. It means breaking with routine and doing something different for the sake of doing something different. It means mapping out a thousand different routes to reach one destination. It means challenging yourself every day by applying extensive thought processes in many scenarios.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Being creative means searching for inspiration in even the most mundane places. It means you’re asking stupid questions. It means creating without critiquing.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Being creative means you know how to find the similarities and differences between two completely random ideas. Being creative means you’re thinking.<br>

        <p><em>Read the (slightly abridged) fable written by Paul White and then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>The Small Wisdom of Feeding Vultures</strong><br><br>
Underneath the buyu tree, outside the hospital clinic, Daudi was handing out medicines. The crows were quarrelling noisily and the shadows were getting long as the afternoon wore on. The patients were talking to each other.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; “I have a strong fear of lions”, said one with a bandaged leg. He shivered slightly.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A long, thin boy coughed and then said, “Heh, the very thought of Nzoka the snake makes my skin go pimply.”<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A man who was recovering from malaria said in a tired voice, “Heh, Kifaru the rhino with his feet that shake the ground, his fierce horn, his …” Words failed him after that.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“No, the creatures to really fear” Daudi said, in a voice that carried, “are Mbu the mosquito and Papasi the tick and Hazi the fly. Small things, yes, but they kill a thousand more people than all the fierce ones of the jungle. Daudi stopped, absolutely still. “But there is another thing more deadly, more dangerous …”<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A visible shudder went through those that listened.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“I shall tell of it”, said Daudi. “It is the tale of the small wisdom of feeding vultures.”</p>
        <p>“Nyani the monkey hated vultures.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But his second wife’s first cousin, Tichi was a creature of the smallest intelligence. He merely said he hated vultures, but he was fascinated by their sharp beaks, their featherless necks, the way their tails swayed and the curve of their dangerous claws.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;One day a vulture alighted on the ground near Tichi’s family tree. <span class="txt-underline"><strong>His eyes drank in every movement of the foul bird</strong></span>. He looked this way and that way. No one was looking and he threw it food. Then, because of the voice within him which spoke loudly against vultures, he shouted in a harsh voice. With many gestures, he ordered it to be gone.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Next day, two vultures came. His eyes were hot as he looked at them, peering through a hole in the tree. His mouth was dry. Furtively he looked to see if he was observed, but those of the jungle were not looking in his direction. Again he threw food to the evil birds who came closer, squawking in a way that was not food for the ears.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Soon more vultures came and came closer, for Tichi repeatedly fed them. Then in a voice that could be heard even in the far thornbush, he uttered threats to throw stones, which would have been terrifying had he not thrown food instead. The vultures fluttered but stood their ground.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Twiga, the giraffe, from his vantage point above the thornbush saw all this and shook his head sadly, for he knew those who fed vultures sought trouble.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A week went by.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The vultures not longer stood at a distance. They came to the very foot of the tree, eating disgustingly the food which the small monkey furtively threw them. He watched them avidly, although fear stirred in his stomach.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In the noon heat of the next day, the bolder vultures were hovering above the buyu tree, pecking savagely at the food he was about to offer.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;High above them circled other vultures. All the time more and more of them arrived. They kept on landing and crowding closer and closer to him.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In real fear, Tichi beat about him with a knobbed stick, but to small purpose. The vultures he had encouraged were quickly overwhelming him. More and more vultures alighted.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;They pressed upon him with their ugly heads and their tearing beaks, viciously pecking at his eyes, his body and his limbs. A shrill monkey scream was drowned by the squawking of vultures.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; At sunset Nyani returned from a journey. He was filled with horror to find the bones of his second wife’s cousin picked clean by the unclean beaks of the filthy birds” “Koh” said one of those who listened, “I will sleep with dreams tonight”<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; “Eh-heh,” said another, grasping the stool on which he sat, “I can see the head with its featherless neck pecking at me. “Yoh!”<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Daudi smiled and then became serious. “So remember not to feed the destructive, and dangerous influences that come hovering over you and want to alight on your life.”&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Ian Fleming&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So, when it came to buying a car, they were all determined that it shouldn't be just any car, but something a bit different from everyone else's - not one of those black-beetle saloon cars that look much the same back and front so that, in the distance, you don't know if they're coming or going - but something rather special, something rather adventurous.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Well, they hunted all that afternoon and all the next day. They looked at brand-new cars and they visited the second-hand showrooms, where smart salesmen offered Commander and Mrs Pott cigarettes and Jeremy and Jemima sweets just to try and tempt them to buy. But Commander Pott knew pretty well all there is to know about cars, having been an engineer officer in the Navy and being an inventor as well, and one look under the bonnet and one trial, listening carefully to the sound of the engine, was generally enough for him—even if he didn't notice that the speedometer had been disconnected or that the chassis was bent because of some crash whose scratches and dents the salesman had carefully painted over.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And then at the end of the second day, they came to a broken-down little garage run by a once famous racing-driver. It was really only a big tin shed with a couple of grimy petrol pumps outside, and inside, the concrete floor was slippery with oil and everywhere there were bits and pieces of old cars that the garage man had been tinkering with, really, as far as one could see, just for the fun of it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But he was the sort of enthusiast Commander Pott always had a warm corner in his heart for. The two of them went on talking for a long time while Mimsie and Jeremy and Jemima grew more and more impatient.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Suddenly, they were surprised to see Commander Pott follow the garage man round to the back of his shed, where there was a long, low object hidden under a tarpaulin. The garage man looked Commander Pott and the family, each one, carefully up and down, and then he went to one end of the tarpaulin and slowly rolled it back.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Well, I can't tell you how disappointed Mimsie and the children were. From the way the garage man had behaved, they thought there must be some splendid treasure of a car under the tarpaulin. But what did they see? A wreck—that's all. Just the remains, rusty and broken and bent, of a very long, low, four-seater, open motor-car without a hood and with the green paint peeling off in strips.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Well, there she is," said the garage man sadly. "She once knew every racing-track in Europe. In the old days, there wasn't a famous driver in Britain who hadn't driven her at one time or another. She's still wearing England's racing green as you can see—that was from early in the 'thirties. She's a twelve-cylinder, eight-litre, supercharged Paragon&nbsp;Panther. They only made one of them and then the firm went broke. This is the only one in the world. Doesn't look much, does she? I'm afraid she's due for the scrap-heap. Can't afford to go on giving her living space. They're coming to tow her away next week, as a matter of fact—take her to the dump, pick her up in a big grab and drop her between one of those giant hydraulic presses. One crunch and it just squashes them into a sort of square metal biscuit. Then, she'll go to a smelting works to be melted down just for the raw metal. Seems a shame, doesn't it? You can almost see from her eyes—those big Marchal racing headlights—that she knows what's in store for her. But there it is. You can see the shape she's in and it would need hundreds of pounds to get her on the road again—even supposing there was someone nowadays who could afford to run her."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Commander Pott was looking curiously excited. "Mind if I look her over?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Go ahead." The garage man shook his head sadly. "She'd appreciate a last look-over by someone like you who knows what real quality used to be."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The whole family picked their way over and through the patches of oily ground. While Commander Pott looked under the bonnet, Mimsie and Jeremy and Jemima prodded the once-beautiful soft leather upholstery (moths flew out!) and looked under the carpets, front and back (beetles scuttled about!), and examined the knobs and switches and dials on the dashboard (there were dozens of them, all rusty and mildewed) and tried the big old boaconstrictor horn that worked with an India-rubber bulb. But nothing happened except that a lot of dust blew out of the end into Commander Pott's face as he bent over the engine, peering and tinkering. The children looked at Mimsie and Mimsie looked back at them, and do you know what? They didn't just dolefully shake their heads at each other. They all had the same look in their eyes. The look said, "This must once have been the most beautiful car in the world. If the engine's more or less all right and if we all set to and scrub and paint and mend and polish, do you suppose we could put her back as she used to be? It wouldn't be like having just one of those black beetles that the factories turn out in hundreds and thousands and that all look alike. We'd have a real jewel of a car, something to love and cherish and look after as if it was one of the family!"&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Ian Fleming&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So, when it came to buying a car, they were all determined that it shouldn't be just any car, but something a bit different from everyone else's - not one of those black-beetle saloon cars that look much the same back and front so that, in the distance, you don't know if they're coming or going - but something rather special, something rather adventurous.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Well, they hunted all that afternoon and all the next day. They looked at brand-new cars and they visited the second-hand showrooms, where smart salesmen offered Commander and Mrs Pott cigarettes and Jeremy and Jemima sweets just to try and tempt them to buy. But Commander Pott knew pretty well all there is to know about cars, having been an engineer officer in the Navy and being an inventor as well, and one look under the bonnet and one trial, listening carefully to the sound of the engine, was generally enough for him—even if he didn't notice that the speedometer had been disconnected or that the chassis was bent because of some crash whose scratches and dents the salesman had carefully painted over.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And then at the end of the second day, they came to a broken-down little garage run by a once famous racing-driver. It was really only a big tin shed with a couple of grimy petrol pumps outside, and inside, the concrete floor was slippery with oil and everywhere there were bits and pieces of old cars that the garage man had been tinkering with, really, as far as one could see, just for the fun of it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But he was the sort of enthusiast Commander Pott always had a warm corner in his heart for. The two of them went on talking for a long time while Mimsie and Jeremy and Jemima grew more and more impatient.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Suddenly, they were surprised to see Commander Pott follow the garage man round to the back of his shed, where there was a long, low object hidden under a tarpaulin. The garage man looked Commander Pott and the family, each one, carefully up and down, and then he went to one end of the tarpaulin and slowly rolled it back.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Well, I can't tell you how disappointed Mimsie and the children were. From the way the garage man had behaved, they thought there must be some splendid treasure of a car under the tarpaulin. But what did they see? A wreck—that's all. Just the remains, rusty and broken and bent, of a very long, low, four-seater, open motor-car without a hood and with the green paint peeling off in strips.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Well, there she is," said the garage man sadly. "She once knew every racing-track in Europe. In the old days, there wasn't a famous driver in Britain who hadn't driven her at one time or another. She's still wearing England's racing green as you can see—that was from early in the 'thirties. She's a twelve-cylinder, eight-litre, supercharged Paragon&nbsp;Panther. They only made one of them and then the firm went broke. This is the only one in the world. Doesn't look much, does she? I'm afraid she's due for the scrap-heap. Can't afford to go on giving her living space. They're coming to tow her away next week, as a matter of fact—take her to the dump, pick her up in a big grab and drop her between one of those giant hydraulic presses. One crunch and it just squashes them into a sort of square metal biscuit. Then, she'll go to a smelting works to be melted down just for the raw metal. Seems a shame, doesn't it? You can almost see from her eyes—those big Marchal racing headlights—that she knows what's in store for her. But there it is. You can see the shape she's in and it would need hundreds of pounds to get her on the road again—even supposing there was someone nowadays who could afford to run her."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Commander Pott was looking curiously excited. "Mind if I look her over?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Go ahead." The garage man shook his head sadly. "She'd appreciate a last look-over by someone like you who knows what real quality used to be."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The whole family picked their way over and through the patches of oily ground. While Commander Pott looked under the bonnet, Mimsie and Jeremy and Jemima prodded the once-beautiful soft leather upholstery (moths flew out!) and looked under the carpets, front and back (beetles scuttled about!), and examined the knobs and switches and dials on the dashboard (there were dozens of them, all rusty and mildewed) and tried the big old boaconstrictor horn that worked with an India-rubber bulb. But nothing happened except that a lot of dust blew out of the end into Commander Pott's face as he bent over the engine, peering and tinkering. The children looked at Mimsie and Mimsie looked back at them, and do you know what? They didn't just dolefully shake their heads at each other. They all had the same look in their eyes. The look said, "This must once have been the most beautiful car in the world. If the engine's more or less all right and if we all set to and scrub and paint and mend and polish, do you suppose we could put her back as she used to be? It wouldn't be like having just one of those black beetles that the factories turn out in hundreds and thousands and that all look alike. We'd have a real jewel of a car, something to love and cherish and look after as if it was one of the family!"&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Ian Fleming&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So, when it came to buying a car, they were all determined that it shouldn't be just any car, but something a bit different from everyone else's - not one of those black-beetle saloon cars that look much the same back and front so that, in the distance, you don't know if they're coming or going - but something rather special, something rather adventurous.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Well, they hunted all that afternoon and all the next day. They looked at brand-new cars and they visited the second-hand showrooms, where smart salesmen offered Commander and Mrs Pott cigarettes and Jeremy and Jemima sweets just to try and tempt them to buy. But Commander Pott knew pretty well all there is to know about cars, having been an engineer officer in the Navy and being an inventor as well, and one look under the bonnet and one trial, listening carefully to the sound of the engine, was generally enough for him—even if he didn't notice that the speedometer had been disconnected or that the chassis was bent because of some crash whose scratches and dents the salesman had carefully painted over.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And then at the end of the second day, they came to a broken-down little garage run by a once famous racing-driver. It was really only a big tin shed with a couple of grimy petrol pumps outside, and inside, the concrete floor was slippery with oil and everywhere there were bits and pieces of old cars that the garage man had been tinkering with, really, as far as one could see, just for the fun of it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But he was the sort of enthusiast Commander Pott always had a warm corner in his heart for. The two of them went on talking for a long time while Mimsie and Jeremy and Jemima grew more and more impatient.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Suddenly, they were surprised to see Commander Pott follow the garage man round to the back of his shed, where there was a long, low object hidden under a tarpaulin. The garage man looked Commander Pott and the family, each one, carefully up and down, and then he went to one end of the tarpaulin and slowly rolled it back.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Well, I can't tell you how disappointed Mimsie and the children were. From the way the garage man had behaved, they thought there must be some splendid treasure of a car under the tarpaulin. But what did they see? A wreck—that's all. Just the remains, rusty and broken and bent, of a very long, low, four-seater, open motor-car without a hood and with the green paint peeling off in strips.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Well, there she is," said the garage man sadly. "She once knew every racing-track in Europe. In the old days, there wasn't a famous driver in Britain who hadn't driven her at one time or another. She's still wearing England's racing green as you can see—that was from early in the 'thirties. She's a twelve-cylinder, eight-litre, supercharged Paragon&nbsp;Panther. They only made one of them and then the firm went broke. This is the only one in the world. Doesn't look much, does she? I'm afraid she's due for the scrap-heap. Can't afford to go on giving her living space. They're coming to tow her away next week, as a matter of fact—take her to the dump, pick her up in a big grab and drop her between one of those giant hydraulic presses. One crunch and it just squashes them into a sort of square metal biscuit. Then, she'll go to a smelting works to be melted down just for the raw metal. Seems a shame, doesn't it? You can almost see from her eyes—those big Marchal racing headlights—that she knows what's in store for her. But there it is. You can see the shape she's in and it would need hundreds of pounds to get her on the road again—even supposing there was someone nowadays who could afford to run her."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Commander Pott was looking curiously excited. "Mind if I look her over?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Go ahead." The garage man shook his head sadly. "She'd appreciate a last look-over by someone like you who knows what real quality used to be."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The whole family picked their way over and through the patches of oily ground. While Commander Pott looked under the bonnet, Mimsie and Jeremy and Jemima prodded the once-beautiful soft leather upholstery (moths flew out!) and looked under the carpets, front and back (beetles scuttled about!), and examined the knobs and switches and dials on the dashboard (there were dozens of them, all rusty and mildewed) and tried the big old boaconstrictor horn that worked with an India-rubber bulb. But nothing happened except that a lot of dust blew out of the end into Commander Pott's face as he bent over the engine, peering and tinkering. The children looked at Mimsie and Mimsie looked back at them, and do you know what? They didn't just dolefully shake their heads at each other. They all had the same look in their eyes. The look said, "This must once have been the most beautiful car in the world. If the engine's more or less all right and if we all set to and scrub and paint and mend and polish, do you suppose we could put her back as she used to be? It wouldn't be like having just one of those black beetles that the factories turn out in hundreds and thousands and that all look alike. We'd have a real jewel of a car, something to love and cherish and look after as if it was one of the family!"&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Ian Fleming&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So, when it came to buying a car, they were all determined that it shouldn't be just any car, but something a bit different from everyone else's - not one of those black-beetle saloon cars that look much the same back and front so that, in the distance, you don't know if they're coming or going - but something rather special, something rather adventurous.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Well, they hunted all that afternoon and all the next day. They looked at brand-new cars and they visited the second-hand showrooms, where smart salesmen offered Commander and Mrs Pott cigarettes and Jeremy and Jemima sweets just to try and tempt them to buy. But Commander Pott knew pretty well all there is to know about cars, having been an engineer officer in the Navy and being an inventor as well, and one look under the bonnet and one trial, listening carefully to the sound of the engine, was generally enough for him—even if he didn't notice that the speedometer had been disconnected or that the chassis was bent because of some crash whose scratches and dents the salesman had carefully painted over.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And then at the end of the second day, they came to a broken-down little garage run by a once famous racing-driver. It was really only a big tin shed with a couple of grimy petrol pumps outside, and inside, the concrete floor was slippery with oil and everywhere there were bits and pieces of old cars that the garage man had been tinkering with, really, as far as one could see, just for the fun of it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But he was the sort of enthusiast Commander Pott always had a warm corner in his heart for. The two of them went on talking for a long time while Mimsie and Jeremy and Jemima grew more and more impatient.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Suddenly, they were surprised to see Commander Pott follow the garage man round to the back of his shed, where there was a long, low object hidden under a tarpaulin. The garage man looked Commander Pott and the family, each one, carefully up and down, and then he went to one end of the tarpaulin and slowly rolled it back.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Well, I can't tell you how disappointed Mimsie and the children were. From the way the garage man had behaved, they thought there must be some splendid treasure of a car under the tarpaulin. But what did they see? A wreck—that's all. Just the remains, rusty and broken and bent, of a very long, low, four-seater, open motor-car without a hood and with the green paint peeling off in strips.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Well, there she is," said the garage man sadly. "She once knew every racing-track in Europe. In the old days, there wasn't a famous driver in Britain who hadn't driven her at one time or another. She's still wearing England's racing green as you can see—that was from early in the 'thirties. She's a twelve-cylinder, eight-litre, supercharged Paragon&nbsp;Panther. They only made one of them and then the firm went broke. This is the only one in the world. Doesn't look much, does she? I'm afraid she's due for the scrap-heap. Can't afford to go on giving her living space. They're coming to tow her away next week, as a matter of fact—take her to the dump, pick her up in a big grab and drop her between one of those giant hydraulic presses. One crunch and it just squashes them into a sort of square metal biscuit. Then, she'll go to a smelting works to be melted down just for the raw metal. Seems a shame, doesn't it? You can almost see from her eyes—those big Marchal racing headlights—that she knows what's in store for her. But there it is. You can see the shape she's in and it would need hundreds of pounds to get her on the road again—even supposing there was someone nowadays who could afford to run her."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Commander Pott was looking curiously excited. "Mind if I look her over?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Go ahead." The garage man shook his head sadly. "She'd appreciate a last look-over by someone like you who knows what real quality used to be."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The whole family picked their way over and through the patches of oily ground. While Commander Pott looked under the bonnet, Mimsie and Jeremy and Jemima prodded the once-beautiful soft leather upholstery (moths flew out!) and looked under the carpets, front and back (beetles scuttled about!), and examined the knobs and switches and dials on the dashboard (there were dozens of them, all rusty and mildewed) and tried the big old boaconstrictor horn that worked with an India-rubber bulb. But nothing happened except that a lot of dust blew out of the end into Commander Pott's face as he bent over the engine, peering and tinkering. The children looked at Mimsie and Mimsie looked back at them, and do you know what? They didn't just dolefully shake their heads at each other. They all had the same look in their eyes. The look said, "This must once have been the most beautiful car in the world. If the engine's more or less all right and if we all set to and scrub and paint and mend and polish, do you suppose we could put her back as she used to be? It wouldn't be like having just one of those black beetles that the factories turn out in hundreds and thousands and that all look alike. We'd have a real jewel of a car, something to love and cherish and look after as if it was one of the family!"&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Ian Fleming&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So, when it came to buying a car, they were all determined that it shouldn't be just any car, but something a bit different from everyone else's - not one of those black-beetle saloon cars that look much the same back and front so that, in the distance, you don't know if they're coming or going - but something rather special, something rather adventurous.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Well, they hunted all that afternoon and all the next day. They looked at brand-new cars and they visited the second-hand showrooms, where smart salesmen offered Commander and Mrs Pott cigarettes and Jeremy and Jemima sweets just to try and tempt them to buy. But Commander Pott knew pretty well all there is to know about cars, having been an engineer officer in the Navy and being an inventor as well, and one look under the bonnet and one trial, listening carefully to the sound of the engine, was generally enough for him—even if he didn't notice that the speedometer had been disconnected or that the chassis was bent because of some crash whose scratches and dents the salesman had carefully painted over.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And then at the end of the second day, they came to a broken-down little garage run by a once famous racing-driver. It was really only a big tin shed with a couple of grimy petrol pumps outside, and inside, the concrete floor was slippery with oil and everywhere there were bits and pieces of old cars that the garage man had been tinkering with, really, as far as one could see, just for the fun of it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But he was the sort of enthusiast Commander Pott always had a warm corner in his heart for. The two of them went on talking for a long time while Mimsie and Jeremy and Jemima grew more and more impatient.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Suddenly, they were surprised to see Commander Pott follow the garage man round to the back of his shed, where there was a long, low object hidden under a tarpaulin. The garage man looked Commander Pott and the family, each one, carefully up and down, and then he went to one end of the tarpaulin and slowly rolled it back.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Well, I can't tell you how disappointed Mimsie and the children were. From the way the garage man had behaved, they thought there must be some splendid treasure of a car under the tarpaulin. But what did they see? A wreck—that's all. Just the remains, rusty and broken and bent, of a very long, low, four-seater, open motor-car without a hood and with the green paint peeling off in strips.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Well, there she is," said the garage man sadly. "She once knew every racing-track in Europe. In the old days, there wasn't a famous driver in Britain who hadn't driven her at one time or another. She's still wearing England's racing green as you can see—that was from early in the 'thirties. She's a twelve-cylinder, eight-litre, supercharged Paragon&nbsp;Panther. They only made one of them and then the firm went broke. This is the only one in the world. Doesn't look much, does she? I'm afraid she's due for the scrap-heap. Can't afford to go on giving her living space. They're coming to tow her away next week, as a matter of fact—take her to the dump, pick her up in a big grab and drop her between one of those giant hydraulic presses. One crunch and it just squashes them into a sort of square metal biscuit. Then, she'll go to a smelting works to be melted down just for the raw metal. Seems a shame, doesn't it? You can almost see from her eyes—those big Marchal racing headlights—that she knows what's in store for her. But there it is. You can see the shape she's in and it would need hundreds of pounds to get her on the road again—even supposing there was someone nowadays who could afford to run her."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Commander Pott was looking curiously excited. "Mind if I look her over?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Go ahead." The garage man shook his head sadly. "She'd appreciate a last look-over by someone like you who knows what real quality used to be."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The whole family picked their way over and through the patches of oily ground. While Commander Pott looked under the bonnet, Mimsie and Jeremy and Jemima prodded the once-beautiful soft leather upholstery (moths flew out!) and looked under the carpets, front and back (beetles scuttled about!), and examined the knobs and switches and dials on the dashboard (there were dozens of them, all rusty and mildewed) and tried the big old boaconstrictor horn that worked with an India-rubber bulb. But nothing happened except that a lot of dust blew out of the end into Commander Pott's face as he bent over the engine, peering and tinkering. The children looked at Mimsie and Mimsie looked back at them, and do you know what? They didn't just dolefully shake their heads at each other. They all had the same look in their eyes. The look said, "This must once have been the most beautiful car in the world. If the engine's more or less all right and if we all set to and scrub and paint and mend and polish, do you suppose we could put her back as she used to be? It wouldn't be like having just one of those black beetles that the factories turn out in hundreds and thousands and that all look alike. We'd have a real jewel of a car, something to love and cherish and look after as if it was one of the family!"&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Where the Pelican Builds&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>[The unexplored parts of Australia are sometimes spoken of by the bushmen of Western Queensland as the home of the pelican, a bird whose nesting place, so far as the writer knows, is seldom, if ever found.]&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The horses were ready, the rails were down,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But the riders lingered still,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One had a parting word to say,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And one had his pipe to fill.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then they mounted, one with a granted prayer,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And one with a grief unguessed.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“We are going” they said, as they rode away,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Where the pelican builds her nest!”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They had told us of pastures wide and green,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To be sought past the sunset's glow;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Of rifts* in the ranges by opal lit,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And gold 'neath the river's flow.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And thirst and hunger were banished words&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When they spoke of that unknown West;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>No drought they dreaded, no flood they feared,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Where the pelican builds her nest!&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The creek at the ford** was but fetlock*** deep&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When we watched them crossing there;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The rains have replenished it thrice since then&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And thrice has the rock lain bare.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But the waters of Hope have flowed and fled,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And never from blue hill's breast&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Come back - by the sun and the sands devoured,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Where the pelican builds her nest!&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>* rift – a crack, split or break in something&nbsp;</p>
        <p>** ford – a shallow spot in a river&nbsp;</p>
        <p>*** fetlock – horse ankle</p>

          <strong>Where the Pelican Builds&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>

        <p>
          <em>[The unexplored parts of Australia are sometimes spoken of by the bushmen of Western Queensland as the home of the pelican, a bird whose nesting place, so far as the writer knows, is seldom, if ever found.]&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The horses were ready, the rails were down,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But the riders lingered still,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One had a parting word to say,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And one had his pipe to fill.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then they mounted, one with a granted prayer,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And one with a grief unguessed.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“We are going” they said, as they rode away,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Where the pelican builds her nest!”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They had told us of pastures wide and green,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To be sought past the sunset's glow;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Of rifts* in the ranges by opal lit,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And gold 'neath the river's flow.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And thirst and hunger were banished words&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When they spoke of that unknown West;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>No drought they dreaded, no flood they feared,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Where the pelican builds her nest!&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The creek at the ford** was but fetlock*** deep&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When we watched them crossing there;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The rains have replenished it thrice since then&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And thrice has the rock lain bare.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But the waters of Hope have flowed and fled,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And never from blue hill's breast&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Come back - by the sun and the sands devoured,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Where the pelican builds her nest!&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>* rift – a crack, split or break in something&nbsp;</p>
        <p>** ford – a shallow spot in a river&nbsp;</p>
        <p>*** fetlock – horse ankle</p>

        <p>One had a parting word to say,&nbsp;</p>

        <p>“We are going” they said, as they rode away,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Where the pelican builds her nest!”&nbsp;</p>

        <p>They had told us of pastures wide and green,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To be sought past the sunset's glow;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Of rifts* in the ranges by opal lit,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And gold 'neath the river's flow.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Where the pelican builds her nest!&nbsp;</p>

        <p>When we watched them crossing there;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The rains have replenished it thrice since then&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And thrice has the rock lain bare.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But the waters of Hope have flowed and fled,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And never from blue hill's breast&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Come back - by the sun and the sands devoured,&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Taj Mahal, the magnificent monument that stands at the heart of India, has a story that has been melting the hearts of millions of listeners since the time Taj Mahal has been visible. It is a story, that although ending back in 1631, continues to live on in the concrete form of Taj Mahal and is considered a living example of eternal love. <strong>15 ………. </strong>These two people from the course of history have set an example for the people living in the present and the future. As the poet, Edwin Arnold describes it, "Not a piece of architecture, as other buildings are, but the proud passion of an emperor's love wrought in living stones." The story that follows next will prove why that statement is true.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Shah Jahan, initially named Prince Khurram, was born in the year 1592. He was the son of Jehangir, the fourth Mughal emperor of India and the grandson of Akbar the Great. In 1607, Shah Jahan strolled down the Meena Bazaar, accompanied by a string of fawning courtiers. <strong>16 ……….</strong> It was love at first sight and the girl was Mumtaz Mahal, who was known as Arjumand Banu Begum at that time. At that time, he was 14 years old and she, a Muslim Persian princess, was 15. After meeting her, Shah Jahan went back to his father and declared that he wanted to marry her. The match was solemnised five years later i.e., in the year 1612.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was in the year 1628 that Shah Jahan became the Emperor and he entrusted Arjumand Banu with the royal seal. <strong>17 ………. </strong>Though Shah Jahan also had other wives, Mumtaz Mahal was his favourite and accompanied him everywhere, even on military campaigns. In the year 1631, when Mumtaz Mahal was giving birth to their 14th child, she died due to some complications. While Mumtaz was on her deathbed, Shah Jahan promised her that he would never remarry and would build the richest mausoleum over her grave.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It is said that Shah Jahan was so heartbroken after her death that he ordered the court into mourning for two years. Sometime after her death, Shah Jahan undertook the task of creating the world's most beautiful monument in the memory of his beloved. It took 22 years and the labour of 22,000 workers to construct the monument. <strong>18 ………. </strong>This magnificent monument came to be known as "Taj Mahal" and now counts amongst the Seven Wonders of the World. It is the true story of the Taj Mahal of India which has mesmerised many people with its bewitching beauty</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Shah Jahan was wealthy enough to support the Taj Mahal and its mighty maintenance costs. However, over the centuries, the Mughal Empire lost its riches and the Taj Mahal fell into ruins. By the 1800s, the British ousted the Mughals and took over India. The Taj Mahal was dissected for its beauty—the British cut gemstones from its walls, stole silver candlesticks and doors, and even tried to sell the white marble overseas. <strong>19 ……….</strong> Rather than looting the Taj Mahal, Curzon worked to restore it.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Taj Mahal has once again become a magnificent place with 2.5 million visitors each year. <strong>20 ………. </strong>Once a month, visitors also have the opportunity to make a short visit during a full moon to see how the Taj Mahal seems to glow from the inside out in the moonlight. The Taj Mahal was placed on the World Heritage List by UNESCO in 1983, but this protection has not guaranteed its safety. It is now at the mercy of pollutants from nearby factories and excessive humidity from the breath of its visitors.</p>

        <p>Taj Mahal, the magnificent monument that stands at the heart of India, has a story that has been melting the hearts of millions of listeners since the time Taj Mahal has been visible. It is a story, that although ending back in 1631, continues to live on in the concrete form of Taj Mahal and is considered a living example of eternal love. <strong>15 ………. </strong>These two people from the course of history have set an example for the people living in the present and the future. As the poet, Edwin Arnold describes it, "Not a piece of architecture, as other buildings are, but the proud passion of an emperor's love wrought in living stones." The story that follows next will prove why that statement is true.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Shah Jahan, initially named Prince Khurram, was born in the year 1592. He was the son of Jehangir, the fourth Mughal emperor of India and the grandson of Akbar the Great. In 1607, Shah Jahan strolled down the Meena Bazaar, accompanied by a string of fawning courtiers. <strong>16 ……….</strong> It was love at first sight and the girl was Mumtaz Mahal, who was known as Arjumand Banu Begum at that time. At that time, he was 14 years old and she, a Muslim Persian princess, was 15. After meeting her, Shah Jahan went back to his father and declared that he wanted to marry her. The match was solemnised five years later i.e., in the year 1612.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was in the year 1628 that Shah Jahan became the Emperor and he entrusted Arjumand Banu with the royal seal. <strong>17 ………. </strong>Though Shah Jahan also had other wives, Mumtaz Mahal was his favourite and accompanied him everywhere, even on military campaigns. In the year 1631, when Mumtaz Mahal was giving birth to their 14th child, she died due to some complications. While Mumtaz was on her deathbed, Shah Jahan promised her that he would never remarry and would build the richest mausoleum over her grave.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It is said that Shah Jahan was so heartbroken after her death that he ordered the court into mourning for two years. Sometime after her death, Shah Jahan undertook the task of creating the world's most beautiful monument in the memory of his beloved. It took 22 years and the labour of 22,000 workers to construct the monument. <strong>18 ………. </strong>This magnificent monument came to be known as "Taj Mahal" and now counts amongst the Seven Wonders of the World. It is the true story of the Taj Mahal of India which has mesmerised many people with its bewitching beauty</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Shah Jahan was wealthy enough to support the Taj Mahal and its mighty maintenance costs. However, over the centuries, the Mughal Empire lost its riches and the Taj Mahal fell into ruins. By the 1800s, the British ousted the Mughals and took over India. The Taj Mahal was dissected for its beauty—the British cut gemstones from its walls, stole silver candlesticks and doors, and even tried to sell the white marble overseas. <strong>19 ……….</strong> Rather than looting the Taj Mahal, Curzon worked to restore it.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Taj Mahal has once again become a magnificent place with 2.5 million visitors each year. <strong>20 ………. </strong>Once a month, visitors also have the opportunity to make a short visit during a full moon to see how the Taj Mahal seems to glow from the inside out in the moonlight. The Taj Mahal was placed on the World Heritage List by UNESCO in 1983, but this protection has not guaranteed its safety. It is now at the mercy of pollutants from nearby factories and excessive humidity from the breath of its visitors.</p>
