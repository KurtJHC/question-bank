        <p><em>Read the poem below by Maya Angelou then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</strong><br><br>
A free bird leaps<br>
on the back of the wind<br>
and floats downstream<br>
till the current ends<br>
and dips his wing<br>
in the orange sun rays<br>
and <span class="txt-underline"><strong>dares to claim the sky.</strong></span><br>
<br>
But a bird that stalks<br>
down his narrow cage<br>
can seldom see through<br>
his bars of rage<br>
his wings are clipped and<br>
his feet are tied<br>
so he opens his throat to sing.<br>
<br>
The caged bird sings<br>
with a fearful trill<br>
of things unknown<br>
but longed for still<br>
and his tune is heard<br>
on the distant hill<br>
for the caged bird<br>
sings of freedom.<br>
<br>
The free bird thinks of another breeze<br>
and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees<br>
and the fat worms waiting on a dawn bright lawn<br>
and he names the sky his own.<br>
<br>
<span class="txt-underline"><strong>But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams</strong></span><br>
his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream<br>
his wings are clipped and his feet are tied<br>
so he opens his throat to sing.<br>
<br>
The caged bird sings<br>
with a fearful trill<br>
of things unknown<br>
but longed for still<br>
and his tune is heard<br>
on the distant hill<br>
for the caged bird<br>
sings of freedom.</p>

<strong>Social media: a blessing and a curse</strong><br>
<br>
<em>Our Social Media Manager, Tess Macpherson-Woods, shares her experience working here in the busy world of social media.</em><br>
<br>
When I tell people what I do for a living, I think this often conjures up images of me surrounded by kittens and puppies, scrolling through Facebook at my leisure... As much as I love my job, kittens and puppies - this couldn't be further from the truth!<strong> 12 .......... .</strong> As a nation of animal lovers, we all feel very strongly about speaking up for the voiceless, and want to help - but as well-intentioned as posts and comments online may be, they can sometimes make it harder for us to help.<br>
<br>
Every day we use social media to achieve amazing things, from finding perpetrators of animal cruelty, to rehoming animals, offering the best pet care advice, and gathering petition signatures to change the law. <strong>13 .......... </strong>. We're incredibly grateful for these passionate and dedicated animal lovers - we couldn't help as many animals as we do without them!<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, with social media also comes fake news, malicious rumours and inaccuracies, which can spread like wildfire. Sometimes such posts are shared by people who don't understand the restrictions we face as a charity, or our very stretched resources; other times they're shared by people who have had a negative experience with us in the past, perhaps due to harming an animal themselves. These posts are not only damaging to our reputation, affecting our ability to help animals, but they can also be unintentionally damaging to specific animals' lives.<br>
<br>
In the past reports have been made to us, with people expecting immediate action and updates, and have then shared our perceived lack of action on social media. <strong>14 ..........</strong> . There are times when people wrongly claim to have reported concerns to us, say we've not attended when we've barely been given a chance to do so, or tell the world that we don't care. <strong>15 ...........</strong><br>
<br>
Each day, my small team deals with hundreds of messages on our social channels. We love speaking to inspirational animal advocates, passionate pet owners, keen campaigners, and fabulous fundraisers - but we also have to deal with terrible trolls. <strong>16 ..........</strong> . It's a sad fact that there will always be people that don't like us. As an organisation which investigates and prosecutes people for animal cruelty, we'll always have enemies, and people's expectations of us (often, wrongly, as the animal police!) will always be far greater than we can realistically deliver.<br>
<br>
As a charity, we have no legal powers and a call comes in every 30 seconds, but we have fewer than 400 full-time members of staff in our inspectorate to pick up these calls.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, people's expectations are that we should arrive within minutes to seize an abused dog without evidence or the police to sign them over to us, always be there to collect a poorly but mobile fox, or immediately come to the rescue of a legally tethered, healthy horse. <strong>17 ..........</strong> . Unfortunately, receiving more calls about these incidents without more information won't help the situation - and sharing the issue online and trolling us will also make things more difficult to solve.<br>

                In doing so, this has given the owner a 'heads-up' about our potential involvement, leading to the animals being moved and us being unable to intervene, or conditions improving, but only to the extent that they're legally compliant, as opposed to endorsed by us.

Sometimes such posts are shared by people who don't understand the restrictions we face as a charity, or our very stretched resources; other times they're shared by people who have had a negative experience with us in the past, perhaps due to harming an animal themselves. These posts are not only damaging to our reputation, affecting our ability to help animals, but they can also be unintentionally damaging to specific animals' lives.<br>
<br>
In the past reports have been made to us, with people expecting immediate action and updates, and have then shared our perceived lack of action on social media. <strong>14 ..........</strong> . There are times when people wrongly claim to have reported concerns to us, say we've not attended when we've barely been given a chance to do so, or tell the world that we don't care. <strong>15 ...........</strong><br>
<br>
Each day, my small team deals with hundreds of messages on our social channels. We love speaking to inspirational animal advocates, passionate pet owners, keen campaigners, and fabulous fundraisers - but we also have to deal with terrible trolls. <strong>16 ..........</strong> . It's a sad fact that there will always be people that don't like us. As an organisation which investigates and prosecutes people for animal cruelty, we'll always have enemies, and people's expectations of us (often, wrongly, as the animal police!) will always be far greater than we can realistically deliver.<br>
<br>
As a charity, we have no legal powers and a call comes in every 30 seconds, but we have fewer than 400 full-time members of staff in our inspectorate to pick up these calls.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, people's expectations are that we should arrive within minutes to seize an abused dog without evidence or the police to sign them over to us, always be there to collect a poorly but mobile fox, or immediately come to the rescue of a legally tethered, healthy horse. <strong>17 ..........</strong> . Unfortunately, receiving more calls about these incidents without more information won't help the situation - and sharing the issue online and trolling us will also make things more difficult to solve.<br>

<strong>Social media: a blessing and a curse</strong><br>
<br>
<em>Our Social Media Manager, Tess Macpherson-Woods, shares her experience working here in the busy world of social media.</em><br>
<br>
When I tell people what I do for a living, I think this often conjures up images of me surrounded by kittens and puppies, scrolling through Facebook at my leisure... As much as I love my job, kittens and puppies - this couldn't be further from the truth!<strong> 12 .......... .</strong> As a nation of animal lovers, we all feel very strongly about speaking up for the voiceless, and want to help - but as well-intentioned as posts and comments online may be, they can sometimes make it harder for us to help.<br>
<br>
Every day we use social media to achieve amazing things, from finding perpetrators of animal cruelty, to rehoming animals, offering the best pet care advice, and gathering petition signatures to change the law. <strong>13 .......... </strong>. We're incredibly grateful for these passionate and dedicated animal lovers - we couldn't help as many animals as we do without them!<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, with social media also comes fake news, malicious rumours and inaccuracies, which can spread like wildfire. Sometimes such posts are shared by people who don't understand the restrictions we face as a charity, or our very stretched resources; other times they're shared by people who have had a negative experience with us in the past, perhaps due to harming an animal themselves. These posts are not only damaging to our reputation, affecting our ability to help animals, but they can also be unintentionally damaging to specific animals' lives.<br>

There are times when people wrongly claim to have reported concerns to us, say we've not attended when we've barely been given a chance to do so, or tell the world that we don't care. <strong>15 ...........</strong><br>
<br>
Each day, my small team deals with hundreds of messages on our social channels. We love speaking to inspirational animal advocates, passionate pet owners, keen campaigners, and fabulous fundraisers - but we also have to deal with terrible trolls. <strong>16 ..........</strong> .

As an organisation which investigates and prosecutes people for animal cruelty, we'll always have enemies, and people's expectations of us (often, wrongly, as the animal police!) will always be far greater than we can realistically deliver.<br>

<strong>Social media: a blessing and a curse</strong><br>
<br>
<em>Our Social Media Manager, Tess Macpherson-Woods, shares her experience working here in the busy world of social media.</em><br>
<br>
When I tell people what I do for a living, I think this often conjures up images of me surrounded by kittens and puppies, scrolling through Facebook at my leisure... As much as I love my job, kittens and puppies - this couldn't be further from the truth!<strong> 12 .......... .</strong> As a nation of animal lovers, we all feel very strongly about speaking up for the voiceless, and want to help - but as well-intentioned as posts and comments online may be, they can sometimes make it harder for us to help.<br>
<br>
Every day we use social media to achieve amazing things, from finding perpetrators of animal cruelty, to rehoming animals, offering the best pet care advice, and gathering petition signatures to change the law. <strong>13 .......... </strong>. We're incredibly grateful for these passionate and dedicated animal lovers - we couldn't help as many animals as we do without them!<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, with social media also comes fake news, malicious rumours and inaccuracies, which can spread like wildfire. Sometimes such posts are shared by people who don't understand the restrictions we face as a charity, or our very stretched resources; other times they're shared by people who have had a negative experience with us in the past, perhaps due to harming an animal themselves. These posts are not only damaging to our reputation, affecting our ability to help animals, but they can also be unintentionally damaging to specific animals' lives.<br>
<br>
In the past reports have been made to us, with people expecting immediate action and updates, and have then shared our perceived lack of action on social media. <strong>14 ..........</strong> . There are times when people wrongly claim to have reported concerns to us, say we've not attended when we've barely been given a chance to do so, or tell the world that we don't care. <strong>15 ...........</strong><br>
<br>
Each day, my small team deals with hundreds of messages on our social channels. We love speaking to inspirational animal advocates, passionate pet owners, keen campaigners, and fabulous fundraisers - but we also have to deal with terrible trolls. <strong>16 ..........</strong> . It's a sad fact that there will always be people that don't like us. As an organisation which investigates and prosecutes people for animal cruelty, we'll always have enemies, and people's expectations of us (often, wrongly, as the animal police!) will always be far greater than we can realistically deliver.<br>
<br>
As a charity, we have no legal powers and a call comes in every 30 seconds, but we have fewer than 400 full-time members of staff in our inspectorate to pick up these calls.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, people's expectations are that we should arrive within minutes to seize an abused dog without evidence or the police to sign them over to us, always be there to collect a poorly but mobile fox, or immediately come to the rescue of a legally tethered, healthy horse. <strong>17 ..........</strong> . Unfortunately, receiving more calls about these incidents without more information won't help the situation - and sharing the issue online and trolling us will also make things more difficult to solve.<br>

<strong>Social media: a blessing and a curse</strong><br>
<br>
<em>Our Social Media Manager, Tess Macpherson-Woods, shares her experience working here in the busy world of social media.</em><br>
<br>
When I tell people what I do for a living, I think this often conjures up images of me surrounded by kittens and puppies, scrolling through Facebook at my leisure... As much as I love my job, kittens and puppies - this couldn't be further from the truth!<strong> 12 .......... .</strong> As a nation of animal lovers, we all feel very strongly about speaking up for the voiceless, and want to help - but as well-intentioned as posts and comments online may be, they can sometimes make it harder for us to help.<br>
<br>
Every day we use social media to achieve amazing things, from finding perpetrators of animal cruelty, to rehoming animals, offering the best pet care advice, and gathering petition signatures to change the law. <strong>13 .......... </strong>. We're incredibly grateful for these passionate and dedicated animal lovers - we couldn't help as many animals as we do without them!<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, with social media also comes fake news, malicious rumours and inaccuracies, which can spread like wildfire. Sometimes such posts are shared by people who don't understand the restrictions we face as a charity, or our very stretched resources; other times they're shared by people who have had a negative experience with us in the past, perhaps due to harming an animal themselves. These posts are not only damaging to our reputation, affecting our ability to help animals, but they can also be unintentionally damaging to specific animals' lives.<br>
<br>
In the past reports have been made to us, with people expecting immediate action and updates, and have then shared our perceived lack of action on social media. <strong>14 ..........</strong> . There are times when people wrongly claim to have reported concerns to us, say we've not attended when we've barely been given a chance to do so, or tell the world that we don't care. <strong>15 ...........</strong><br>
<br>
Each day, my small team deals with hundreds of messages on our social channels. We love speaking to inspirational animal advocates, passionate pet owners, keen campaigners, and fabulous fundraisers - but we also have to deal with terrible trolls. <strong>16 ..........</strong> . It's a sad fact that there will always be people that don't like us. As an organisation which investigates and prosecutes people for animal cruelty, we'll always have enemies, and people's expectations of us (often, wrongly, as the animal police!) will always be far greater than we can realistically deliver.<br>
<br>
As a charity, we have no legal powers and a call comes in every 30 seconds, but we have fewer than 400 full-time members of staff in our inspectorate to pick up these calls.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, people's expectations are that we should arrive within minutes to seize an abused dog without evidence or the police to sign them over to us, always be there to collect a poorly but mobile fox, or immediately come to the rescue of a legally tethered, healthy horse. <strong>17 ..........</strong> . Unfortunately, receiving more calls about these incidents without more information won't help the situation - and sharing the issue online and trolling us will also make things more difficult to solve.<br>

                In doing so, this has given the owner a 'heads-up' about our potential involvement, leading to the animals being moved and us being unable to intervene, or conditions improving, but only to the extent that they're legally compliant, as opposed to endorsed by us.

horse, (Equus caballus), a hoofed herbivorous mammal of the family Equidae. It comprises a single species, Equus caballus, whose numerous varieties are called breeds. Before the advent of mechanised vehicles, the horse was widely used as a draft animal, and riding on horseback was one of the chief means of transportation.<br>
<br>
In prehistoric times the wild horse was probably first hunted for food. Research suggests that domestication had taken place by approximately 6,000 years ago. It is supposed that the horse was first used by a tribe of Indo-European origin that lived in the steppes north of the chain of mountains adjacent to the Black and Caspian seas. Influenced by climate, food, and humans, the horse rapidly acquired its present form.<br>
<br>
The relationship of the horse to humans has been unique. The horse is a partner and friend. It has ploughed fields and brought in the harvest, hauled goods and conveyed passengers, followed game and tracked cattle, and carried combatants into battle and adventurers to unknown lands. It has provided recreation in the form of jousts, tournaments, carousels, and the sport of riding. The influence of the horse is expressed in the English language in such terms as chivalry and cavalier, which connote honour, respect, good manners, and straightforwardness.<br>
<br>
{^ <strong>Extract B</strong> ^}<br>
Old Zoey knew his mood well enough and whinnied her warning, backing off into the dark recesses of the stable, but she need not have warned me for I sensed his intention. One look at the raised stick sent my heart thumping wildly with fear. Terrified, I knew I could not run, for there was nowhere to go, so I put my back to him and lashed out behind me. I felt my&nbsp; hooves strike home. I heard a cry of pain and turned to see him crawling out of the stable door dragging one leg stiffly behind him and muttering words of cruel vengeance.<br>
<br>
That next morning both Albert and his father came out together to the stables. His father was walking with a pronounced limp. They were carrying a collar each and I could see that Albert had been crying for his pale cheeks were stained with tears. They stood together at the stable door. I noticed with infinite pride and pleasure that my Albert was already taller than his father whose face was drawn and lined with pain. ‘If your mother hadn’t begged me last night, Albert, I’d have shot that horse on the spot. He could’ve killed me. Now I’m warning you, if that animal is not ploughing straight as an arrow inside a week, he’ll be sold on, and that’s a promise. It’s up to you. You say you can deal with him, and I’ll give you just one chance. He won’t let me go near him. He’s wild and vicious, and unless you make it your business to tame him and train him inside that week, he’s going. Do you understand?

Horse-drawn streetcars first appeared in American cities in the early 1830s when the New York &amp; Harlem Railroad began running trains from Harlem to 27th Street, substituting horses for steam south of that point as required by a city statute. By 1838, the railroad possessed one hundred horses, forty cars, and four locomotives, with a depot and stables at 27th Street. Four horses pulled the car along iron strips laid on granite blocks. The tracks rose several inches above the street surface and provided a smooth ride for the vehicle on the rails, but proved a hindrance to cross town traffic. In 1845, the New York Common Council prohibited steam locomotives below 32nd Street, a limit extended in 1856 to 42nd Street, and the number of horse-drawn cars expanded. Passenger loads grew rapidly, as the streetcar provided a smoother ride and cheaper fares than the<br>

When the time comes to finally buy your own horse it can be intimidating, but mostly it should be an exciting time for any rider. I could not wait to start looking around.

When I first announced that I would be buying a horse, the horror stories I heard filled me with anxiety. I was made to feel as though I was going to be just another fool who would be scammed because of my lack of years in the equestrian world. I was told how many horses I should look at, how long I should take before responding to an offer on a horse, and so on, as if there is some secret formula for buying the perfect horse at the perfect time and at the perfect price. Every horse I looked at was too old, too young, too green, skinny, crazy, or too expensive. The list went on and I got to the point where I felt defeated and close to giving up on buying a horse at all because it would never be the right horse for me.

horse, (Equus caballus), a hoofed herbivorous mammal of the family Equidae. It comprises a single species, Equus caballus, whose numerous varieties are called breeds. Before the advent of mechanised vehicles, the horse was widely used as a draft animal, and riding on horseback was one of the chief means of transportation.<br>
<br>
In prehistoric times the wild horse was probably first hunted for food. Research suggests that domestication had taken place by approximately 6,000 years ago. It is supposed that the horse was first used by a tribe of Indo-European origin that lived in the steppes north of the chain of mountains adjacent to the Black and Caspian seas. Influenced by climate, food, and humans, the horse rapidly acquired its present form.<br>
<br>
The relationship of the horse to humans has been unique. The horse is a partner and friend. It has ploughed fields and brought in the harvest, hauled goods and conveyed passengers, followed game and tracked cattle, and carried combatants into battle and adventurers to unknown lands. It has provided recreation in the form of jousts, tournaments, carousels, and the sport of riding. The influence of the horse is expressed in the English language in such terms as chivalry and cavalier, which connote honour, respect, good manners, and straightforwardness.<br>

Old Zoey knew his mood well enough and whinnied her warning, backing off into the dark recesses of the stable, but she need not have warned me for I sensed his intention. One look at the raised stick sent my heart thumping wildly with fear. Terrified, I knew I could not run, for there was nowhere to go, so I put my back to him and lashed out behind me. I felt my&nbsp; hooves strike home. I heard a cry of pain and turned to see him crawling out of the stable door dragging one leg stiffly behind him and muttering words of cruel vengeance.<br>
<br>
That next morning both Albert and his father came out together to the stables. His father was walking with a pronounced limp. They were carrying a collar each and I could see that Albert had been crying for his pale cheeks were stained with tears. They stood together at the stable door. I noticed with infinite pride and pleasure that my Albert was already taller than his father whose face was drawn and lined with pain. ‘If your mother hadn’t begged me last night, Albert, I’d have shot that horse on the spot. He could’ve killed me. Now I’m warning you, if that animal is not ploughing straight as an arrow inside a week, he’ll be sold on, and that’s a promise. It’s up to you. You say you can deal with him, and I’ll give you just one chance. He won’t let me go near him. He’s wild and vicious, and unless you make it your business to tame him and train him inside that week, he’s going. Do you understand? That horse has to earn his keep like everyone else around here – I don’t care how showy he is – that horse has got to learn how to work. And I’ll promise you another thing, Albert, if I have to lose that bet, then he has to go.’ He dropped the collar on the ground and turned on his heel to go. ‘Father,’ said Albert with resolution in his voice. ‘I’ll train Joey – I’ll train him to plough all right – but you must promise never to raise a stick to him again.

Old Zoey knew his mood well enough and whinnied her warning, backing off into the dark recesses of the stable, but she need not have warned me for I sensed his intention. One look at the raised stick sent my heart thumping wildly with fear. Terrified, I knew I could not run, for there was nowhere to go, so I put my back to him and lashed out behind me. I felt my&nbsp; hooves strike home. I heard a cry of pain and turned to see him crawling out of the stable door dragging one leg stiffly behind him and muttering words of cruel vengeance.<br>
<br>
That next morning both Albert and his father came out together to the stables. His father was walking with a pronounced limp. They were carrying a collar each and I could see that Albert had been crying for his pale cheeks were stained with tears. They stood together at the stable door. I noticed with infinite pride and pleasure that my Albert was already taller than his father whose face was drawn and lined with pain. ‘If your mother hadn’t begged me last night, Albert, I’d have shot that horse on the spot. He could’ve killed me. Now I’m warning you, if that animal is not ploughing straight as an arrow inside a week, he’ll be sold on, and that’s a promise. It’s up to you. You say you can deal with him, and I’ll give you just one chance. He won’t let me go near him. He’s wild and vicious, and unless you make it your business to tame him and train him inside that week, he’s going. Do you understand? That horse has to earn his keep like everyone else around here – I don’t care how showy he is – that horse has got to learn how to work. And I’ll promise you another thing, Albert, if I have to lose that bet, then he has to go.’ He dropped the collar on the ground and turned on his heel to go. ‘Father,’ said Albert with resolution in his voice. ‘I’ll train Joey – I’ll train him to plough all right – but you must promise never to raise a stick to him again. He can’t be handled that way, I know him, Father. I know him as if he were my own brother.’ ‘You train him, Albert, you handle him. Don’t care how you do it. I don’t want to know,’ said his father dismissively. ‘I’ll not go near the brute again. I’d shoot him first.&nbsp;<br>

Horse-drawn streetcars first appeared in American cities in the early 1830s when the New York &amp; Harlem Railroad began running trains from Harlem to 27th Street, substituting horses for steam south of that point as required by a city statute. By 1838, the railroad possessed one hundred horses, forty cars, and four locomotives, with a depot and stables at 27th Street. Four horses pulled the car along iron strips laid on granite blocks. The tracks rose several inches above the street surface and provided a smooth ride for the vehicle on the rails, but proved a hindrance to cross town traffic. In 1845, the New York Common Council prohibited steam locomotives below 32nd Street, a limit extended in 1856 to 42nd Street, and the number of horse-drawn cars expanded. Passenger loads grew rapidly, as the streetcar provided a smoother ride and cheaper fares than the<br>

<br>
When the time comes to finally buy your own horse it can be intimidating, but mostly it should be an exciting time for any rider. I could not wait to start looking around. I was, of course, open to advice from my mentors and parents because it’s a big financial decision, but ultimately, I ’m a grown woman, it’s my money, and it will be my horse.<br>
<br>
When I first announced that I would be buying a horse, the horror stories I heard filled me with anxiety. I was made to feel as though I was going to be just another fool who would be scammed because of my lack of years in the equestrian world. I was told how many horses I should look at, how long I should take before responding to an offer on a horse, and so on, as if there is some secret formula for buying the perfect horse at the perfect time and at the perfect price. Every horse I looked at was too old, too young, too green, skinny, crazy, or too expensive. The list went on and I got to the point where I felt defeated and close to giving up on buying a horse at all because it would never be the right horse for me. I was even told: All you see is a horse with four legs and a tail; I see much more. I was terrified of offending and upsetting these people.<br>

horse, (Equus caballus), a hoofed herbivorous mammal of the family Equidae. It comprises a single species, Equus caballus, whose numerous varieties are called breeds. Before the advent of mechanised vehicles, the horse was widely used as a draft animal, and riding on horseback was one of the chief means of transportation.<br>
<br>
In prehistoric times the wild horse was probably first hunted for food. Research suggests that domestication had taken place by approximately 6,000 years ago. It is supposed that the horse was first used by a tribe of Indo-European origin that lived in the steppes north of the chain of mountains adjacent to the Black and Caspian seas. Influenced by climate, food, and humans, the horse rapidly acquired its present form.<br>
<br>
The relationship of the horse to humans has been unique. The horse is a partner and friend. It has ploughed fields and brought in the harvest, hauled goods and conveyed passengers, followed game and tracked cattle, and carried combatants into battle and adventurers to unknown lands. It has provided recreation in the form of jousts, tournaments, carousels, and the sport of riding. The influence of the horse is expressed in the English language in such terms as chivalry and cavalier, which connote honour, respect, good manners, and straightforwardness.<br>
