        <p>“So, kiddies, you’re mine for the next hundred days,” Large said. “Every day will be equally joyous. There are no holidays. No weekends. You will rise at 0545. Cold shower, get dressed, run the assault course. 0700 breakfast, followed by physical training until school starts at 0900. Lessons include Espionage, Language, Weaponry and Survival Skills. At 1400 you run the assault course again. Lunch at 1500. At 1600 two more hours of physical training. At 1800 you return here.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>James’ foot touched the floor. Large smashed the baton into the bucket. The noise inside was incredible. “Keep that foot up. Where was I? At 1800 you return here. Another shower, warm water if I’m feeling kind. Wash your clothes in the sinks and hang them up so they’re dry for morning. Then clean and polish your boots. At 1900 you get your evening meal. 1930 to 2030 homework. Brush your teeth, lights out at 2045. There will also be trips off campus for survival training, the last of which will take us to sunny Malaysia.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“If anyone is accusing me of cruelty, I remind you that the fences that surround us are not to keep you in, but to keep your little chums from slipping in and giving you a helping hand or a tasty snack. You are free to leave the training facility at any time, but if you wish to be a CHERUB agent you will have to resume Basic Training from day one. If you get an injury that stops you training for more than three days, you start again from day one. James, put your foot down and take off the bucket.” James lifted the bucket off his head. It took his eyes a few seconds to readjust to the light. “You were very late this morning, James, weren’t you?” Large said.</p>
        <p>“Yes, sir,” James said. “Well everyone, because James is still so full after his lie-in and his cooked breakfast, I think you can all skip lunch. Not to worry though. It’s only eleven and a half hours until dinner.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">****&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The eight kids in training were split into pairs. The first pair, numbers one and two, were Shakeel and Mo. Shakeel was as big as James but only ten years old. Born in Egypt, he’d been at CHERUB for three years and in that time he’d learned a lot that would help in basic training. James realised he was going to be at a big disadvantage to trainees who had spent years in a red shirt.</p>
        <p>Mo was another veteran, three days past his tenth birthday. A policeman had found him abandoned at Heathrow Airport when he was four. Mo’s parents were never found. Mo always jiggled his bony arms like he was trying to swat flies off himself.</p>
        <p>Three and four were Connor and Callum, the twins James had met on the running track a few days earlier. James had had a few conversations with them and they seemed OK.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Five and six were Gabrielle and Nicole. Gabrielle was from the Caribbean; her parents had died a few months earlier in a car wreck. Eleven years old, she looked tough as boots. Nicole was smaller. Twelve, red-haired and overweight.</p>
        <p>Number eight, James’ partner, was Kerry. She was eleven years old, small and boyish with a flat face and dark eyes. Her black hair was shaved down to a number one. James&nbsp;had seen her in a red shirt with shoulder length hair a few days earlier. Now, she looked totally different. She didn’t look as nervous as the others.</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">****&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Large led them out to the assault course at a jog.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Do exactly what I do,’ Kerry said as their feet squished in the mud.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Who made you boss?’ James asked.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘I’ve been at CHERUB since I was six,’ Kerry said. ‘I did sixty-four days of this course last year before I broke my kneecap and got chucked off. You’ve been here what? Two weeks?’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘About three,’ James said. ‘Why did you cut off your hair?’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Quicker to wash, quicker to dry, doesn’t get in your face all day. If you do things quickly and get a few minutes’ extra rest, it makes a difference. I’ll do everything I can to make life easy for you, James, if you do one thing for me.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘What?’ James asked.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Protect my knee,’ Kerry said. ‘There are titanium pins holding the bits together. When we do karate, please don’t kick me on that part of my leg. If we have to run with heavy packs, take some of my weight for me. Will you help me, James, if I help you?’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Whatever I can do,’ James said. ‘We’re partners anyway. How come they’re letting you take this course if your knee isn’t better?’</p>
        <p>‘I lied. I said the pain was gone. All the kids I grew up with are living in the main building and going on missions. I spend my evenings watching six-year-olds cut up sticky paper. I’m getting through basic this time or I’ll die trying.’</p>

At 1400 you run the assault course again. Lunch at 1500. At 1600 two more hours of physical training. At 1800 you return here.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>James’ foot touched the floor. Large smashed the baton into the bucket. The noise inside was incredible. “Keep that foot up. Where was I? At 1800 you return here. Another shower, warm water if I’m feeling kind. Wash your clothes in the sinks and hang them up so they’re dry for morning. Then clean and polish your boots. At 1900 you get your evening meal. 1930 to 2030 homework. Brush your teeth, lights out at 2045. There will also be trips off campus for survival training, the last of which will take us to sunny Malaysia.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“If anyone is accusing me of cruelty, I remind you that the fences that surround us are not to keep you in, but to keep your little chums from slipping in and giving you a helping hand or a tasty snack. You are free to leave the training facility at any time, but if you wish to be a CHERUB agent you will have to resume Basic Training from day one. If you get an injury that stops you training for more than three days, you start again from day one. James, put your foot down and take off the bucket.” James lifted the bucket off his head. It took his eyes a few seconds to readjust to the light. “You were very late this morning, James, weren’t you?” Large said.</p>
        <p>“Yes, sir,” James said. “Well everyone, because James is still so full after his lie-in and his cooked breakfast, I think you can all skip lunch. Not to worry though. It’s only eleven and a half hours until dinner.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">****&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The eight kids in training were split into pairs. The first pair, numbers one and two, were Shakeel and Mo. Shakeel was as big as James but only ten years old. Born in Egypt, he’d been at CHERUB for three years and in that time he’d learned a lot that would help in basic training. James realised he was going to be at a big disadvantage to trainees who had spent years in a red shirt.</p>
        <p>Mo was another veteran, three days past his tenth birthday. A policeman had found him abandoned at Heathrow Airport when he was four. Mo’s parents were never found. Mo always jiggled his bony arms like he was trying to swat flies off himself.</p>
        <p>Three and four were Connor and Callum, the twins James had met on the running track a few days earlier. James had had a few conversations with them and they seemed OK.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Five and six were Gabrielle and Nicole. Gabrielle was from the Caribbean; her parents had died a few months earlier in a car wreck. Eleven years old, she looked tough as boots. Nicole was smaller. Twelve, red-haired and overweight.</p>
        <p>Number eight, James’ partner, was Kerry. She was eleven years old, small and boyish with a flat face and dark eyes. Her black hair was shaved down to a number one. James&nbsp;had seen her in a red shirt with shoulder length hair a few days earlier. Now, she looked totally different. She didn’t look as nervous as the others.</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">****&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Large led them out to the assault course at a jog.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Do exactly what I do,’ Kerry said as their feet squished in the mud.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Who made you boss?’ James asked.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘I’ve been at CHERUB since I was six,’ Kerry said. ‘I did sixty-four days of this course last year before I broke my kneecap and got chucked off. You’ve been here what? Two weeks?’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘About three,’ James said. ‘Why did you cut off your hair?’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Quicker to wash, quicker to dry, doesn’t get in your face all day. If you do things quickly and get a few minutes’ extra rest, it makes a difference. I’ll do everything I can to make life easy for you, James, if you do one thing for me.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘What?’ James asked.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Protect my knee,’ Kerry said. ‘There are titanium pins holding the bits together. When we do karate, please don’t kick me on that part of my leg. If we have to run with heavy packs, take some of my weight for me. Will you help me, James, if I help you?’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Whatever I can do,’ James said. ‘We’re partners anyway. How come they’re letting you take this course if your knee isn’t better?’</p>
        <p>‘I lied. I said the pain was gone. All the kids I grew up with are living in the main building and going on missions. I spend my evenings watching six-year-olds cut up sticky paper. I’m getting through basic this time or I’ll die trying.’</p>

        <p>“If anyone is accusing me of cruelty, I remind you that the fences that surround us are not to keep you in, but to keep your little chums from slipping in and giving you a helping hand or a tasty snack. You are free to leave the training facility at any time, but if you wish to be a CHERUB agent you will have to resume Basic Training from day one. If you get an injury that stops you training for more than three days, you start again from day one. James, put your foot down and take off the bucket.” James lifted the bucket off his head. It took his eyes a few seconds to readjust to the light. “You were very late this morning, James, weren’t you?” Large said.</p>
        <p>“Yes, sir,” James said. “Well everyone, because James is still so full after his lie-in and his cooked breakfast, I think you can all skip lunch. Not to worry though. It’s only eleven and a half hours until dinner.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">****&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The eight kids in training were split into pairs. The first pair, numbers one and two, were Shakeel and Mo. Shakeel was as big as James but only ten years old. Born in Egypt, he’d been at CHERUB for three years and in that time he’d learned a lot that would help in basic training. James realised he was going to be at a big disadvantage to trainees who had spent years in a red shirt.</p>
        <p>Mo was another veteran, three days past his tenth birthday. A policeman had found him abandoned at Heathrow Airport when he was four. Mo’s parents were never found. Mo always jiggled his bony arms like he was trying to swat flies off himself.</p>
        <p>Three and four were Connor and Callum, the twins James had met on the running track a few days earlier. James had had a few conversations with them and they seemed OK.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Five and six were Gabrielle and Nicole. Gabrielle was from the Caribbean; her parents had died a few months earlier in a car wreck. Eleven years old, she looked tough as boots. Nicole was smaller. Twelve, red-haired and overweight.</p>
        <p>Number eight, James’ partner, was Kerry. She was eleven years old, small and boyish with a flat face and dark eyes. Her black hair was shaved down to a number one. James&nbsp;had seen her in a red shirt with shoulder length hair a few days earlier. Now, she looked totally different. She didn’t look as nervous as the others.</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">****&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Large led them out to the assault course at a jog.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Do exactly what I do,’ Kerry said as their feet squished in the mud.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Who made you boss?’ James asked.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘I’ve been at CHERUB since I was six,’ Kerry said. ‘I did sixty-four days of this course last year before I broke my kneecap and got chucked off. You’ve been here what? Two weeks?’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘About three,’ James said. ‘Why did you cut off your hair?’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Quicker to wash, quicker to dry, doesn’t get in your face all day. If you do things quickly and get a few minutes’ extra rest, it makes a difference. I’ll do everything I can to make life easy for you, James, if you do one thing for me.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘What?’ James asked.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Protect my knee,’ Kerry said. ‘There are titanium pins holding the bits together. When we do karate, please don’t kick me on that part of my leg. If we have to run with heavy packs, take some of my weight for me. Will you help me, James, if I help you?’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Whatever I can do,’ James said. ‘We’re partners anyway. How come they’re letting you take this course if your knee isn’t better?’</p>
        <p>‘I lied. I said the pain was gone. All the kids I grew up with are living in the main building and going on missions. I spend my evenings watching six-year-olds cut up sticky paper. I’m getting through basic this time or I’ll die trying.’</p>

        <p><em>Read the poem below by Charles Wolfe then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>The Burial of Sir John Moore After Corunna&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Not a drum was heard, not a funeral note,&nbsp;<br>
As his corpse to the rampart we hurried;&nbsp;<br>
Not a soldier discharged his farewell shot&nbsp;<br>
O’er the grave where our hero we buried.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We buried him darkly at dead of night,&nbsp;<br>
<span class="txt-underline"><strong>The sods with our bayonets turning;</strong></span><br>
By the struggling moonbeam’s misty light&nbsp;<br>
And the lantern dimly burning.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>No useless coffin enclosed his breast,&nbsp;<br>
Nor in sheet nor in shroud we wound him,&nbsp;<br>
But he lay like a warrior taking his rest&nbsp;<br>
With his martial cloak around him.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Few and short were the prayers we said,&nbsp;<br>
And we spoke not a word of sorrow;&nbsp;<br>
But we steadfastly gazed on the face that was dead,&nbsp;<br>
And we bitterly thought of the morrow.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We thought, as we hollowed his narrow bed&nbsp;<br>
And smoothed down his lonely pillow,&nbsp;<br>
That the foe and the stranger would tread o’er his head,&nbsp;<br>
And we far away on the billow!&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Lightly they’ll talk of the spirit that’s gone&nbsp;<br>
And o’er his cold ashes upbraid him,&nbsp;<br>
But little he’ll reck, if they let him sleep on&nbsp;<br>
In the grave where a Briton has laid him.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But half of our heavy task was done&nbsp;<br>
When the clock struck the hour for retiring;&nbsp;<br>
And we heard the distant and random gun&nbsp;<br>
That the foe was sullenly firing.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Slowly and sadly we laid him down,&nbsp;<br>
From the field of his fame fresh and gory;&nbsp;<br>
<span class="txt-underline"><strong>We carved not a line, and we raised not a stone,</strong></span><br>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF BODY LANGUAGE&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Geoffrey Beattie, at the University of Manchester, found that a woman is instinctively four times more likely to mirror another woman than a man is to mirror another man. <strong>12 ………</strong>, but men are reluctant to mirror a woman’s gestures or posture – unless he is in courtship mode.</p>
        <p>When a woman says she can ‘see’ that someone doesn’t agree with the group opinion, she is actually ‘seeing’ the disagreement. <strong>13 ……….</strong> and they are showing their disagreement by not mirroring the group’s body language. How women can ‘see’ disagreement, anger, lying or feeling hurt has always been a source of amazement to most men. <strong>14 ……….</strong> and don’t consciously notice mirroring discrepancies.</p>
        <p>Men and women’s brains are programmed differently to express different emotions through facial expressions and body language. Typically, a woman can use an average of six main facial expressions in a ten-second listening period to reflect and then feedback the speaker’s emotions. <strong>15 ……….</strong> To someone watching, it can look as if the events being discussed are happening to both women.</p>
        <p>A woman reads the meaning of what is being said through the speaker’s voice and tone and his emotional condition through his body language. <strong>16 ……….</strong> Most men are daunted by the prospect of using facial feedback while listening, but it pays big dividends for the man who becomes good at it.</p>
        <p>Some men say, <strong>17 ………. </strong>but research with these techniques shows that when a man mirrors a woman’s facial expressions as she talks, she will describe him as caring, intelligent, interesting and attractive.</p>

Geoffrey Beattie, at the University of Manchester, found that a woman is instinctively four times more likely to mirror another woman than a man is to mirror another man. <strong>12 ………</strong>, but men are reluctant to mirror a woman’s gestures or posture – unless he is in courtship mode.</p>
        <p>When a woman says she can ‘see’ that someone doesn’t agree with the group opinion, she is actually ‘seeing’ the disagreement. <strong>13 ……….</strong> and they are showing their disagreement by not mirroring the group’s body language. How women can ‘see’ disagreement, anger, lying or feeling hurt has always been a source of amazement to most men. <strong>14 ……….</strong> and don’t consciously notice mirroring discrepancies.</p>
        <p>Men and women’s brains are programmed differently to express different emotions through facial expressions and body language. Typically, a woman can use an average of six main facial expressions in a ten-second listening period to reflect and then feedback the speaker’s emotions. <strong>15 ……….</strong> To someone watching, it can look as if the events being discussed are happening to both women.</p>
        <p>A woman reads the meaning of what is being said through the speaker’s voice and tone and his emotional condition through his body language. <strong>16 ……….</strong> Most men are daunted by the prospect of using facial feedback while listening, but it pays big dividends for the man who becomes good at it.</p>
        <p>Some men say, <strong>17 ………. </strong>but research with these techniques shows that when a man mirrors a woman’s facial expressions as she talks, she will describe him as caring, intelligent, interesting and attractive.</p>

Communication with humans often incorporates specific calls or patterns of behaviour that cats have been taught or have found effective. British novelist, Kingsley Amis was convinced that his cat, Sarah Snow, was trying to speak English. Her attempts to communicate led him to write in a poem, “I was impressed to hear her say ‘Hello,’ Not like a person, true; / It might not sound quite right to you, / More of a simple squeak or squawk - / Still, that’s what happens when cats talk.” Sachiko, a seal-point Siamese belonging to the author of this book, had a call sounding like, “oweer,” which everyone said was clearly an attempt to call his name, “Howard.” She used it in different tones to mean either, “Hello, you’re home – I’m upstairs,” “Hello, I’ve just come in,” or, “Where are you? I want you!” – but she never used this sound with anyone else.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
If her kittens are endangered, a mother will defend them fiercely, ignoring any risk to herself. During the heavy bombing of World War II, a cat in Portsmouth, England, found an ingenious way to rescue her kittens. The only way out of their home was through an open bedroom window but it was too high to jump from with kittens or to drop them to safety. Furthermore, there was no tree or drain pipe to climb down. There was, however, a telephone cable attached to the wall near the window. One at a time, she took her two kittens gently in her mouth, jumped from the ledge to the cable, and carried them along it, down a telegraph pole and into the garden shed. Whether or not she sensed the impending danger of the forthcoming air raid, or had a more specific premonition, she probably saved their lives, for soon after they reached the shed, the blast from a bomb showered their home with debris and broken glass.<br>

Feral city cats have to be opportunists. They may catch a mouse or rat but mostly they survive by scavenging and on handouts from people who are kind enough to feed them. There are feral cats in the excavated ruins of Ancient Rome and Athens, and in the trafficfree piazzas of Venice, but these city cats mainly frequent any railed-off area – say, around an institutional building, such as a hospital or a public utility, where the high fences may offer them protection from marauding dogs and other enemies. Colonies of city cats can grow to considerable numbers. English cat expert, Roger Tabor studied one such group in a London square. They were fed regularly by a number of volunteers so that Tabor could determine which cats ate most of the food and which were prepared to share their food with others.<br>

Many keepers who commit the ultimate dereliction of duty in the eyes of their cat – going away and leaving someone else in charge – are met with complete indifference on their return, the offended cat simply refusing to speak to the miscreant who went off and abandoned the creature. If you have ever left a cat behind while you went on a trip, you have probably experienced how cats express their displeasure at being deserted. Some manage to maintain a sulky disdain for days before they admit that they are really very pleased to see you again.<br>

Communication with humans often incorporates specific calls or patterns of behaviour that cats have been taught or have found effective. British novelist, Kingsley Amis was convinced that his cat, Sarah Snow, was trying to speak English. Her attempts to communicate led him to write in a poem, “I was impressed to hear her say ‘Hello,’ Not like a person, true; / It might not sound quite right to you, / More of a simple squeak or squawk - / Still, that’s what happens when cats talk.” Sachiko, a seal-point Siamese belonging to the author of this book, had a call sounding like, “oweer,” which everyone said was clearly an attempt to call his name, “Howard.” She used it in different tones to mean either, “Hello, you’re home – I’m upstairs,” “Hello, I’ve just come in,” or, “Where are you? I want you!” – but she never used this sound with anyone else.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
If her kittens are endangered, a mother will defend them fiercely, ignoring any risk to herself. During the heavy bombing of World War II, a cat in Portsmouth, England, found an ingenious way to rescue her kittens. The only way out of their home was through an open bedroom window but it was too high to jump from with kittens or to drop them to safety. Furthermore, there was no tree or drain pipe to climb down. There was, however, a telephone cable attached to the wall near the window. One at a time, she took her two kittens gently in her mouth, jumped from the ledge to the cable, and carried them along it, down a telegraph pole and into the garden shed. Whether or not she sensed the impending danger of the forthcoming air raid, or had a more specific premonition, she probably saved their lives, for soon after they reached the shed, the blast from a bomb showered their home with debris and broken glass.<br>

Feral city cats have to be opportunists. They may catch a mouse or rat but mostly they survive by scavenging and on handouts from people who are kind enough to feed them. There are feral cats in the excavated ruins of Ancient Rome and Athens, and in the trafficfree piazzas of Venice, but these city cats mainly frequent any railed-off area – say, around an institutional building, such as a hospital or a public utility, where the high fences may offer them protection from marauding dogs and other enemies. Colonies of city cats can grow to considerable numbers. English cat expert, Roger Tabor studied one such group in a London square. They were fed regularly by a number of volunteers so that Tabor could determine which cats ate most of the food and which were prepared to share their food with others.<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Many keepers who commit the ultimate dereliction of duty in the eyes of their cat – going away and leaving someone else in charge – are met with complete indifference on their return, the offended cat simply refusing to speak to the miscreant who went off and abandoned the creature. If you have ever left a cat behind while you went on a trip, you have probably experienced how cats express their displeasure at being deserted. Some manage to maintain a sulky disdain for days before they admit that they are really very pleased to see you again.<br>

I want you!” – but she never used this sound with anyone else.&nbsp;<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
If her kittens are endangered, a mother will defend them fiercely, ignoring any risk to herself. During the heavy bombing of World War II, a cat in Portsmouth, England, found an ingenious way to rescue her kittens. The only way out of their home was through an open bedroom window but it was too high to jump from with kittens or to drop them to safety. Furthermore, there was no tree or drain pipe to climb down. There was, however, a telephone cable attached to the wall near the window. One at a time, she took her two kittens gently in her mouth, jumped from the ledge to the cable, and carried them along it, down a telegraph pole and into the garden shed. Whether or not she sensed the impending danger of the forthcoming air raid, or had a more specific premonition, she probably saved their lives, for soon after they reached the shed, the blast from a bomb showered their home with debris and broken glass.<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Feral city cats have to be opportunists. They may catch a mouse or rat but mostly they survive by scavenging and on handouts from people who are kind enough to feed them. There are feral cats in the excavated ruins of Ancient Rome and Athens, and in the trafficfree piazzas of Venice, but these city cats mainly frequent any railed-off area – say, around an institutional building, such as a hospital or a public utility, where the high fences may offer them protection from marauding dogs and other enemies. Colonies of city cats can grow to considerable numbers. English cat expert, Roger Tabor studied one such group in a London square. They were fed regularly by a number of volunteers so that Tabor could determine which cats ate most of the food and which were prepared to share their food with others.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Many keepers who commit the ultimate dereliction of duty in the eyes of their cat – going away and leaving someone else in charge – are met with complete indifference on their return, the offended cat simply refusing to speak to the miscreant who went off and abandoned the creature. If you have ever left a cat behind while you went on a trip, you have probably experienced how cats express their displeasure at being deserted. Some manage to maintain a sulky disdain for days before they admit that they are really very pleased to see you again.<br>
