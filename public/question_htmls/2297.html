        <p><strong>Read the text below. Six sentences&nbsp;have been removed from this text so that there are six gaps.</strong><br><br><strong>Sun</strong><br><br><strong>(A)</strong>&nbsp;………... The sun is an ordinary star, one of about 100 billion in our galaxy, the Milky Way. The sun has extremely important influences on our planet: It drives weather, ocean currents, seasons, and climate, and makes plant life possible through photosynthesis. Without the sun’s heat and light, life on Earth would not exist. The sun is about 150 million kilometres (93 million miles) from Earth. This distance, called an astronomical unit (AU), is a standard measure of distance for astronomers and astrophysicists. An AU can be measured at light speed, or the time it takes for a photon of light to travel from the sun to Earth. It takes light on the sun about eight minutes and 19 seconds to reach Earth.</p>
        <p><strong>(B)</strong> ………. About 4.5 billion years ago, the sun began to take shape from a molecular cloud that was mainly composed of hydrogen and helium. A nearby supernova emitted a shockwave, which came in contact with the molecular cloud and energized it. The molecular cloud began to compress, and some regions of gas collapsed under their own gravitational pull. As one of these regions collapsed, it also began to rotate and heat up from increasing pressure. Much of the hydrogen and helium remained in the centre of this hot, rotating mass. Eventually, the gases heated up enough to begin nuclear fusion, and became the sun in our solar system. Other parts of the molecular cloud cooled into a disc around the brand-new sun and became planets, asteroids, comets, and other bodies in our solar system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>(C)</strong> ………. The sun has not always been a subject of scientific discovery and inquiry. For thousands of years, the sun was known in cultures all over the world as a god, a goddess, and a symbol of life. To the ancient Aztecs, the sun was a powerful deity known as Tonatiuh, who required human sacrifice to travel across the sky. In Baltic mythology, the sun was a goddess named Saule, who brought fertility and health. Chinese mythology held that the sun is the only remaining of 10 sun gods. In 150 A.D., Greek scholar Claudius Ptolemy created a geocentric model of the solar system in which the moon, planets, and sun revolved around Earth. It was not until the 16th century that Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus used mathematical and scientific reasoning to prove that planets rotated around the sun. This heliocentric model is the one we use today.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>(D)</strong> ………. In the 17th century, the telescope allowed people to examine the sun in detail. The sun is much too bright to allow us to study it with our eyes unprotected. With a telescope, it was possible for the first time to project a clear image of the sun onto a screen for examination. English scientist Sir Isaac Newton used a telescope and prism to scatter the light of the sun, and proved that sunlight was actually made of a spectrum of colours. In 1800, infrared and ultraviolet light were discovered to exist just outside of the visible spectrum. An optical instrument called a spectroscope made it possible to separate visible light and other electromagnetic radiation into its various wavelengths. Spectroscopy also helped scientists&nbsp;identify gases in the sun’s atmosphere—each element has its own wavelength pattern. In 1868, English astronomer Joseph Norman Lockyer was studying the sun’s electromagnetic spectrum. He guessed that there was an element isolated on the sun, and named it helium after the Greek sun god, Helios.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>(E)</strong> ………. Technology continued to improve and allowed scientists to uncover new features of the sun Twentieth-century astronomers used balloons and rockets to send specialized telescopes high above Earth, and examined the sun without any interference from Earth's atmosphere. Solrad 1 was the first spacecraft designed to study the sun, and was launched by the United States in 1960. That decade, NASA sent five Pioneer satellites to orbit the sun and collect information about the star. In 1980, NASA launched a mission during the solar maximum to gather information about the high-frequency gamma rays, UV rays, and x-rays that are emitted during solar flares.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>(F)</strong>&nbsp;………. The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) was developed in Europe and put into orbit in 1996 to collect information. SOHO has been successfully collecting data and forecasting space weather for 12 years. Voyager 1 and 2 are spacecraft traveling to the edge of the heliosphere to discover what the atmosphere is made of where solar wind meets the interstellar medium. Voyager 1 crossed this boundary in 2012 and Voyager 2 did so in 2018. Another development in the study of the sun is helioseismology, the study of solar waves.. By studying these waves, scientists understand more about the sun’s interior and the cause of solar activity.&nbsp;</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Walking the Yukon Trail</strong>
        <p><br><strong>(A)</strong>&nbsp; ………..&nbsp; The name "Yukon Trail" conjures images of a rugged, pristine vastness, lying deep in the wilderness along the border between Alaska and the mountains of western Canada. It should because they were carved into the Yukon to give gold prospectors access to the previously inaccessible reaches of that beautiful but forbidding country. Some of these trails still exist, giving hikers the opportunity to explore the landscape of the Yukon.</p>
        <p><strong>(B)</strong>&nbsp; ………..&nbsp; Strictly speaking, there are multiple "Yukon Trails," or routes used by prospectors and settlers seeking access to the depths of the Yukon during the Klondike Gold Rush. These include the Overland Trail in Canada and the international Chilkoot Trail. No modern trail in the Yukon actually bears the name "The Yukon Trail."</p>
        <p><strong>(C)​&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;………..&nbsp; Chilkoot Trail is possibly the most accessible because it connects the US Klondike Gold Rush National Historic Park with Canada's Chilkoot Trail National Historic Site – both ends of the trail are in a national park facility. Although the trail is only 33 miles long, its difficult terrain and strenuous nature make hiking it a backpacking and camping expedition. According to the Parks Canada, just hiking the almost 8 miles from Sheep Camp to Happy Camp takes 12 hours.</p>
        <p><strong>(D)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;………..&nbsp; Another Yukon trail is the Dawson Overland Trail, perhaps best known for its part of the famed Yukon Quest dog-sledding race. The modern trail runs 70 miles from Whitehorse and Braeburn Lodge, entirely within the Canadian Yukon. However, the classic Overland Trail ran all the way to Dawson City, near the US-Canadian border, and from there into Alaska. This route started as a dog-sledding freight path and is now used by hikers, horseback riders, dog-sledders and snowmobilers.</p>
        <p><strong>(E)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;………..&nbsp; The Yukon is a habitat for both grizzly and black bears, so safety precautions must be followed. The National Park Service requests that all hikers on Chilkoot Trail use their bear-safe food containers and camp only in designated areas. If this is not possible, hang your food in its container some distance from the camp using a rope and a bear pole, so it is both out of reach and a safe distance away. Make plenty of noise while hiking to give bears warning of your approach.</p>
        <p><strong>(F)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;………..&nbsp; Due to frigid temperatures, heavy snowfall and the risk of avalanche, hiking on the Chilkoot Trail in winter is not recommended by either US or Canadian park authorities. Snows persist in the upper reaches of the trail well into June, so the Chilkoot hiking season is between mid-June and late September. The Dawson route, on the other hand, is open all year to hikers using snowshoes.</p>

&nbsp;
<p><strong>(A)</strong> …………….&nbsp; What are seahorses? The oddly shaped and upright-swimming seahorse seems an unlikely fish. Yet more than 45 species live in coastal waters around the globe. Scientists have learned their basic biology, but much remains unknown about these charismatic animals. It can be difficult to classify seahorses using just visual markings and characteristics because individual seahorses within the same species sometimes look very different from one another. This is because seahorses can change their shape and color to blend in with their surroundings. So scientists have used genetic research to help differentiate between the species.</p>

<p><strong>(B)</strong> …………….&nbsp; The head of a seahorse may resemble a horse’s, but each seahorse has a look all its own. Most are spotted, speckled, or striped, and some are decked out in skin frills, spikes, and crowns. Colors vary and can change with the twitch of a muscle to offer camouflage or to signal a foe or potential mate. Seahorses have flesh-covered bony plates instead of scales, eyes that work independently of each other, and prehensile tails—used to grip holdfasts on the seafloor to avoid drifting and, during courtship, to link to each other. The tiniest species is no bigger than a lima bean; the largest can reach more than a foot from head to tail tip.</p>

<p><strong>(C)</strong> …………….&nbsp; Preferring calm, shallow waters, seahorses thrive in seagrass beds, mangroves, estuaries, and coral reefs in temperate and tropical waters around the world. Relatively inept swimmers, the fish get around with frantic beats (up to 70 times per second) of a dorsal (back) fin and rely on tiny pectoral fins for stability and steering. Easily exhausted, many are swept away in heavy currents or killed in storm-roiled seas.</p>

<p><strong>(D)</strong> …………….&nbsp; Seahorses hold still and wait for krill, copepods, fish larvae, and other tiny edibles to float by and then nab them with remarkable speed. Toothless and lacking a stomach for food storage, the animals use their long snouts like vacuum cleaners to suck up plankton nearly continually. The seahorse is a very unusual animal. Sure, it's a fish, but it's also so un-fish-like. Along with its horse-shaped head, it has eyes like a chameleon that can move independently and a prehensile tail that, similar to a hand, can grip objects. As our understanding of these unique creatures grows, the data is making us realize that seahorses need our help.</p>

<p><strong>(E) </strong>…………….&nbsp; Seahorses are dancers at heart, circling one another or a floating object, flashing colors, and intertwining tails during a sometimes days-long courtship. Said to mate for life, a pair’s commitment may actually be fragile: If the two are separated for a time, or if the male’s health declines, a female may switch partners rather than stick with her original choice. In a reproductive role reversal unique to seahorses and others in the family Syngnathidae (which also includes pipefish and sea dragons), males experience pregnancy. During mating a female uses a tube called an “ovipositor” to place her eggs into the male’s frontal “brood pouch.” He then incubates, nourishes, and carries the young to term—usually two to four weeks. With powerful contractions he’ll give birth to fully developed fry, from dozens to more than a thousand depending on the species. Newborn seahorses, set adrift, are immediately vulnerable to predators, and few survive their early days.</p>

<p><strong>(F)</strong> …………….&nbsp; Pollution and coastal development harm seahorses, but the top threat is rampant overfishing. Commercial fishermen scoop up millions of seahorses a year as bycatch. There is also targeted fishing of seahorses to supply tourist demand for dried trinkets and an unregulated traditional-medicine market in Asia. Population data for many seahorse species is sparse, but scientists believe the vast majority are threatened and some populations in rapid decline. How warming seas due to climate change will affect seahorses long term is unknown. Protecting seahorses will require protecting their shallow-water habitats from pollution and destructive development, enforcing commercial-fishing laws aimed at stemming the bycatch problem, and reducing demand for these animals as trinkets and supposed medicinal supplements.</p>

        <strong>The Great Plague 1665 – the Black Death</strong>
        <p><em>by Ben Johnson</em><br><br><strong>(A)</strong>&nbsp; ………&nbsp; In two successive years of the 17th century London suffered two terrible disasters. In the spring and summer of 1665 an outbreak of Bubonic Plague spread from parish to parish until thousands had died and the huge pits dug to receive the bodies were full. In 1666 the Great Fire of London destroyed much of the centre of London, but also helped to kill off some of the black rats and fleas that carried the plague bacillus.</p>
        <p><strong>(B)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;………&nbsp; Bubonic Plague was known as the Black Death and had been known in England for centuries. The plague started in the East, possibly China, and quickly spread through Europe. The plague lasted in London until the late autumn when the colder weather helped kill off the fleas. The King, Charles II and his Court left London and fled to Oxford. Those people who could sent their families away from London during these months, but the poor had no recourse but to stay. In his diary, Samuel Pepys gives a vivid account of the empty streets in London, as all who could had left in an attempt to flee the pestilence.</p>
        <p><strong>(C)&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>………&nbsp; Whole communities were wiped out and corpses littered the streets as there was no one left to bury them. It began in London in the poor, overcrowded parish of St. Giles-in-the-Field. It started slowly at first but by May of 1665, 43 had died. In June, 6137 people died, in July, 17036 people and at its peak in August, 31159 people died. In all, 15% of the population perished during that terrible summer. It was a ghastly disease. The victim’s skin turned black in patches and inflamed glands or ‘buboes’ in the groin, combined with compulsive vomiting, swollen tongue and splitting headaches made it a horrible, agonizing killer. Incubation took a mere four to six days and when the plague appeared in a household, the house was sealed, thus condemning the whole family to death! These houses were distinguished by a painted red cross on the door and the words, ‘Lord have mercy on us’. At night the corpses were brought out in answer to the cry, ’Bring out your dead’, put in a cart and taken away to the plague pits. One called the Great Pit was at Aldgate in London and another at Finsbury Fields.</p>
        <p><strong>(D)&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>………&nbsp; It was believed that holding a posy of flowers to the nose kept away the plague and to this day judges are still given a nose-gay to carry on ceremonial occasions as a protection against the plague! A song about the plague is still sung by children. ‘Ring-a-ring of roses‘ describes in great detail the symptoms of the plague and ends with ‘All fall down’. The last word, ‘dead’, is omitted today.</p>
        <p><strong>(E)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;………&nbsp; The plague spread to many parts of England. York was one city badly affected. The plague victims were buried outside the city walls and it is said that they have never been disturbed since then, as a precaution against a resurgence of the dreaded plague. The grassy embankments below the city walls are the sites of these plague pits. In some towns and villages in England there are still the old market crosses which have a depression at the foot of the stone cross. This was filled with vinegar during times of plague as it was believed that vinegar would kill any germs on the coins and so contain the disease.</p>
        <p><strong>(F)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;………&nbsp; Over the centuries Bubonic Plague has broken out in Europe and the Far East. In 1900 there were outbreaks of plague in places as far apart as Portugal and Australia. Influenza seems to be the modern form of plague. At the end of World War One an influenza outbreak circled the world during 1918 – 1919. Within a year 20 million people had died world-wide.</p>

        <p><strong>Read the text below. Six sentences&nbsp;have been removed from this text so that there are six gaps.</strong><br><br><strong>The Namib Desert</strong><br><br><b>(A)</b>&nbsp;……….. Covering an area of 31,274 sq. mi (81,000 sq. km), the Namib is a coastal desert, situated along the south-western coast of the African continent. Stretching over 1200mi (2000km), the Namib crosses Angola, Namibia and South Africa. Characterised by red sand dunes that can reach impressive heights, the Namib is considered to be particularly old, even by geological standard.</p>
        <p><strong>(B)</strong> ……….. The word ‘Namib’ is of Nama origin, and means ‘open space’. Geologists believe that the Namib Desert is the world’s oldest desert. It is thought that an arid climate began to dominate in the region approximately 55 million years old, before changing to a semi-arid climate 14-18 million years ago. The Namib is home to the highest sand dunes in the world; some of which can reach over 1280ft (390m) high and can even be seen from space. Diamonds are the most important mineral asset found in the Namib Desert. Due to the lightweight nature of diamonds and the ease of theft, the entire region where the diamonds are situated has been declared a Prohibited Area, totally closed to public access.</p>
        <p><strong>(C)</strong> ……….. The Namib experiences less than 1cm of rain annually and is almost entirely barren. Strangely, whilst the region is virtually rainless, its air is typically at or near to saturation point, and fog is very common. The coastal regions have a steady temperature throughout the day and seasons of 9-20C.The wind blows inland pushing moisture ladened air from the sea inland forming thick fog and providing plants and wildlife with a rare reliable water source. Inland temperatures vary much more and they can be freezing overnight and reach 45C during daylight hours. Rainfall is rare along the coast and central regions of the desert but it increases as the desert rises towards the towering Great Escarpment at its rear. Many streams run from this rock formation back through the desert towards the sea. Few reach it as they evaporate or soak below the desert. These water reserves are tapped to support the desert’s few towns.</p>
        <p><strong>(D)</strong> ……….. Whilst there are other coastal deserts (such as the Atacama) bounded by cool ocean currents, the Namib is the only one in which endemic plants and animals have evolved in virtually barren dunes. In fact, the Namib is teeming with animals, including elephants, rhinos, Hartmann’s zebra, lions, gemsbok and the black-faced impala.</p>
        <p><strong>(E) </strong>……….. A number of rare and interesting plants are present in the Namib Desert, such as the Welwitschia Mirabilis, which consists only of 2 leaves and a stem, and is estimated to reach up to 2000 years old. It can grow up to 6-feet high, and 24-feet wide, and was referred to by Darwin as the ‘the platypus of the plant kingdom. Another bizarre plant is the Quiver Tree, which effectively cuts off its own branches in times of severe drought in order to save moisture loss through its leaves.</p>
        <p><strong>(F) </strong>……….. The Namib is well-protected by a range of national parks, such as the Namib-Naukluft National Park (19,215 sq. mi / 49,768 sq. km) which protects the central area of the region. In fact, most of the desert is covered by some level of protection as can be seen by the map below. In 2012 a stretch of the coastal desert was designated a World Heritage site.</p>

        <p><strong>Read the text below. Six sentences&nbsp;have been removed from this text so that there are six gaps.</strong><br><br><strong>Blackbeard: History of the Dreaded Pirate</strong><br><br><strong>(A) </strong>……… He and other pirates plagued shipping lanes off North America and throughout the Caribbean in the early-eighteenth century: an era commonly referred to as the "Golden Age of Piracy." Despite his legendary reputation, little is known about the early life of Blackbeard. Even his true name is uncertain, though it is usually given as some variation of Edward Thatch or Teach. It is believed that he served as a privateer during Queen Anne's War (1701 - 1714),&nbsp;<strong>(B)&nbsp;</strong>……… The earliest primary source document that mentions Blackbeard by name dates to the summer of 1717. Other records indicate that by the fall of 1717 Blackbeard was operating off Delaware and Chesapeake bays in conjunction with two other pirate captains, Benjamin Hornigold and Stede Bonnet. Blackbeard served an apprenticeship under Hornigold before becoming a pirate captain in his own right.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>(C)&nbsp;</strong> ……… Late in the fall of 1717, the pirates made their way to the eastern Caribbean. It was here, off the island of Martinique, that Blackbeard and his fellow pirates captured the French slaveship La Concorde -- a vessel he would keep as his flagship and rename Queen Anne's Revenge. After crossing the Atlantic during its third journey, and only 100 miles from Martinique, the French ship encountered Blackbeard and his company. According to a primary account, the pirates were aboard two sloops, one with 120 men and twelve cannon, and the other with thirty men and eight cannon. With the French crew already reduced by sixteen fatalities and another thirty-six seriously ill from scurvy and dysentery, the French were powerless to resist. After the pirates fired two volleys at La Concorde, Captain Dosset surrendered the ship. The pirates took La Concorde to the island of Bequia in the Grenadines where the French crew and the enslaved Africans were put ashore. While the pirates searched La Concorde, the French cabin boy, Louis Arot, informed them of the gold dust that was aboard. The pirates searched the French officers and crew and seized the gold. The cabin boy and three of his fellow French crewmen voluntarily joined the pirates, and ten others were taken by force including a pilot, three surgeons, two carpenters, two sailors, and the cook. Blackbeard and his crew decided to keep La Concorde and left the French the smaller of the two pirate sloops. The French gave their new and much smaller vessel the appropriate name Mauvaise Rencontre (Bad Encounter) and, in two trips, succeeded in transporting the remaining Africans from Bequia to Martinique.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>(D)&nbsp;</strong> ……… 1717-1718. Leaving Bequia in late November, Blackbeard cruised the Caribbean in his new ship, now renamed Queen Anne's Revenge, taking prizes and adding to his fleet. From the Grenadines, Blackbeard sailed north along the Lesser Antilles plundering ships near St. Vincent, St. Lucia, Nevis, and Antigua, and by early December&nbsp;he had arrived off the eastern end of Puerto Rico. From there, a former captive reported that the pirates were headed to Samana Bay in Hispaniola (Dominican Republic). By April 1718, the pirates were off the Turneffe Islands in the Bay of Honduras. It was there that Blackbeard captured the sloop Adventure, forcing the sloop's captain, David Herriot, to join him. Sailing east once again, the pirates passed near the Cayman Islands and captured a Spanish sloop off Cuba that they also added to their flotilla. Blackbeard then turned to terrorizing Charleston in 1718. Turning north, they sailed through the Bahamas and proceeded up the North American coast. In May 1718, the pirates arrived off Charleston, South Carolina, with Queen Anne's Revenge and three smaller sloops. In perhaps the most brazen act of his piratical career, Blackbeard blockaded the port of Charleston for nearly a week. The pirates seized several ships attempting to enter or leave the port and detained the crew and passengers of one ship, the Crowley, as prisoners. As ransom for the hostages, Blackbeard demanded a chest of medicine. Once delivered, the captives were released, and the pirates continued their journey up the coast.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>(E)</strong>&nbsp;……… Soon after leaving Charleston, Blackbeard's fleet tried to enter Old Topsail Inlet in North Carolina, now known as Beaufort Inlet. During that attempt, Queen Anne's Revenge and the sloop Adventure grounded on a sandbar and were abandoned. Research has uncovered two eyewitness accounts that shed light on where the two pirate vessels were lost. But was the loss of QAR Blackbeard's gambit? According to a deposition given by David Herriot, the former captain of Adventure, Blackbeard intentionally grounded Queen Anne's Revenge and Adventure in order to break up the company, which by this time had grown to over 300 pirates. Intentional or not, that is what happened as Blackbeard marooned some pirates and left Beaufort with a hand picked crew and most of the valuable plunder.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>(F)&nbsp;</strong> ……… Blackbeard's piratical career ended six months later at Ocracoke Inlet on the North Carolina coast. There he encountered an armed contingent sent by Virginia Governor Alexander Spotswood and led by Royal Navy Lieutenant Robert Maynard. In a desperate battle aboard Maynard's sloop, Blackbeard and a number of his fellow pirates were killed. Maynard returned to Virginia with the surviving pirates and the grim trophy of Blackbeard's severed head hanging from the sloop's bowsprit.</p>

Spanish Bullfighting<br>
<br>
<strong>(A)</strong>&nbsp; ……….&nbsp; The Spanish people consider types of bullfighting as art forms which are intimately linked with their country’s history, art and culture.&nbsp; Pressure groups attempt to lobby against bullfighting yet the King of Spain himself has allegedly stated that the day the EU bans bullfighting is the day Spain leaves the EU.</p>
        <p><strong>(B)</strong>&nbsp; ……….&nbsp; They were popular spectacles in ancient Rome, but it was in the Iberian Peninsula that these contests were fully developed by the Moors from North Africa who overran Andalucia in AD 711. Bullfighting developed into a ritualistic occasion observed in connection with feast days, on which the conquering Moors, mounted on highly trained horses, confronted and killed the bulls. Whilst bullfighting maintains strong support in its heartlands of Madrid, Andalucia and Extremadura it has been banned in Catalonia.</p>
        <p><strong>(C)</strong>&nbsp; ……….&nbsp; All major Spanish cities have impressive bullrings but probably the most outstanding are those in Madrid, Seville, and Ronda. The Madrid’s Bullring is La Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas which was built in 1929 and was first used in 1931. It is the most important bullring in the world with a capacity of 25,000. Every seat is taken every evening during the world-renowned San Isidro Bullfighting festival in June. The Seville Bullring is very old Building of the Maestranza Bullring in Seville began in 1758 making it Spain’s oldest Plaza de Toros. The origin of modern-day bullfighting on foot (rather than horseback) can be traced back to here and Ronda. It is one of the most charming bullrings in the country and although its capacity is only 12,500, it attracts the top bullfighters.&nbsp; You can see bullfights in Seville from April (during Seville’s Feria de Abril) through to October. Check the bullfight calendar as they don’t take place every weekend.</p>
        <p><strong>(D)</strong>&nbsp; ……….&nbsp; It is one of the oldest and most beautiful in Spain. Previously it had been Philip II’s centre for horsemanship training (Real Maestranza de Caballeria). Bulls were used in this training and when one day an aristocrat fell from his horse one Francisco Romero came to his help by using his hat to distract it. The hat was replaced by a cape and modern day bullfighting was born. Romero’s grandson, Pedro Romero, developed all the passes and moves which to this day are seen at a bullfight. He retired in his eighties after killing more than 5,600 bulls without ever being hurt. Thus Ronda is considered the home of bullfighting. You can visit the bullring in Ronda which houses a small bullfighting museum. The bullfighting season in Ronda is from April to October though fights are quite infrequent. Check with the tourist office next to the bullring.</p>
        <p><strong>(E)&nbsp;</strong> ……….&nbsp; It depends on their position in the bullfighting arena. The ones in the shade (sombra) are more expensive than the ones in the sun (sol). Some seats are designated as sun and shade (sol y sombra) because they begin in the sun but move to shade as the afternoon progresses. Seats located closest to the bullfight are also more expensive than those near the back. So ones near the ringside barrier (barrera) which are also in the shade are the most expensive. Buying tickets at the actual arena can prove a major hassle as it is difficult to work out which ticket window (taquilla) you should go to and without a very good level of Spanish it is almost impossible to explain or find out which tickets you wish to buy. Just study the poster of the event in advance to decide where you want to sit then ask for those seats or simply copy the name of the seating area and show it to the ticket seller.</p>
        <p><strong>(F)&nbsp;</strong> ……….&nbsp; Bulls can suffer a severe and tortuous death. Many animal rights activists often protest bullfighting in Spain and other countries, citing the needless endangerment of the bull and bullfighter. Some cities around the world where bullfighting was once popular, including Coslada (Spain), Mouans-Sartoux (France), and Teocelo (Mexico), have even declared themselves to be anti-bullfighting cities. Other places, including some towns in Catalonia (Spain), have ceased killing the bull in the fight, but continue bullfighting.</p>

        <p><strong>Read the text below. Six sentences&nbsp;have been removed from this text so that there are six gaps.</strong><br><br><strong>Marie Curie&nbsp;</strong><br><br><strong>(A)</strong> ………. Marie Curie was a Polish-French scientist who won two Nobel prizes. Her work focused on radioactivity, which is a property of some chemical elements. (Radioactive elements give off unending rays of energy.) Curie helped to discover two radioactive elements, polonium and radium. She also successfully isolated, or separated, radium from the rock in which it is found. Science, medicine, and industry soon found important uses for these elements. For example, radium was used for many years to treat cancer.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>(B)</strong> ………. Marie Curie was born Maria Salomea Sklodowska on November 7, 1867. She was born in Warsaw, Poland, which was then under Russian rule. Her parents were teachers who valued education. But women in Poland could not get university degrees. So, Maria and her sister, Bronislawa, saved enough money to study in France. In 1891 Maria entered the Sorbonne, a university in Paris. She began calling herself Marie.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>(C)</strong> ………. Within three years, Marie completed degrees in physics and math. Marie decided to investigate the rays from uranium – this was a new and very exciting field to work in. She began working with a French scientist, Pierre Curie, whom she married in 1895. By the summer of 1898, Marie’s husband Pierre had become as excited about her discoveries as Marie herself. The Curies had two daughters, Irène and Ève.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>(D)</strong> ………. In 1896 a French scientist named Henri Becquerel discovered the unusual rays of energy given off by the element uranium. Marie began studying the phenomenon, which she named radioactivity. In 1898 the Curies announced their discovery of radium and polonium. They named polonium after Marie’s homeland of Poland. In 1903 the Curies shared the Nobel Prize for Physics with Becquerel.</p>
        <p><strong>(E)</strong> ………. After Pierre died in 1906, Marie carried on their research. She also became the first woman professor at the Sorbonne. In 1911 she won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for isolating pure radium. During World War I, Marie helped to build a car that carried X ray equipment to doctors treating wounded soldiers. After the war, Marie continued her study of radioactive substances and their use in medicine. Her Radium Institute in Paris became an important centre of scientific research.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>(F)</strong> ………. Marie did not realize that working with radioactive material could make her ill. She died of leukemia, a type of cancer, on July 4, 1934. Irène Curie carried on her mother’s work. She and her husband, Frédéric Joliot, won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1935. Ève Curie wrote a biography of her mother (1937) that was made into a movie.</p>

        <p><strong>Read the text below. Six sentences&nbsp;have been removed from this text so that there are six gaps.</strong><br><br><strong>Our Passion for Gardening</strong><br><br><strong>(A)</strong>&nbsp;........... Gardening, the art and science of cultivating plants, has been a cherished human activity for centuries. It encompasses a wide range of practices, from nurturing ornamental flowers to growing food for sustenance. The history of gardening is not only a reflection of human horticultural achievements but also a testament to the cultural significance that gardens hold in different societies around the world.</p>
        <p><strong>(B)</strong>&nbsp;........... Community gardening projects have also surged in popularity. These initiatives bring people together to cultivate shared green spaces, fostering a sense of community and environmental stewardship. Urban community gardens provide a welcome respite from concrete jungles, promoting sustainable practices and food security.</p>
        <p><strong>(C)</strong> ........... Modern gardeners benefit from a plethora of tools and equipment, from motorized lawnmowers to automated irrigation systems. These innovations have made gardening more accessible and efficient, allowing enthusiasts to create and maintain diverse types of gardens, from intricate formal designs to wild, naturalistic landscapes.</p>
        <p><strong>(D)</strong> ........... Despite the many joys and benefits of gardening, it also raises concerns. Issues such as water usage, pesticide application, and habitat destruction have prompted gardeners to reconsider their practices. Sustainable gardening methods, such as organic gardening and xeriscaping, aim to minimize the environmental impact while preserving the beauty and functionality of gardens. Gardening, once purely an individual pursuit, has now become a collective effort to protect the planet.</p>
        <p><strong>(E)</strong> ........... Gardens have played a multifaceted role in human culture. In ancient civilizations like Babylon and Egypt, gardens were symbols of power and opulence, designed to impress and inspire awe. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, exemplified this. In contrast, medieval European gardens were often practical, focused on growing herbs and vegetables for medicinal and culinary purposes. Over time, the emphasis shifted from pure functionality to aesthetics.</p>
        <p><strong>(F)</strong> ........... One significant aspect of gardening is its therapeutic benefits. Studies have shown that spending time in a garden can reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. The act of tending to plants and watching them grow can provide a sense of accomplishment and peace. Gardening therapy programs have gained popularity as a means of improving mental well-being.</p>

You'll never believe what the chocolate that we enjoy today looks like from the beginning. <strong>(A)</strong>&nbsp;.………. The pulp and the cocoa beans are removed from the tree and placed in buckets for fermentation. Depending on the type of cacao tree and the manufacturer, the process can take a week or longer.</p>
        <p>Fermentation gives the beans some semblance of the chocolate taste we like. Once the fermentation process is complete, the cocoa beans are spread out so that they can dry naturally in the sun.</p>
        <p>It is the dried beans that are shipped to chocolate manufacturers all over the world. <strong>(B)</strong> .………. Roasting intensifies the final taste of the chocolate. When the beans are ready, the shells are then removed. What you are left with is the essence of the bean - cocoa butter and other chocolate solids.</p>
        <p>A machine grinds the shelled beans into a paste that is referred to as chocolate liquor even though it is not a liquid and does not contain alcohol. <strong>(C)</strong> .………. if you will, that varies from manufacturer to manufacturer.</p>
        <p>Even though some of the ingredients are trade secrets, the process is quite similar. The chocolate paste goes through a machine that removes the cocoa butter. <strong>(D)</strong> .………. Substances like cocoa butter (re-added), sugar, milk, oil and the like are added to reconstitute the powder into chocolate.</p>
        <p><strong>(E)</strong> .………. The chocolate is mixed in a large machine until it is the consistency the manufacturer likes. <strong>(F)</strong> .……….&nbsp;</p>

Quit Hiding: How Public Speaking Is Key To Standing Out</strong><br><br>
When was the last time you stood up in front of a crowd and became the centre of attention? <strong>(A)</strong> ………. Public speaking helped me grow my business. Here is how:

<p>1. Authenticity is key. Most people only want to do business with people who can truly help them reach a goal and reach it quickly. Your message needs to reflect who you are, what you do and, most importantly, what you can do for others. <strong>(B)</strong> ……….</p>

<p>2. Be the expert. No one wants to see an uncomfortable person reading off slides. <strong>(C)</strong> …… When the room feels awkward for you, you'll lose credibility and possibly sales.&nbsp;Be confident in what you're saying, back yourself up with statistics and prove your worth to your audience.</p>

<p>3. Make an offer they can’t refuse. When the crowd likes you as a person, trusts your expertise and is hungry to do business with you, make it easy for them to move forward. Offer a special price for the first 20 who sign up, throw in a bonus session or provide a ticket to your next event. <strong>(D)</strong> ……….</p>

<p>If you are just starting out, start small. Make the first move and step out from behind the screen. Attend networking events in your local area. <strong>(E)</strong> …… Use these as an opportunity to master your quick pitch and test out your messaging.</p>

<p>Once you’ve attended a few events and begun making new connections, it's easy to use your contacts to land presenting spots at networking events and lunches. Once you’re there, make yourself seen. <strong>(F)</strong> ……….</p>

THE STORY OF THE TEDDY BEAR</strong><br><br>
Did you know that the Teddy Bear was invented in honour of President Theodore Roosevelt? It all began when Theodore Roosevelt was on a bear hunting trip near Onward, Mississippi on November 14, 1902. Mississippi's Governor Andrew H. Longino had invited him, but unlike other hunters in the group, <strong>(A)</strong>&nbsp;……….</p>
        <p>Roosevelt's assistants, led by Holt Collier, a born slave and former Confederate cavalryman, cornered and tied a black bear to a willow tree. <strong>(B)</strong> ………. Viewing this as extremely unsportsmanlike, Roosevelt refused to shoot the bear. <strong>(C)</strong> ………. The articles recounted the story of the president who refused to shoot a bear. However, it was not just any president, it was Theodore Roosevelt the big game hunter!</p>
        <p>Clifford Berryman, a political cartoonist, read the article and decided to lightheartedly satirise the president's refusal to shoot the bear. <strong>(D)</strong> ………. Morris Michtom, a Brooklyn candy shop owner, saw the cartoon and had an idea. He and his wife Rose also made stuffed animals, and Michtom decided to create a stuffed toy bear and dedicate it to the president who refused to shoot a bear. <strong>(E)</strong> ……….</p>
        <p>After receiving Roosevelt's permission to use his name, Michtom mass produced the toy bears which were so popular that he soon founded the Ideal Toy Company. <strong>(F)</strong> ………. and its origin can be traced back to Theodore's fateful hunting trip in 1902.</p>

        <strong>THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF BODY LANGUAGE</strong>
        <p><br>
Geoffrey Beattie, at the University of Manchester, found that a woman is instinctively four times more likely to mirror another woman than a man is to mirror another man.&nbsp;<strong>(A)</strong>&nbsp;………, but men are reluctant to mirror a woman’s gestures or posture – unless he is in courtship mode.</p>
        <p>When a woman says she can ‘see’ that someone doesn’t agree with the group opinion, she is actually ‘seeing’ the disagreement.&nbsp;<strong>(B)</strong>&nbsp;………. and they are showing their disagreement by not mirroring the group’s body language. How women can ‘see’ disagreement, anger, lying or feeling hurt has always been a source of amazement to most men.&nbsp;<strong>(C)</strong>&nbsp;………. and don’t consciously notice mirroring discrepancies.</p>
        <p>Men and women’s brains are programmed differently to express different emotions through facial expressions and body language. Typically, a woman can use an average of six main facial expressions in a ten-second listening period to reflect and then feedback the speaker’s emotions.&nbsp;<strong>(D)</strong>&nbsp;………. To someone watching, it can look as if the events being discussed are happening to both women.</p>
        <p>A woman reads the meaning of what is being said through the speaker’s voice and tone and his emotional condition through his body language.&nbsp;<strong>(E)</strong>&nbsp;………. Most men are daunted by the prospect of using facial feedback while listening, but it pays big dividends for the man who becomes good at it.</p>
        <p>Some men say,&nbsp;<strong>(F)</strong>&nbsp;………. but research with these techniques shows that when a man mirrors a woman’s facial expressions as she talks, she will describe him as caring, intelligent, interesting and attractive.</p>

        <p><br><strong>WHAT CAUSES A FALLING STAR?</strong><br><br><strong>StarChild – NASA Kids</strong><br><br>
A “falling star” or a “shooting star” has nothing to do at all with a star! <strong>(A)</strong> ………. The short-lived trail of light the burning meteorite produces is called a meteor. <strong>(B)</strong> ……… If any part of the meteoroid survives burning up and actually hits the Earth, that remaining bit is then called a meteorite.</p>
        <p>At certain times of the year, you are likely to see a great number of meteors in the night sky. <strong>(C)</strong> ……… and they occur when the Earth passes through the trail of debris left by a comet as it orbits the Sun. <strong>(D)</strong> ……… For example, the Leonid Meteor Shower, or Leonids, appear to originate in the constellation Leo. It is important to understand that the meteoroids (and therefore the meteors) do not really originate from the constellations or any of the stars in the constellations, however. <strong>(E)</strong> ……… Associating the shower name with the region of the sky they seem to come from just helps astronomers know where to look!</p>
        <p>Note that one of the best meteor showers, the Perseids, happens in August. The “peak time” is when you are likely to see the largest number of meteors per hour. <strong>(F)</strong> ………</p>

Fantastic Benefits of Arts and Crafts for Kids</strong><br><br>
In this day and age, many parents resort to technology in order to keep their kids entertained and occupied, completely forgetting the benefits of arts and crafts. True, technology is very useful, and kids should be introduced to it, but it should never come at the expense of them playing and making things with their own hands. <strong>(A)</strong> ………. and here are some of them.<br>
<br>
<strong>It improves their coordination and fine motor skills.</strong><br>
Arts and crafts usually require kids to use both hands in a certain manner, which can help them develop fine motor skills and bilateral coordination.<strong> (B)</strong> ………. – and kids enjoy doing them. This can help them develop faster and become more skilled in other daily activities such as tying their shoes, dressing, using kitchenware, etc.<br>
<br>
<strong>It helps them express themselves.</strong><br>
Kids tend to be very visual about everything that happens around them, and they generally absorb a lot of information every day. <strong>(C)</strong> ………. Those kids may look for different, more visual ways to express their emotions and thoughts – and arts and crafts can give them what they need. It is a safe environment that they can control and shape in any way they want by using any materials they like. <strong>(D)</strong> ……….

<p><br><strong>It makes them more creative and productive.</strong><br>
There are no limits to children’s imagination, and arts and crafts are a great way for them to turn that endless imagination into something more productive. <strong>(E)</strong> ………. which allows children to explore different options and pick those that they find the most enjoyable. And who knows, they might even discover a fun hobby, like drawing, that can later become a lucrative career, like graphic design.<br>
<br>
<strong>It helps them develop other skills.</strong><br>
Young kids usually begin using pens by scribbling random things. However, the thing is, the more they scribble, the better they will be at controlling the pen and their movements across the paper.<strong> (F)</strong> ………. In other words, the more they scribble, the faster they’ll master everything they need in order to write clearly. Also, you can encourage scribbling by giving them colorful gel pens—scribbling with such fun pens will make them want to do it all the time!</p>

Shelter is one of the fundamental requirements for every human being along with food and clothing. <strong>(A)</strong>&nbsp;………. So, humans need shelter to feel protected and for a sense of well being. It is a comfortable place for a person where one can rest, rejuvenate and revive. In different phases of human life, there were varied forms of shelter. The history of human life gets traced to the primitive era. During the Palaeolithic age, also referred to as the stone age, for survival and in search of food, human beings lived under the trees and in natural caves. This era was around 25000 years ago. <strong>(B)</strong> ………. During this period, humans started using grass and wood to make their shelter in the form of a tent or hut. After this, was the Megalithic age, where formation of places of worship took place using stone. There have been many changes and transitions.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>The Stone Age</strong><br>
In the prehistoric era, man relied on nature for shelter and protection. The earliest form of housing was in the way of trees where people got minimal protection from the sun, rain and cold weather. <strong>(C)</strong> ………. Another natural form of shelter was caves. These provide protection against weather but not from wild animals. The first man-made shelter got made with stones and tree branches. <strong>(D)</strong> ………. With time, materials like stone slabs, bones and animal hide got used to building a stable, comfortable and secure shelter. Later, man started to make clay blocks and used it as the building block.</p>
        <p><strong>Ancient Civilisations</strong><br>
Around 3100 BC, the ancient Egyptians started using sun-dried blocks to make flat-topped houses. Most domestic dwellings got built using perishable materials like wood and clay bricks. <strong>(E)</strong> ………. The Assyrians further improved the concept of sun-dried bricks after 600 years. They discovered that baking bricks in the fire could make them harder and enhance their durability. They also started glazing the bricks to strengthen them and for improving their resistance to water.</p>
        <p>The ancient Greeks also lived in well-made stone houses with slanted roofs. Most of the structures were made using sun-dried bricks or wooden framework with some fibrous material like straw or seaweed. <strong>(F)</strong> ………. They introduced the concept of central heating that provided them with protection from the cold weather. They started to lay down earthenware pipes under the floors and roof and ran hot water or air on them to heat.</p>

<br>
Are Expensive Pillows Worth the Money?</strong><br><br>
Lumpy, bumpy, flat and smelly might not be Doc, Dopey or Bashful's distant cousins, but they may be adjectives used to describe an old, uncomfortable pillow, which can make you sleepy and grumpy. <strong>(A)</strong> ………. But price isn’t necessarily a factor; a reasonably priced pillow may be just as comfortable as an expensive one.</p>
        <p><strong>Down to Feathers</strong><br>
In a 2012 blind study by "Consumer’s Report", participants preferred sleeping on a costlier down-filled pillow compared to a feather-filled pillow at about one-third the cost. If you’re shopping for the more expensive option, look for down-pillow buzzwords, such as “hypoallergenic”, “fill power” --- a fill power number of 600 is standard quality, while 800 or more means high quality, and “freshness assured” or “clean and dust-free”, as quality assurance. <strong>(B)</strong> ………. But an inexpensive feather pillow slipped into a padded, protective pillow cover, or a down-alternative pillow offers a way to save some money, and possibly rest just as comfortably. <strong>(C)</strong> ………. advises researchers at Harvard University, and may justify spending more money, if needed.<br>
<br>
<strong>Paying for Polyester</strong><br>
You could pay eight times the cost of an inexpensive polyester pillow for an expensive pillow, but, as the "Consumer's Report" study demonstrates, spending more money is likely going to mean getting better sleep. <strong>(D)</strong> ………. If you sleep on your side, go for a thicker, firm pillow to fill in the space created by your shoulder.</p>
        <p><strong>Mind Your Memory Foam</strong><br>
The higher price of a memory-foam pillow may be highly overrated, the "Consumer's Report" study shows. Try an inexpensive memory-foam pillow, at around one-third the price of the costlier versions. <strong>(E)</strong> ………. paying a bit more for a memory-foam pillow with a cooling-gel surface should help you rest easier.</p>
        <p><strong>The Price of Longevity</strong><br>
Your old pillows need to be replaced --- possibly more often than you realise. You may have noticed that old pillows tend to “put on some weight” over the years. The added weight is the weight of skin cells, dust mites, fungus and mold that accumulate with time. <strong>(F)</strong> ………. Before washing any pillow, refer to the care label and washing instructions. Replace your pillow at least every other year, but sooner if it becomes lumpy, bumpy, flat or smelly.</p>

          <strong>What is Flat Pack Furniture?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Flat packs, also known as ready-to-assemble furniture, known-down furniture, or self-assembly furniture are incredibly popular because of their affordability. This type of furniture is produced in flat parts and are assembled when purchased without the need for special tools (in most cases). <strong>(A)</strong>&nbsp;………. Depending on the piece of furniture, they can have 5 components to assemble, or over 50. One of the most known flat pack retailers is IKEA, with stores in over 25 countries.<br>
<br>
What is Flat Pack Furniture Made from?</p>
        <p>The materials used for the making of flat packs is either solid wood, medium-density fibreboard (MDF), or chipboard. MDF is the product of the residuals of softwood and hardwood mixed with wax and combined to form a panel stronger than chipboard. Chipboard is made from wood chippings, sawdust, wood shavings or particles, and are bound together into a board. <strong>(B)</strong> ………. The only disadvantage of it is that it is more susceptible to water damage. Solid wood can crack due to time or environment conditions, which is something that cannot happen to chipboard. MDF prices can vary as well, but if it is of a high quality, then it is much stronger than chipboard. <strong>(C)</strong> ………. It is often used in furniture such as desks, and cabinets.<br>
<br>
Advantages of Flat Pack Furniture</p>
        <p>&gt;&gt; One of the most famous advantages of flat pack furniture – affordable prices. <strong>(D)</strong> ………&nbsp; Also, they are said to be cheaper because they compensate for their low durability, but if properly maintained they can be very durable.</p>
        <p>&gt;&gt; They are easy to ship, disassemble and put together. Companies do not spend tons of money on shipping costs and transportation because customers can pick their furniture themselves and build them in their homes.</p>
        <p>&gt;&gt; Flat packs can be customised – there are many sites and hacks for improving, changing the design or style of flat packs. <strong>(E)</strong> ……….</p>
        <p>&gt;&gt; They are produced by machines, which cuts company costs a lot. <strong>(F)</strong> ……….</p>
        <p>&gt;&gt; This type of furniture is easily packed and moved from one place to another. If you ever move house, you can dismantle your furniture, put them in their flat boxes and easily transport and reassemble them</p>

<br>
Tomato: Fruit or Vegetable</strong><br><br>
No food straddles the line between fruit and vegetable more famously than the tomato. And while your elementary-school teacher or know-it-all friend may have informed you that tomatoes are technically fruits, the answer isn't so clear-cut. <strong>(A)</strong> ……….

<p>The explanation lies in the two different ways that "fruit" is defined. First, it is true that scientifically speaking, tomatoes are fruits. <strong>(B)</strong> ………. In a&nbsp;blog post, the dictionary explained it in simpler terms: "Anything that grows on a plant and is the means by which that plant gets its seeds out into the world is a fruit." <strong>(C)</strong> ………. &nbsp;(Cucumbers, capsicums, pumpkins and avocados are all fruits too, according to science.)</p>

<p>Vegetables, on the other hand, have a slightly murkier definition. It's a word we use to group together a wide range of plants whose parts are edible and herbaceous, like roots, stems, and leaves. <strong>(D)</strong> ………., while fruits are just the means by which certain plants spread their seeds.</p>

<p>"The thing a tomato plant produces isn't a part of the plant itself, any more than the egg a chicken lays is part of the chicken, <strong>(E)</strong> ……….,” Merriam-Webster wrote.<strong> (F)</strong> ………. And "fruit" can be a culinary term, too – described as "having a sweet pulp associated with the seed" and "used chiefly in a dessert or sweet course,"&nbsp;according to Merriam-Webster.</p>

<p>So scientifically, fruits don't have to be sweet, but in the kitchen, most people would classify the fruits that fall on the savoury side, like tomatoes, as vegetables. Nutritionists recognise the terms as they are commonly used, and tomatoes are&nbsp;listed as a vegetable&nbsp;under USDA guidelines.</p>

The image of Uncle Sam is based on a combination of two earlier American characters: Yankee Doodle and Brother Jonathan. Yankee Doodle was a derogatory term the British used for colonial Americans during the Revolutionary War. <strong>(A)</strong> ……….<br>
Though the origins of the name Uncle Sam are subject to some dispute, most historians believe that the name came from a New York merchant named Sam Wilson, known by his friends as “Uncle Sam”. <strong>(B)</strong> ……….&nbsp; The barrels were stamped with the initials U.S., for United States, but many associated the initials with “Uncle Sam” Wilson. <strong>(C)</strong> ……….&nbsp;<br>
Illustrations of Uncle Sam, <strong>(D)</strong> ………., began appearing shortly after the War of 1812. British cartoonists from Punch magazine were the first to fully develop the image of Uncle Sam as a tall, bearded, thin figure. American cartoonist Thomas Nast cemented the image of Uncle Sam in his own drawings during the 1870s.&nbsp;<br>
By the early 1900s, Uncle Sam had become known worldwide as a symbol for the United States. <strong>(E)</strong> ……….&nbsp; The U.S. government printed millions of these posters during World War I and used the image again during World War II. <strong>(F)</strong> ……….&nbsp; Most depictions today closely resemble Flagg’s famous illustration.<br>

Wisdom Teeth</strong><br><br>
Wisdom teeth were once an extremely valuable asset to our ancestors. When a typical diet consisted of chewy plants and uncooked meat, third molars (wisdom teeth), which fit easily into our ancestors’ larger jaws, were absolutely necessary. <strong>(A)</strong> ……….</p>
        <p>Today, our diets are not as rough as those of our ancestors. <strong>(B)</strong> ……….&nbsp; And yet, on average, about 65% of the human population is born with wisdom teeth which usually erupt between the ages of 17 and 25.</p>
        <p>Although wisdom teeth were incredibly advantageous for our ancestors, they pose a bit of a problem for the modern mouth. <strong>(C)</strong> ………., and so wisdom teeth are often either too big for the jaw or the jaws themselves are just too small. <strong>(D)</strong> ………. Because of this lack of space, molars often grow sideways, only partially emerging from the gums, or actually get trapped inside the gums and jawbone.</p>
        <p>These impacted wisdom teeth can be chronically contaminated with bacteria associated with infection, tooth decay, inflammation, and gum disease. <strong>(E)</strong> ……….&nbsp; Even when wisdom teeth come in fully, they are so far back in the mouth that it’s just too easy for food to get trapped, leading to plaque, cavities, and gum disease.<br>
<strong>(F)</strong> ………., nowadays, they pose a serious problem to oral health.&nbsp;</p>

Post War Migration in Australia</strong><br><br>
From the 1950s, Australia began to relax its ‘White Australia’ policy. In 1956, non-European residents were allowed to apply for citizenship. <strong>(A)</strong> ………. with a non-European country, in this case, Turkey.</p>
        <p>Then in 1972, Australians elected their first Labour government since 1948. As Minister for Immigration, Al Grassby radically changed official policy. The quota system, based on country of origin and preservation of racial ‘homogeneity’, was replaced by ‘structured selection’. <strong>(B)</strong> ………. rather than country of origin. In 1973, declaring Australia a ‘multicultural’ society, Al Grassby announced that every relic of past ethnic or racial discrimination had been abolished. The Australian Citizenship Act of that year declared that all migrants were to be accorded equal treatment.</p>
        <p><strong>(C)</strong> ………. More than 25 000 arrived in the next thirty years, initially from East Timor and then from Vietnam, China and most recently, the Middle East. All are subject to compulsory internment while their claims of refugee status are assessed. Although Australia has been criticised by the United Nations and Amnesty International for the injustice of interring all illegal migrants, particularly children, <strong>(D)</strong> ……….&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In 1988, the Fitzgerald Inquiry led to further changes in migration with a move away from ‘family reunion’ towards an emphasis on skilled and business categories. The assisted passage scheme had ended in 1981 and only refugees are given any level of support on their arrival in Australia. In 1996, for the first time in Australia’s migration history, the number of British migrants arriving fell to second place behind New Zealand. <strong>(E)</strong> ……….&nbsp; today, after New Zealand, it is people from China, South Africa and India. <strong>(F)</strong> ………. In 2006, the fastest growing refugee group was from Sudan followed by Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>

For the past few years, men’s ties have gotten skinnier and skinnier. Designers suddenly decided that wide, patterned ties were too reminiscent of a slimy politician or math teacher— <b>(A)</b>&nbsp;………. Hedi Slimane is the man pretty much single-handedly responsible for the look: he introduced it during his early-’00s Dior Homme days—along with scrawny, slim-cut suits—and continued pushing it forward while at both Saint Laurent, and Celine today. <strong>(B)</strong> ………. But halt the presses! The popular menswear trend may finally be on its way out—and Harry Styles is leading the charge.</p>
        <p>Performing on The Today Show in New York City yesterday, the singer took to the stage in an extra thick polka-dot tie. Skinny tie, who? <strong>(C)</strong> ………. Styles may be on to something with the go-big-or-go-home necktie: <strong>(D)</strong> ………., as seen at shows such as Off-White (it was printed with the Mona Lisa), E. Tautz (tucked into the trousers), and Prada (worn with a sweater vest). Like any trend, the pendulum often swings into the opposite direction, <strong>(E)</strong> ……….&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But Styles is also a notorious style risk-taker: he may be on board with the widened silhouette, but will other Hollywood gents follow suit? <strong>(F)</strong> ………. — just remember not to go too wide. But, as Styles proved this week, if you strike the balance right, it can look surprisingly fresh.</p>

<br>
Why You Should Take Your Children Camping</strong><br><br><strong>1. Camping helps children to develop a sense of adventure</strong> - Going camping, even if it’s just for one night is fun. A new environment, unfamiliar sights and sounds, other kids to meet and play with, a tent to help put up and sleeping under the stars all make for a fun-filled adventure. <strong>(A)</strong> ……….; promoting the positive outlook that underpins good mental health.<br>
<br>
<strong>2. Camping builds resilience </strong>- Children rarely move out of their comfort zone these days. With more children spending time indoors than ever before, their environment, for many, is predictable, secure and closely monitored. <strong>(B)</strong> ……….&nbsp; Working out where to pitch, helping to put up a tent, finding the campsite shop and being sent to pick up supplies, dealing with adversity (broken poles, forgotten tent pegs, bad weather), by comparison are all great ways of building resilience. <strong>(C)</strong> ……….&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>3. Camping gives children the freedom to explore, boosting creativity</strong> - Having the freedom to play, explore and generally behave the way children should is one of the vital elements missing from modern life for many children. <strong>(D)</strong> ……….&nbsp; Family-friendly campsites provide a safe, and relatively secure environment for children to play and explore in, giving them a sense of freedom. This freedom, combined with a more natural environment is a great way to boost creativity; instead of relying on a tablet or smartphone for entertainment, children use their imagination to play games and entertain themselves; something they typically don’t need to do when they’re at home.<br>
<br>
<strong>4. Camping&nbsp; brings children closer to nature</strong> - There is compelling evidence to support the claim that many children are now suffering from ‘nature deficit disorder‘, with many being unable to identify the most basic flora and fauna. <strong>(E)</strong> ……….; but I’m willing to bet that all of them would be able to correctly identify the McDonalds or Facebook logo. Spending time outdoors brings children closer to the natural world, and if they live in an urban environment, it is particularly important to ensure that a proportion of their free-time activities provide the chance to experience some of the wonder and beauty of nature. <strong>(F)</strong> ………., and camping is an excellent way to immerse children in the natural world.</p>

<br>
Imperial vs Metric</strong><br><br>
The Metric system started in France during the 1700’s. It is based on the metre (length), gram (weight, or more properly “mass”) and litre (volume). “Metric” comes from the word “metre.”&nbsp;<br>
There is also a system of prefixes for making things bigger (kilo- , mega- , giga- , tera- ) or smaller (milli- , micro- , nano- ) in multiples of 1000: think of your milligrams of medicines or your gigabytes of computing power. <strong>(A)</strong>&nbsp;……….<br>
The Imperial system, on the other hand, is based on the inch / foot / yard / mile (length), the ounce / pound / stone / hundredweight (weight / mass) and the fluid ounce / pint / quart / gallon (volume). The Imperial system is generally not decimal:</p><ul><li>LENGTH: There are 12 inches in a foot, 3 feet in a yard, and 1760 yards in a mile – a curious choice of number with a long and confusing history based on even older lengths called the FURLONG, POLE and CHAIN.</li><li>WEIGHT / MASS: There are 16 ounces in a pound, 14 pounds in a stone, and 8 stones in a hundredweight (or 7 stone 2 pounds if you’re in North America – somewhat confusingly!).</li><li>CAPACITY: <strong>(B)</strong> ……….</li></ul>
These bizarre conversion factors and cross-continental differences are confusing for countries that use the imperial system, whereas the metric system of prefixes deals effortlessly with the miniscule and enormous quantities of modern living – like microns or megabytes. <strong>(C)</strong> ………. : one cm3 is exactly equal to one ml (millilitre), and a litre of water weighs precisely one kilogram. Now, that’s beautiful!<br>
<br>
<strong>Which is more intuitive?</strong><br>
Let’s take length: Most everyday objects we measure are either something you use (a book, a door) or a person (how tall do you think she is?). The inch and foot are just the right size for these measurements!&nbsp;<br>
Most of us can imagine someone who’s 5 foot 4 quite easily: a foot is, well, about the length of an adult’s foot, and the inch is the distance between your thumb and forefinger when you hold them parallel as if to say “about this big”. But “one point six three metres” or “163cm” are both harder for us to process – <strong>(D)</strong> ……….<br>
Now, take weight: Again, the Imperial units were designed with everyday objects in mind – “four ounces of butter” is easier to handle than “114 grams”: the grams are too accurate! So although ingredients such as flour, sugar and butter are now sold by the kilo, many of us still use ounces to weigh them. When weighing ourselves, compare these three equal values: 159lbs, 11 and a bit stone, or 72kg. <strong>(E)</strong> ………. And finally, volume: now both systems are easy to picture: we all know what one pint and one litre look like (if you don’t then look for a pint glass and a one litre bottle of juice in your kitchen). <strong>(F)</strong> ……….<br>

        <p><strong>Read the text below. Six sentences&nbsp;have been removed from this text so that there are six gaps.</strong><br><br><strong>Book Review – Harry Potter and the&nbsp;​Philosopher’s Stone</strong><br><br>
The Philosopher’s Stone is the first in J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series of seven novels that have made her the most successful literary author of all time, selling in excess of 400 million copies world-wide. <strong>(A)</strong>&nbsp;……….&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Do the Harry Potter books live up to the hype? When I first began reading the Philosopher’s Stone, I was immediately struck by how good - and laugh-out-loud funny - the humour was. <strong>(B)</strong> ………. but Rowling has managed to infuse this book with a lovely wit and charm that will both amuse and delight adults and children.</p>
        <p>Here is an example, with the ending being particularly good:&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>"Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large, pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes and thick, blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head.</em><strong>(C)</strong> ………. <em>– Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig."</em></p>
        <p>There are characters in this book that will remind us of all the people we have met. <strong>(D)</strong> ………. or a bossy and interfering (yet kind-hearted) girl like Hermione. A large number of the younger readers will also be able to easily identify with Harry, especially with his initial feelings of isolation and not belonging, and then through to his excitement at finally leaving that life behind in favour of one where he belongs and will be happy.</p>
        <p>When Harry begins his first term at Hogwarts (a wizarding school) he is not alone in being overawed:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>“‘Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight of Hogwarts in a sec,’ Hagrid called over his shoulder, ‘jus’ round this bend here.’ There was a loud ‘Oooooh!’ The narrow path had opened suddenly on to the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.”</em>
        </p>
        <p>Hogwarts is a truly magical place, not only in the most obvious way but also in all the detail that the author has gone to describe it so vibrantly. It is the place that everybody wishes they could have gone to when they were eleven. <strong>(E)</strong> ………. The story builds towards an exciting conclusion that has the ultimate feel-good factor.</p>
        <p>J.K. Rowling should be commended for getting so many people reading and excited by books. The biggest surprise must be the effect that this novel had on the adult population, both male and female - at the time the books were published many a commuting train was spotted with Harry Potter books providing world-weary workers with a wonderful sense of escapism. <strong>(F)</strong> ……….</p>
        <p>Is all the hype about the Harry Potter books justified? In a word, yes, the books are a joy to read and possibly the most rewarding young adult’s book since The Hobbit.</p>

        <p><strong>Read the text below. Six sentences&nbsp;have been removed from this text so that there are six gaps.</strong><br><br><strong>Bottled Water vs Tap Water</strong><br><br>
Over the past few years, bottled water consumption has grown significantly because it’s considered safer and better tasting than tap water. In fact, in the United States, each person drinks approximately 114 litres of bottled water per year. However, due to environmental concerns and potential health effects, many people are starting to wonder whether tap water is better.</p>
        <p>Tap water, also called municipal water, comes from large wells, lakes, rivers, or reservoirs. <strong>(A)</strong> ………. While contaminated drinking water is an issue in some regions, tap water is generally safe, convenient, and environmentally friendly. U.S. public tap water is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA is responsible for identifying and setting legal limits for potential contaminants in drinking water under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). Nonetheless, drinking water contamination can still occur. <strong>(B)</strong> ………. Additionally, old plumbing may introduce contaminants like lead, and natural disasters like floods can temporarily pollute public water systems.</p>
        <p>Bottled water is often said to taste better than tap water. Yet, in blind taste tests, most people can’t tell the difference between tap and bottled water. In general, tap water tastes the same as bottled water. <strong>(C)</strong> ………. Before it reaches your house, water is stored in a treatment facility in which it undergoes several processes to remove potential contaminants. <strong>(D)</strong> ………. Then, after you drink water from a glass, you’ll likely wash the glass either by hand or in a dishwasher.</p>
        <p>Bottled water comes from a variety of sources. Some products simply comprise tap water that’s been bottled while others use fresh spring water or another source. While some people believe bottled water to be safer, better tasting, and more convenient than tap water, several concerns surround its safety and environmental impact. Unlike tap water, which is regulated by the EPA, bottled water is overseen by the FDA.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One of the main drawbacks of bottled water is its environmental impact. From treating and bottling to transportation and refrigeration, bottled water requires large amounts of energy. <strong>(E)</strong> ………. The energy input required to produce that amount is equal to 64 million barrels of oil. Furthermore, it’s estimated that only 20% of plastic water bottles in the United States get recycled. Most end up in landfills or bodies of water.</p>
        <p>Studies reveal that one of the main reasons consumers choose bottled water is that it’s convenient. Whether you’re traveling or out and about, bottled water is available at many stores. However, that convenience comes with a hefty price tag.</p>
        <p>3.8 litres of tap water costs roughly $0.005 in the United States, while the same amount of bottled water, obtained from combining single-serving water bottles, costs around $9.47. This not only means that bottled water is pricier than milk and gasoline but also nearly 2,000 times more expensive than tap water. <strong>(F)</strong> ……….</p>

The Olympic Games? Well, it was a nice idea, but it’s run its course and it’s time for it to go. Admittedly, that’s a pretty bold statement, but there are a number of reasons why the Games need to come to an end. When Pierre de Coubertin instigated the modern Olympics in 1896, he did so hoping that by bringing amateur sportsmen (not women) together from around the world, it would help promote peace and unity. <strong>(A)</strong> ………. However, at the time, the majority of sports were amateur and not organised well enough on a global stage for their own world championships.</p>
        <p>But, it’s no longer 1896. Organised sports have matured. Sports that are popular have flourished, ones that aren’t have been slotted into a category called ‘minor sports’. <strong>(B)</strong> ………. They have their own world cups, world championships, grand slams or world series that suit their needs and bring in money and the Olympics are a distraction that risks diluting the importance of their own events.</p>
        <p>For smaller sports, the Olympics artificially and temporarily over-inflate their importance. Apart from the people involved, their families and a small group of others, hardly anyone cares about shooting, fencing, modern pentathlon, diving and archery. <strong>(C)</strong> ………. Well done to those who remembered New Zealand trap shooter Natalie Rooney from Rio, or diver Greg Louganis, but otherwise you see the point.</p>
        <p>When the Games come around, we all become overnight experts in beach volleyball, table tennis and weightlifting, then forget everything as soon as the Games’ closing ceremony is over. <strong>(D)</strong> ………. It has been reported that it’s costing Tokyo $22 billion to put on the Olympics. <strong>(E)</strong> ………. Many of the venues for the 2016 Rio Games now stand obsolete and are heading to the same decrepit state that buildings for the Athens and Beijing Games are in.</p>
        <p>Once the eyes of the world have gone elsewhere, cities are left with these white elephants they don’t have any use for, and the talk of leaving a lasting legacy is forgotten about. <strong>(F)</strong> ………. In 2024 break dancing will be included and there have been calls for the Fortnite video game to be added. But by bringing in these other, more modern sports, they are devaluing medals won in other events.</p>
        <p>The hopes that Coubertin had when he revived the Olympics 125 years ago are meaningless these days.</p>
