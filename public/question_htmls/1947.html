          <strong>The Red Fox</strong>

        </p>
        <p>It was cold in the forest. A bitter March wind rattled bare trees like skeletons and whipped up the dark clouds in an iron gray sky. The approaching snowstorm probably would not be the last one of the winter.</p>
        <p>The red fox couldn’t have chosen a worse time to bring a litter of kits<sup>1</sup> into the world. Nestled in a small hollow beneath a hickory tree, curled against their mother’s plush fur, the three young kits were warm and comfortable. But when the freezing storms came, the shallow nest would surely let in the snow. And it would be too easy for predators to find the babies when their mother left them to search for food. The fox knew she would have to seek a new home, and soon.</p>
        <p>She nuzzled her kits, whose eyes were not yet open. She licked them, and they mewed about her like kittens. Then she left them. Outside her den, cold air stung her nose as she sniffed about for danger. Then she padded off into the gray, wintry forest.</p>
        <p>She ducked beneath a wooden fence and followed a path across a familiar field, where during the summer she’d chased rabbits. She was near a farm, a place she’d always avoided because of the fearful smell of humans. But now, the warmth and protection of the barn drew her close.</p>
        <p>Squeezing through the gap where a board was missing, she sneaked into the barn. The straw was deep and soft, a perfect bed for fox kits.</p>
        <p>The red fox hurried back to her babies. One by one she carried them under the fence, across the field, and through the hole in the barn wall. And when all three kits were snuggled down in the blanket of straw, she licked them and felt safe. Even when the farmer came to milk his cows, the silent fox knew her family would be unnoticed, hidden in the farthest and darkest corner of the barn.</p>
        <p>One snowy evening, the farmer turned off his lantern and hung it on the wall as he left the barn, just as he did every night. But as he closed the door, the lantern slipped from its hook and shattered on the floor. A tiny spark danced across the pool of kerosene<sup>2</sup> and nibbled at the scattered straw.</p>
        <p>The fox watched with wide, yellow eyes as the straw curled and caught flame. Wisps of smoke reached her nostrils, and she became fearful. Slipping through the hole in the wall, she ran outside and howled. Her voice carried across the barnyard, and the farmer turned around. He was surprised and angry to see a fox. He was even more angry to see it run into his barn.</p>
        <p>Setting down his milk pail, the farmer headed back to his barn, determined to chase away the unwelcome visitor. But when he threw open the barn door, fire danced about his feet. Grabbing a shovel, he beat the flames until they were out. Once again, the barn was safe and dark.</p>
        <p>Taking up a flashlight, the farmer shone its beam about the barn. It finally came to rest on the fox, her family nestled close, her eyes shining gold. The farmer smiled. He flicked off the light and walked away, quietly closing the barn door behind him.</p>
        <p>Winter’s harshness gave way to spring’s gentle warmth. One day the farmer glanced into the darkest corner of the barn and found it empty. But for a time it had been a place to feel safe. It had been home to a red fox family.</p>

          <strong>As American as . . . Pizza Pie?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Michael Demchsak</em>
        </p>
        <p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In America, the pizza industry makes more than 30 billion dollars a year. Americans eat 350 slices of pizza per second. A pizza that would satisfy the cravings of the American public each day would cover a 100-acre field. Among kids ages 3–11, pizza is reported to be the first choice for either lunch or dinner.</p>
        <p><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently, it is not surprising that pizza seems ready to take the title of “America’s favorite food” away from the hamburger.</p>
        <p><sup>3</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The success achieved by the pizza pie is fairly amazing. After all, pizza was an ethnic food found only in big-city Italian neighborhoods until around 60 years ago.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ancient History</strong>
        </p>
        <p><sup>4</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the area around the Mediterranean Sea, people have been baking flat breads, usually covered with herbs, for thousands of years. In fact, the Latin word picea refers to bread blackening in an oven. It may be the origin of the term pizza. The flat breads baked by these Mediterranean people, especially the Italians, were sometimes topped with cheese or vegetables. The result was fairly close to being pizza. But these culinary efforts were not what most of us think of when we hear the word pizza.</p>
        <p><sup>5</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two of the essential ingredients—the crust and the cheese—were in place. It is hard to imagine pizza without tomato sauce, but the tomato is not native to the Mediterranean. It would be many years before this third crucial ingredient would be available. The tomato is a New World plant. It would not have been available in Europe until the 16th century, when Spanish explorers brought it back from Mexico.</p>

        <p><sup>6</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 16th and 17th centuries, the city of Naples in Italy began producing the ancestors of the tasty treats we now call pizzas. Vendors carried pizzas through the streets in metal stoves worn on their heads. This practice of taking the product to the customer helped increase the popularity of pizza. The first sit-down pizzeria, the Antica Pizzeria Port’Alba, opened in 1830. It continues to operate to this day.</p>
        <p><sup>7</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was not until 1889 that pizza had its great moment in history. A restaurant owner in Naples was asked to make a dish in honor of the visiting Queen Margherita. He decided to recreate a version of the Italian flag on crusty flat bread. Tomatoes, mozzarella cheese and a puree of basil formed the red, white and green of the Italian flag. The dish was a giant hit. In fact, visitors to Naples today can still see a royal thank you note from June 1889 written by Galli Camillo, the head of the table of the royal household of Italy.</p>
        <p><sup>8</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Italian immigrants brought their love of pizza to the United States. It was popular in Italian neighborhoods in the early 20th century. The first pizzeria in the United States opened in 1905 in New York City. For a time, the popularity of pizza remained restricted mostly to cities where large groups of Italians lived. But servicemen who had been stationed in Italy during World War II (1941–1945) sparked a new enthusiasm for pizza as they returned home. That spark obviously turned into a wildfire.</p>

        <p><sup>9</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pizza is an incredibly versatile dish. Over time, modifications to pizza and its ingredients have become common. Purists can debate whether or not a particular combination is really pizza. But personal and cultural preferences guarantee that pizza will vary widely—and wildly—depending where in the world it is found. At the moment, pizza can be eaten in this country with regular hand-tossed, deep-dish, or ultra-thin crust. Seemingly unusual ingredients are not very unusual at all. For example, Americans with a taste for something different can often ask for a pizza topped with anything from pineapple to sauerkraut. In other lands, the choices may be even more interesting. There are squid pizzas in Japan and mackerel pizzas in Russia. There are coconut pizzas in Costa Rica and curry pizzas in Pakistan.</p>

          <strong>As American as . . . Pizza Pie?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Michael Demchsak</em>
        </p>
        <p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In America, the pizza industry makes more than 30 billion dollars a year. Americans eat 350 slices of pizza per second. A pizza that would satisfy the cravings of the American public each day would cover a 100-acre field. Among kids ages 3–11, pizza is reported to be the first choice for either lunch or dinner.</p>
        <p><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently, it is not surprising that pizza seems ready to take the title of “America’s favorite food” away from the hamburger.</p>
        <p><sup>3</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The success achieved by the pizza pie is fairly amazing. After all, pizza was an ethnic food found only in big-city Italian neighborhoods until around 60 years ago.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ancient History</strong>
        </p>
        <p><sup>4</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the area around the Mediterranean Sea, people have been baking flat breads, usually covered with herbs, for thousands of years. In fact, the Latin word picea refers to bread blackening in an oven. It may be the origin of the term pizza. The flat breads baked by these Mediterranean people, especially the Italians, were sometimes topped with cheese or vegetables. The result was fairly close to being pizza. But these culinary efforts were not what most of us think of when we hear the word pizza.</p>
        <p><sup>5</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two of the essential ingredients—the crust and the cheese—were in place. It is hard to imagine pizza without tomato sauce, but the tomato is not native to the Mediterranean. It would be many years before this third crucial ingredient would be available. The tomato is a New World plant. It would not have been available in Europe until the 16th century, when Spanish explorers brought it back from Mexico.</p>

        <p><sup>7</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was not until 1889 that pizza had its great moment in history. A restaurant owner in Naples was asked to make a dish in honor of the visiting Queen Margherita. He decided to recreate a version of the Italian flag on crusty flat bread. Tomatoes, mozzarella cheese and a puree of basil formed the red, white and green of the Italian flag. The dish was a giant hit. In fact, visitors to Naples today can still see a royal thank you note from June 1889 written by Galli Camillo, the head of the table of the royal household of Italy.</p>
        <p><sup>8</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Italian immigrants brought their love of pizza to the United States. It was popular in Italian neighborhoods in the early 20th century. The first pizzeria in the United States opened in 1905 in New York City. For a time, the popularity of pizza remained restricted mostly to cities where large groups of Italians lived. But servicemen who had been stationed in Italy during World War II (1941–1945) sparked a new enthusiasm for pizza as they returned home. That spark obviously turned into a wildfire.</p>

          <strong>Getting Creative with Pizza</strong>
        </p>
        <p><sup>9</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pizza is an incredibly versatile dish. Over time, modifications to pizza and its ingredients have become common. Purists can debate whether or not a particular combination is really pizza. But personal and cultural preferences guarantee that pizza will vary widely—and wildly—depending where in the world it is found. At the moment, pizza can be eaten in this country with regular hand-tossed, deep-dish, or ultra-thin crust. Seemingly unusual ingredients are not very unusual at all. For example, Americans with a taste for something different can often ask for a pizza topped with anything from pineapple to sauerkraut. In other lands, the choices may be even more interesting. There are squid pizzas in Japan and mackerel pizzas in Russia. There are coconut pizzas in Costa Rica and curry pizzas in Pakistan.</p>

          <strong>As American as . . . Pizza Pie?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Michael Demchsak</em>
        </p>
        <p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In America, the pizza industry makes more than 30 billion dollars a year. Americans eat 350 slices of pizza per second. A pizza that would satisfy the cravings of the American public each day would cover a 100-acre field. Among kids ages 3–11, pizza is reported to be the first choice for either lunch or dinner.</p>
        <p><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently, it is not surprising that pizza seems ready to take the title of “America’s favorite food” away from the hamburger.</p>
        <p><sup>3</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The success achieved by the pizza pie is fairly amazing. After all, pizza was an ethnic food found only in big-city Italian neighborhoods until around 60 years ago.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ancient History</strong>
        </p>
        <p><sup>4</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the area around the Mediterranean Sea, people have been baking flat breads, usually covered with herbs, for thousands of years. In fact, the Latin word picea refers to bread blackening in an oven. It may be the origin of the term pizza. The flat breads baked by these Mediterranean people, especially the Italians, were sometimes topped with cheese or vegetables. The result was fairly close to being pizza. But these culinary efforts were not what most of us think of when we hear the word pizza.</p>
        <p><sup>5</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two of the essential ingredients—the crust and the cheese—were in place. It is hard to imagine pizza without tomato sauce, but the tomato is not native to the Mediterranean. It would be many years before this third crucial ingredient would be available. The tomato is a New World plant. It would not have been available in Europe until the 16th century, when Spanish explorers brought it back from Mexico.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>More Recent History</strong>
        </p>
        <p><sup>6</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 16th and 17th centuries, the city of Naples in Italy began producing the ancestors of the tasty treats we now call pizzas. Vendors carried pizzas through the streets in metal stoves worn on their heads. This practice of taking the product to the customer helped increase the popularity of pizza. The first sit-down pizzeria, the Antica Pizzeria Port’Alba, opened in 1830. It continues to operate to this day.</p>

        <p><sup>7</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was not until 1889 that pizza had its great moment in history. A restaurant owner in Naples was asked to make a dish in honor of the visiting Queen Margherita. He decided to recreate a version of the Italian flag on crusty flat bread. Tomatoes, mozzarella cheese and a puree of basil formed the red, white and green of the Italian flag. The dish was a giant hit. In fact, visitors to Naples today can still see a royal thank you note from June 1889 written by Galli Camillo, the head of the table of the royal household of Italy.</p>
        <p><sup>8</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Italian immigrants brought their love of pizza to the United States. It was popular in Italian neighborhoods in the early 20th century. The first pizzeria in the United States opened in 1905 in New York City. For a time, the popularity of pizza remained restricted mostly to cities where large groups of Italians lived. But servicemen who had been stationed in Italy during World War II (1941–1945) sparked a new enthusiasm for pizza as they returned home. That spark obviously turned into a wildfire.</p>

          <strong>Getting Creative with Pizza</strong>
        </p>
        <p><sup>9</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pizza is an incredibly versatile dish. Over time, modifications to pizza and its ingredients have become common. Purists can debate whether or not a particular combination is really pizza. But personal and cultural preferences guarantee that pizza will vary widely—and wildly—depending where in the world it is found. At the moment, pizza can be eaten in this country with regular hand-tossed, deep-dish, or ultra-thin crust. Seemingly unusual ingredients are not very unusual at all. For example, Americans with a taste for something different can often ask for a pizza topped with anything from pineapple to sauerkraut. In other lands, the choices may be even more interesting. There are squid pizzas in Japan and mackerel pizzas in Russia. There are coconut pizzas in Costa Rica and curry pizzas in Pakistan.</p>

          <strong>Pizza Today</strong>
        </p>
        <p><sup>10&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In America today, there are approximately 61,000 pizzerias. Pizza is so common that it is hard to imagine that there are people today who grew up in a time when many Americans had never heard of pizza or seen a slice of this food favorite. It seems almost sad. But those times are gone. Now it can be claimed that America is the pizza capital of the world. But . . . shhh! Don’t tell Naples.</p>

          <strong>I Was There</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>By Vanna Walsh</em>
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>As Halley’s Comet passed through<br>
the night sky, amateur astronomer<br>
Mark Sansom was one of the first<br>
in Australia to witness its fiery tail.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Traditionally, comets are<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called dirty snow-balls; they<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are made mainly of ice, but<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contain other materials as well. They are<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;born in an area of space outside<br>
10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the solar system and float around.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, one will be pulled towards<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sun, due to the gravity, and, as it<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;approaches earth, the sun’s radiation<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;burns it and the comet produces its tail<br>
15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; – the tail is what’s visible from the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Comet Halley measures four by eight<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kilometres, so although it’s shedding its<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;material every time it comes around, it’s<br>
20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; going to take a lot of apparitions before<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it shrinks to nothing. Comet Halley has<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been going around the earth since<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before Christ and its apparition has<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been recorded many times. Edmund<br>
25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Halley, an English astronomer,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calculated its orbit and predicted that it<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was going to come back every 76 years.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Halley was visible for about six<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;months and it was best in March and<br>
30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; April. We went up to the country<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because when you get away from (the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;city’s) open-light pollution you get a<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;much clearer sky.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was meant to be a very spectacular<br>
35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; comet and, in about March, it was. Out<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a dark sky, if you had binoculars, the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;view would have been very spectacular:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the comet would have taken up the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whole field of view of the binoculars.</p>
        <p>40&nbsp; Binoculars, by the way, are better for<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;viewing the comet than telescopes.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In April, when it was meant to be at<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its best, it diminished somewhat. At the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time it was among the Milky Way, so it<br>
45&nbsp; wasn’t quite as apparent as a lot of the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public were expecting it to be.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Astronomers can’t predict how<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bright the tail is going to be: even today<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are still unpredictable, like meteor<br>
50&nbsp; showers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We were all very excited at seeing<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the comet: it’s a once in a lifetime<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;experience. The next time I’ll see it I’ll be<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;100 years of age – if I live that long.</p>
        <p>55&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The atmosphere was so intense. With<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a solar eclipse the event is over and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;done with within a few minutes; with<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the comet, it’s there for the majority of<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the night. Unlike what a lot of people<br>
60&nbsp; think, comets don’t sweep across the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;sky, but move very gradually.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You could see it, night by night,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;slightly changing its position in the sky<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;compared to the background stars. We<br>
65&nbsp; weren’t sure how big it was going to be<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;or how bright. It could have been a real<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;fizzer. Halley wasn’t a total disaster but<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;it wasn’t quite what a lot of people were<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;led to believe. It was OK, providing you<br>
70&nbsp; were prepared to get up in the early<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;hours of the morning in mid- to late-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;March.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I have very fond and vivid<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;memories of the comet.</p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Comet Halley measures four by eight<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kilometres, so although it’s shedding its<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;material every time it comes around, it’s<br>
20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; going to take a lot of apparitions before<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it shrinks to nothing. Comet Halley has<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been going around the earth since<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before Christ and its apparition has<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been recorded many times. Edmund<br>
25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Halley, an English astronomer,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calculated its orbit and predicted that it<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was going to come back every 76 years.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Halley was visible for about six<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;months and it was best in March and<br>
30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; April. We went up to the country<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because when you get away from (the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;city’s) open-light pollution you get a<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;much clearer sky.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was meant to be a very spectacular<br>
35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; comet and, in about March, it was. Out<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a dark sky, if you had binoculars, the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;view would have been very spectacular:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the comet would have taken up the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whole field of view of the binoculars.</p>
        <p>40&nbsp; Binoculars, by the way, are better for<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;viewing the comet than telescopes.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In April, when it was meant to be at<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its best, it diminished somewhat. At the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time it was among the Milky Way, so it<br>
45&nbsp; wasn’t quite as apparent as a lot of the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public were expecting it to be.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Astronomers can’t predict how<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bright the tail is going to be: even today<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are still unpredictable, like meteor<br>
50&nbsp; showers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We were all very excited at seeing<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the comet: it’s a once in a lifetime<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;experience. The next time I’ll see it I’ll be<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;100 years of age – if I live that long.</p>
        <p>55&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The atmosphere was so intense. With<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a solar eclipse the event is over and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;done with within a few minutes; with<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the comet, it’s there for the majority of<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the night. Unlike what a lot of people<br>
60&nbsp; think, comets don’t sweep across the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;sky, but move very gradually.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You could see it, night by night,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;slightly changing its position in the sky<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;compared to the background stars. We<br>
65&nbsp; weren’t sure how big it was going to be<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;or how bright. It could have been a real<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;fizzer. Halley wasn’t a total disaster but<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;it wasn’t quite what a lot of people were<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;led to believe. It was OK, providing you<br>
70&nbsp; were prepared to get up in the early<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;hours of the morning in mid- to late-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;March.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I have very fond and vivid<br>

          <strong>I Was There</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>By Vanna Walsh</em>
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>As Halley’s Comet passed through<br>
the night sky, amateur astronomer<br>
Mark Sansom was one of the first<br>
in Australia to witness its fiery tail.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Traditionally, comets are<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called dirty snow-balls; they<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are made mainly of ice, but<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contain other materials as well. They are<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;born in an area of space outside<br>
10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the solar system and float around.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, one will be pulled towards<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sun, due to the gravity, and, as it<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;approaches earth, the sun’s radiation<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;burns it and the comet produces its tail<br>
15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; – the tail is what’s visible from the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Comet Halley measures four by eight<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kilometres, so although it’s shedding its<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;material every time it comes around, it’s<br>
20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; going to take a lot of apparitions before<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it shrinks to nothing. Comet Halley has<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been going around the earth since<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before Christ and its apparition has<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been recorded many times. Edmund<br>
25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Halley, an English astronomer,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calculated its orbit and predicted that it<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was going to come back every 76 years.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Halley was visible for about six<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;months and it was best in March and<br>
30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; April. We went up to the country<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because when you get away from (the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;city’s) open-light pollution you get a<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;much clearer sky.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was meant to be a very spectacular<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whole field of view of the binoculars.</p>
        <p>40&nbsp; Binoculars, by the way, are better for<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In April, when it was meant to be at<br>

45&nbsp; wasn’t quite as apparent as a lot of the<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bright the tail is going to be: even today<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are still unpredictable, like meteor<br>
50&nbsp; showers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We were all very excited at seeing<br>

          <strong>As Halley’s Comet passed through<br>
the night sky, amateur astronomer<br>
Mark Sansom was one of the first<br>
in Australia to witness its fiery tail.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Traditionally, comets are<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called dirty snow-balls; they<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are made mainly of ice, but<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contain other materials as well. They are<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;born in an area of space outside<br>
10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the solar system and float around.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, one will be pulled towards<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sun, due to the gravity, and, as it<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;approaches earth, the sun’s radiation<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;burns it and the comet produces its tail<br>
15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; – the tail is what’s visible from the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Comet Halley measures four by eight<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kilometres, so although it’s shedding its<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;material every time it comes around, it’s<br>
20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; going to take a lot of apparitions before<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it shrinks to nothing. Comet Halley has<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been going around the earth since<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before Christ and its apparition has<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been recorded many times. Edmund<br>
25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Halley, an English astronomer,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calculated its orbit and predicted that it<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was going to come back every 76 years.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Halley was visible for about six<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;months and it was best in March and<br>
30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; April. We went up to the country<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because when you get away from (the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;city’s) open-light pollution you get a<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;much clearer sky.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was meant to be a very spectacular<br>
35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; comet and, in about March, it was. Out<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a dark sky, if you had binoculars, the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;view would have been very spectacular:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the comet would have taken up the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whole field of view of the binoculars.</p>
        <p>40&nbsp; Binoculars, by the way, are better for<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;viewing the comet than telescopes.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In April, when it was meant to be at<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its best, it diminished somewhat. At the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time it was among the Milky Way, so it<br>
45&nbsp; wasn’t quite as apparent as a lot of the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public were expecting it to be.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Astronomers can’t predict how<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bright the tail is going to be: even today<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are still unpredictable, like meteor<br>
50&nbsp; showers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We were all very excited at seeing<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the comet: it’s a once in a lifetime<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;experience. The next time I’ll see it I’ll be<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;100 years of age – if I live that long.</p>
        <p>55&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The atmosphere was so intense. With<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a solar eclipse the event is over and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;done with within a few minutes; with<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the comet, it’s there for the majority of<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the night. Unlike what a lot of people<br>
60&nbsp; think, comets don’t sweep across the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;sky, but move very gradually.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You could see it, night by night,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;slightly changing its position in the sky<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;compared to the background stars. We<br>
65&nbsp; weren’t sure how big it was going to be<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;or how bright. It could have been a real<br>

          <strong>I Was There</strong>

          <em>By Vanna Walsh</em>
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>As Halley’s Comet passed through<br>
the night sky, amateur astronomer<br>
Mark Sansom was one of the first<br>
in Australia to witness its fiery tail.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Traditionally, comets are<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called dirty snow-balls; they<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are made mainly of ice, but<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contain other materials as well. They are<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;born in an area of space outside<br>
10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the solar system and float around.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, one will be pulled towards<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sun, due to the gravity, and, as it<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;approaches earth, the sun’s radiation<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;burns it and the comet produces its tail<br>
15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; – the tail is what’s visible from the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Comet Halley measures four by eight<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kilometres, so although it’s shedding its<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;material every time it comes around, it’s<br>
20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; going to take a lot of apparitions before<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it shrinks to nothing. Comet Halley has<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been going around the earth since<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before Christ and its apparition has<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been recorded many times. Edmund<br>
25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Halley, an English astronomer,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calculated its orbit and predicted that it<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was going to come back every 76 years.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Halley was visible for about six<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;months and it was best in March and<br>
30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; April. We went up to the country<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because when you get away from (the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;city’s) open-light pollution you get a<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;much clearer sky.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was meant to be a very spectacular<br>
35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; comet and, in about March, it was. Out<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a dark sky, if you had binoculars, the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;view would have been very spectacular:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the comet would have taken up the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whole field of view of the binoculars.</p>
        <p>40&nbsp; Binoculars, by the way, are better for<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;viewing the comet than telescopes.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In April, when it was meant to be at<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its best, it diminished somewhat. At the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time it was among the Milky Way, so it<br>
45&nbsp; wasn’t quite as apparent as a lot of the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public were expecting it to be.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Astronomers can’t predict how<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bright the tail is going to be: even today<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are still unpredictable, like meteor<br>
50&nbsp; showers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We were all very excited at seeing<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the comet: it’s a once in a lifetime<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;experience. The next time I’ll see it I’ll be<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;100 years of age – if I live that long.</p>
        <p>55&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The atmosphere was so intense. With<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a solar eclipse the event is over and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;done with within a few minutes; with<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the comet, it’s there for the majority of<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the night. Unlike what a lot of people<br>
60&nbsp; think, comets don’t sweep across the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;sky, but move very gradually.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You could see it, night by night,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;slightly changing its position in the sky<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;compared to the background stars. We<br>
65&nbsp; weren’t sure how big it was going to be<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;or how bright. It could have been a real<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;fizzer. Halley wasn’t a total disaster but<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;it wasn’t quite what a lot of people were<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;led to believe. It was OK, providing you<br>
70&nbsp; were prepared to get up in the early<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;hours of the morning in mid- to late-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;March.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I have very fond and vivid<br>

          <strong>I Was There</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>By Vanna Walsh</em>
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>As Halley’s Comet passed through<br>
the night sky, amateur astronomer<br>
Mark Sansom was one of the first<br>
in Australia to witness its fiery tail.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Traditionally, comets are<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called dirty snow-balls; they<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are made mainly of ice, but<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contain other materials as well. They are<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;born in an area of space outside<br>
10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the solar system and float around.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, one will be pulled towards<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sun, due to the gravity, and, as it<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;approaches earth, the sun’s radiation<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;burns it and the comet produces its tail<br>
15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; – the tail is what’s visible from the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Comet Halley measures four by eight<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kilometres, so although it’s shedding its<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;material every time it comes around, it’s<br>
20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; going to take a lot of apparitions before<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it shrinks to nothing. Comet Halley has<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been going around the earth since<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before Christ and its apparition has<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been recorded many times. Edmund<br>
25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Halley, an English astronomer,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calculated its orbit and predicted that it<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was going to come back every 76 years.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Halley was visible for about six<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;months and it was best in March and<br>
30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; April. We went up to the country<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because when you get away from (the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;city’s) open-light pollution you get a<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;much clearer sky.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was meant to be a very spectacular<br>
35&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; comet and, in about March, it was. Out<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a dark sky, if you had binoculars, the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;view would have been very spectacular:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the comet would have taken up the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whole field of view of the binoculars.</p>
        <p>40&nbsp; Binoculars, by the way, are better for<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;viewing the comet than telescopes.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In April, when it was meant to be at<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its best, it diminished somewhat. At the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time it was among the Milky Way, so it<br>
45&nbsp; wasn’t quite as apparent as a lot of the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public were expecting it to be.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Astronomers can’t predict how<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bright the tail is going to be: even today<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are still unpredictable, like meteor<br>
50&nbsp; showers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We were all very excited at seeing<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the comet: it’s a once in a lifetime<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;experience. The next time I’ll see it I’ll be<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;100 years of age – if I live that long.</p>
        <p>55&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The atmosphere was so intense. With<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a solar eclipse the event is over and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;done with within a few minutes; with<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the comet, it’s there for the majority of<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the night. Unlike what a lot of people<br>
60&nbsp; think, comets don’t sweep across the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;sky, but move very gradually.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You could see it, night by night,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;slightly changing its position in the sky<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;compared to the background stars. We<br>
65&nbsp; weren’t sure how big it was going to be<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;or how bright. It could have been a real<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;fizzer. Halley wasn’t a total disaster but<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;it wasn’t quite what a lot of people were<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;led to believe. It was OK, providing you<br>
70&nbsp; were prepared to get up in the early<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;hours of the morning in mid- to late-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;March.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I have very fond and vivid<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;memories of the comet.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In November 1992, more than half of<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;all living Nobel Prize winners signed a<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;document called ‘World Scientists’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Warning to Humanity’ that began with<br>
5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this stark statement: ‘Human beings and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;the natural world are on a collision<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;course. Human activities inflict harsh<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;and often irreversible damage on the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; environment. If not checked, many of<br>
10&nbsp; our practices put at serious risk the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;future we wish for human society.’</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Scientists are extremely cautious<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;when making pronouncements to the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;general public, so this was a most<br>
15&nbsp; unusual alarm call. In biological terms,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;the globe is experiencing an ecoholocaust,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;as more than 50,000 species<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;vanish annually and air, water and soil<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;are poisoned with civilisation’s<br>
20&nbsp; effluents. The great challenge of the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;millennium is recognising the reality of<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;impending ecological collapse, and the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;urgent need to get on with taking the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;steps to avoid it.</p>
        <p>25&nbsp; &nbsp; But our obsession with economics has<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;become an impediment to taking<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;appropriate action. I have often been<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;told: ‘Listen Suzuki, we have to pay for<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;all those parks and environmental clean-<br>
30&nbsp; ups. We can’t afford to protect the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;environment if we don’t have a strong,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;growing economy.’ That sentiment<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;flows from a belief that the economy<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;provides us with all of our products,<br>
35&nbsp; from food to oil to manufactured goods.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This is nonsense.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Everything we depend on, whether it<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;is cars, popcorn or computers, comes<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;from the earth and will eventually end<br>
40&nbsp; up going back to it. It is the biosphere,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;that thin layer of air, water and soil<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;within which life exists, that creates the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;earth’s productivity and abundance<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;that, in turn, make economies and our<br>
45&nbsp; lives possible.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I suggest the following exercise can<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;help to get our priorities in order.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine that you have lived a full and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;rich life and are now on your death-bed.<br>
50&nbsp; As you reflect on life, what memories fill<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;you with happiness, pride and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;satisfaction?</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I suspect it will not be the latest<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;designer clothing, a huge house, a sport<br>
55&nbsp; utility vehicle or a high tech<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;entertainment centre. What makes life<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;worthwhile and joyful is not ‘stuff’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;that can be bought with money. The<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;most important things are family,<br>
60&nbsp; friends, community and the sharing<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;that enhances the quality of all of our<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;lives.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are several reasons we are<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;failing to see the urgency of what is<br>
65&nbsp; happening, including:</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;• Most people alive today were born<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;after 1950 and thus have lived<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;all their lives during a period<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;of spectacular unprecedented and<br>
70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unsustainable growth and change.<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But for most of us, this is all<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;we’ve ever known and it seems<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;normal. Rapid change also brings<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;rapid collective forgetfulness, and<br>
75&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;memories of what the world once<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;was quickly fade.</p>
        <p>​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • Most people now live in the<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;human-created environment of big<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;cities where it’s easy to believe the<br>
80&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;illusion that we have escaped our<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;biological dependence on the<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;natural world.</p>
        <p>​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;• The explosive increase in<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;information shatters the world into<br>
85&nbsp; &nbsp; fragments devoid of the history<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;or context that might explain<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;their relevance, importance or<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;significance. In order to attract<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;attention, stories or reports become</p>
        <p>90&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;shorter and increasingly shrill,<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;sensational or violent.</p>
        <p>​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;• The great public faith that ‘they’&nbsp;—<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;scientists and technologists — will<br>
​​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;resolve our problems is simply</p>
        <p>95&nbsp; &nbsp; unwarranted. While technology<br>
​​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;can be impressive, our knowledge<br>
​​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;of the complexity of the real world<br>
​​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;is so limited. For example, we have<br>
​​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;no idea how to replace thousands</p>
        <p>100&nbsp; of species now extinct or repair the<br>
​​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;ozone layer.</p>
        <p>​​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What are our real basic needs in order<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;to live rich and fulfilling lives? I believe<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;you cannot separate environmental</p>
        <p>105&nbsp;&nbsp;and social needs. Hungry people will<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;not care if their actions endanger an<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;edible species or an important habitat.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unemployment, injustice or insecurity<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;lead to desperation and the need to<br>
110&nbsp;&nbsp;survive at all costs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To protect an environment for future<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;generations, we have to build a society<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;on a foundation of clean air, water, soil<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;and energy to fulfil our needs; we have<br>
115&nbsp;&nbsp;to ensure full employment, justice and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;security for all communities to serve our<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;social needs; and we have to retain<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;sacred places, a sense of belonging and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;connectedness with nature and a<br>
120&nbsp;&nbsp;knowledge that there are cosmic forces<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;beyond our comprehension or control,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;to satisfy our spiritual requirements.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then, we can work on the best kind of<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;economy to construct from there. Right<br>
125&nbsp;&nbsp;now, we seem to be trying to squeeze<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;everything into the constraints dictated<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;by the economy without establishing the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;fundamental bottom line.</p>

​​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;resolve our problems is simply</p>

​​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;of the complexity of the real world<br>
​​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;is so limited. For example, we have<br>
​​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;no idea how to replace thousands</p>
        <p>100&nbsp; of species now extinct or repair the<br>
​​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;ozone layer.</p>
        <p>​​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What are our real basic needs in order<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;to live rich and fulfilling lives? I believe<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;you cannot separate environmental</p>
        <p>105&nbsp;&nbsp;and social needs. Hungry people will<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;not care if their actions endanger an<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;edible species or an important habitat.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unemployment, injustice or insecurity<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;lead to desperation and the need to<br>
110&nbsp;&nbsp;survive at all costs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To protect an environment for future<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;generations, we have to build a society<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;on a foundation of clean air, water, soil<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;and energy to fulfil our needs; we have<br>
115&nbsp;&nbsp;to ensure full employment, justice and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;security for all communities to serve our<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;social needs; and we have to retain<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;sacred places, a sense of belonging and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;connectedness with nature and a<br>
120&nbsp;&nbsp;knowledge that there are cosmic forces<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;beyond our comprehension or control,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;to satisfy our spiritual requirements.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then, we can work on the best kind of<br>

          <strong>The ultimate test for life’s priorities</strong>
          <br>
          <em>David Suzuki</em>
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>
            <em>David Suzuki is a Canadian-based environmentalist, scientist, author and broadcaster. This is an edited version of a speech he gave at the Seymour Centre in Sydney.</em>
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In November 1992, more than half of<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;all living Nobel Prize winners signed a<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;document called ‘World Scientists’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Warning to Humanity’ that began with<br>
5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this stark statement: ‘Human beings and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;the natural world are on a collision<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;course. Human activities inflict harsh<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;and often irreversible damage on the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; environment. If not checked, many of<br>
10&nbsp; our practices put at serious risk the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;future we wish for human society.’</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Scientists are extremely cautious<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;when making pronouncements to the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;general public, so this was a most<br>
15&nbsp; unusual alarm call. In biological terms,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;the globe is experiencing an ecoholocaust,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;as more than 50,000 species<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;vanish annually and air, water and soil<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;are poisoned with civilisation’s<br>
20&nbsp; effluents. The great challenge of the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;millennium is recognising the reality of<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;impending ecological collapse, and the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;urgent need to get on with taking the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;steps to avoid it.</p>
        <p>25&nbsp; &nbsp; But our obsession with economics has<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;become an impediment to taking<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;appropriate action. I have often been<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;told: ‘Listen Suzuki, we have to pay for<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;all those parks and environmental clean-<br>
30&nbsp; ups. We can’t afford to protect the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;environment if we don’t have a strong,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;growing economy.’ That sentiment<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;flows from a belief that the economy<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;provides us with all of our products,<br>
35&nbsp; from food to oil to manufactured goods.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This is nonsense.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Everything we depend on, whether it<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;is cars, popcorn or computers, comes<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;from the earth and will eventually end<br>
40&nbsp; up going back to it. It is the biosphere,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;that thin layer of air, water and soil<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;within which life exists, that creates the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;earth’s productivity and abundance<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;that, in turn, make economies and our<br>
45&nbsp; lives possible.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I suggest the following exercise can<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;help to get our priorities in order.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine that you have lived a full and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;rich life and are now on your death-bed.<br>
50&nbsp; As you reflect on life, what memories fill<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;you with happiness, pride and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;satisfaction?</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I suspect it will not be the latest<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;designer clothing, a huge house, a sport<br>
55&nbsp; utility vehicle or a high tech<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;entertainment centre. What makes life<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;worthwhile and joyful is not ‘stuff’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;that can be bought with money. The<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;most important things are family,<br>
60&nbsp; friends, community and the sharing<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;that enhances the quality of all of our<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;lives.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are several reasons we are<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;failing to see the urgency of what is<br>
65&nbsp; happening, including:</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;• Most people alive today were born<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;after 1950 and thus have lived<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;all their lives during a period<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;of spectacular unprecedented and<br>
70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unsustainable growth and change.<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But for most of us, this is all<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;we’ve ever known and it seems<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;normal. Rapid change also brings<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;rapid collective forgetfulness, and<br>
75&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;memories of what the world once<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;was quickly fade.</p>
        <p>​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • Most people now live in the<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;human-created environment of big<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;cities where it’s easy to believe the<br>
80&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;illusion that we have escaped our<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;biological dependence on the<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;natural world.</p>
        <p>​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;• The explosive increase in<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;information shatters the world into<br>
85&nbsp; &nbsp; fragments devoid of the history<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;or context that might explain<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;their relevance, importance or<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;significance. In order to attract<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;attention, stories or reports become</p>
        <p>90&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;shorter and increasingly shrill,<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;sensational or violent.</p>
        <p>​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;• The great public faith that ‘they’&nbsp;—<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;scientists and technologists — will<br>

          <strong>The ultimate test for life’s priorities</strong>
          <br>
          <em>David Suzuki</em>
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>
            <em>David Suzuki is a Canadian-based environmentalist, scientist, author and broadcaster. This is an edited version of a speech he gave at the Seymour Centre in Sydney.</em>
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In November 1992, more than half of<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;all living Nobel Prize winners signed a<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;document called ‘World Scientists’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Warning to Humanity’ that began with<br>
5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this stark statement: ‘Human beings and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;the natural world are on a collision<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;course. Human activities inflict harsh<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;and often irreversible damage on the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; environment. If not checked, many of<br>
10&nbsp; our practices put at serious risk the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;future we wish for human society.’</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Scientists are extremely cautious<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;when making pronouncements to the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;general public, so this was a most<br>
15&nbsp; unusual alarm call. In biological terms,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;the globe is experiencing an ecoholocaust,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;as more than 50,000 species<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;vanish annually and air, water and soil<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;are poisoned with civilisation’s<br>
20&nbsp; effluents. The great challenge of the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;millennium is recognising the reality of<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;impending ecological collapse, and the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;urgent need to get on with taking the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;steps to avoid it.</p>
        <p>25&nbsp; &nbsp; But our obsession with economics has<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;become an impediment to taking<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;appropriate action. I have often been<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;told: ‘Listen Suzuki, we have to pay for<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;all those parks and environmental clean-<br>
30&nbsp; ups. We can’t afford to protect the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;environment if we don’t have a strong,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;growing economy.’ That sentiment<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;flows from a belief that the economy<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;provides us with all of our products,<br>
35&nbsp; from food to oil to manufactured goods.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This is nonsense.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Everything we depend on, whether it<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;is cars, popcorn or computers, comes<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;from the earth and will eventually end<br>
40&nbsp; up going back to it. It is the biosphere,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;that thin layer of air, water and soil<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;within which life exists, that creates the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;earth’s productivity and abundance<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;that, in turn, make economies and our<br>
45&nbsp; lives possible.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I suggest the following exercise can<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;help to get our priorities in order.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine that you have lived a full and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;rich life and are now on your death-bed.<br>
50&nbsp; As you reflect on life, what memories fill<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;you with happiness, pride and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;satisfaction?</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I suspect it will not be the latest<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;designer clothing, a huge house, a sport<br>
55&nbsp; utility vehicle or a high tech<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;entertainment centre. What makes life<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;worthwhile and joyful is not ‘stuff’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;that can be bought with money. The<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;most important things are family,<br>
60&nbsp; friends, community and the sharing<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;that enhances the quality of all of our<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;lives.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are several reasons we are<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;failing to see the urgency of what is<br>
65&nbsp; happening, including:</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;• Most people alive today were born<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;after 1950 and thus have lived<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;all their lives during a period<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;of spectacular unprecedented and<br>
70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unsustainable growth and change.<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But for most of us, this is all<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;we’ve ever known and it seems<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;normal. Rapid change also brings<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;rapid collective forgetfulness, and<br>
75&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;memories of what the world once<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;was quickly fade.</p>
        <p>​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • Most people now live in the<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;human-created environment of big<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;cities where it’s easy to believe the<br>
80&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;illusion that we have escaped our<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;biological dependence on the<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;natural world.</p>
        <p>​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;• The explosive increase in<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;information shatters the world into<br>
85&nbsp; &nbsp; fragments devoid of the history<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;or context that might explain<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;their relevance, importance or<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;significance. In order to attract<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;attention, stories or reports become</p>
        <p>90&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;shorter and increasingly shrill,<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;sensational or violent.</p>
        <p>​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;• The great public faith that ‘they’&nbsp;—<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;scientists and technologists — will<br>
​​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;resolve our problems is simply</p>
        <p>95&nbsp; &nbsp; unwarranted. While technology<br>
​​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;can be impressive, our knowledge<br>
​​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;of the complexity of the real world<br>
​​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;is so limited. For example, we have<br>
​​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;no idea how to replace thousands</p>
        <p>100&nbsp; of species now extinct or repair the<br>
​​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;ozone layer.</p>
        <p>​​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What are our real basic needs in order<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;to live rich and fulfilling lives? I believe<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;you cannot separate environmental</p>
        <p>105&nbsp;&nbsp;and social needs. Hungry people will<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;not care if their actions endanger an<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;edible species or an important habitat.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unemployment, injustice or insecurity<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;lead to desperation and the need to<br>
110&nbsp;&nbsp;survive at all costs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To protect an environment for future<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;generations, we have to build a society<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;on a foundation of clean air, water, soil<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;and energy to fulfil our needs; we have<br>
115&nbsp;&nbsp;to ensure full employment, justice and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;security for all communities to serve our<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;social needs; and we have to retain<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;sacred places, a sense of belonging and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;connectedness with nature and a<br>
120&nbsp;&nbsp;knowledge that there are cosmic forces<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;beyond our comprehension or control,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;to satisfy our spiritual requirements.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then, we can work on the best kind of<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;economy to construct from there. Right<br>
125&nbsp;&nbsp;now, we seem to be trying to squeeze<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;everything into the constraints dictated<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;by the economy without establishing the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;fundamental bottom line.</p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;satisfaction?</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I suspect it will not be the latest<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;designer clothing, a huge house, a sport<br>
55&nbsp; utility vehicle or a high tech<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;entertainment centre. What makes life<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;worthwhile and joyful is not ‘stuff’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;that can be bought with money. The<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;most important things are family,<br>
60&nbsp; friends, community and the sharing<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;that enhances the quality of all of our<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;lives.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are several reasons we are<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;failing to see the urgency of what is<br>
65&nbsp; happening, including:</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;• Most people alive today were born<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;after 1950 and thus have lived<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;all their lives during a period<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;of spectacular unprecedented and<br>
70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unsustainable growth and change.<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But for most of us, this is all<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;we’ve ever known and it seems<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;normal. Rapid change also brings<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;rapid collective forgetfulness, and<br>
75&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;memories of what the world once<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;was quickly fade.</p>
        <p>​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • Most people now live in the<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;human-created environment of big<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;cities where it’s easy to believe the<br>
80&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;illusion that we have escaped our<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;biological dependence on the<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;natural world.</p>
        <p>​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;• The explosive increase in<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;information shatters the world into<br>
85&nbsp; &nbsp; fragments devoid of the history<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;or context that might explain<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;their relevance, importance or<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;significance. In order to attract<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;attention, stories or reports become</p>
        <p>90&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;shorter and increasingly shrill,<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;sensational or violent.</p>
        <p>​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;• The great public faith that ‘they’&nbsp;—<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;scientists and technologists — will<br>
​​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;resolve our problems is simply</p>
        <p>95&nbsp; &nbsp; unwarranted. While technology<br>
​​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;can be impressive, our knowledge<br>
​​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;of the complexity of the real world<br>
​​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;is so limited. For example, we have<br>
​​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;no idea how to replace thousands</p>
        <p>100&nbsp; of species now extinct or repair the<br>
​​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;ozone layer.</p>
        <p>​​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What are our real basic needs in order<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;to live rich and fulfilling lives? I believe<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;you cannot separate environmental</p>
        <p>105&nbsp;&nbsp;and social needs. Hungry people will<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;not care if their actions endanger an<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;edible species or an important habitat.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unemployment, injustice or insecurity<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;lead to desperation and the need to<br>
110&nbsp;&nbsp;survive at all costs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To protect an environment for future<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;generations, we have to build a society<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;on a foundation of clean air, water, soil<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;and energy to fulfil our needs; we have<br>
115&nbsp;&nbsp;to ensure full employment, justice and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;security for all communities to serve our<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;social needs; and we have to retain<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;sacred places, a sense of belonging and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;connectedness with nature and a<br>
120&nbsp;&nbsp;knowledge that there are cosmic forces<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;beyond our comprehension or control,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;to satisfy our spiritual requirements.</p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;economy to construct from there. Right<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;everything into the constraints dictated<br>

          <strong>The ultimate test for life’s priorities</strong>
          <br>
          <em>David Suzuki</em>
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>
            <em>David Suzuki is a Canadian-based environmentalist, scientist, author and broadcaster. This is an edited version of a speech he gave at the Seymour Centre in Sydney.</em>
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In November 1992, more than half of<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;all living Nobel Prize winners signed a<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;document called ‘World Scientists’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Warning to Humanity’ that began with<br>
5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this stark statement: ‘Human beings and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;the natural world are on a collision<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;course. Human activities inflict harsh<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;and often irreversible damage on the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; environment. If not checked, many of<br>
10&nbsp; our practices put at serious risk the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;future we wish for human society.’</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Scientists are extremely cautious<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;when making pronouncements to the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;general public, so this was a most<br>
15&nbsp; unusual alarm call. In biological terms,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;the globe is experiencing an ecoholocaust,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;as more than 50,000 species<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;vanish annually and air, water and soil<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;are poisoned with civilisation’s<br>
20&nbsp; effluents. The great challenge of the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;millennium is recognising the reality of<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;impending ecological collapse, and the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;urgent need to get on with taking the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;steps to avoid it.</p>
        <p>25&nbsp; &nbsp; But our obsession with economics has<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;become an impediment to taking<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;appropriate action. I have often been<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;told: ‘Listen Suzuki, we have to pay for<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;all those parks and environmental clean-<br>
30&nbsp; ups. We can’t afford to protect the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;environment if we don’t have a strong,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;growing economy.’ That sentiment<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;flows from a belief that the economy<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;provides us with all of our products,<br>
35&nbsp; from food to oil to manufactured goods.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This is nonsense.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Everything we depend on, whether it<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;is cars, popcorn or computers, comes<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;from the earth and will eventually end<br>
40&nbsp; up going back to it. It is the biosphere,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;that thin layer of air, water and soil<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;within which life exists, that creates the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;earth’s productivity and abundance<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;that, in turn, make economies and our<br>
45&nbsp; lives possible.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I suggest the following exercise can<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;help to get our priorities in order.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine that you have lived a full and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;rich life and are now on your death-bed.<br>
50&nbsp; As you reflect on life, what memories fill<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;you with happiness, pride and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;satisfaction?</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I suspect it will not be the latest<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;designer clothing, a huge house, a sport<br>
55&nbsp; utility vehicle or a high tech<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;entertainment centre. What makes life<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;worthwhile and joyful is not ‘stuff’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;that can be bought with money. The<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;most important things are family,<br>
60&nbsp; friends, community and the sharing<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;that enhances the quality of all of our<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;lives.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are several reasons we are<br>

          <strong>The ultimate test for life’s priorities</strong>
          <br>
          <em>David Suzuki</em>
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>
            <em>David Suzuki is a Canadian-based environmentalist, scientist, author and broadcaster. This is an edited version of a speech he gave at the Seymour Centre in Sydney.</em>
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In November 1992, more than half of<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;all living Nobel Prize winners signed a<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;document called ‘World Scientists’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Warning to Humanity’ that began with<br>
5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this stark statement: ‘Human beings and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;the natural world are on a collision<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;course. Human activities inflict harsh<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;and often irreversible damage on the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; environment. If not checked, many of<br>
10&nbsp; our practices put at serious risk the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;future we wish for human society.’</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Scientists are extremely cautious<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;when making pronouncements to the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;general public, so this was a most<br>
15&nbsp; unusual alarm call. In biological terms,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;the globe is experiencing an ecoholocaust,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;as more than 50,000 species<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;vanish annually and air, water and soil<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;are poisoned with civilisation’s<br>
20&nbsp; effluents. The great challenge of the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;millennium is recognising the reality of<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;impending ecological collapse, and the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;urgent need to get on with taking the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;steps to avoid it.</p>
        <p>25&nbsp; &nbsp; But our obsession with economics has<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;become an impediment to taking<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;appropriate action. I have often been<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;told: ‘Listen Suzuki, we have to pay for<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;all those parks and environmental clean-<br>
30&nbsp; ups. We can’t afford to protect the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;environment if we don’t have a strong,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;growing economy.’ That sentiment<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;flows from a belief that the economy<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;provides us with all of our products,<br>
35&nbsp; from food to oil to manufactured goods.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This is nonsense.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Everything we depend on, whether it<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;is cars, popcorn or computers, comes<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;from the earth and will eventually end<br>
40&nbsp; up going back to it. It is the biosphere,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;that thin layer of air, water and soil<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;within which life exists, that creates the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;earth’s productivity and abundance<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;that, in turn, make economies and our<br>
45&nbsp; lives possible.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I suggest the following exercise can<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;help to get our priorities in order.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine that you have lived a full and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;rich life and are now on your death-bed.<br>
50&nbsp; As you reflect on life, what memories fill<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;you with happiness, pride and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;satisfaction?</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I suspect it will not be the latest<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;designer clothing, a huge house, a sport<br>
55&nbsp; utility vehicle or a high tech<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;entertainment centre. What makes life<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;worthwhile and joyful is not ‘stuff’<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;that can be bought with money. The<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;most important things are family,<br>
60&nbsp; friends, community and the sharing<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;that enhances the quality of all of our<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;lives.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are several reasons we are<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;failing to see the urgency of what is<br>
65&nbsp; happening, including:</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;• Most people alive today were born<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;after 1950 and thus have lived<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;all their lives during a period<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;of spectacular unprecedented and<br>
70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unsustainable growth and change.<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But for most of us, this is all<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;we’ve ever known and it seems<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;normal. Rapid change also brings<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;rapid collective forgetfulness, and<br>
75&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;memories of what the world once<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;was quickly fade.</p>
        <p>​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; • Most people now live in the<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;human-created environment of big<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;cities where it’s easy to believe the<br>
80&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;illusion that we have escaped our<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;biological dependence on the<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;natural world.</p>
        <p>​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;• The explosive increase in<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;information shatters the world into<br>
85&nbsp; &nbsp; fragments devoid of the history<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;or context that might explain<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;their relevance, importance or<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;significance. In order to attract<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;attention, stories or reports become</p>
        <p>90&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;shorter and increasingly shrill,<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;sensational or violent.</p>
        <p>​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;• The great public faith that ‘they’&nbsp;—<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;scientists and technologists — will<br>
​​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;resolve our problems is simply</p>
        <p>95&nbsp; &nbsp; unwarranted. While technology<br>
​​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;can be impressive, our knowledge<br>
​​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;of the complexity of the real world<br>
​​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;is so limited. For example, we have<br>
​​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;no idea how to replace thousands</p>
        <p>100&nbsp; of species now extinct or repair the<br>
​​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;ozone layer.</p>
        <p>​​&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What are our real basic needs in order<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;to live rich and fulfilling lives? I believe<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;you cannot separate environmental</p>
        <p>105&nbsp;&nbsp;and social needs. Hungry people will<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;not care if their actions endanger an<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;edible species or an important habitat.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unemployment, injustice or insecurity<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;lead to desperation and the need to<br>
110&nbsp;&nbsp;survive at all costs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To protect an environment for future<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;generations, we have to build a society<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;on a foundation of clean air, water, soil<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;and energy to fulfil our needs; we have<br>
115&nbsp;&nbsp;to ensure full employment, justice and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;security for all communities to serve our<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;social needs; and we have to retain<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;sacred places, a sense of belonging and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;connectedness with nature and a<br>
120&nbsp;&nbsp;knowledge that there are cosmic forces<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;beyond our comprehension or control,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;to satisfy our spiritual requirements.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then, we can work on the best kind of<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;economy to construct from there. Right<br>
125&nbsp;&nbsp;now, we seem to be trying to squeeze<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;everything into the constraints dictated<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;by the economy without establishing the<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;fundamental bottom line.</p>

          <strong>Rescue at Pea Island</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Tracey E. Fern</em>
        </p>
        <p>Station Keeper Richard Etheridge peered from the lookout tower of the Pea Island life-saving station. Fog swirled around his face, and it was pitch-dark. Huge waves crashed onto the beach, and hurricane-force winds hurled sand and sea spray into the air.</p>
        <p>On that night back in October 1896, the worst storm in almost fifty years was battering the North Carolina coast. Moments earlier, one of Etheridge’s surfmen, Theodore Meekins, had spotted a faint red glimmer in the distance. Could it have been a flare from a ship in distress?</p>
        <p>Etheridge quickly lit a flare and held it high over his head until the flame died out. Then he saw it—a dull red light flickered to the south. That could mean only one thing: shipwreck.</p>
        <p><strong>The Keeper of the Station</strong><br>
Rescuing ships in distress was nothing new for Etheridge. He had been keeper of this life-saving station since 1880. Etheridge had grown up swimming, fishing, and boating on nearby Roanoke Island. He eventually became known as one of the best surfmen and lifesavers in North Carolina. But Etheridge was also known for something else: he was the Life-Saving Service’s first African American station chief.</p>
        <p>White surfmen refused to work under Etheridge. So Etheridge and the Life-Saving Service recruited a crew of African American rescuers to work with him.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Etheridge’s men trained for ten hours a day, seven days a week. They swam in the rough surf and patrolled the beach. They performed life-saving drills and tugged their 1,500-pound surfboat and equipment for miles through the sand. But the wreck on the night of October 1896 put all of the crew’s practice to the test.</p>
        <p><strong>Rescuing the Wreck</strong><br>
As soon as Etheridge and Meekins spotted the red flare, they woke up the other five surfmen on duty. The crew quickly hitched up a team of mules. Then they pushed and pulled their surfboat and equipment cart down the beach for two miles.</p>
        <p>“The storm was raging fearfully,” Etheridge later wrote, “and . . . the team was often brought to a standstill by the sweeping current.” But the crew kept trudging through the knee-deep sand and icy water. Finally, they spotted the wreck.</p>
        <p>The schooner E.S. <em>Newman </em>had blown aground 30 yards offshore. The storm had ripped off the ship’s sails and demolished her deck. Now the battered ship was rolling and tossing in the surf. All nine of the passengers and crew, including the captain’s wife and three-year-old child, were trapped onboard.</p>
        <p>“It seemed impossible under such circumstances to render any assistance,” Etheridge later wrote.</p>
        <p>But unless someone did something soon, the passengers would probably be swept out to sea, die from exposure, or be crushed when the <em>Newman </em>broke apart in the surf. So Etheridge came up with a daring plan.</p>
        <p>His men would try to swim to the ship. Meekins and another surfman volunteered for the first attempt. They lashed themselves together with a rope. Then they grabbed one end of a life-saving line while the rest of the crew held the other end of the line securely to the beach.</p>
        <p>Meekins and the other surfman slowly waded farther out into the chilly water. They struggled through the currents and against the undertow in total darkness.</p>
        <p>Onboard the <em>Newman</em>, the captain lowered a ladder over the side of the broken ship. Finally the surfmen reached the ship.</p>
        <p>“The voice of gladden[ed] hearts greeted the arrival of the station crew,” Etheridge later wrote.</p>
        <p>One passenger climbed carefully down the ladder. Meekins knotted the end of the rope around him. Slowly they carried him through the churning water to safety. Then two other surfmen headed back to the <em>Newman</em>.</p>
        <p>Next, they carried the child to shore. Then they returned to rescue the captain’s wife. Again and again, the surfmen took turns swimming in pairs through the sea to the wreck. After six grueling hours, the <em>Newman </em>was destroyed, but all nine passengers were safely onshore.</p>
        <p><strong>Life After the Rescue</strong><br>
The captain of the <em>Newman </em>was so grateful that he gave Etheridge and his crew the ship’s name board. But for many years, this was the only award that the surfmen received. Pea Island Station was closed in 1947, and everyone seemed to forget the courageous crew.</p>
        <p>Finally, in 1996 Etheridge and his men were awarded the Coast Guard’s highest honor, the Gold Lifesaving Medal, for their “extreme and heroic daring.” One hundred years after the <em>Newman </em>rescue, the men of the Pea Island Station were recognized for what they were—heroes.<br>

          <strong>Coming to the Crew’s Rescue</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Kate Burkart, an eighth-grader from North Carolina, helped to “rescue” the Pea Island crew. She wrote letters to her senator and President Clinton.<br>
With Coast Guard officer Stephen Rochon and graduate students David Wright and David Zoby, Burkart submitted a report to the Coast Guard about the crew.<br>
Their hard work paid off. Burkart was at the Navy Memorial when the Gold Lifesaving Medal was awarded to the Pea Island crew.</p>
