Chengdu Shishi High School was founded in 141 B.C. and has operated on the same site for more than 2,150 years. The school has an excellent reputation on a provincial and national level and is located in the downtown area on an attractive campus. The international centre follows the British Cambridge International exams for its A-level program. These prepare students well for entry to universities worldwide.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Chengdu is the capital of Sichuan province and one of China’s largest cities. With a long history, it is now famous for its relaxed lifestyle, spicy cuisine and as the home of the panda.<br>
<br>
Chengdu Shishi High School is likely the oldest school in the world, standing on the site of the first Chinese public school, built by a Han dynasty governor. It was originally constructed in stone, hence the current school’s name Shishi, which means stone chamber. The school is very much a Chinese state institution and students have physical exercises in the morning, eye exercises in the afternoon and the day begins with the national anthem. However, it is very internationally minded and fosters regular exchange program with countries including the USA and Denmark. In 2016, it hosted Cambridge International Examinations training courses that were attended by teachers from China and beyond.<br>

The King’s School in Canterbury is a modern school with a long history. Its roots can be traced back as far a 597 A.D. This was when St Augustine, having arrived in Canterbury from Rome, founded a monastery school. King Henry VIII’s banning of the monasteries meant it was re-founded as the King’s School in 1541. As the school flourished, the need for a primary school became apparent. It was founded in 1879, but the primary section spent the first half century in church grounds. Then in 1929, it moved to its present premises in Sturry, two miles from Canterbury. Formerly the home of Lord Alfred Milner, the Tudor house and grounds were given to The King’s School in his memory by Lady Milner. The new school building is on 80 acres along the River Stour. It was opened by the famous writer and poet, Rudyard Kipling on 5 October.<br>

There are some very unusual schools in the world. In Bangladesh, floods make it difficult for some students to learn, so education has been given to young people by transforming boats into schools and libraries. Then there is a special teaching facility, the Salem’s witch school that teaches witchcraft as the main subject. Dong Zhong, a school in a cave in the poor Mao village in Ziyun County in China, has been the place of learning since 1984 for kids with no access to education. But the school was recently closed after the Chinese government said China is not ‘a society of cavemen’. The 2,000 students at River Plate&nbsp;School, Argentina spend their school time learning in the Buenos Aires world class soccer Stadium; home of Atletico River Plate soccer club. Students at Microsoft-designed ‘School of the Future’, Philadelphia are given a laptop, but no reading or writing books. The school doesn’t allow using paper at all. In a social experiment, Burgess Hill School in London had absolutely no rules for students to follow. This was so much so that even lessons were voluntary. As such the school is no longer in operation. The Train Platform Schools in India use trains at train platforms to help children educate themselves instead of begging for money. They have so far taught 4,000 students. Which of these schools would you like to attend?&nbsp;<br>

Welcome to Australia’s National Youth Circus, the Flying Fruit Fly Circus. We deliver Australia’s only full-time circus training program for students aged 8-19 in partnership with our own academic school, providing a holistic, nurturing creative education. We tour the world with our contemporary circus performances. Our unique full-time program uses circus as the creative and physical inspiration for young people to flourish. We provide elite-level training in technical skill and artistic ability while equally embracing the physical and creative joys of a circus environment for young people who aspire to many futures.<br>
<br>
With many landmark projects to our name and an ever-increasing roll call of alumni working in leading companies around the world, we are arguably Australia’s “most influential circus company” (Arts Hub), continuing to enrich the lives of many young Australians in north-east Victoria, southern NSW and from around the country. Basic acrobatic training involves strength, speed, agility, stamina and endurance including stunt rolls, flips, dives and falls, as well as further developing circus disciplines such as aerial ring, trapeze, juggle and manipulation. Come see for yourself what the Flying Fruit Fly Circus is like on the inside. It could be the school for you.<br>

Then in 1929, it moved to its present premises in Sturry, two miles from Canterbury. Formerly the home of Lord Alfred Milner, the Tudor house and grounds were given to The King’s School in his memory by Lady Milner. The new school building is on 80 acres along the River Stour. It was opened by the famous writer and poet, Rudyard Kipling on 5 October.<br>

There are some very unusual schools in the world. In Bangladesh, floods make it difficult for some students to learn, so education has been given to young people by transforming boats into schools and libraries. Then there is a special teaching facility, the Salem’s witch school that teaches witchcraft as the main subject. Dong Zhong, a school in a cave in the poor Mao village in Ziyun County in China, has been the place of learning since 1984 for kids with no access to education. But the school was recently closed after the Chinese government said China is not ‘a society of cavemen’. The 2,000 students at River Plate&nbsp;School, Argentina spend their school time learning in the Buenos Aires world class soccer Stadium; home of Atletico River Plate soccer club. Students at Microsoft-designed ‘School of the Future’, Philadelphia are given a laptop, but no reading or writing books. The school doesn’t allow using paper at all. In a social experiment, Burgess Hill School in London had absolutely no rules for students to follow. This was so much so that even lessons were voluntary. As such the school is no longer in operation. The Train Platform Schools in India use trains at train platforms to help children educate themselves instead of begging for money. They have so far taught 4,000 students. Which of these schools would you like to attend?&nbsp;<br>

Welcome to Australia’s National Youth Circus, the Flying Fruit Fly Circus. We deliver Australia’s only full-time circus training program for students aged 8-19 in partnership with our own academic school, providing a holistic, nurturing creative education. We tour the world with our contemporary circus performances. Our unique full-time program uses circus as the creative and physical inspiration for young people to flourish. We provide elite-level training in technical skill and artistic ability while equally embracing the physical and creative joys of a circus environment for young people who aspire to many futures.<br>
<br>
With many landmark projects to our name and an ever-increasing roll call of alumni working in leading companies around the world, we are arguably Australia’s “most influential circus company” (Arts Hub), continuing to enrich the lives of many young Australians in north-east Victoria, southern NSW and from around the country. Basic acrobatic training involves strength, speed, agility, stamina and endurance including stunt rolls, flips, dives and falls, as well as further developing circus disciplines such as aerial ring, trapeze, juggle and manipulation. Come see for yourself what the Flying Fruit Fly Circus is like on the inside. It could be the school for you.<br>

Chengdu Shishi High School was founded in 141 B.C. and has operated on the same site for more than 2,150 years. The school has an excellent reputation on a provincial and national level and is located in the downtown area on an attractive campus. The international centre follows the British Cambridge International exams for its A-level program. These prepare students well for entry to universities worldwide.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Chengdu is the capital of Sichuan province and one of China’s largest cities. With a long history, it is now famous for its relaxed lifestyle, spicy cuisine and as the home of the panda.<br>
<br>
Chengdu Shishi High School is likely the oldest school in the world, standing on the site of the first Chinese public school, built by a Han dynasty governor. It was originally constructed in stone, hence the current school’s name Shishi, which means stone chamber. The school is very much a Chinese state institution and students have physical exercises in the morning, eye exercises in the afternoon and the day begins with the national anthem. However, it is very internationally minded and fosters regular exchange program with countries including the USA and Denmark. In 2016, it hosted Cambridge International Examinations training courses that were attended by teachers from China and beyond.<br>

        <p>Raha and her friends were looking at a map of the suburbs in NSW on software which is updated daily. Raha commented that by simply knowing the name of a street or road, it would be enough to locate the exact suburb or town it belongs to.</p>
        <p>Her friends somewhat disagree and pointed out a few things:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Some streets could be new and so the map might be inaccurate.</li>
          <li>Some roads are very long and extend interstate or through multiple suburbs.</li>
          <li>Some suburbs have streets or roads of the same names despite not being adjacent.</li>
          <li>Some towns might have roads that are not named.&nbsp;</li>
