        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Holden Equinox: While the Holden Equinox was a comparatively late entrant into the medium-sized SUV market, it has quickly established itself as one of the very best.<br>
<br>
Boasting a massive goodie bag of features, including a 7-inch touchscreen, active noise cancellation, 17-inch alloy wheels, a reversing camera, and automatic headlights, the Equinox is certainly top of its class when it comes to kit.<br>
<br>
In terms of on-road performance, the Equinox fares equally well, offering a comfortable ride with a ton of storage space, highlighted by an engine that delivers a stunning 188kW of power – far more than any of its competitors. Of course, this added power doesn’t compromise the safety or practicality you would expect from a top of the line medium-sized SUV.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Hyundai Tucson: The Hyundai Tucson has everything that you would expect from a high- quality medium-sized SUV – comfort, safety, an eye-catching design, and a long list of features.<br>
<br>
However, what really sets it apart from competitors is its on-road performance, offering a smooth, comfortable ride unmatched by any other opponents, highlighted by top-notch suspension, a refined engine, and reliable steering.<br>
<br>
In terms of safety, the Tucson is also a winner, delivering six&nbsp;airbags (including dual front airbags), as well as front-side and full-length curtain airbags, and electronic stability control. Partner this with an extremely spacious boot and ISOFIX anchor points, and the Hyundai Tucson is sure to appeal to parents.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Mitsubishi Outlander: If you’re lucky enough to land in an Outlander, you’ll quickly see why this roomy SUV has been making waves. The Mitsubishi Outlander is equipped with 7 seats – a rare sight among its closest competitors in the medium-sized SUV market, exceeding expectancies of what a medium-sized SUV is often presumed to be. This makes for an extremely spacious interior, and no lack of storage room.<br>
<br>
Also setting it apart from other medium-sized SUVs, the Outlander features a turbo-diesel engine, which makes for a refined and effortless driving experience. Between the seven seats and the diesel engine, the Mitsubishi Outlander is in a class all of its own when it comes to medium-sized SUVs. Pair this with a solid entertainment system, a standard list of safety features and an intuitive design, and the Mitsubishi Outlander is a real standout!<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Mazda CX-9: The Mazda CX-9 is a large SUV loaded with a little luxury. Upon entering the CX-9, you could be forgiven for mistaking it for a smaller, flashier model. Mazda obviously don’t believe in trading size for comfort, with the large CX-9 featuring an elegant<br>
leather steering wheel, paired with black cloth seat covers, which round out an exceptionally well-designed interior. Really, there are little touches of class wherever you look.<br>
<br>
The CX-9 also knocks it out of the park when it comes to safety beating all of its competitors, including a rear-view camera, blind-spot monitoring, autonomous braking in case of emergency, ISOFIX connection points, rear sensors for parking, and six airbags.<br>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>The Betsy-Tacy Treasury</strong><br><br><em>by Maud Hart Lovelace</em><br><br>
It was difficult, later, to think of a time when Betsy and Tacy had not been friends. Hill Street came to regard them almost as one person. Betsy’s brown braids went with Tacy’s red curls, Betsy’s plump legs with Tacy’s spindly ones, to school and from school, uphill and down, on errands and in play. So that when Tacy had the mumps and Betsy was obliged to make her journeys alone, saucy boys teased her: “Where’s the cheese, apple pie?” “Where’s your mush, milk?” As though she didn’t feel lonesome enough already! And Hill Street knew when Sunday came, even without listening to the rolling bells, for Betsy Ray and Tacy Kelly (whose parents attended different churches), set off down Hill Street separately, looking uncomfortable&nbsp; and strange.<br>
<br>
But on this March afternoon, a month before Betsy’s fifth birthday, they did not know each other. They had not even seen each other, unless Betsy had glimpsed Tacy, without knowing her for Tacy, among the children of assorted sizes moving into the house across the street. Betsy had been kept in because of bad weather, and all day she had sat with her <span class="txt-underline"><strong>nose pasted to the pane</strong></span>. It was exciting beyond words to have a family with children moving into that house.<br>
<br>
Hill Street was rightfully named. It ran straight up into a green hill and stopped. The name of the town was Deep Valley, and a town named Deep Valley naturally had plenty of hills. Betsy’s house, a small yellow cottage, was the last house on her side of Hill Street, and the rambling white house opposite was the last house on that side. So of course, it was very important. And it had been empty ever since Betsy could remember. “I hope whoever moves in will have children,” Betsy’s mother had said.<br>
<br>
“Well, for Pete’s sake!” said Betsy’s father. “Hill Street is so full of children now that Old Mag has to watch out where she puts her feet down.”<br>
<br>
“I know,” said Betsy’s mother. “There are plenty of children for Julia.” (Julia was Betsy’s sister, eight years old.) “And there are dozens of babies. But there isn’t one little girl just Betsy’s age. And that’s what I’m hoping will come to the house across the street.” That was what Betsy hoped, too. And that was what she had been watching for all day as she sat at the dining room window. She was certain there must be such a little girl. There were girls of almost every size and boys to match, milling about the moving dray and in and out of the house. But she wasn’t sure. She hadn’t absolutely seen one. She had watched all day, and now the dining room was getting dark. Julia had stopped practising her music lesson, and Mrs. Ray had lighted the lamp in the kitchen.<br>
<br>
The March snow lay cold and dirty outside the window, but the wind had died down, and the western sky, behind the house opposite, was stained with red. The furniture had all been carried in, and the dray was gone. A light was shining in the house. Suddenly the front door opened, and a little girl ran out. She wore a hood beneath which long red ringlets spattered out above her coat. Her legs in their long black stockings were thin. It was Tacy, although Betsy did not know it! She ran first to the hitching block, and bounced there on her toes a minute, looking up at the sky and all around. Then, she ran up the road to the point where it ended on the hill. Some long-gone person had placed a bench there.&nbsp;It commanded the view down Hill Street. The little girl climbed up on this bench and looked intently into the dusk. “I know just how she feels,” thought Betsy with a throb. “This is her new home. She wants to see what it’s like.” She ran to her mother.<br>
<br>
“Mamma!” she cried. “There’s the little girl my age. Please let me go out! Just a minute! Please!” Mrs. Ray was moved by the entreaty. She looked out at the coloured sky.<br>
<br>
“It does seem to be clearing up,” she said. “But you could only stay a minute. Do you want to go to the bother of putting on your things...”<br>
<br>
“Oh, yes, yes!”<br>
“Overshoes and mittens and everything?”<br>
“Yes, really!”<br>
<br>
Betsy flew to the closet, but she could not find her hoodie. The mittens were twisted on the string inside her coat.<br>
<br>
“Mamma! Help me! Please! She’ll be gone.”<br>
“Help her, Julia,” called Betsy’s mother, and Julia helped, and at last the hood was tied, and the coat buttoned, and the overshoes buckled, and the mittens pulled on.<br>
<br>
Outside the air was fresh and cold. The streetlamp had been lighted. It was exciting just to be out at this hour, even without the prospect of meeting the new little girl. But the new little girl still stood on the bench looking down the street. Betsy ran toward her. She ran on the sidewalk as far as it went. Then she took to the frozen rutty road, and she had almost reached the bench when the little girl saw her.<br>
<br>
“Hello!” called Betsy. “What’s your name?” The other child made no answer. She jumped off the bench. “Don’t go!” cried Betsy. “I’m coming.” But the other child without a word began to run. She brushed past Betsy on her headlong flight down the hill. She ran like a frightened rabbit, and Betsy ran in pursuit. “Wait! Wait!” Betsy panted as she ran. But the new child would not stop. On fleet, black-stockinged legs she ran, faster than Betsy could follow. “Wait! Wait!” pleaded Betsy but the child did not turn her head. She gained her own lawn, floundered through the snow to her house. The entrance to her house was through a storm shed. She ran into this and banged the door. The door had a pane of glass in the front, and through that pane she stared fearfully at Betsy. Betsy stood still, winking back tears, a mittened finger in her mouth. At last, she turned and trudged slowly back through the snowy dark to her house. She had almost reached her porch when the door of the storm shed opened. The new little girl stuck out her head. “Tacy!” she shouted.<br>
<br>
“You needn’t call names!” Betsy shouted back. Tacy was shouting her own name, really. But it was such an odd one, Betsy didn’t understand. She trudged on into the house. The lamp hanging over the dining room table was lighted now. A delicious smell of fried potatoes floated from the kitchen. “Well,” her mother called out cheerfully. “Did you get acquainted?”<br>
<br>
“What’s her name?” asked Julia.<br>
“I don’t know. I don’t like her. I’m mad at her,” said Betsy. It was all she could do not to cry.<br>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>The Betsy-Tacy Treasury</strong><br><br><em>by Maud Hart Lovelace</em><br><br>
It was difficult, later, to think of a time when Betsy and Tacy had not been friends. Hill Street came to regard them almost as one person. Betsy’s brown braids went with Tacy’s red curls, Betsy’s plump legs with Tacy’s spindly ones, to school and from school, uphill and down, on errands and in play. So that when Tacy had the mumps and Betsy was obliged to make her journeys alone, saucy boys teased her: “Where’s the cheese, apple pie?” “Where’s your mush, milk?” As though she didn’t feel lonesome enough already! And Hill Street knew when Sunday came, even without listening to the rolling bells, for Betsy Ray and Tacy Kelly (whose parents attended different churches), set off down Hill Street separately, looking uncomfortable&nbsp; and strange.<br>
<br>
But on this March afternoon, a month before Betsy’s fifth birthday, they did not know each other. They had not even seen each other, unless Betsy had glimpsed Tacy, without knowing her for Tacy, among the children of assorted sizes moving into the house across the street. Betsy had been kept in because of bad weather, and all day she had sat with her <span class="txt-underline"><strong>nose pasted to the pane</strong></span>. It was exciting beyond words to have a family with children moving into that house.<br>
<br>
Hill Street was rightfully named. It ran straight up into a green hill and stopped. The name of the town was Deep Valley, and a town named Deep Valley naturally had plenty of hills. Betsy’s house, a small yellow cottage, was the last house on her side of Hill Street, and the rambling white house opposite was the last house on that side. So of course, it was very important. And it had been empty ever since Betsy could remember. “I hope whoever moves in will have children,” Betsy’s mother had said.<br>
<br>
“Well, for Pete’s sake!” said Betsy’s father. “Hill Street is so full of children now that Old Mag has to watch out where she puts her feet down.”<br>
<br>
“I know,” said Betsy’s mother. “There are plenty of children for Julia.” (Julia was Betsy’s sister, eight years old.) “And there are dozens of babies. But there isn’t one little girl just Betsy’s age. And that’s what I’m hoping will come to the house across the street.” That was what Betsy hoped, too. And that was what she had been watching for all day as she sat at the dining room window. She was certain there must be such a little girl. There were girls of almost every size and boys to match, milling about the moving dray and in and out of the house. But she wasn’t sure. She hadn’t absolutely seen one. She had watched all day, and now the dining room was getting dark. Julia had stopped practising her music lesson, and Mrs. Ray had lighted the lamp in the kitchen.<br>
<br>
The March snow lay cold and dirty outside the window, but the wind had died down, and the western sky, behind the house opposite, was stained with red. The furniture had all been carried in, and the dray was gone. A light was shining in the house. Suddenly the front door opened, and a little girl ran out. She wore a hood beneath which long red ringlets spattered out above her coat. Her legs in their long black stockings were thin. It was Tacy, although Betsy did not know it! She ran first to the hitching block, and bounced there on her toes a minute, looking up at the sky and all around. Then, she ran up the road to the point where it ended on the hill. Some long-gone person had placed a bench there.&nbsp;It commanded the view down Hill Street. The little girl climbed up on this bench and looked intently into the dusk. “I know just how she feels,” thought Betsy with a throb. “This is her new home. She wants to see what it’s like.” She ran to her mother.<br>
<br>
“Mamma!” she cried. “There’s the little girl my age. Please let me go out! Just a minute! Please!” Mrs. Ray was moved by the entreaty. She looked out at the coloured sky.<br>
<br>
“It does seem to be clearing up,” she said. “But you could only stay a minute. Do you want to go to the bother of putting on your things...”<br>
<br>
“Oh, yes, yes!”<br>
“Overshoes and mittens and everything?”<br>
“Yes, really!”<br>
<br>
Betsy flew to the closet, but she could not find her hoodie. The mittens were twisted on the string inside her coat.<br>
<br>
“Mamma! Help me! Please! She’ll be gone.”<br>
“Help her, Julia,” called Betsy’s mother, and Julia helped, and at last the hood was tied, and the coat buttoned, and the overshoes buckled, and the mittens pulled on.<br>
<br>
Outside the air was fresh and cold. The streetlamp had been lighted. It was exciting just to be out at this hour, even without the prospect of meeting the new little girl. But the new little girl still stood on the bench looking down the street. Betsy ran toward her. She ran on the sidewalk as far as it went. Then she took to the frozen rutty road, and she had almost reached the bench when the little girl saw her.<br>
<br>
“Hello!” called Betsy. “What’s your name?” The other child made no answer. She jumped off the bench. “Don’t go!” cried Betsy. “I’m coming.” But the other child without a word began to run. She brushed past Betsy on her headlong flight down the hill. She ran like a frightened rabbit, and Betsy ran in pursuit. “Wait! Wait!” Betsy panted as she ran. But the new child would not stop. On fleet, black-stockinged legs she ran, faster than Betsy could follow. “Wait! Wait!” pleaded Betsy but the child did not turn her head. She gained her own lawn, floundered through the snow to her house. The entrance to her house was through a storm shed. She ran into this and banged the door. The door had a pane of glass in the front, and through that pane she stared fearfully at Betsy. Betsy stood still, winking back tears, a mittened finger in her mouth. At last, she turned and trudged slowly back through the snowy dark to her house. She had almost reached her porch when the door of the storm shed opened. The new little girl stuck out her head. “Tacy!” she shouted.<br>
<br>
“You needn’t call names!” Betsy shouted back. Tacy was shouting her own name, really. But it was such an odd one, Betsy didn’t understand. She trudged on into the house. The lamp hanging over the dining room table was lighted now. A delicious smell of fried potatoes floated from the kitchen. “Well,” her mother called out cheerfully. “Did you get acquainted?”<br>
<br>
“What’s her name?” asked Julia.<br>
“I don’t know. I don’t like her. I’m mad at her,” said Betsy. It was all she could do not to cry.<br>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>The Betsy-Tacy Treasury</strong><br><br><em>by Maud Hart Lovelace</em><br><br>
It was difficult, later, to think of a time when Betsy and Tacy had not been friends. Hill Street came to regard them almost as one person. Betsy’s brown braids went with Tacy’s red curls, Betsy’s plump legs with Tacy’s spindly ones, to school and from school, uphill and down, on errands and in play. So that when Tacy had the mumps and Betsy was obliged to make her journeys alone, saucy boys teased her: “Where’s the cheese, apple pie?” “Where’s your mush, milk?” As though she didn’t feel lonesome enough already! And Hill Street knew when Sunday came, even without listening to the rolling bells, for Betsy Ray and Tacy Kelly (whose parents attended different churches), set off down Hill Street separately, looking uncomfortable&nbsp; and strange.<br>
<br>
But on this March afternoon, a month before Betsy’s fifth birthday, they did not know each other. They had not even seen each other, unless Betsy had glimpsed Tacy, without knowing her for Tacy, among the children of assorted sizes moving into the house across the street. Betsy had been kept in because of bad weather, and all day she had sat with her <span class="txt-underline"><strong>nose pasted to the pane</strong></span>. It was exciting beyond words to have a family with children moving into that house.<br>
<br>
Hill Street was rightfully named. It ran straight up into a green hill and stopped. The name of the town was Deep Valley, and a town named Deep Valley naturally had plenty of hills. Betsy’s house, a small yellow cottage, was the last house on her side of Hill Street, and the rambling white house opposite was the last house on that side. So of course, it was very important. And it had been empty ever since Betsy could remember. “I hope whoever moves in will have children,” Betsy’s mother had said.<br>
<br>
“Well, for Pete’s sake!” said Betsy’s father. “Hill Street is so full of children now that Old Mag has to watch out where she puts her feet down.”<br>
<br>
“I know,” said Betsy’s mother. “There are plenty of children for Julia.” (Julia was Betsy’s sister, eight years old.) “And there are dozens of babies. But there isn’t one little girl just Betsy’s age. And that’s what I’m hoping will come to the house across the street.” That was what Betsy hoped, too. And that was what she had been watching for all day as she sat at the dining room window. She was certain there must be such a little girl. There were girls of almost every size and boys to match, milling about the moving dray and in and out of the house. But she wasn’t sure. She hadn’t absolutely seen one. She had watched all day, and now the dining room was getting dark. Julia had stopped practising her music lesson, and Mrs. Ray had lighted the lamp in the kitchen.<br>
<br>
The March snow lay cold and dirty outside the window, but the wind had died down, and the western sky, behind the house opposite, was stained with red. The furniture had all been carried in, and the dray was gone. A light was shining in the house. Suddenly the front door opened, and a little girl ran out. She wore a hood beneath which long red ringlets spattered out above her coat. Her legs in their long black stockings were thin. It was Tacy, although Betsy did not know it! She ran first to the hitching block, and bounced there on her toes a minute, looking up at the sky and all around. Then, she ran up the road to the point where it ended on the hill. Some long-gone person had placed a bench there.&nbsp;It commanded the view down Hill Street. The little girl climbed up on this bench and looked intently into the dusk. “I know just how she feels,” thought Betsy with a throb. “This is her new home. She wants to see what it’s like.” She ran to her mother.<br>
<br>
“Mamma!” she cried. “There’s the little girl my age. Please let me go out! Just a minute! Please!” Mrs. Ray was moved by the entreaty. She looked out at the coloured sky.<br>
<br>
“It does seem to be clearing up,” she said. “But you could only stay a minute. Do you want to go to the bother of putting on your things...”<br>
<br>
“Oh, yes, yes!”<br>
“Overshoes and mittens and everything?”<br>
“Yes, really!”<br>
<br>
Betsy flew to the closet, but she could not find her hoodie. The mittens were twisted on the string inside her coat.<br>
<br>
“Mamma! Help me! Please! She’ll be gone.”<br>
“Help her, Julia,” called Betsy’s mother, and Julia helped, and at last the hood was tied, and the coat buttoned, and the overshoes buckled, and the mittens pulled on.<br>
<br>
Outside the air was fresh and cold. The streetlamp had been lighted. It was exciting just to be out at this hour, even without the prospect of meeting the new little girl. But the new little girl still stood on the bench looking down the street. Betsy ran toward her. She ran on the sidewalk as far as it went. Then she took to the frozen rutty road, and she had almost reached the bench when the little girl saw her.<br>
<br>
“Hello!” called Betsy. “What’s your name?” The other child made no answer. She jumped off the bench. “Don’t go!” cried Betsy. “I’m coming.” But the other child without a word began to run. She brushed past Betsy on her headlong flight down the hill. She ran like a frightened rabbit, and Betsy ran in pursuit. “Wait! Wait!” Betsy panted as she ran. But the new child would not stop. On fleet, black-stockinged legs she ran, faster than Betsy could follow. “Wait! Wait!” pleaded Betsy but the child did not turn her head. She gained her own lawn, floundered through the snow to her house. The entrance to her house was through a storm shed. She ran into this and banged the door. The door had a pane of glass in the front, and through that pane she stared fearfully at Betsy. Betsy stood still, winking back tears, a mittened finger in her mouth. At last, she turned and trudged slowly back through the snowy dark to her house. She had almost reached her porch when the door of the storm shed opened. The new little girl stuck out her head. “Tacy!” she shouted.<br>
<br>
“You needn’t call names!” Betsy shouted back. Tacy was shouting her own name, really. But it was such an odd one, Betsy didn’t understand. She trudged on into the house. The lamp hanging over the dining room table was lighted now. A delicious smell of fried potatoes floated from the kitchen. “Well,” her mother called out cheerfully. “Did you get acquainted?”<br>
<br>
“What’s her name?” asked Julia.<br>
“I don’t know. I don’t like her. I’m mad at her,” said Betsy. It was all she could do not to cry.<br>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>The Betsy-Tacy Treasury</strong><br><br><em>by Maud Hart Lovelace</em><br><br>
It was difficult, later, to think of a time when Betsy and Tacy had not been friends. Hill Street came to regard them almost as one person. Betsy’s brown braids went with Tacy’s red curls, Betsy’s plump legs with Tacy’s spindly ones, to school and from school, uphill and down, on errands and in play. So that when Tacy had the mumps and Betsy was obliged to make her journeys alone, saucy boys teased her: “Where’s the cheese, apple pie?” “Where’s your mush, milk?” As though she didn’t feel lonesome enough already! And Hill Street knew when Sunday came, even without listening to the rolling bells, for Betsy Ray and Tacy Kelly (whose parents attended different churches), set off down Hill Street separately, looking uncomfortable&nbsp; and strange.<br>
<br>
But on this March afternoon, a month before Betsy’s fifth birthday, they did not know each other. They had not even seen each other, unless Betsy had glimpsed Tacy, without knowing her for Tacy, among the children of assorted sizes moving into the house across the street. Betsy had been kept in because of bad weather, and all day she had sat with her <span class="txt-underline"><strong>nose pasted to the pane</strong></span>. It was exciting beyond words to have a family with children moving into that house.<br>
<br>
Hill Street was rightfully named. It ran straight up into a green hill and stopped. The name of the town was Deep Valley, and a town named Deep Valley naturally had plenty of hills. Betsy’s house, a small yellow cottage, was the last house on her side of Hill Street, and the rambling white house opposite was the last house on that side. So of course, it was very important. And it had been empty ever since Betsy could remember. “I hope whoever moves in will have children,” Betsy’s mother had said.<br>
<br>
“Well, for Pete’s sake!” said Betsy’s father. “Hill Street is so full of children now that Old Mag has to watch out where she puts her feet down.”<br>
<br>
“I know,” said Betsy’s mother. “There are plenty of children for Julia.” (Julia was Betsy’s sister, eight years old.) “And there are dozens of babies. But there isn’t one little girl just Betsy’s age. And that’s what I’m hoping will come to the house across the street.” That was what Betsy hoped, too. And that was what she had been watching for all day as she sat at the dining room window. She was certain there must be such a little girl. There were girls of almost every size and boys to match, milling about the moving dray and in and out of the house. But she wasn’t sure. She hadn’t absolutely seen one. She had watched all day, and now the dining room was getting dark. Julia had stopped practising her music lesson, and Mrs. Ray had lighted the lamp in the kitchen.<br>
<br>
The March snow lay cold and dirty outside the window, but the wind had died down, and the western sky, behind the house opposite, was stained with red. The furniture had all been carried in, and the dray was gone. A light was shining in the house. Suddenly the front door opened, and a little girl ran out. She wore a hood beneath which long red ringlets spattered out above her coat. Her legs in their long black stockings were thin. It was Tacy, although Betsy did not know it! She ran first to the hitching block, and bounced there on her toes a minute, looking up at the sky and all around. Then, she ran up the road to the point where it ended on the hill. Some long-gone person had placed a bench there.&nbsp;It commanded the view down Hill Street. The little girl climbed up on this bench and looked intently into the dusk. “I know just how she feels,” thought Betsy with a throb. “This is her new home. She wants to see what it’s like.” She ran to her mother.<br>
<br>
“Mamma!” she cried. “There’s the little girl my age. Please let me go out! Just a minute! Please!” Mrs. Ray was moved by the entreaty. She looked out at the coloured sky.<br>
<br>
“It does seem to be clearing up,” she said. “But you could only stay a minute. Do you want to go to the bother of putting on your things...”<br>
<br>
“Oh, yes, yes!”<br>
“Overshoes and mittens and everything?”<br>
“Yes, really!”<br>
<br>
Betsy flew to the closet, but she could not find her hoodie. The mittens were twisted on the string inside her coat.<br>
<br>
“Mamma! Help me! Please! She’ll be gone.”<br>
“Help her, Julia,” called Betsy’s mother, and Julia helped, and at last the hood was tied, and the coat buttoned, and the overshoes buckled, and the mittens pulled on.<br>
<br>
Outside the air was fresh and cold. The streetlamp had been lighted. It was exciting just to be out at this hour, even without the prospect of meeting the new little girl. But the new little girl still stood on the bench looking down the street. Betsy ran toward her. She ran on the sidewalk as far as it went. Then she took to the frozen rutty road, and she had almost reached the bench when the little girl saw her.<br>
<br>
“Hello!” called Betsy. “What’s your name?” The other child made no answer. She jumped off the bench. “Don’t go!” cried Betsy. “I’m coming.” But the other child without a word began to run. She brushed past Betsy on her headlong flight down the hill. She ran like a frightened rabbit, and Betsy ran in pursuit. “Wait! Wait!” Betsy panted as she ran. But the new child would not stop. On fleet, black-stockinged legs she ran, faster than Betsy could follow. “Wait! Wait!” pleaded Betsy but the child did not turn her head. She gained her own lawn, floundered through the snow to her house. The entrance to her house was through a storm shed. She ran into this and banged the door. The door had a pane of glass in the front, and through that pane she stared fearfully at Betsy. Betsy stood still, winking back tears, a mittened finger in her mouth. At last, she turned and trudged slowly back through the snowy dark to her house. She had almost reached her porch when the door of the storm shed opened. The new little girl stuck out her head. “Tacy!” she shouted.<br>
<br>
“You needn’t call names!” Betsy shouted back. Tacy was shouting her own name, really. But it was such an odd one, Betsy didn’t understand. She trudged on into the house. The lamp hanging over the dining room table was lighted now. A delicious smell of fried potatoes floated from the kitchen. “Well,” her mother called out cheerfully. “Did you get acquainted?”<br>
<br>
“What’s her name?” asked Julia.<br>
“I don’t know. I don’t like her. I’m mad at her,” said Betsy. It was all she could do not to cry.<br>

Did you ever see a V<br>
Drawn by geese as they fly?<br>
Did you ever wonder how<br>
Did you ever wonder why<br>
Geese would want to draw<br>
With feathered ink in the sky?<br>
Did you look for other letters?<br>
Did you even try?<br>
I did.<br>
I do.<br>
I always will.<br>
You can too. Be silent-still.<br>
Read the letters forming<br>
On a cloud of paper white.<br>
You might be surprised<br>
By the stories geese will write.</div>

<br>
<strong>Film vs Digital – A Photo Comparison</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>12 ..........</strong> . Nothing compares – not even digital. A good example of this is when a film company like Fujifilm tries to match film’s beautiful colour consistency. Such an ‘advancement’ in technology is nothing more than a marketing gimmick. Film is manufactured in various formats to suit a variety of cameras. This is much the same as the sensor sizes on digital cameras. However, unlike digital cameras, film can capture and store at greater resolutions. More specifically, when the film stock is larger, so is the photon count on the film stock’s surface.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One of the key elements of film photography is the creative control offered throughout the processing and editing stages. Rather than being a bulk-edit workflow as experienced in digital, there is a staged process involved with film. <strong>13 ..........</strong> . One of the biggest advantages of film editing is the greater level of light management within the darkroom environment. Film offers a significant level of dynamic range with less blowout of highlights and loss of detail in shadow areas. Digital files can be impossible to recover from such issues.<br>
<br>
While it is convenient that digital editing can be done in-camera or on a digital device, it is often done on the go. There is fulfillment and enjoyment in our busy world to be gained in slowing down and working within a darkroom lab. Alternatively, many are now taking the time to work on high-resolution scans from film photography outings. With the right processing flow, film negatives will last a lifetime and can be used for scans or prints numerous times. Those in the digital world live in constant fear of computer crashes, hard drive failures, or even memory card corruption. <strong>14 .......... .</strong><br>
<br>
Like it or not, the costs involved in photography’s creative pursuit are a key consideration<br>
for many people. <strong>15 .......... </strong>– however, film photography has a gentler approach with a lower financial burden. With film, your up-front costs are far less as film cameras’ price is significantly lower than that of a modern DSLR or mirrorless kit. The price of some of the high-end models is staggering and would place most under financial strain. Plus, you are shackled with the other drawbacks of being locked into the digital medium.<br>
<br>
Film photography spreads its costs out throughout your life as a photographer. Aside from the camera, the ongoing cost of film is a low-cost element – buying in bulk is always a smart choice as you are more likely to get out and shoot with a bag full of film. <strong>16 ..........</strong> . From there, you are looking at lab and darkroom costs depending on how deep you want to dive. A popular solution is to manage lab costs by opting for digital scans of your film. These scans are of the highest quality and retain all the quality and detail of your original&nbsp;shots. Plus, you now have full creative control of which direction you want to head and how much you want to spend.<br>
<br>
You can now take your digital scans and edit them further with your preferred editing software – or not at all. You can opt to print your scans at home or through a lab in any size and format you want. And, if you are so inclined, you can, of course, share your work on your site, blog, or via social media platforms. <strong>17 ..........</strong> . Film cameras last lifetimes while digital-only last as long as their circuits hold-up.</p>

Plus, you now have full creative control of which direction you want to head and how much you want to spend.<br>
<br>
You can now take your digital scans and edit them further with your preferred editing software – or not at all. You can opt to print your scans at home or through a lab in any size and format you want. And, if you are so inclined, you can, of course, share your work on your site, blog, or via social media platforms. <strong>17 ..........</strong> . Film cameras last lifetimes while digital-only last as long as their circuits hold-up.</p>

<br>
<strong>Film vs Digital – A Photo Comparison</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>12 ..........</strong> . Nothing compares – not even digital. A good example of this is when a film company like Fujifilm tries to match film’s beautiful colour consistency. Such an ‘advancement’ in technology is nothing more than a marketing gimmick. Film is manufactured in various formats to suit a variety of cameras. This is much the same as the sensor sizes on digital cameras. However, unlike digital cameras, film can capture and store at greater resolutions. More specifically, when the film stock is larger, so is the photon count on the film stock’s surface.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One of the key elements of film photography is the creative control offered throughout the processing and editing stages. Rather than being a bulk-edit workflow as experienced in digital, there is a staged process involved with film. <strong>13 ..........</strong> . One of the biggest advantages of film editing is the greater level of light management within the darkroom environment. Film offers a significant level of dynamic range with less blowout of highlights and loss of detail in shadow areas. Digital files can be impossible to recover from such issues.<br>
<br>
While it is convenient that digital editing can be done in-camera or on a digital device, it is often done on the go. There is fulfillment and enjoyment in our busy world to be gained in slowing down and working within a darkroom lab. Alternatively, many are now taking the time to work on high-resolution scans from film photography outings. With the right processing flow, film negatives will last a lifetime and can be used for scans or prints numerous times. Those in the digital world live in constant fear of computer crashes, hard drive failures, or even memory card corruption. <strong>14 .......... .</strong><br>
<br>
Like it or not, the costs involved in photography’s creative pursuit are a key consideration<br>
for many people. <strong>15 .......... </strong>– however, film photography has a gentler approach with a lower financial burden. With film, your up-front costs are far less as film cameras’ price is significantly lower than that of a modern DSLR or mirrorless kit. The price of some of the high-end models is staggering and would place most under financial strain. Plus, you are shackled with the other drawbacks of being locked into the digital medium.<br>
<br>
Film photography spreads its costs out throughout your life as a photographer. Aside from the camera, the ongoing cost of film is a low-cost element – buying in bulk is always a smart choice as you are more likely to get out and shoot with a bag full of film. <strong>16 ..........</strong> . From there, you are looking at lab and darkroom costs depending on how deep you want to dive. A popular solution is to manage lab costs by opting for digital scans of your film. These scans are of the highest quality and retain all the quality and detail of your original&nbsp;shots. Plus, you now have full creative control of which direction you want to head and how much you want to spend.<br>
<br>
You can now take your digital scans and edit them further with your preferred editing software – or not at all. You can opt to print your scans at home or through a lab in any size and format you want. And, if you are so inclined, you can, of course, share your work on your site, blog, or via social media platforms. <strong>17 ..........</strong> .

<strong>Film vs Digital – A Photo Comparison</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>12 ..........</strong> . Nothing compares – not even digital. A good example of this is when a film company like Fujifilm tries to match film’s beautiful colour consistency. Such an ‘advancement’ in technology is nothing more than a marketing gimmick. Film is manufactured in various formats to suit a variety of cameras. This is much the same as the sensor sizes on digital cameras. However, unlike digital cameras, film can capture and store at greater resolutions. More specifically, when the film stock is larger, so is the photon count on the film stock’s surface.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One of the key elements of film photography is the creative control offered throughout the processing and editing stages. Rather than being a bulk-edit workflow as experienced in digital, there is a staged process involved with film. <strong>13 ..........</strong> . One of the biggest advantages of film editing is the greater level of light management within the darkroom environment. Film offers a significant level of dynamic range with less blowout of highlights and loss of detail in shadow areas. Digital files can be impossible to recover from such issues.<br>
<br>
While it is convenient that digital editing can be done in-camera or on a digital device, it is often done on the go. There is fulfillment and enjoyment in our busy world to be gained in slowing down and working within a darkroom lab. Alternatively, many are now taking the time to work on high-resolution scans from film photography outings. With the right processing flow, film negatives will last a lifetime and can be used for scans or prints numerous times. Those in the digital world live in constant fear of computer crashes, hard drive failures, or even memory card corruption. <strong>14 .......... .</strong><br>
<br>
Like it or not, the costs involved in photography’s creative pursuit are a key consideration<br>
for many people. <strong>15 .......... </strong>– however, film photography has a gentler approach with a lower financial burden. With film, your up-front costs are far less as film cameras’ price is significantly lower than that of a modern DSLR or mirrorless kit. The price of some of the high-end models is staggering and would place most under financial strain. Plus, you are shackled with the other drawbacks of being locked into the digital medium.<br>
<br>
Film photography spreads its costs out throughout your life as a photographer. Aside from the camera, the ongoing cost of film is a low-cost element – buying in bulk is always a smart choice as you are more likely to get out and shoot with a bag full of film. <strong>16 ..........</strong> . From there, you are looking at lab and darkroom costs depending on how deep you want to dive. A popular solution is to manage lab costs by opting for digital scans of your film. These scans are of the highest quality and retain all the quality and detail of your original&nbsp;shots. Plus, you now have full creative control of which direction you want to head and how much you want to spend.<br>
<br>
You can now take your digital scans and edit them further with your preferred editing software – or not at all. You can opt to print your scans at home or through a lab in any size and format you want. And, if you are so inclined, you can, of course, share your work on your site, blog, or via social media platforms. <strong>17 ..........</strong> . Film cameras last lifetimes while digital-only last as long as their circuits hold-up.</p>

Choose from the sentences <strong>(A – G) </strong>the one which fits each gap <strong>(12 – 17).</strong> There is one extra sentence which you do not need to use.<br>
<br>
<strong>Film vs Digital – A Photo Comparison</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>12 ..........</strong> . Nothing compares – not even digital. A good example of this is when a film company like Fujifilm tries to match film’s beautiful colour consistency. Such an ‘advancement’ in technology is nothing more than a marketing gimmick. Film is manufactured in various formats to suit a variety of cameras. This is much the same as the sensor sizes on digital cameras. However, unlike digital cameras, film can capture and store at greater resolutions. More specifically, when the film stock is larger, so is the photon count on the film stock’s surface.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One of the key elements of film photography is the creative control offered throughout the processing and editing stages. Rather than being a bulk-edit workflow as experienced in digital, there is a staged process involved with film. <strong>13 ..........</strong> . One of the biggest advantages of film editing is the greater level of light management within the darkroom environment. Film offers a significant level of dynamic range with less blowout of highlights and loss of detail in shadow areas. Digital files can be impossible to recover from such issues.<br>
<br>
While it is convenient that digital editing can be done in-camera or on a digital device, it is often done on the go. There is fulfillment and enjoyment in our busy world to be gained in slowing down and working within a darkroom lab. Alternatively, many are now taking the time to work on high-resolution scans from film photography outings. With the right processing flow, film negatives will last a lifetime and can be used for scans or prints numerous times. Those in the digital world live in constant fear of computer crashes, hard drive failures, or even memory card corruption. <strong>14 .......... .</strong><br>
<br>
Like it or not, the costs involved in photography’s creative pursuit are a key consideration<br>
for many people. <strong>15 .......... </strong>– however, film photography has a gentler approach with a lower financial burden. With film, your up-front costs are far less as film cameras’ price is significantly lower than that of a modern DSLR or mirrorless kit. The price of some of the high-end models is staggering and would place most under financial strain. Plus, you are shackled with the other drawbacks of being locked into the digital medium.<br>
<br>
Film photography spreads its costs out throughout your life as a photographer. Aside from the camera, the ongoing cost of film is a low-cost element – buying in bulk is always a smart choice as you are more likely to get out and shoot with a bag full of film. <strong>16 ..........</strong> . From there, you are looking at lab and darkroom costs depending on how deep you want to dive. A popular solution is to manage lab costs by opting for digital scans of your film. These scans are of the highest quality and retain all the quality and detail of your original&nbsp;shots. Plus, you now have full creative control of which direction you want to head and how much you want to spend.<br>
<br>
You can now take your digital scans and edit them further with your preferred editing software – or not at all. You can opt to print your scans at home or through a lab in any size and format you want. And, if you are so inclined, you can, of course, share your work on your site, blog, or via social media platforms. <strong>17 ..........</strong> . Film cameras last lifetimes while digital-only last as long as their circuits hold-up.</p>

When it comes to deserts, we often think of hot weather and scalding sunshine. Yet the classification of a desert is not actually related to temperature – it is about how much moisture is present. To be considered a desert, an area must receive an annual rainfall of less than 250mm, or lose more water than is gained. Desert rainfalls tend to be seasonal and unreliable. Parts of the Sahara – the world’s largest desert – goes for years without seeing rain.<br>

Like pyramids of exotic spices stacked across the horizon, subject to sculpting by the whimsy of the wind, the cumin- and cinnamon-coloured sands of the Sahara have long lured intrepid travellers.<br>
<br>
Caravans stretching hundreds of camel lengths once traversed the Sahara Desert shipping routes, transporting cargo of gold, ivory, salt and slaves. And while desert nomads called Tuaregs still move goods (mainly salt from the interior) along the traditional trade routes today, the tourist trade does a brisker business in North Africa, enticing visitors from around the world to dip their toes in the powder-fine Sahara sand.<br>
<br>
From the Red Sea to the fringes of the Mediterranean coast, the Sahara spills across more than 3 million square miles in North Africa -- an area that is vaster than Australia. Most of the desert is inaccessible to tourist itineraries -- not to mention darn inhospitable -- but the good news is that you don't have to venture far from urban oases to feel very far removed from the rest of the world.<br>
<br>

I arrived in the Alice at five a.m. with a dog, six dollars, and a small suitcase of inappropriate clothes. “Bring a cardigan for the evenings,” the brochure said. A freezing wind whipped grit down the platform and I stood shivering, holding warm dog flesh, and wondering what foolishness had brought me to this eerie, empty train station in the center of nowhere. I turned against the wind, and saw the line of mountains at the edge of town.<br>
<br>
Diggety wriggled out of my arms and looked at me, head cocked, piglet ears flying. I experienced that sinking feeling when you know you have conned yourself into doing something difficult and there’s no going back.<br>
<br>
{^ <strong>Extract D</strong> ^}<br>
Plant matter in deserts in often sparse or non-existent. The few types of plant that do manage to survive are plants that either store all their water, like cacti and other succulents, or plants that have developed to be very durable and have extensive root cover, like spinifex and tumbleweed. Sturt’s desert pea has a long root that allows it to access water deep underground. The seeds of the plant are small and hard, and they can germinate after many years of drought or unsuitable conditions.<br>

A freezing wind whipped grit down the platform and I stood shivering, holding warm dog flesh, and wondering what foolishness had brought me to this eerie, empty train station in the center of nowhere. I turned against the wind, and saw the line of mountains at the edge of town.<br>

Plant matter in deserts in often sparse or non-existent. The few types of plant that do manage to survive are plants that either store all their water, like cacti and other succulents, or plants that have developed to be very durable and have extensive root cover, like spinifex and tumbleweed. Sturt’s desert pea has a long root that allows it to access water deep underground. The seeds of the plant are small and hard, and they can germinate after many years of drought or unsuitable conditions.<br>

When it comes to deserts, we often think of hot weather and scalding sunshine. Yet the classification of a desert is not actually related to temperature – it is about how much moisture is present. To be considered a desert, an area must receive an annual rainfall of less than 250mm, or lose more water than is gained. Desert rainfalls tend to be seasonal and unreliable. Parts of the Sahara – the world’s largest desert – goes for years without seeing rain.<br>
<br>
{^ <strong>Extract B</strong> ^}<br>
Like pyramids of exotic spices stacked across the horizon, subject to sculpting by the whimsy of the wind, the cumin- and cinnamon-coloured sands of the Sahara have long lured intrepid travellers.<br>
<br>
Caravans stretching hundreds of camel lengths once traversed the Sahara Desert shipping routes, transporting cargo of gold, ivory, salt and slaves. And while desert nomads called Tuaregs still move goods (mainly salt from the interior) along the traditional trade routes today, the tourist trade does a brisker business in North Africa, enticing visitors from around the world to dip their toes in the powder-fine Sahara sand.<br>
<br>
From the Red Sea to the fringes of the Mediterranean coast, the Sahara spills across more than 3 million square miles in North Africa -- an area that is vaster than Australia. Most of the desert is inaccessible to tourist itineraries -- not to mention darn inhospitable -- but the good news is that you don't have to venture far from urban oases to feel very far removed from the rest of the world.<br>
