        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Almost every successful person, whether in sport, business, family or leisure, possesses mental toughness attributes. Although they may not view themselves entirely that way, they almost certainly have a more positive and disciplined mindset than most other people. This mindset enables them to focus on achieving the outcomes they want, rather than be distracted or diverted by external factors or their own internal mental obstacles.<br>
<br>
It has been scientifically proven that mentally tough people are more successful, more positive and better able to manage their stress than those who aren’t as mentally tough. The good news is that Mental Toughness, which comprises both resilience (defined as the ability to bounce back from setbacks and failures) and confidence (defined as the ability to spot and seize opportunities) can be measured and then developed through a series of simple mental exercises – like going to the gym but for your mind.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
What are the types of physical endurance training? Endurance is the ability to do physical activity that increases your heart rate by 50% for as long as you can without getting tired.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There are two types of endurance: Specific endurance is when you fight against fatigue in sport-specific conditions. For example, if you run 1 500m you would use a specific combination of endurance training to excel in your 1 500m race. You might not be able to push yourself to do a 10 000m race if you have specifically focused on 1 500m.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
General endurance is when you fight against fatigue when doing different kinds of exercises. For example, if you run 1 500m, you can also run a 10 000m race without becoming fatigued. But if you compete against 10 000m runners who have done specific training for that distance, they would be able to outperform you.<br>

[Winston Churchill speaking to students at his old school.]<br>
<br>
But for everyone, surely, what we have gone through in this period [the start of World War 2] -- I am addressing myself to the school -- surely from this period of ten months, this is the lesson: Never give in. Never give in. Never, never, never, never -- in nothing, great or small, large or petty -- never give in, except to convictions of honour and good sense.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Never yield to force. Never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy. We stood all alone a year ago, and, to many countries, it seemed that our account was closed, we were finished … we now find ourselves in a position where I say that we can be sure that we have only to persevere to conquer.&nbsp;<br>

Bear Grylls said he had “tears in his eyes regularly” while filming his new Amazon TV series. The adventurer hosts World’s Toughest Race: Eco-Challenge Fiji, which sees 66 teams from 30 countries race non-stop for 11 days, 24 hours a day, across hundreds of miles of rugged Fijian terrain complete with mountains, jungles and oceans. They cover 671 kilometres of terrain in a test of physical and mental endurance, in a bid to cross the finish line.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Speaking from north Wales, Grylls said the series was “a reminder for me in an era when the world desperately needs inspiration”. He added: “It was a reminder of the power of friendships and what you can do together and when you help each other and when you’re honest and vulnerable with each other. But also, a reminder of the power of just the human spirit, that resilience, that fire inside of all of us that it can conquer everything when everything is against you and you think the human body is incapable of it, mind and body and spirit is what really counts, that will always count more than the outer muscles, that fire and spirit can conquer all.”<br>

Almost every successful person, whether in sport, business, family or leisure, possesses mental toughness attributes. Although they may not view themselves entirely that way, they almost certainly have a more positive and disciplined mindset than most other people. This mindset enables them to focus on achieving the outcomes they want, rather than be distracted or diverted by external factors or their own internal mental obstacles.<br>
<br>
It has been scientifically proven that mentally tough people are more successful, more positive and better able to manage their stress than those who aren’t as mentally tough. The good news is that Mental Toughness, which comprises both resilience (defined as the ability to bounce back from setbacks and failures) and confidence (defined as the ability to spot and seize opportunities) can be measured and then developed through a series of simple mental exercises – like going to the gym but for your mind.<br>

What are the types of physical endurance training? Endurance is the ability to do physical activity that increases your heart rate by 50% for as long as you can without getting tired.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There are two types of endurance: Specific endurance is when you fight against fatigue in sport-specific conditions. For example, if you run 1 500m you would use a specific combination of endurance training to excel in your 1 500m race. You might not be able to push yourself to do a 10 000m race if you have specifically focused on 1 500m.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
General endurance is when you fight against fatigue when doing different kinds of exercises. For example, if you run 1 500m, you can also run a 10 000m race without becoming fatigued. But if you compete against 10 000m runners who have done specific training for that distance, they would be able to outperform you.<br>

<br>
But for everyone, surely, what we have gone through in this period [the start of World War 2] -- I am addressing myself to the school -- surely from this period of ten months, this is the lesson: Never give in. Never give in. Never, never, never, never -- in nothing, great or small, large or petty -- never give in, except to convictions of honour and good sense.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Never yield to force. Never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy. We stood all alone a year ago, and, to many countries, it seemed that our account was closed, we were finished … we now find ourselves in a position where I say that we can be sure that we have only to persevere to conquer.&nbsp;<br>

Bear Grylls said he had “tears in his eyes regularly” while filming his new Amazon TV series. The adventurer hosts World’s Toughest Race: Eco-Challenge Fiji, which sees 66 teams from 30 countries race non-stop for 11 days, 24 hours a day, across hundreds of miles of rugged Fijian terrain complete with mountains, jungles and oceans. They cover 671 kilometres of terrain in a test of physical and mental endurance, in a bid to cross the finish line.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Speaking from north Wales, Grylls said the series was “a reminder for me in an era when the world desperately needs inspiration”. He added: “It was a reminder of the power of friendships and what you can do together and when you help each other and when you’re honest and vulnerable with each other. But also, a reminder of the power of just the human spirit, that resilience, that fire inside of all of us that it can conquer everything when everything is against you and you think the human body is incapable of it, mind and body and spirit is what really counts, that will always count more than the outer muscles, that fire and spirit can conquer all.”</p>

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Almost every successful person, whether in sport, business, family or leisure, possesses mental toughness attributes. Although they may not view themselves entirely that way, they almost certainly have a more positive and disciplined mindset than most other people. This mindset enables them to focus on achieving the outcomes they want, rather than be distracted or diverted by external factors or their own internal mental obstacles.<br>
<br>
It has been scientifically proven that mentally tough people are more successful, more positive and better able to manage their stress than those who aren’t as mentally tough. The good news is that Mental Toughness, which comprises both resilience (defined as the ability to bounce back from setbacks and failures) and confidence (defined as the ability to spot and seize opportunities) can be measured and then developed through a series of simple mental exercises – like going to the gym but for your mind.<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
What are the types of physical endurance training? Endurance is the ability to do physical activity that increases your heart rate by 50% for as long as you can without getting tired.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There are two types of endurance: Specific endurance is when you fight against fatigue in sport-specific conditions. For example, if you run 1 500m you would use a specific combination of endurance training to excel in your 1 500m race. You might not be able to push yourself to do a 10 000m race if you have specifically focused on 1 500m.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
General endurance is when you fight against fatigue when doing different kinds of exercises. For example, if you run 1 500m, you can also run a 10 000m race without becoming fatigued. But if you compete against 10 000m runners who have done specific training for that distance, they would be able to outperform you.<br>

[Winston Churchill speaking to students at his old school.]<br>
<br>
But for everyone, surely, what we have gone through in this period [the start of World War 2] -- I am addressing myself to the school -- surely from this period of ten months, this is the lesson: Never give in. Never give in. Never, never, never, never -- in nothing, great or small, large or petty -- never give in, except to convictions of honour and good sense.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Never yield to force. Never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy. We stood all alone a year ago, and, to many countries, it seemed that our account was closed, we were finished … we now find ourselves in a position where I say that we can be sure that we have only to persevere to conquer.&nbsp;<br>

Bear Grylls said he had “tears in his eyes regularly” while filming his new Amazon TV series. The adventurer hosts World’s Toughest Race: Eco-Challenge Fiji, which sees 66 teams from 30 countries race non-stop for 11 days, 24 hours a day, across hundreds of miles of rugged Fijian terrain complete with mountains, jungles and oceans. They cover 671 kilometres of terrain in a test of physical and mental endurance, in a bid to cross the finish line.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Speaking from north Wales, Grylls said the series was “a reminder for me in an era when the world desperately needs inspiration”. He added: “It was a reminder of the power of friendships and what you can do together and when you help each other and when you’re honest and vulnerable with each other. But also, a reminder of the power of just the human spirit, that resilience, that fire inside of all of us that it can conquer everything when everything is against you and you think the human body is incapable of it, mind and body and spirit is what really counts, that will always count more than the outer muscles, that fire and spirit can conquer all.”<br>

        <p>[^cstable^]It is time to change the meaning of the word “love”. The word is mostly used according to the definition given in the dictionary: “an intense feeling of deep affection”. In other words, love is what one feels. But love should be seen not as a feeling but as an enacted emotion. To love is to feel <span class="txt-underline"><strong>and</strong></span> to act lovingly.[^/cstable^]<br>
<br>
<strong>Ariana</strong>: “So the words of the song that say ‘Don’t talk to me of love; show me!’ has a clear idea of what love really is.”<br>

<p>Most people around the world have heard of Disney but people may not know about who Walt Disney was as a man and all of his fantastic achievements. Walter Elias Disney was born on 5<sup>th</sup> December 1901, in Chicago, USA. He was a motion picture and television producer as well as a pioneer of cartoon films. He created the extraordinarily famous cartoon character, Mickey Mouse and was the founder of the thrilling and family fun theme parks, Disneyland and Disney World.<br>
<br>
On 15<sup>th</sup> December 1966, Disney sadly died from lung cancer. Soon after his death, a very bizarre rumour began spreading that Disney’s body was frozen and buried beneath the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland California. It was thought that somehow when medical technology was advanced enough, he could be brought back to life. Disney’s daughter, Diane, has stated that this is definitely just a rumour but can anyone really be sure?<br>
&nbsp;<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Disney and his brother, Roy founded The Walt Disney Studios after working at Kansas City Film Ad Company. During his time working at the ad company, he made cut out animated commercials and started playing around with hand drawn animation using cameras. This really sparked his interest in animation and led to him opening up his own studio.<br>
<br>
In the late 1920s, the cartoons featuring Mickey Mouse and his friends were created. The first successful film starring the lovable Mickey Mouse was called Steamboat Willie. It’s hard to imagine now, with all the technology we have today, but at the time, sound was only just beginning to be available in films. Walt Disney voiced Mickey Mouse and the character was drawn by Ub Iwerks, the chief animator at the studio. Steamboat Willie and Mickey Mouse were an immediate hit with the general public. This was the start of the popularity of the enthusiastic, little mouse whom we still love today.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
During the time that Disney was alive, he produced more than 100 feature films. His first full-length animated film premiered in 1937 and that film was Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. It was so unbelievably successful that it generated $1.499 million. That was a huge amount of money in those days and an even greater achievement because it was during the Great Depression. The Great Depression (1929-1939) was the worst economic crisis in the history of the industrialised world. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs also won eight Oscars, which are awards for artistic and technical excellence in the film industry.</p>

<p>Most people around the world have heard of Disney but people may not know about who Walt Disney was as a man and all of his fantastic achievements. Walter Elias Disney was born on 5<sup>th</sup> December 1901, in Chicago, USA. He was a motion picture and television producer as well as a pioneer of cartoon films. He created the extraordinarily famous cartoon character, Mickey Mouse and was the founder of the thrilling and family fun theme parks, Disneyland and Disney World.<br>
<br>
On 15<sup>th</sup> December 1966, Disney sadly died from lung cancer. Soon after his death, a very bizarre rumour began spreading that Disney’s body was frozen and buried beneath the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland California. It was thought that somehow when medical technology was advanced enough, he could be brought back to life. Disney’s daughter, Diane, has stated that this is definitely just a rumour but can anyone really be sure?<br>

Disney and his brother, Roy founded The Walt Disney Studios after working at Kansas City Film Ad Company. During his time working at the ad company, he made cut out animated commercials and started playing around with hand drawn animation using cameras. This really sparked his interest in animation and led to him opening up his own studio.<br>
<br>
In the late 1920s, the cartoons featuring Mickey Mouse and his friends were created. The first successful film starring the lovable Mickey Mouse was called Steamboat Willie. It’s hard to imagine now, with all the technology we have today, but at the time, sound was only just beginning to be available in films. Walt Disney voiced Mickey Mouse and the character was drawn by Ub Iwerks, the chief animator at the studio. Steamboat Willie and Mickey Mouse were an immediate hit with the general public. This was the start of the popularity of the enthusiastic, little mouse whom we still love today.<br>

During the time that Disney was alive, he produced more than 100 feature films. His first full-length animated film premiered in 1937 and that film was Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. It was so unbelievably successful that it generated $1.499 million. That was a huge amount of money in those days and an even greater achievement because it was during the Great Depression. The Great Depression (1929-1939) was the worst economic crisis in the history of the industrialised world. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs also won eight Oscars, which are awards for artistic and technical excellence in the film industry.</p>
