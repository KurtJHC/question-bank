by Karly Lane&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Elspeth Kinnaird sighed in irritation as she stared at the computer screen and the picturesque image of rolling green Highlands hills that had interrupted her Facebook newsfeed. Normally Elle wouldn’t give the ad a second glance, but that was before she’d started to notice the unsettlingly repetitive signs. No, not signs, she told herself firmly. Coincidences. That’s all they were.</p>
        <p>Ever since her Gran’s funeral two weeks ago, everywhere she turned, Scotland kept appearing before her eyes.</p>
        <p>Elle knew it wasn’t really a sign. She’d just been thinking about Scotland so much lately. A similar thing happened when she updated to the new iPhone – she hadn’t seen anyone with one, and then suddenly every second person in town seemed to be carrying her model. This was the same kind of thing. She was just noticing the Scottish references now because of Gran.</p>
        <p>Her heart sank a little at the thought.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Gran.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I miss you so much,” she said quietly.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She had only been gone a few weeks, and already it felt longer. Elle closed the laptop and stood up, grabbing her keys and handbag before heading out the door to work.</p>
        <p>Jessup’s Creek had been her home her entire life. Population three thousand two hundred and fifty-three. Tucked away in the New South Wales hinterland, their sleepy little town had been bypassed by the tourist trade and highways for most of its life, which had never been a problem for a tightknit farming community. Not until the past few generations, when working farms began to dwindle as kinds moved away to start their careers, and parents running properties got too old and tired to continue working them.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then, a miracle of sorts happened. Over the past two years, the grey-nomad trade had come to the rescue, saving Jessup’s Creek from becoming another dying country town with more closed shops than residents. The retirees and their caravans, motorhomes and campervans were an almost constant stream driving through. More shops had opened, filling the main street with all kinds of quirky businesses, drawing now only the travellers but weekend tours from the coast and inland as well.</p>
        <p>There was a chocolatier, two antique stores and a pottery-and-craft barn, which sold local handmade items and ran workshops, where Elle had taken a few art classes. Cafes were spring up left, right and centre, and only a month ago a boutique brewery had opened its doors, bringing quite a few beard-sorting, man-bun-wearing men to town on weekend beer-tasting sessions.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As a result, property prices had begun to climb, and new people were moving to town. The downside to this was that the once-quiet village was changing. It looked the same, with verandah-lined shops running along both sides of the whole main street, but there was a very different vibe about the place. Where Elle once knew every face in town, nowadays, more often than not she could walk into a shop and not recognise a single person. It&nbsp;wasn’t like newcomers were overrunning the place, but it was still strange, and a lot of the older residents were finding it a tad confronting.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Take Me Home&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br>
by Karly Lane&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Elspeth Kinnaird sighed in irritation as she stared at the computer screen and the picturesque image of rolling green Highlands hills that had interrupted her Facebook newsfeed. Normally Elle wouldn’t give the ad a second glance, but that was before she’d started to notice the unsettlingly repetitive signs. No, not signs, she told herself firmly. Coincidences. That’s all they were.</p>
        <p>Ever since her Gran’s funeral two weeks ago, everywhere she turned, Scotland kept appearing before her eyes.</p>
        <p>Elle knew it wasn’t really a sign. She’d just been thinking about Scotland so much lately. A similar thing happened when she updated to the new iPhone – she hadn’t seen anyone with one, and then suddenly every second person in town seemed to be carrying her model. This was the same kind of thing. She was just noticing the Scottish references now because of Gran.</p>
        <p>Her heart sank a little at the thought.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Gran.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I miss you so much,” she said quietly.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She had only been gone a few weeks, and already it felt longer. Elle closed the laptop and stood up, grabbing her keys and handbag before heading out the door to work.</p>
        <p>Jessup’s Creek had been her home her entire life. Population three thousand two hundred and fifty-three. Tucked away in the New South Wales hinterland, their sleepy little town had been bypassed by the tourist trade and highways for most of its life, which had never been a problem for a tightknit farming community. Not until the past few generations, when working farms began to dwindle as kinds moved away to start their careers, and parents running properties got too old and tired to continue working them.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then, a miracle of sorts happened. Over the past two years, the grey-nomad trade had come to the rescue, saving Jessup’s Creek from becoming another dying country town with more closed shops than residents. The retirees and their caravans, motorhomes and campervans were an almost constant stream driving through. More shops had opened, filling the main street with all kinds of quirky businesses, drawing now only the travellers but weekend tours from the coast and inland as well.</p>
        <p>There was a chocolatier, two antique stores and a pottery-and-craft barn, which sold local handmade items and ran workshops, where Elle had taken a few art classes. Cafes were spring up left, right and centre, and only a month ago a boutique brewery had opened its doors, bringing quite a few beard-sorting, man-bun-wearing men to town on weekend beer-tasting sessions.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As a result, property prices had begun to climb, and new people were moving to town. The downside to this was that the once-quiet village was changing. It looked the same, with verandah-lined shops running along both sides of the whole main street, but there was a very different vibe about the place. Where Elle once knew every face in town, nowadays, more often than not she could walk into a shop and not recognise a single person. It&nbsp;wasn’t like newcomers were overrunning the place, but it was still strange, and a lot of the older residents were finding it a tad confronting.</p>

        <p>[^cstable^]At the end of the year, Mrs Ospina gave her students Sarah and Elizabeth a score in reading, writing and speaking. These three scores are then added together to give an overall score in English for the year. (For example, 10 in reading, 20 in writing and 30 in speaking gives an overall score of 60).<br>
<br>
At the end of the year Sarah and Elizabeth got the same overall score.[^/cstable^]<br>
