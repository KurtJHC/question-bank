          <strong>No Time for Fear</strong>
        </p>
        <p><br>
1&nbsp; &nbsp; Carly heard the buzzer, which was the signal to begin her descent. The thoughts whirling around in her head quickly disappeared, and she dug her ski poles into the packed snow. She leaned forward and began speeding down the steep snow-covered mountain. Her heart was thumping. Her breathing came in quick gulps, and she knew that there was no turning back. No time for fear.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; “Relax,” she whispered, trying to push the unwanted thoughts away. But the memory of her brother Alex’s accident came back. She remembered him tumbling down the slope, clutching his leg and screaming in agony. Waiting to see him at the hospital, Carly had realized that the same thing could happen to her. Now Alex was working hard to recover. He was determined to once again be the town’s best young skier. Although Alex seemed to have put the accident behind him, Carly relived it every time she thought about downhill skiing.</p>

        </p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As she raced downhill, Carly saw that the first turn was coming faster than she had expected. A spray of snow filled the air as she skidded wildly around the flag. For one horrifying moment she thought she had leaned too far to the left and would crash. However, she managed to shift her weight and regain her balance. “Stupid!” she told herself angrily, but there was no time to think about what she had done wrong. She was already rushing toward the next flag.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I don’t belong here,” Carly thought as she made the next turn. “What use is a team member who’s afraid to ski?” She remembered what Coach Bennett had said a few days earlier. Since Alex’s accident Coach Bennett had been kind and understanding. However, Carly knew he wouldn’t stay that way for long. He had asked Carly whether she was having doubts about staying on the ski team. She had<br>
wanted to say yes, but instead she said, “I don’t know.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You need to find out,” Coach Bennett had said. “I’m making you an alternate in Saturday’s competition. Tonya hasn’t been feeling well. You’ll race if she can’t make it. And, Carly,” he added as she started to walk away, “after the race I expect you to tell me whether you want to stay on the team.”</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Carly had arrived at the race earlier this morning, she was greeted by the news that Tonya was home with the flu. “Get your skis on and get warmed up,” Coach Bennett had instructed. “This is a good day for your first race.”</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carly couldn’t have disagreed more. Her teammates had skied well. They actually had a chance to win—if Carly didn’t let them down. She didn’t have to be the fastest, but she couldn’t creep down the slopes, either. Only Alex’s expression—half pride, half jealousy—had kept Carly from quitting right then. Alex loved to compete more than Carly ever would.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carly remembered when she and Alex were little and just learning cross-country skiing. Every time it snowed, their father loved to take them skiing in the woods. There were no mountains to speed down, and the snow always seemed smooth, unlike in downhill skiing. She had loved the flat whiteness and the silence. She had felt peaceful and calm there.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before she knew it, Carly had sped across the finish line. She glanced at the big electronic clock and saw that her time was too slow. Her team would finish in second place. Carly was disappointed but thought she had skied well for her first race.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her teammates rushed up to her. “Carly! That was amazing!” exclaimed Brandi, the team’s captain.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Awesome!” said Alex, giving her a big hug. “How did it feel?”</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Scary,” Carly answered without thinking.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“It gets easier,” Alex promised. “Next time won’t be so bad.”</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As Coach Bennett walked over, Carly saw the question in his eyes. Did she want there to be a next time?</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Did she like the fear and excitement of competition? Again she pictured herself skiing through the peaceful woods and knew that that was what she wanted to do. She knew what she would tell Coach Bennett. She wasn’t like Alex, and that was O.K. It would not matter if others didn’t understand her decision. Following her heart would take courage, too—just as much as, or maybe even more than, racing down a snowy mountain.</p>

          <strong>Songs of the Dreamtime</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <em>http://aboriginalart.com.au/didgeridoo/songs.html</em>
        </p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A song is sung as a series comprising many short verses, each of which tells about a particular event or place associated with the ancestor; or the performance may be a full ceremonial one which includes the portrayal of relevant events in the performance of dances accompanied by the singing of the appropriate verses.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The song associated with any one totemic "line" will have the one melodic form throughout.

        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A song is sung as a series comprising many short verses, each of which tells about a particular event or place associated with the ancestor; or the performance may be a full ceremonial one which includes the portrayal of relevant events in the performance of dances accompanied by the singing of the appropriate verses.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The song associated with any one totemic "line" will have the one melodic form throughout. This means, in the case of very long "lines" of songs, where the ancestor is reputed to have crossed thousands of miles of territory, that their characteristic melodic form will be found in areas with different languages and musical techniques.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Because of the latter differences, an outside observer may well fail to recognize extreme sections of the one song-line as conforming to the same musical pattern, but that they do conform has been repeatedly stressed by performers and shown by a number of detailed analyses. The concept differs from our experience of melodic sameness; it consists of repetitions of sections of melody for a set proportion of the time the total verse takes to perform.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Because this technique allows flexibility in those areas of musical expression which tend to change from one tribe to another, the basic information can be kept intact even though the total history may be retained, section by section, in many different tribal areas.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This means that, even when a visitor from afar is unable to understand the language that the locals are using in a song, he can determine, from the musical structure, to which totemic line the song belongs.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And, because his own totemic song has been a very strong conditioning agent in the total processes of his education to adult status in the community, the recognition of his own song in another area will have very deep significance. These history songs link the time long past with the present; the singer is part of a continuum; he is reliving events of another era, and is yet part of them.</p>

        </p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What do former president Bill Clinton and rock musician Pete Townshend have in common? Both men have hearing damage from exposure to loud music, and both now wear hearing aids as a consequence. As a teenager, Clinton played saxophone in a band. Townshend, who has the more severe hearing loss, was a guitarist for a band called the Who. He is one of the first rock musicians to call the public’s attention to the problem of hearing loss from exposure to loud music.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Temporary hearing loss can happen after only 15 minutes of listening to loud music. One early warning sign is when your ears begin to feel warm while you listen to music at a rock concert or through headphones.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“What happens is the hair cells [in the inner ear] are damaged, but they’re not dead,” says physician and ear specialist Dr. Sam Levine. According to Dr. Levine, if you avoid further exposure to loud noise, it’s possible to <span class="txt-underline">recondition</span> the cells somewhat. However, he adds, “Eventually, over a long period of time, hair cells are permanently damaged.” And this is no small problem.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When tiny hair cells in the cochlea (CO-klee-uh), a coiled tube in the inner ear, are damaged or destroyed, an abnormal sound is sometimes produced in a person’s head. This sensation of a ringing in the ears is called tinnitus (tin-IHtuss). Tinnitus can also consist of hissing, clicking, or buzzing sounds that can be heard only by the person affected with the condition.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What sound level is dangerous? According to Dr. Levine, regular exposure to noise in excess of 85 decibels is considered dangerous. A decibel is the unit of measurement for sound. Most people don’t carry around the scientific equipment that measures decibels, though. The chart on this page offers a comparison of decibel levels to certain sounds. Here’s another gauge you can use. If you’re at a rock concert and the music is so loud that you have to shout to make yourself heard, you’re at risk for hearing loss. That’s when wearing protective devices such as earplugs becomes critical.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The facts are pretty frightening. But are rock bands turning down the volume? Most aren’t. “Rock music is supposed to be loud,” says drummer Andrew Sather. “I wouldn’t have it any other way. And neither would the real fans of rock.”</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Continued exposure to loud music and the failure to wear earplugs can lead to deafness, according to Dr. Levine. He states, “There’s no cure for tinnitus or hearing loss. Your ears are trying to tell you something. That ringing is the scream of your hair cells dying. Each time that happens, more and more damage is done.”</p>

        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What do former president Bill Clinton and rock musician Pete Townshend have in common? Both men have hearing damage from exposure to loud music, and both now wear hearing aids as a consequence. As a teenager, Clinton played saxophone in a band. Townshend, who has the more severe hearing loss, was a guitarist for a band called the Who. He is one of the first rock musicians to call the public’s attention to the problem of hearing loss from exposure to loud music.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Temporary hearing loss can happen after only 15 minutes of listening to loud music. One early warning sign is when your ears begin to feel warm while you listen to music at a rock concert or through headphones.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“What happens is the hair cells [in the inner ear] are damaged, but they’re not dead,” says physician and ear specialist Dr. Sam Levine. According to Dr. Levine, if you avoid further exposure to loud noise, it’s possible to <span class="txt-underline">recondition</span> the cells somewhat. However, he adds, “Eventually, over a long period of time, hair cells are permanently damaged.” And this is no small problem.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When tiny hair cells in the cochlea (CO-klee-uh), a coiled tube in the inner ear, are damaged or destroyed, an abnormal sound is sometimes produced in a person’s head. This sensation of a ringing in the ears is called tinnitus (tin-IHtuss). Tinnitus can also consist of hissing, clicking, or buzzing sounds that can be heard only by the person affected with the condition.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What sound level is dangerous? According to Dr. Levine, regular exposure to noise in excess of 85 decibels is considered dangerous. A decibel is the unit of measurement for sound. Most people don’t carry around the scientific equipment that measures decibels, though. The chart on this page offers a comparison of decibel levels to certain sounds. Here’s another gauge you can use. If you’re at a rock concert and the music is so loud that you have to shout to make yourself heard, you’re at risk for hearing loss. That’s when wearing protective devices such as earplugs becomes critical.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The facts are pretty frightening. But are rock bands turning down the volume? Most aren’t. “Rock music is supposed to be loud,” says drummer Andrew Sather. “I wouldn’t have it any other way. And neither would the real fans of rock.”</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Continued exposure to loud music and the failure to wear earplugs can lead to deafness, according to Dr. Levine. He states, “There’s no cure for tinnitus or hearing loss. Your ears are trying to tell you something. That ringing is the scream of your hair cells dying. Each time that happens, more and more damage is done.”</p>

        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What do former president Bill Clinton and rock musician Pete Townshend have in common? Both men have hearing damage from exposure to loud music, and both now wear hearing aids as a consequence. As a teenager, Clinton played saxophone in a band. Townshend, who has the more severe hearing loss, was a guitarist for a band called the Who. He is one of the first rock musicians to call the public’s attention to the problem of hearing loss from exposure to loud music.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Temporary hearing loss can happen after only 15 minutes of listening to loud music. One early warning sign is when your ears begin to feel warm while you listen to music at a rock concert or through headphones.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“What happens is the hair cells [in the inner ear] are damaged, but they’re not dead,” says physician and ear specialist Dr. Sam Levine. According to Dr. Levine, if you avoid further exposure to loud noise, it’s possible to <span class="txt-underline">recondition</span> the cells somewhat. However, he adds, “Eventually, over a long period of time, hair cells are permanently damaged.” And this is no small problem.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When tiny hair cells in the cochlea (CO-klee-uh), a coiled tube in the inner ear, are damaged or destroyed, an abnormal sound is sometimes produced in a person’s head. This sensation of a ringing in the ears is called tinnitus (tin-IHtuss). Tinnitus can also consist of hissing, clicking, or buzzing sounds that can be heard only by the person affected with the condition.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What sound level is dangerous? According to Dr. Levine, regular exposure to noise in excess of 85 decibels is considered dangerous. A decibel is the unit of measurement for sound. Most people don’t carry around the scientific equipment that measures decibels, though. The chart on this page offers a comparison of decibel levels to certain sounds. Here’s another gauge you can use. If you’re at a rock concert and the music is so loud that you have to shout to make yourself heard, you’re at risk for hearing loss. That’s when wearing protective devices such as earplugs becomes critical.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The facts are pretty frightening. But are rock bands turning down the volume? Most aren’t. “Rock music is supposed to be loud,” says drummer Andrew Sather. “I wouldn’t have it any other way. And neither would the real fans of rock.”</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Continued exposure to loud music and the failure to wear earplugs can lead to deafness, according to Dr. Levine. He states, “There’s no cure for tinnitus or hearing loss. Your ears are trying to tell you something. That ringing is the scream of your hair cells dying. Each time that happens, more and more damage is done.”</p>

        </p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What do former president Bill Clinton and rock musician Pete Townshend have in common? Both men have hearing damage from exposure to loud music, and both now wear hearing aids as a consequence. As a teenager, Clinton played saxophone in a band. Townshend, who has the more severe hearing loss, was a guitarist for a band called the Who. He is one of the first rock musicians to call the public’s attention to the problem of hearing loss from exposure to loud music.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Temporary hearing loss can happen after only 15 minutes of listening to loud music. One early warning sign is when your ears begin to feel warm while you listen to music at a rock concert or through headphones.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“What happens is the hair cells [in the inner ear] are damaged, but they’re not dead,” says physician and ear specialist Dr. Sam Levine. According to Dr. Levine, if you avoid further exposure to loud noise, it’s possible to <span class="txt-underline">recondition</span> the cells somewhat. However, he adds, “Eventually, over a long period of time, hair cells are permanently damaged.” And this is no small problem.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When tiny hair cells in the cochlea (CO-klee-uh), a coiled tube in the inner ear, are damaged or destroyed, an abnormal sound is sometimes produced in a person’s head. This sensation of a ringing in the ears is called tinnitus (tin-IHtuss). Tinnitus can also consist of hissing, clicking, or buzzing sounds that can be heard only by the person affected with the condition.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What sound level is dangerous? According to Dr. Levine, regular exposure to noise in excess of 85 decibels is considered dangerous. A decibel is the unit of measurement for sound. Most people don’t carry around the scientific equipment that measures decibels, though. The chart on this page offers a comparison of decibel levels to certain sounds. Here’s another gauge you can use. If you’re at a rock concert and the music is so loud that you have to shout to make yourself heard, you’re at risk for hearing loss. That’s when wearing protective devices such as earplugs becomes critical.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The facts are pretty frightening. But are rock bands turning down the volume? Most aren’t. “Rock music is supposed to be loud,” says drummer Andrew Sather. “I wouldn’t have it any other way. And neither would the real fans of rock.”</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Continued exposure to loud music and the failure to wear earplugs can lead to deafness, according to Dr. Levine. He states, “There’s no cure for tinnitus or hearing loss. Your ears are trying to tell you something. That ringing is the scream of your hair cells dying. Each time that happens, more and more damage is done.”</p>

          <em>Giving speeches at schools was something musician David Todman never pictured himself doing. He thought his life would always be devoted to music. But hearing loss changed all that. The following is his story in his own words.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>I Learned the Hard Rock Way</strong>
        </p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; I always thought that hearing loss was something that affects other people—and not only other people, but much older other people.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I was a guitarist in a rock band for nearly nine years, and before that I attended every rock concert that came to town. If someone had suggested that I wear earplugs while playing or listening to music, I would have laughed. What was the point of listening to music if you couldn’t enjoy it at full volume?</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When I first began playing in a band, I noticed that my ears would ring after a concert and in normal conversations people’s voices would sound muffled. But my hearing would return to normal in a day or two, so I didn’t think there was any problem. I now know that people can lose their hearing gradually. My doctor explained that repeated exposure, week after week, causes permanent damage. I didn’t realize that I had a problem until it was too late.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;High-pitched sounds were the first ones I had trouble hearing. Different words—for example, <em>hill, fill,</em> and <em>sill </em>— sounded the same to me.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes my ears produce a low, dull sound, something between the hum of an organ and the purr of a car motor. At other times the sound is a ringing or a faint, high squealing. Still other times the sound is like the whooshing inside a seashell. The sounds can get so bad sometimes that I can’t function. I become completely immobilized, often for hours at a time.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I’m now so concerned about the dangers of listening to loud music that I speak about the subject to students in middle schools and high schools. I tell students about a study in which researchers found that about 17 percent of middle school and high school students have some degree of hearing damage or loss and that the most significant hearing loss was detected in students who attend rock concerts frequently.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn’t until my hearing loss was diagnosed by my doctor that I learned how delicate people’s ears are. So please take my advice: protect your ears. Don’t go to loud rock concerts, or if you do go, use earplugs. It might not seem cool to wear earplugs, but let me tell you, hearing loss is definitely not cool. And, by the way, stuffing cotton in your ears won’t do much good. That will reduce sound by only seven decibels.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Earplugs are not for wimps. Three of the four members of the band Metallica wear earplugs. If you play in a band, you’ll still be able to hear yourself and the other instruments when you wear hearing protection devices. Actually, you may hear more clearly once distracting noise is curtailed or even completely blocked out. Musicians’ earplugs are comfortable and easy to insert, and they filter sound better than disposable plugs.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Music once meant everything to me. It was the center of my life and is still important. But preserving my hearing means more. After all, what good is great music if you can’t hear it?</p>

          <em>Giving speeches at schools was something musician David Todman never pictured himself doing. He thought his life would always be devoted to music. But hearing loss changed all that. The following is his story in his own words.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>I Learned the Hard Rock Way</strong>
        </p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; I always thought that hearing loss was something that affects other people—and not only other people, but much older other people.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I was a guitarist in a rock band for nearly nine years, and before that I attended every rock concert that came to town. If someone had suggested that I wear earplugs while playing or listening to music, I would have laughed. What was the point of listening to music if you couldn’t enjoy it at full volume?</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When I first began playing in a band, I noticed that my ears would ring after a concert and in normal conversations people’s voices would sound muffled. But my hearing would return to normal in a day or two, so I didn’t think there was any problem. I now know that people can lose their hearing gradually. My doctor explained that repeated exposure, week after week, causes permanent damage. I didn’t realize that I had a problem until it was too late.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;High-pitched sounds were the first ones I had trouble hearing. Different words—for example, <em>hill, fill,</em> and <em>sill </em>— sounded the same to me.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes my ears produce a low, dull sound, something between the hum of an organ and the purr of a car motor. At other times the sound is a ringing or a faint, high squealing. Still other times the sound is like the whooshing inside a seashell. The sounds can get so bad sometimes that I can’t function. I become completely immobilized, often for hours at a time.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I’m now so concerned about the dangers of listening to loud music that I speak about the subject to students in middle schools and high schools. I tell students about a study in which researchers found that about 17 percent of middle school and high school students have some degree of hearing damage or loss and that the most significant hearing loss was detected in students who attend rock concerts frequently.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn’t until my hearing loss was diagnosed by my doctor that I learned how delicate people’s ears are. So please take my advice: protect your ears. Don’t go to loud rock concerts, or if you do go, use earplugs. It might not seem cool to wear earplugs, but let me tell you, hearing loss is definitely not cool. And, by the way, stuffing cotton in your ears won’t do much good. That will reduce sound by only seven decibels.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Earplugs are not for wimps. Three of the four members of the band Metallica wear earplugs. If you play in a band, you’ll still be able to hear yourself and the other instruments when you wear hearing protection devices. Actually, you may hear more clearly once distracting noise is curtailed or even completely blocked out. Musicians’ earplugs are comfortable and easy to insert, and they filter sound better than disposable plugs.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Music once meant everything to me. It was the center of my life and is still important. But preserving my hearing means more. After all, what good is great music if you can’t hear it?</p>

At other times the sound is a ringing or a faint, high squealing. Still other times the sound is like the whooshing inside a seashell. The sounds can get so bad sometimes that I can’t function. I become completely immobilized, often for hours at a time.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I’m now so concerned about the dangers of listening to loud music that I speak about the subject to students in middle schools and high schools. I tell students about a study in which researchers found that about 17 percent of middle school and high school students have some degree of hearing damage or loss and that the most significant hearing loss was detected in students who attend rock concerts frequently.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn’t until my hearing loss was diagnosed by my doctor that I learned how delicate people’s ears are. So please take my advice: protect your ears. Don’t go to loud rock concerts, or if you do go, use earplugs. It might not seem cool to wear earplugs, but let me tell you, hearing loss is definitely not cool. And, by the way, stuffing cotton in your ears won’t do much good. That will reduce sound by only seven decibels.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Earplugs are not for wimps. Three of the four members of the band Metallica wear earplugs. If you play in a band, you’ll still be able to hear yourself and the other instruments when you wear hearing protection devices. Actually, you may hear more clearly once distracting noise is curtailed or even completely blocked out. Musicians’ earplugs are comfortable and easy to insert, and they filter sound better than disposable plugs.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Music once meant everything to me. It was the center of my life and is still important. But preserving my hearing means more. After all, what good is great music if you can’t hear it?</p>

          <em>Giving speeches at schools was something musician David Todman never pictured himself doing. He thought his life would always be devoted to music. But hearing loss changed all that. The following is his story in his own words.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>I Learned the Hard Rock Way</strong>
        </p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; I always thought that hearing loss was something that affects other people—and not only other people, but much older other people.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I was a guitarist in a rock band for nearly nine years, and before that I attended every rock concert that came to town. If someone had suggested that I wear earplugs while playing or listening to music, I would have laughed. What was the point of listening to music if you couldn’t enjoy it at full volume?</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When I first began playing in a band, I noticed that my ears would ring after a concert and in normal conversations people’s voices would sound muffled. But my hearing would return to normal in a day or two, so I didn’t think there was any problem. I now know that people can lose their hearing gradually. My doctor explained that repeated exposure, week after week, causes permanent damage. I didn’t realize that I had a problem until it was too late.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;High-pitched sounds were the first ones I had trouble hearing. Different words—for example, <em>hill, fill,</em> and <em>sill </em>— sounded the same to me.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes my ears produce a low, dull sound, something between the hum of an organ and the purr of a car motor. At other times the sound is a ringing or a faint, high squealing. Still other times the sound is like the whooshing inside a seashell. The sounds can get so bad sometimes that I can’t function. I become completely immobilized, often for hours at a time.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I’m now so concerned about the dangers of listening to loud music that I speak about the subject to students in middle schools and high schools. I tell students about a study in which researchers found that about 17 percent of middle school and high school students have some degree of hearing damage or loss and that the most significant hearing loss was detected in students who attend rock concerts frequently.</p>

          <em>Giving speeches at schools was something musician David Todman never pictured himself doing. He thought his life would always be devoted to music. But hearing loss changed all that. The following is his story in his own words.</em>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <strong>I Learned the Hard Rock Way</strong>
        </p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; I always thought that hearing loss was something that affects other people—and not only other people, but much older other people.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I was a guitarist in a rock band for nearly nine years, and before that I attended every rock concert that came to town. If someone had suggested that I wear earplugs while playing or listening to music, I would have laughed. What was the point of listening to music if you couldn’t enjoy it at full volume?</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When I first began playing in a band, I noticed that my ears would ring after a concert and in normal conversations people’s voices would sound muffled. But my hearing would return to normal in a day or two, so I didn’t think there was any problem. I now know that people can lose their hearing gradually. My doctor explained that repeated exposure, week after week, causes permanent damage. I didn’t realize that I had a problem until it was too late.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;High-pitched sounds were the first ones I had trouble hearing. Different words—for example, <em>hill, fill,</em> and <em>sill </em>— sounded the same to me.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes my ears produce a low, dull sound, something between the hum of an organ and the purr of a car motor. At other times the sound is a ringing or a faint, high squealing. Still other times the sound is like the whooshing inside a seashell. The sounds can get so bad sometimes that I can’t function. I become completely immobilized, often for hours at a time.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I’m now so concerned about the dangers of listening to loud music that I speak about the subject to students in middle schools and high schools. I tell students about a study in which researchers found that about 17 percent of middle school and high school students have some degree of hearing damage or loss and that the most significant hearing loss was detected in students who attend rock concerts frequently.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn’t until my hearing loss was diagnosed by my doctor that I learned how delicate people’s ears are. So please take my advice: protect your ears. Don’t go to loud rock concerts, or if you do go, use earplugs. It might not seem cool to wear earplugs, but let me tell you, hearing loss is definitely not cool. And, by the way, stuffing cotton in your ears won’t do much good. That will reduce sound by only seven decibels.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Earplugs are not for wimps. Three of the four members of the band Metallica wear earplugs. If you play in a band, you’ll still be able to hear yourself and the other instruments when you wear hearing protection devices. Actually, you may hear more clearly once distracting noise is curtailed or even completely blocked out. Musicians’ earplugs are comfortable and easy to insert, and they filter sound better than disposable plugs.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Music once meant everything to me. It was the center of my life and is still important. But preserving my hearing means more. After all, what good is great music if you can’t hear it?</p>

          <strong>The Painter</strong>
        </p>
        <p>1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacob Lawrence was extraordinary. I could tell it from the moment I met him. Maybe it was the way he talked. Or maybe it was the way he acted. For a famous artist he didn’t have even a hint of ego about him. His open manner made him pleasant to be around. This was the first thing I noticed about him when I, a nervous college student, walked into the art class he taught at the University of Washington in Seattle. It was 1980, and I couldn’t have predicted then what an effect this quiet man would have on the rest of my life.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
                  <img width="69%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766028987/sg8cfuri9pn1hytxy0ak.png" alt="STT23_RC_25_1">


        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than being impressed by Lawrence’s artwork, I was surprised at how his story mirrored my own. Lawrence spent most of his childhood in Harlem, a mostly African American neighborhood in New York City—the same city I grew up in almost 40 years after he did. He discovered painting during the 1930s at an after-school program when he was 13 years old. He first painted with tempera paint, which was the first kind of paint that I began using as a boy in school. The paint was, and still is, cheap. During the Great Depression, when Lawrence began painting, everyone was searching for ways to save money. Lawrence liked the bright colors of the tempera paint so much that he continued to use it throughout his career, even after he could afford higher quality paints.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lawrence didn’t spend much time talking about himself in his art class, so I read about him on my own. I read that people first noticed his paintings because of how <span class="txt-underline">striking</span> they were. His paintings caught a person’s attention immediately because Lawrence had a style that was all his own. When he painted a picture, he liked to paint using one color at a time. He might begin with red and paint everything that he wanted red in his picture first. Then he would paint the next color. Even if the painting did not appear to make sense in the beginning, by the time all his colors had been added, the images were complete and powerful.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When Lawrence was in his twenties, African American artists had to work very hard to gain recognition. But he continued to paint, and word of his talent and unique style slowly began to spread. Lawrence painted scenes from everyday life in Harlem, as well as portraits of his favorite black heroes. He valued his heritage. Late in life he decided to honor the first black hero that he had learned about as a boy, Toussaint-Louverture, the former slave who founded the Republic of Haiti. Lawrence set about this ambitious project using his signature technique. He laid out 41 large panels. Then, after sketching the scenes he wanted to paint, he began with one color and applied that color across all the panels before picking up the next color. He continued this process until he had painted the significant events from Toussaint’s life—from birth to victory in the Haitian Revolution.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
                  <img width="100%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766028986/gwdd0dtzgwupchq96vbw.png" alt="STT23_RC_25_2">


        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I admire the fact that Lawrence became known as a talented African American artist. But he was bothered by this fact. He didn’t want to be known as a good African American artist. He wanted to be known as a good artist. Lawrence said, “I would like to see them buy my art, buy the art of other Negro artists. I would like to see this done. But again, I would like to see them buy it because it’s a good work of art.”</p>
        <p>6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good art was something that Edith Halpert knew about. Her exclusive art gallery in downtown New York City featured top American artists. Before she became aware of Lawrence, no famous gallery had included the art of African Americans. Halpert decided to change this and invited Lawrence to display his famous Migration Series of paintings at her gallery. He now had a passport to international fame. Soon museums wanted to purchase his art, and his work appeared in a national magazine. Lawrence was gaining recognition for his talent, not his race, and his dream of becoming a respected American artist, not just a good African American artist, was coming true.</p>
        <p>7 By the time I met Lawrence in my college art class, he had long been regarded as one of the greatest American artists of the twentieth century. What’s amazing is that an artist of his stature would take the time to teach students like me. It seemed to me that he truly enjoyed sharing ideas and knowledge with others. He was never one to tell his students that what they painted was wrong. He guided us toward painting what was really inside us, where our hopes and dreams resided.</p>
        <p>8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why after college I returned to the neighborhood where I had grown up to teach art at an after-school program for inner-city youth while I worked on my own artistic style. I knew I would someday have a story to tell with my art, just as Lawrence had. But until my story was told, I wanted to help my students work on stories of their own.</p>

          <strong>The Painter</strong>
        </p>
        <p>1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacob Lawrence was extraordinary. I could tell it from the moment I met him. Maybe it was the way he talked. Or maybe it was the way he acted. For a famous artist he didn’t have even a hint of ego about him. His open manner made him pleasant to be around. This was the first thing I noticed about him when I, a nervous college student, walked into the art class he taught at the University of Washington in Seattle. It was 1980, and I couldn’t have predicted then what an effect this quiet man would have on the rest of my life.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than being impressed by Lawrence’s artwork, I was surprised at how his story mirrored my own. Lawrence spent most of his childhood in Harlem, a mostly African American neighborhood in New York City—the same city I grew up in almost 40 years after he did. He discovered painting during the 1930s at an after-school program when he was 13 years old. He first painted with tempera paint, which was the first kind of paint that I began using as a boy in school. The paint was, and still is, cheap. During the Great Depression, when Lawrence began painting, everyone was searching for ways to save money. Lawrence liked the bright colors of the tempera paint so much that he continued to use it throughout his career, even after he could afford higher quality paints.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lawrence didn’t spend much time talking about himself in his art class, so I read about him on my own. I read that people first noticed his paintings because of how <span class="txt-underline">striking</span> they were. His paintings caught a person’s attention immediately because Lawrence had a style that was all his own. When he painted a picture, he liked to paint using one color at a time. He might begin with red and paint everything that he wanted red in his picture first. Then he would paint the next color. Even if the painting did not appear to make sense in the beginning, by the time all his colors had been added, the images were complete and powerful.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When Lawrence was in his twenties, African American artists had to work very hard to gain recognition. But he continued to paint, and word of his talent and unique style slowly began to spread. Lawrence painted scenes from everyday life in Harlem, as well as portraits of his favorite black heroes. He valued his heritage. Late in life he decided to honor the first black hero that he had learned about as a boy, Toussaint-Louverture, the former slave who founded the Republic of Haiti. Lawrence set about this ambitious project using his signature technique. He laid out 41 large panels. Then, after sketching the scenes he wanted to paint, he began with one color and applied that color across all the panels before picking up the next color. He continued this process until he had painted the significant events from Toussaint’s life—from birth to victory in the Haitian Revolution.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I admire the fact that Lawrence became known as a talented African American artist. But he was bothered by this fact. He didn’t want to be known as a good African American artist. He wanted to be known as a good artist. Lawrence said, “I would like to see them buy my art, buy the art of other Negro artists. I would like to see this done. But again, I would like to see them buy it because it’s a good work of art.”</p>
        <p>6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good art was something that Edith Halpert knew about. Her exclusive art gallery in downtown New York City featured top American artists. Before she became aware of Lawrence, no famous gallery had included the art of African Americans. Halpert decided to change this and invited Lawrence to display his famous Migration Series of paintings at her gallery. He now had a passport to international fame. Soon museums wanted to purchase his art, and his work appeared in a national magazine. Lawrence was gaining recognition for his talent, not his race, and his dream of becoming a respected American artist, not just a good African American artist, was coming true.</p>
        <p>7 By the time I met Lawrence in my college art class, he had long been regarded as one of the greatest American artists of the twentieth century. What’s amazing is that an artist of his stature would take the time to teach students like me. It seemed to me that he truly enjoyed sharing ideas and knowledge with others. He was never one to tell his students that what they painted was wrong. He guided us toward painting what was really inside us, where our hopes and dreams resided.</p>
        <p>8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why after college I returned to the neighborhood where I had grown up to teach art at an after-school program for inner-city youth while I worked on my own artistic style. I knew I would someday have a story to tell with my art, just as Lawrence had. But until my story was told, I wanted to help my students work on stories of their own.</p>

          <strong>The Painter</strong>
        </p>
        <p>1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacob Lawrence was extraordinary. I could tell it from the moment I met him. Maybe it was the way he talked. Or maybe it was the way he acted. For a famous artist he didn’t have even a hint of ego about him. His open manner made him pleasant to be around. This was the first thing I noticed about him when I, a nervous college student, walked into the art class he taught at the University of Washington in Seattle. It was 1980, and I couldn’t have predicted then what an effect this quiet man would have on the rest of my life.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than being impressed by Lawrence’s artwork, I was surprised at how his story mirrored my own. Lawrence spent most of his childhood in Harlem, a mostly African American neighborhood in New York City—the same city I grew up in almost 40 years after he did. He discovered painting during the 1930s at an after-school program when he was 13 years old. He first painted with tempera paint, which was the first kind of paint that I began using as a boy in school. The paint was, and still is, cheap. During the Great Depression, when Lawrence began painting, everyone was searching for ways to save money. Lawrence liked the bright colors of the tempera paint so much that he continued to use it throughout his career, even after he could afford higher quality paints.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lawrence didn’t spend much time talking about himself in his art class, so I read about him on my own. I read that people first noticed his paintings because of how <span class="txt-underline">striking</span> they were. His paintings caught a person’s attention immediately because Lawrence had a style that was all his own. When he painted a picture, he liked to paint using one color at a time. He might begin with red and paint everything that he wanted red in his picture first. Then he would paint the next color. Even if the painting did not appear to make sense in the beginning, by the time all his colors had been added, the images were complete and powerful.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When Lawrence was in his twenties, African American artists had to work very hard to gain recognition. But he continued to paint, and word of his talent and unique style slowly began to spread. Lawrence painted scenes from everyday life in Harlem, as well as portraits of his favorite black heroes. He valued his heritage. Late in life he decided to honor the first black hero that he had learned about as a boy, Toussaint-Louverture, the former slave who founded the Republic of Haiti. Lawrence set about this ambitious project using his signature technique. He laid out 41 large panels. Then, after sketching the scenes he wanted to paint, he began with one color and applied that color across all the panels before picking up the next color. He continued this process until he had painted the significant events from Toussaint’s life—from birth to victory in the Haitian Revolution.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I admire the fact that Lawrence became known as a talented African American artist. But he was bothered by this fact. He didn’t want to be known as a good African American artist. He wanted to be known as a good artist. Lawrence said, “I would like to see them buy my art, buy the art of other Negro artists. I would like to see this done. But again, I would like to see them buy it because it’s a good work of art.”</p>
        <p>6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good art was something that Edith Halpert knew about. Her exclusive art gallery in downtown New York City featured top American artists. Before she became aware of Lawrence, no famous gallery had included the art of African Americans. Halpert decided to change this and invited Lawrence to display his famous Migration Series of paintings at her gallery. He now had a passport to international fame. Soon museums wanted to purchase his art, and his work appeared in a national magazine. Lawrence was gaining recognition for his talent, not his race, and his dream of becoming a respected American artist, not just a good African American artist, was coming true.</p>
        <p>7 By the time I met Lawrence in my college art class, he had long been regarded as one of the greatest American artists of the twentieth century. What’s amazing is that an artist of his stature would take the time to teach students like me. It seemed to me that he truly enjoyed sharing ideas and knowledge with others. He was never one to tell his students that what they painted was wrong. He guided us toward painting what was really inside us, where our hopes and dreams resided.</p>
        <p>8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why after college I returned to the neighborhood where I had grown up to teach art at an after-school program for inner-city youth while I worked on my own artistic style. I knew I would someday have a story to tell with my art, just as Lawrence had. But until my story was told, I wanted to help my students work on stories of their own.</p>

          <strong>The Painter</strong>
        </p>
        <p>1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacob Lawrence was extraordinary. I could tell it from the moment I met him. Maybe it was the way he talked. Or maybe it was the way he acted. For a famous artist he didn’t have even a hint of ego about him. His open manner made him pleasant to be around. This was the first thing I noticed about him when I, a nervous college student, walked into the art class he taught at the University of Washington in Seattle. It was 1980, and I couldn’t have predicted then what an effect this quiet man would have on the rest of my life.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than being impressed by Lawrence’s artwork, I was surprised at how his story mirrored my own. Lawrence spent most of his childhood in Harlem, a mostly African American neighborhood in New York City—the same city I grew up in almost 40 years after he did. He discovered painting during the 1930s at an after-school program when he was 13 years old. He first painted with tempera paint, which was the first kind of paint that I began using as a boy in school. The paint was, and still is, cheap. During the Great Depression, when Lawrence began painting, everyone was searching for ways to save money. Lawrence liked the bright colors of the tempera paint so much that he continued to use it throughout his career, even after he could afford higher quality paints.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lawrence didn’t spend much time talking about himself in his art class, so I read about him on my own. I read that people first noticed his paintings because of how <span class="txt-underline">striking</span> they were. His paintings caught a person’s attention immediately because Lawrence had a style that was all his own. When he painted a picture, he liked to paint using one color at a time. He might begin with red and paint everything that he wanted red in his picture first. Then he would paint the next color. Even if the painting did not appear to make sense in the beginning, by the time all his colors had been added, the images were complete and powerful.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When Lawrence was in his twenties, African American artists had to work very hard to gain recognition. But he continued to paint, and word of his talent and unique style slowly began to spread. Lawrence painted scenes from everyday life in Harlem, as well as portraits of his favorite black heroes. He valued his heritage. Late in life he decided to honor the first black hero that he had learned about as a boy, Toussaint-Louverture, the former slave who founded the Republic of Haiti. Lawrence set about this ambitious project using his signature technique. He laid out 41 large panels. Then, after sketching the scenes he wanted to paint, he began with one color and applied that color across all the panels before picking up the next color. He continued this process until he had painted the significant events from Toussaint’s life—from birth to victory in the Haitian Revolution.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I admire the fact that Lawrence became known as a talented African American artist. But he was bothered by this fact. He didn’t want to be known as a good African American artist. He wanted to be known as a good artist. Lawrence said, “I would like to see them buy my art, buy the art of other Negro artists. I would like to see this done. But again, I would like to see them buy it because it’s a good work of art.”</p>
        <p>6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good art was something that Edith Halpert knew about. Her exclusive art gallery in downtown New York City featured top American artists. Before she became aware of Lawrence, no famous gallery had included the art of African Americans. Halpert decided to change this and invited Lawrence to display his famous Migration Series of paintings at her gallery. He now had a passport to international fame. Soon museums wanted to purchase his art, and his work appeared in a national magazine. Lawrence was gaining recognition for his talent, not his race, and his dream of becoming a respected American artist, not just a good African American artist, was coming true.</p>
        <p>7 By the time I met Lawrence in my college art class, he had long been regarded as one of the greatest American artists of the twentieth century. What’s amazing is that an artist of his stature would take the time to teach students like me. It seemed to me that he truly enjoyed sharing ideas and knowledge with others. He was never one to tell his students that what they painted was wrong. He guided us toward painting what was really inside us, where our hopes and dreams resided.</p>
        <p>8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why after college I returned to the neighborhood where I had grown up to teach art at an after-school program for inner-city youth while I worked on my own artistic style. I knew I would someday have a story to tell with my art, just as Lawrence had. But until my story was told, I wanted to help my students work on stories of their own.</p>

          <strong>The Corn-Stalk Fiddle</strong>
          <br>
          <em>By Paul Laurence Dunbar</em>
        </p>
        <p>When the corn’s all cut and the bright stalks shine&nbsp; <em>1</em><br>
Like the burnished spears of a field of gold;<br>
When the field-mice rich on the nubbins dine,<br>
And the frost comes white and the wind blows cold;<br>
Then its heigho fellows and hi-diddle-diddle,&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>5</em><br>
For the time is ripe for the corn-stalk fiddle.</p>
        <p><br>
And you take a stalk that is straight and long,<br>
With an expert eye to its worthy points,<br>
And you think of the bubbling strains of song<br>
That are bound between its pithy joints—&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>10</em><br>
Then you cut out strings, with a bridge in the middle,<br>
With a corn-stalk bow for a corn-stalk fiddle.</p>
        <p><br>
Then the strains that grow as you draw the bow<br>
O’er the yielding strings with a practiced hand!<br>
And the music’s flow never loud but low&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>15</em><br>
Is the concert note of a fairy band.<br>
Oh, your dainty songs are a misty riddle<br>
To the simple sweets of the corn-stalk fiddle.</p>
        <p><br>
When the eve comes on and our work is done<br>
And the sun drops down with a tender glance,&nbsp; <em>20</em><br>
With their hearts all prime for the harmless fun,<br>
Come the neighbor girls for the evening’s dance,<br>
And they wait for the well-known twist and twiddle,<br>
More <span class="txt-underline">time than tune</span>—from the corn-stalk fiddle.</p>
        <p><br>
Then brother Jabez takes the bow,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>25</em><br>
While Ned stands off with Susan Bland,<br>
Then Henry stops by Milly Snow<br>
And John takes Nellie Jones’s hand,<br>
While I pair off with Mandy Biddle,<br>
And scrape, scrape, scrape goes the corn-stalk fiddle. <em>30</em></p>
        <p><br>
“Salute your partners,” comes the call,<br>
“All join hands and circle round,”<br>
“Grand train back,” and “Balance all,”<br>
Footsteps lightly spurn the ground,<br>
“Take your lady and balance down the middle”&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>35</em><br>
To the merry strains of the corn-stalk fiddle.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So the night goes on and the dance is o’er,<br>
And the merry girls are homeward gone,<br>
But I see it all in my sleep once more,<br>
And I dream till the very break of dawn&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>40</em><br>
Of an impish dance on a red-hot griddle<br>
To the screech and scrape of a corn-stalk fiddle.</p>
