In practice, what often happens is that a new theory is devised that is really an extension of the previous theory. For example, very accurate observations of the planet Mercury revealed a small difference between its motion and the predictions of Newton’s theory of gravity. Einstein’s general theory of relativity predicted&nbsp; a slightly different motion from Newton’s theory. The fact that Einstein’s predictions matched what was seen, while Newton’s did not, was one of the crucial confirmations of the new theory. However, we still use Newton’s theory for all practical purposes because the difference between its predictions and those of general relativity is very small in the situations that we normally deal with.<br>

Both Aristotle and Newton believed in absolute time. That is, they believed that one could unambiguously measure the interval of time between two events, and that this time would be the same whoever measured it, provided they used a good clock. Time was completely separate from and independent of space. This is what most people would take to be the commonsense view. However, we have had to change our ideas about space and time. Although our apparently common sense notions work with things like apples, or planets that travel comparatively slowly, they don’t work at all for things moving at or near the speed of light.<br>
<br>
{^<strong> Extract C </strong>^}<br>
Before 1915, space and time were thought of as a fixed arena in which events took place, but which was not affected by what happened in it. This was true even for the special theory of relativity. Bodies moved, forces attracted and repelled, but time and space simply continued, unaffected. It was natural to think that space and time went on forever.<br>

It is an interesting reflection on the general climate of thought before the twentieth century that no one had suggested that the universe was expanding or contracting. It was generally accepted either that the universe had existed forever in an unchanging state, or that it had been created at a finite time in the past more or less as we observe it today. In part, this may be due to people’s tendency to believe in eternal truths, as well as the comfort they found in the thought that even though they may grow old and die, the universe is eternal and unchanging.</div>

In practice, what often happens is that a new theory is devised that is really an extension of the previous theory. For example, very accurate observations of the planet Mercury revealed a small difference between its motion and the predictions of Newton’s theory of gravity. Einstein’s general theory of relativity predicted&nbsp; a slightly different motion from Newton’s theory. The fact that Einstein’s predictions matched what was seen, while Newton’s did not, was one of the crucial confirmations of the new theory. However, we still use Newton’s theory for all practical purposes because the difference between its predictions and those of general relativity is very small in the situations that we normally deal with.<br>

Both Aristotle and Newton believed in absolute time. That is, they believed that one could unambiguously measure the interval of time between two events, and that this time would be the same whoever measured it, provided they used a good clock. Time was completely separate from and independent of space. This is what most people would take to be the commonsense view. However, we have had to change our ideas about space and time. Although our apparently common sense notions work with things like apples, or planets that travel comparatively slowly, they don’t work at all for things moving at or near the speed of light.<br>
<br>
{^<strong> Extract C </strong>^}<br>
Before 1915, space and time were thought of as a fixed arena in which events took place, but which was not affected by what happened in it. This was true even for the special theory of relativity. Bodies moved, forces attracted and repelled, but time and space simply continued, unaffected. It was natural to think that space and time went on forever.<br>

It is an interesting reflection on the general climate of thought before the twentieth century that no one had suggested that the universe was expanding or contracting. It was generally accepted either that the universe had existed forever in an unchanging state, or that it had been created at a finite time in the past more or less as we observe it today. In part, this may be due to people’s tendency to believe in eternal truths, as well as the comfort they found in the thought that even though they may grow old and die, the universe is eternal and unchanging.</div>

In practice, what often happens is that a new theory is devised that is really an extension of the previous theory. For example, very accurate observations of the planet Mercury revealed a small difference between its motion and the predictions of Newton’s theory of gravity. Einstein’s general theory of relativity predicted&nbsp; a slightly different motion from Newton’s theory. The fact that Einstein’s predictions matched what was seen, while Newton’s did not, was one of the crucial confirmations of the new theory. However, we still use Newton’s theory for all practical purposes because the difference between its predictions and those of general relativity is very small in the situations that we normally deal with.<br>

{^<strong> Extract B </strong>^}<br>
Both Aristotle and Newton believed in absolute time. That is, they believed that one could unambiguously measure the interval of time between two events, and that this time would be the same whoever measured it, provided they used a good clock. Time was completely separate from and independent of space. This is what most people would take to be the commonsense view. However, we have had to change our ideas about space and time. Although our apparently common sense notions work with things like apples, or planets that travel comparatively slowly, they don’t work at all for things moving at or near the speed of light.<br>
<br>
{^<strong> Extract C </strong>^}<br>
Before 1915, space and time were thought of as a fixed arena in which events took place, but which was not affected by what happened in it. This was true even for the special theory of relativity. Bodies moved, forces attracted and repelled, but time and space simply continued, unaffected. It was natural to think that space and time went on forever.<br>

{^<strong> Extract D </strong>^}<br>
It is an interesting reflection on the general climate of thought before the twentieth century that no one had suggested that the universe was expanding or contracting. It was generally accepted either that the universe had existed forever in an unchanging state, or that it had been created at a finite time in the past more or less as we observe it today. In part, this may be due to people’s tendency to believe in eternal truths, as well as the comfort they found in the thought that even though they may grow old and die, the universe is eternal and unchanging.</div>

People turn to the garden for a variety of reasons; filling open areas in the yard, improving the curbside appeal, fulfilling a personal desire to create, and even partaking for the many health benefits it provides are all great reasons to garden. But what many people are unaware of is how amazing these activities are for the environment. Gardening impacts everything from the air we breathe to the minimising of carbon footprints we leave behind. If you have an area to plant in, even if it’s simply containers on a terrace, take advantage of this space and become part of a healthy environmental impact. Plants produce oxygen through the process of photosynthesis. They take in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through their leaves and use it to help expel oxygen and water. They also remove any chemicals and bacterias that may be floating around in the air, providing an overall healthier environment to be within.<br>
<br>
{^<strong> Extract B </strong>^}<br>
The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World listed by Hellenic culture. They were described as a remarkable feat of engineering with an ascending series of tiered gardens containing a wide variety of trees, shrubs, and vines, resembling a large green mountain constructed of mud bricks. It was said to have been built in the ancient city of Babylon, near present-day Hillah, Babil province, in Iraq.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
According to one legend, the Hanging Gardens were built alongside a grand palace known as The Marvel of Mankind, by the Neo-Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar II (who ruled between 605 and 562 BC), for his Median wife Queen Amytis, because she missed the green hills and valleys of her homeland. This was attested to by the Babylonian priest Berossus, writing in about 290 BC, a description that was later quoted by Josephus. One theory suggests that they existed in Babylon, but were completely destroyed sometime around the first century AD.<br>
<br>
{^<strong> Extract C </strong>^}<br>
It was the lock of the door which had been closed ten years and she put her hand in her pocket, drew out the key and found it fitted the keyhole. She put the key in and turned it. It took two hands to do it, but it did turn. And then she took a long breath and looked behind her up the long walk to see if anyone was coming. She held back the swinging curtain of ivy and pushed back the door which opened slowly—slowly. Then she slipped through it, and shut it behind her, and stood with her back against it, looking about her and breathing quite fast with excitement, and wonder, and delight.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>She was standing inside the secret garden!</strong> It was the sweetest, most mysteriouslooking place anyone could imagine. The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of climbing roses which were so thick that they were matted together. Mary Lennox knew they were roses because she had seen a great many roses in India. There were numbers of standard roses which had so spread their branches that they were like little trees. Their thin gray or brown branches and sprays looked like a sort of hazy mantle spreading over everything, walls, and trees, and even brown grass. It was this hazy tangle from tree to tree which made it all look so mysterious. Mary had thought indeed it was different from any other place she had ever seen in her life.<br>
<br>
“How still it is!” she whispered. “How still!” Then she waited a moment and listened at the stillness. The robin, who had flown to his treetop, was still as all the rest. He did not even flutter his wings; he sat without stirring, and looked at Mary. “No wonder it is still,” she whispered again. “I am the first person who has spoken in here for ten years."<br>

I love gardens. Although I currently live in an apartment building, I grew up in a house - in Costa Rica - that was surrounded by a large garden. The garden had mango trees, blackberry shrubs, rows of corn stalks, a lemon tree, and all kinds of flowers. Today I was thinking about that garden and it occurred to me that gardening is a great metaphor for living one’s life. After all, nature is a great teacher and there are many life lessons that can be learned by spending time out in the natural world.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
These are the lessons I believe you can learn from gardening. Have a Vision for Your Garden. You Need to Prioritize. You Need Good Soil. You Reap What You Sow. Assess Your Garden’s Conditions. Build a Fence Around Your Garden. A Garden Needs Constant Tending. Have Patience and Trust the Process. Learn to Deal with Things Outside of Your Control. Reap Your Harvest.<br>
<br>
So, what do you want your garden to look like? What seeds will you plant? What steps will you take to tend your garden? Live your best life by being a good life gardener.</div>

According to one legend, the Hanging Gardens were built alongside a grand palace known as The Marvel of Mankind, by the Neo-Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar II (who ruled between 605 and 562 BC), for his Median wife Queen Amytis, because she missed the green hills and valleys of her homeland. This was attested to by the Babylonian priest Berossus, writing in about 290 BC, a description that was later quoted by Josephus. One theory suggests that they existed in Babylon, but were completely destroyed sometime around the first century AD.<br>

It was the lock of the door which had been closed ten years and she put her hand in her pocket, drew out the key and found it fitted the keyhole. She put the key in and turned it. It took two hands to do it, but it did turn. And then she took a long breath and looked behind her up the long walk to see if anyone was coming. She held back the swinging curtain of ivy and pushed back the door which opened slowly—slowly. Then she slipped through it, and shut it behind her, and stood with her back against it, looking about her and breathing quite fast with excitement, and wonder, and delight.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>She was standing inside the secret garden!</strong> It was the sweetest, most mysteriouslooking place anyone could imagine. The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of climbing roses which were so thick that they were matted together. Mary Lennox knew they were roses because she had seen a great many roses in India. There were numbers of standard roses which had so spread their branches that they were like little trees. Their thin gray or brown branches and sprays looked like a sort of hazy mantle spreading over everything, walls, and trees, and even brown grass. It was this hazy tangle from tree to tree which made it all look so mysterious. Mary had thought indeed it was different from any other place she had ever seen in her life.<br>
<br>
“How still it is!” she whispered. “How still!” Then she waited a moment and listened at the stillness. The robin, who had flown to his treetop, was still as all the rest. He did not even flutter his wings; he sat without stirring, and looked at Mary. “No wonder it is still,” she whispered again. “I am the first person who has spoken in here for ten years."<br>

I love gardens. Although I currently live in an apartment building, I grew up in a house - in Costa Rica - that was surrounded by a large garden. The garden had mango trees, blackberry shrubs, rows of corn stalks, a lemon tree, and all kinds of flowers. Today I was thinking about that garden and it occurred to me that gardening is a great metaphor for living one’s life. After all, nature is a great teacher and there are many life lessons that can be learned by spending time out in the natural world.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
These are the lessons I believe you can learn from gardening. Have a Vision for Your Garden. You Need to Prioritize. You Need Good Soil. You Reap What You Sow. Assess Your Garden’s Conditions. Build a Fence Around Your Garden. A Garden Needs Constant Tending. Have Patience and Trust the Process. Learn to Deal with Things Outside of Your Control. Reap Your Harvest.<br>
<br>
So, what do you want your garden to look like? What seeds will you plant? What steps will you take to tend your garden? Live your best life by being a good life gardener.</div>

People turn to the garden for a variety of reasons; filling open areas in the yard, improving the curbside appeal, fulfilling a personal desire to create, and even partaking for the many health benefits it provides are all great reasons to garden. But what many people are unaware of is how amazing these activities are for the environment. Gardening impacts everything from the air we breathe to the minimising of carbon footprints we leave behind. If you have an area to plant in, even if it’s simply containers on a terrace, take advantage of this space and become part of a healthy environmental impact. Plants produce oxygen through the process of photosynthesis. They take in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through their leaves and use it to help expel oxygen and water. They also remove any chemicals and bacterias that may be floating around in the air, providing an overall healthier environment to be within.<br>

The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World listed by Hellenic culture. They were described as a remarkable feat of engineering with an ascending series of tiered gardens containing a wide variety of trees, shrubs, and vines, resembling a large green mountain constructed of mud bricks. It was said to have been built in the ancient city of Babylon, near present-day Hillah, Babil province, in Iraq.&nbsp;<br>

People turn to the garden for a variety of reasons; filling open areas in the yard, improving the curbside appeal, fulfilling a personal desire to create, and even partaking for the many health benefits it provides are all great reasons to garden. But what many people are unaware of is how amazing these activities are for the environment. Gardening impacts everything from the air we breathe to the minimising of carbon footprints we leave behind. If you have an area to plant in, even if it’s simply containers on a terrace, take advantage of this space and become part of a healthy environmental impact. Plants produce oxygen through the process of photosynthesis. They take in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through their leaves and use it to help expel oxygen and water. They also remove any chemicals and bacterias that may be floating around in the air, providing an overall healthier environment to be within.<br>

The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World listed by Hellenic culture. They were described as a remarkable feat of engineering with an ascending series of tiered gardens containing a wide variety of trees, shrubs, and vines, resembling a large green mountain constructed of mud bricks. It was said to have been built in the ancient city of Babylon, near present-day Hillah, Babil province, in Iraq.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
According to one legend, the Hanging Gardens were built alongside a grand palace known as The Marvel of Mankind, by the Neo-Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar II (who ruled between 605 and 562 BC), for his Median wife Queen Amytis, because she missed the green hills and valleys of her homeland. This was attested to by the Babylonian priest Berossus, writing in about 290 BC, a description that was later quoted by Josephus. One theory suggests that they existed in Babylon, but were completely destroyed sometime around the first century AD.<br>

It was the lock of the door which had been closed ten years and she put her hand in her pocket, drew out the key and found it fitted the keyhole. She put the key in and turned it. It took two hands to do it, but it did turn. And then she took a long breath and looked behind her up the long walk to see if anyone was coming. She held back the swinging curtain of ivy and pushed back the door which opened slowly—slowly. Then she slipped through it, and shut it behind her, and stood with her back against it, looking about her and breathing quite fast with excitement, and wonder, and delight.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>She was standing inside the secret garden!</strong> It was the sweetest, most mysteriouslooking place anyone could imagine. The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of climbing roses which were so thick that they were matted together. Mary Lennox knew they were roses because she had seen a great many roses in India. There were numbers of standard roses which had so spread their branches that they were like little trees. Their thin gray or brown branches and sprays looked like a sort of hazy mantle spreading over everything, walls, and trees, and even brown grass. It was this hazy tangle from tree to tree which made it all look so mysterious. Mary had thought indeed it was different from any other place she had ever seen in her life.<br>
<br>
“How still it is!” she whispered. “How still!” Then she waited a moment and listened at the stillness. The robin, who had flown to his treetop, was still as all the rest. He did not even flutter his wings; he sat without stirring, and looked at Mary. “No wonder it is still,” she whispered again. “I am the first person who has spoken in here for ten years."<br>

I love gardens. Although I currently live in an apartment building, I grew up in a house - in Costa Rica - that was surrounded by a large garden. The garden had mango trees, blackberry shrubs, rows of corn stalks, a lemon tree, and all kinds of flowers. Today I was thinking about that garden and it occurred to me that gardening is a great metaphor for living one’s life. After all, nature is a great teacher and there are many life lessons that can be learned by spending time out in the natural world.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
These are the lessons I believe you can learn from gardening. Have a Vision for Your Garden. You Need to Prioritize. You Need Good Soil. You Reap What You Sow. Assess Your Garden’s Conditions. Build a Fence Around Your Garden. A Garden Needs Constant Tending. Have Patience and Trust the Process. Learn to Deal with Things Outside of Your Control. Reap Your Harvest.<br>
<br>
So, what do you want your garden to look like? What seeds will you plant? What steps will you take to tend your garden? Live your best life by being a good life gardener.</div>
