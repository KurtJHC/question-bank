[^cstable^]Brady is a recently retired search and rescue dog. He is not happy and misses his owner Al because Al has gone out on a rescue mission without him. Al’s nephew Steve decides to take Brady along when he and his friend Zach go on an overnight hike. In this part of the story, Steve and Zach have just realized that lightning has set the woods on fire.[^/cstable^]<br>
<br>
In the short time they’d been inside their tent packing their gear, wind-blown flame had leaped from the top of one tree to another. The long dry summer had turned the forest into a tinderbox, and the thunderstorm wasn’t helping much. It had more wind and lightning than rain.<br>
<br>
Zach tugged at Steve’s arm. “Let’s go! We can make it back to the river we crossed today.”<br>
<br>
Steve snapped Brady’s leash to his collar, and their heads down against the gusting fire-wind, they hurried down the trail they had followed earlier. The air was full of smoke and fiery cinders, and pine branches snapped from burning trees with a cannon-like sound. Steve kept his eyes fixed on the trail. All they had to do was to make it down to the river.<br>
. . .<br>
<br>
Brady barked a sharp warning. Ahead of them lay a dense curtain of smoke across the trail. They’d never make it through that—they’d have to find another escape route.<br>
<br>
The dog was tugging at his leash trying to draw them away from the smoke. This was what Brady was trained to do, and yet Steve was uneasy. It seemed to him they were moving away from the river.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, Zach yelled. Steve whipped around, but his friend had disappeared. “Zach!” Steve shouted. “Are you O.K.? Where are you?”<br>
<br>
Zach’s answer was lost in the fire-noises around them, but Brady tugged Steve down a sharp incline. At the base of the slope Zach was sitting and rubbing his ankle.<br>
<br>
“I’ve sprained it,” he groaned. “I tried to get up, but I can’t put any pressure on it.”<br>
<br>
“We can’t stop moving. Lean on me, and we’ll go slow.”<br>
<br>
As Steve helped his friend to his feet, Brady lifted his head and snuffed the smoke-laden wind. Next moment, the dog bounded away and disappeared. The boys yelled and shouted for him, but he didn’t come back.<br>
<br>
They had no choice but to leave him behind. Heartsick, Steve helped Zach up the slope. He couldn’t blame Brady for panicking and bolting. He himself wanted to run even though he didn’t have a clue which way.<br>
<br>
They hadn’t gone far when there was a familiar bark, and Brady came bounding toward them. “Where’ve you been?” Steve cried.<br>
<br>
For an answer Brady stopped directly in front of him. “What’s gotten into him?” Zach demanded as the big dog butted Steve with his head, pushing him back toward the slope they’d just climbed. Then, when Steve still didn’t get it, Brady grabbed the boy’s jeans and started tugging.<br>
<br>
The message was clear, but Steve hesitated.&nbsp; Of course he remembered what his uncle had said about Brady saving his life, but that had been a long time ago when the dog was much younger. Was he still sharp enough to get them through this?<br>
<br>
Nearby, a pine went up in a whoosh of smoke. Brady tugged again, urgently. “O.K., big guy,” Steve gritted. After all, what choice did they have?<br>
<br>
Brady led them back down the incline and into the trees. Not far from them fire was licking at underbrush and old logs before rearing up into the trees. Zach stared as if hypnotized, but Steve focused on Brady. “You can do it,” he kept muttering.<br>
<br>
Could he? Steve didn’t know, and he wasn’t sure whether Brady knew, either. Several times the big dog stopped as if to get his bearings. Often he changed direction. Once Zach stumbled, taking Steve with him, and they both went sprawling.<br>
<br>
Steve was so tired that he just wanted to lie there and rest, but Brady wouldn’t have it. Growling and nudging, the dog bullied both boys to their feet. Then they started to move again.<br>
<br>
How long they’d walked Steve had no idea. He just held onto Brady’s leash with one hand, hung onto Zach with the other, and kept putting one foot in front of the other. He was almost numb when he heard it—the wonderful sound of rushing water.<br>
<br>
The river! With a hoarse yell the boys stumbled forward until they splashed thigh-deep in cool, running water. “Brady, you did it!” Zach yelled. “Yee-ha! You got us through!”<br>

They hadn’t gone far when there was a familiar bark, and Brady came bounding toward them. “Where’ve you been?” Steve cried.<br>
<br>
For an answer Brady stopped directly in front of him. “What’s gotten into him?” Zach demanded as the big dog butted Steve with his head, pushing him back toward the slope they’d just climbed. Then, when Steve still didn’t get it, Brady grabbed the boy’s jeans and started tugging.<br>
<br>
The message was clear, but Steve hesitated.&nbsp; Of course he remembered what his uncle had said about Brady saving his life, but that had been a long time ago when the dog was much younger. Was he still sharp enough to get them through this?<br>
<br>
Nearby, a pine went up in a whoosh of smoke. Brady tugged again, urgently. “O.K., big guy,” Steve gritted. After all, what choice did they have?<br>
<br>
Brady led them back down the incline and into the trees. Not far from them fire was licking at underbrush and old logs before rearing up into the trees. Zach stared as if hypnotized, but Steve focused on Brady. “You can do it,” he kept muttering.<br>
<br>
Could he? Steve didn’t know, and he wasn’t sure whether Brady knew, either. Several times the big dog stopped as if to get his bearings. Often he changed direction. Once Zach stumbled, taking Steve with him, and they both went sprawling.<br>
<br>
Steve was so tired that he just wanted to lie there and rest, but Brady wouldn’t have it. Growling and nudging, the dog bullied both boys to their feet. Then they started to move again.<br>
<br>
How long they’d walked Steve had no idea. He just held onto Brady’s leash with one hand, hung onto Zach with the other, and kept putting one foot in front of the other. He was almost numb when he heard it—the wonderful sound of rushing water.<br>
<br>
The river! With a hoarse yell the boys stumbled forward until they splashed thigh-deep in cool, running water. “Brady, you did it!” Zach yelled. “Yee-ha! You got us through!”<br>

[^cstable^]Brady is a recently retired search and rescue dog. He is not happy and misses his owner Al because Al has gone out on a rescue mission without him. Al’s nephew Steve decides to take Brady along when he and his friend Zach go on an overnight hike. In this part of the story, Steve and Zach have just realized that lightning has set the woods on fire.[^/cstable^]<br>
<br>
In the short time they’d been inside their tent packing their gear, wind-blown flame had leaped from the top of one tree to another. The long dry summer had turned the forest into a tinderbox, and the thunderstorm wasn’t helping much. It had more wind and lightning than rain.<br>
<br>
Zach tugged at Steve’s arm. “Let’s go! We can make it back to the river we crossed today.”<br>
<br>
Steve snapped Brady’s leash to his collar, and their heads down against the gusting fire-wind, they hurried down the trail they had followed earlier. The air was full of smoke and fiery cinders, and pine branches snapped from burning trees with a cannon-like sound. Steve kept his eyes fixed on the trail. All they had to do was to make it down to the river.<br>
. . .<br>
<br>
Brady barked a sharp warning. Ahead of them lay a dense curtain of smoke across the trail. They’d never make it through that—they’d have to find another escape route.<br>
<br>
The dog was tugging at his leash trying to draw them away from the smoke. This was what Brady was trained to do, and yet Steve was uneasy. It seemed to him they were moving away from the river.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, Zach yelled. Steve whipped around, but his friend had disappeared. “Zach!” Steve shouted. “Are you O.K.? Where are you?”<br>
<br>
Zach’s answer was lost in the fire-noises around them, but Brady tugged Steve down a sharp incline. At the base of the slope Zach was sitting and rubbing his ankle.<br>
<br>
“I’ve sprained it,” he groaned. “I tried to get up, but I can’t put any pressure on it.”<br>
<br>
“We can’t stop moving. Lean on me, and we’ll go slow.”<br>
<br>
As Steve helped his friend to his feet, Brady lifted his head and snuffed the smoke-laden wind. Next moment, the dog bounded away and disappeared. The boys yelled and shouted for him, but he didn’t come back.<br>
<br>
They had no choice but to leave him behind. Heartsick, Steve helped Zach up the slope. He couldn’t blame Brady for panicking and bolting. He himself wanted to run even though he didn’t have a clue which way.<br>

        <p><strong>The Wolf at My Window</strong><br><em>by Diane L. Burns<br>
drawing by Sal Catalano</em><br><br>
Wolf! Hank thought. The boy stared out the cabin window at the lone creature. It was sitting a stone’s throw away in the moonlight. The wolf howled; Hank shivered. For the first time, he felt truly alone in these Idaho mountains.</p>
        <p>It had felt so good to be allowed to come along with Dad. Dad was a scientist who studied wild animals. Together, Hank and Dad had followed the tracks of mountain sheep, goats, and cougars. Through binoculars, they’d studied coyotes and mule deer. And they’d carefully recorded all the information in Dad’s logbook every night in their tent. Dad planned to share the information with other wildlife scientists.</p>
        <p>Then, two days ago, they had moved into an empty cabin. Here, Dad would write a report about what he had found. But they discovered that dozens and dozens of mice had taken over the cabin. The little rodents scurried in and out through lots of tiny holes in the walls… Worst of all, the mice had gotten into the supplies of dried food and ruined almost everything.</p>
        <p>Now, because most of the food was gone, Dad had left overnight to get new supplies from town. Hank had insisted on staying behind.</p>
        <p>* * *</p>
        <p>The Wolf. Its howl sounded again. Hank opened the logbook to write about it, but his hand shook. Dad had never mentioned having any trouble with wolves. But Hank’s friend Jill had once told him of a shopkeeper in Montana who’d faced a whole pack of wolves during a hard winter long ago. He’d been alone in his cabin, Jill had said.</p>
        <p>Like I am now, Hank thought with a nervous gulp. The wolves had chewed right through a solid door, Jill had said, to get a smoked ham hanging from the ceiling.</p>
        <p>But . . . Hank took a deep breath and forced down his fright. How could such a story be true? Dad had told him many times that wolves were smart but shy, staying many miles away from people. The big, bad wolf was just a fairy tale, Hank thought. A 13-year-old boy was too old for such things.</p>
        <p>Hank closed the logbook and put it on the table. Quickly he looked around for something he could use as a weapon—just in case. He grabbed a poker from the fireplace, went to the door, and took a deep breath. Then he opened the door, waved the poker, and yelled with all his might: “Go away, wolf! Go away!”</p>
        <p>Startled, the wolf sprang up—and started trotting away. Hank closed the door and leaned back with a gasp. When he’d caught his breath, he turned back to the window. Oh, no! There was the wolf, sitting right where it had sat before.</p>
        <p>Hank stared at the wolf. The wolf stared right back at him. Hank was staring into the eyes of a hunter. He knew, like all creatures, the wolf needed to eat. Hank’s dad had said wolves play their part in the environment by eating deer, elk, rabbits, and other animals. But maybe, like the hungry mice that were frisking about Hank’s feet, wolves go for any food they can find.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, the wolf sprang! Hank ducked, expecting to hear the window glass shattering above him. Instead, he heard a muffled snuffling along the ground outside. The wolf wanted a way in! Hank shuddered. His heart pounded. If only Dad were here!</p>
        <p>Now came a scratching sound—the sound of pawing at the cabin walls. And then, over the hammering of his heart, Hank heard a high-pitched, tiny . . . SQUEAK!</p>
        <p>Squeak? Holding his breath, Hank raised his head to see. The wolf was below the window, holding on to a small something. Then it lay in the grass and gulped down its prize—a mouse!</p>
        <p>The wolf stood up to pounce, stiff-legged, on another. Hank’s breath rushed out. The wolf was hungry all right. But just for the kind of food it should eat, as Dad had said.</p>
        <p>* * *</p>
        <p>As the wolf pounced again, Hank opened the logbook. He began to write, neatly and carefully, every detail of his evening with the wolf. The story would be waiting for Dad when he returned in the morning—long after the smart, shy wolf had moved on in search of bigger animals to eat.</p>

        <p><strong>The Wolf at My Window</strong><br><em>by Diane L. Burns<br>
drawing by Sal Catalano</em><br><br>
Wolf! Hank thought. The boy stared out the cabin window at the lone creature. It was sitting a stone’s throw away in the moonlight. The wolf howled; Hank shivered. For the first time, he felt truly alone in these Idaho mountains.</p>
        <p>It had felt so good to be allowed to come along with Dad. Dad was a scientist who studied wild animals. Together, Hank and Dad had followed the tracks of mountain sheep, goats, and cougars. Through binoculars, they’d studied coyotes and mule deer. And they’d carefully recorded all the information in Dad’s logbook every night in their tent. Dad planned to share the information with other wildlife scientists.</p>
        <p>Then, two days ago, they had moved into an empty cabin. Here, Dad would write a report about what he had found. But they discovered that dozens and dozens of mice had taken over the cabin. The little rodents scurried in and out through lots of tiny holes in the walls… Worst of all, the mice had gotten into the supplies of dried food and ruined almost everything.</p>
        <p>Now, because most of the food was gone, Dad had left overnight to get new supplies from town. Hank had insisted on staying behind.</p>
        <p>* * *</p>
        <p>The Wolf. Its howl sounded again. Hank opened the logbook to write about it, but his hand shook. Dad had never mentioned having any trouble with wolves. But Hank’s friend Jill had once told him of a shopkeeper in Montana who’d faced a whole pack of wolves during a hard winter long ago. He’d been alone in his cabin, Jill had said.</p>
        <p>Like I am now, Hank thought with a nervous gulp. The wolves had chewed right through a solid door, Jill had said, to get a smoked ham hanging from the ceiling.</p>
        <p>But . . . Hank took a deep breath and forced down his fright. How could such a story be true? Dad had told him many times that wolves were smart but shy, staying many miles away from people. The big, bad wolf was just a fairy tale, Hank thought. A 13-year-old boy was too old for such things.</p>
        <p>Hank closed the logbook and put it on the table. Quickly he looked around for something he could use as a weapon—just in case. He grabbed a poker from the fireplace, went to the door, and took a deep breath. Then he opened the door, waved the poker, and yelled with all his might: “Go away, wolf! Go away!”</p>
        <p>Startled, the wolf sprang up—and started trotting away. Hank closed the door and leaned back with a gasp. When he’d caught his breath, he turned back to the window. Oh, no! There was the wolf, sitting right where it had sat before.</p>
        <p>Hank stared at the wolf. The wolf stared right back at him. Hank was staring into the eyes of a hunter. He knew, like all creatures, the wolf needed to eat. Hank’s dad had said wolves play their part in the environment by eating deer, elk, rabbits, and other animals. But maybe, like the hungry mice that were frisking about Hank’s feet, wolves go for any food they can find.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, the wolf sprang! Hank ducked, expecting to hear the window glass shattering above him. Instead, he heard a muffled snuffling along the ground outside. The wolf wanted a way in! Hank shuddered. His heart pounded. If only Dad were here!</p>
        <p>Now came a scratching sound—the sound of pawing at the cabin walls. And then, over the hammering of his heart, Hank heard a high-pitched, tiny . . . SQUEAK!</p>
        <p>Squeak? Holding his breath, Hank raised his head to see. The wolf was below the window, holding on to a small something. Then it lay in the grass and gulped down its prize—a mouse!</p>
        <p>The wolf stood up to pounce, stiff-legged, on another. Hank’s breath rushed out. The wolf was hungry all right. But just for the kind of food it should eat, as Dad had said.</p>
        <p>* * *</p>
        <p>As the wolf pounced again, Hank opened the logbook. He began to write, neatly and carefully, every detail of his evening with the wolf. The story would be waiting for Dad when he returned in the morning—long after the smart, shy wolf had moved on in search of bigger animals to eat.</p>

        <p><strong>The Wolf at My Window</strong><br><em>by Diane L. Burns<br>
drawing by Sal Catalano</em><br><br>
Wolf! Hank thought. The boy stared out the cabin window at the lone creature. It was sitting a stone’s throw away in the moonlight. The wolf howled; Hank shivered. For the first time, he felt truly alone in these Idaho mountains.</p>
        <p>It had felt so good to be allowed to come along with Dad. Dad was a scientist who studied wild animals. Together, Hank and Dad had followed the tracks of mountain sheep, goats, and cougars. Through binoculars, they’d studied coyotes and mule deer. And they’d carefully recorded all the information in Dad’s logbook every night in their tent. Dad planned to share the information with other wildlife scientists.</p>
        <p>Then, two days ago, they had moved into an empty cabin. Here, Dad would write a report about what he had found. But they discovered that dozens and dozens of mice had taken over the cabin. The little rodents scurried in and out through lots of tiny holes in the walls… Worst of all, the mice had gotten into the supplies of dried food and ruined almost everything.</p>
        <p>Now, because most of the food was gone, Dad had left overnight to get new supplies from town. Hank had insisted on staying behind.</p>
        <p>* * *</p>
        <p>The Wolf. Its howl sounded again. Hank opened the logbook to write about it, but his hand shook. Dad had never mentioned having any trouble with wolves. But Hank’s friend Jill had once told him of a shopkeeper in Montana who’d faced a whole pack of wolves during a hard winter long ago. He’d been alone in his cabin, Jill had said.</p>
        <p>Like I am now, Hank thought with a nervous gulp. The wolves had chewed right through a solid door, Jill had said, to get a smoked ham hanging from the ceiling.</p>
        <p>But . . . Hank took a deep breath and forced down his fright. How could such a story be true? Dad had told him many times that wolves were smart but shy, staying many miles away from people. The big, bad wolf was just a fairy tale, Hank thought. A 13-year-old boy was too old for such things.</p>
        <p>Hank closed the logbook and put it on the table. Quickly he looked around for something he could use as a weapon—just in case. He grabbed a poker from the fireplace, went to the door, and took a deep breath. Then he opened the door, waved the poker, and yelled with all his might: “Go away, wolf! Go away!”</p>
        <p>Startled, the wolf sprang up—and started trotting away. Hank closed the door and leaned back with a gasp. When he’d caught his breath, he turned back to the window. Oh, no! There was the wolf, sitting right where it had sat before.</p>
        <p>Hank stared at the wolf. The wolf stared right back at him. Hank was staring into the eyes of a hunter. He knew, like all creatures, the wolf needed to eat. Hank’s dad had said wolves play their part in the environment by eating deer, elk, rabbits, and other animals. But maybe, like the hungry mice that were frisking about Hank’s feet, wolves go for any food they can find.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, the wolf sprang! Hank ducked, expecting to hear the window glass shattering above him. Instead, he heard a muffled snuffling along the ground outside. The wolf wanted a way in! Hank shuddered. His heart pounded. If only Dad were here!</p>
        <p>Now came a scratching sound—the sound of pawing at the cabin walls. And then, over the hammering of his heart, Hank heard a high-pitched, tiny . . . SQUEAK!</p>
        <p>Squeak? Holding his breath, Hank raised his head to see. The wolf was below the window, holding on to a small something. Then it lay in the grass and gulped down its prize—a mouse!</p>
        <p>The wolf stood up to pounce, stiff-legged, on another. Hank’s breath rushed out. The wolf was hungry all right. But just for the kind of food it should eat, as Dad had said.</p>
        <p>* * *</p>
        <p>As the wolf pounced again, Hank opened the logbook. He began to write, neatly and carefully, every detail of his evening with the wolf. The story would be waiting for Dad when he returned in the morning—long after the smart, shy wolf had moved on in search of bigger animals to eat.</p>

        <p><strong>The Wolf at My Window</strong><br><em>by Diane L. Burns<br>
drawing by Sal Catalano</em><br><br>
Wolf! Hank thought. The boy stared out the cabin window at the lone creature. It was sitting a stone’s throw away in the moonlight. The wolf howled; Hank shivered. For the first time, he felt truly alone in these Idaho mountains.</p>
        <p>It had felt so good to be allowed to come along with Dad. Dad was a scientist who studied wild animals. Together, Hank and Dad had followed the tracks of mountain sheep, goats, and cougars. Through binoculars, they’d studied coyotes and mule deer. And they’d carefully recorded all the information in Dad’s logbook every night in their tent. Dad planned to share the information with other wildlife scientists.</p>
        <p>Then, two days ago, they had moved into an empty cabin. Here, Dad would write a report about what he had found. But they discovered that dozens and dozens of mice had taken over the cabin. The little rodents scurried in and out through lots of tiny holes in the walls… Worst of all, the mice had gotten into the supplies of dried food and ruined almost everything.</p>
        <p>Now, because most of the food was gone, Dad had left overnight to get new supplies from town. Hank had insisted on staying behind.</p>
        <p>* * *</p>
        <p>The Wolf. Its howl sounded again. Hank opened the logbook to write about it, but his hand shook. Dad had never mentioned having any trouble with wolves. But Hank’s friend Jill had once told him of a shopkeeper in Montana who’d faced a whole pack of wolves during a hard winter long ago. He’d been alone in his cabin, Jill had said.</p>
        <p>Like I am now, Hank thought with a nervous gulp. The wolves had chewed right through a solid door, Jill had said, to get a smoked ham hanging from the ceiling.</p>
        <p>But . . . Hank took a deep breath and forced down his fright. How could such a story be true? Dad had told him many times that wolves were smart but shy, staying many miles away from people. The big, bad wolf was just a fairy tale, Hank thought. A 13-year-old boy was too old for such things.</p>
        <p>Hank closed the logbook and put it on the table. Quickly he looked around for something he could use as a weapon—just in case. He grabbed a poker from the fireplace, went to the door, and took a deep breath. Then he opened the door, waved the poker, and yelled with all his might: “Go away, wolf! Go away!”</p>
        <p>Startled, the wolf sprang up—and started trotting away. Hank closed the door and leaned back with a gasp. When he’d caught his breath, he turned back to the window. Oh, no! There was the wolf, sitting right where it had sat before.</p>
        <p>Hank stared at the wolf. The wolf stared right back at him. Hank was staring into the eyes of a hunter. He knew, like all creatures, the wolf needed to eat. Hank’s dad had said wolves play their part in the environment by eating deer, elk, rabbits, and other animals. But maybe, like the hungry mice that were frisking about Hank’s feet, wolves go for any food they can find.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, the wolf sprang! Hank ducked, expecting to hear the window glass shattering above him. Instead, he heard a muffled snuffling along the ground outside. The wolf wanted a way in! Hank shuddered. His heart pounded. If only Dad were here!</p>
        <p>Now came a scratching sound—the sound of pawing at the cabin walls. And then, over the hammering of his heart, Hank heard a high-pitched, tiny . . . SQUEAK!</p>
        <p>Squeak? Holding his breath, Hank raised his head to see. The wolf was below the window, holding on to a small something. Then it lay in the grass and gulped down its prize—a mouse!</p>
        <p>The wolf stood up to pounce, stiff-legged, on another. Hank’s breath rushed out. The wolf was hungry all right. But just for the kind of food it should eat, as Dad had said.</p>
        <p>* * *</p>
        <p>As the wolf pounced again, Hank opened the logbook. He began to write, neatly and carefully, every detail of his evening with the wolf. The story would be waiting for Dad when he returned in the morning—long after the smart, shy wolf had moved on in search of bigger animals to eat.</p>

        <p><strong>The Beagle Brigade</strong><br><em>by Kathiann M. Kowalski</em><br><br>
Return to the United States from a trip abroad, and your luggage will get inspected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Beagle Brigade. Working with human canine officer partners, the beagles sniff out potential threats to American agriculture.</p>
        <p>An orange or apple, for example, might harbor a Mediterranean fruit fly. Ham could carry a disease such as hog cholera. These and other pests could devastate farmers’ crops and livestock. “Once we introduce something that is not part of the environment, there may not be any controls for it in the environment,” notes USDA’s Lisa Davis at the National Dog Detector Training Center in Orlando, Florida. “The best thing for us to do is to prevent it from coming across the border and becoming established.”</p>
        <p>When a beagle sniffs specific food odors, it signals its partner by sitting. The human officer then investigates. When the dog is right—which happens 90 percent of the time—it gets an edible treat.</p>
        <p>“The dog is not out there working,” explains Davis. “It’s out there playing. It’s a game to the dog.” The handlers give the beagles plenty of food and loving. They make sure they get first-class medical attention, too. When the dogs finally retire after 9 to 11 years, the USDA finds caring homes for them. It’s a dog’s life indeed!</p>
        <p>Their people partners work and study somewhat harder. As specialized quarantine officers, most hold degrees in the biological sciences or related sciences.</p>
        <p>How well does the Beagle Brigade do its job? “On the average,” notes Davis, “each year our 54 teams intercept around 75,000 prohibited, restricted items.” Since even one infested item could cause widespread destruction, that’s a great result for America’s agricultural environment.

        <p><strong>The Beagle Brigade</strong><br><em>by Kathiann M. Kowalski</em><br><br>
Return to the United States from a trip abroad, and your luggage will get inspected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Beagle Brigade. Working with human canine officer partners, the beagles sniff out potential threats to American agriculture.</p>
        <p>An orange or apple, for example, might harbor a Mediterranean fruit fly. Ham could carry a disease such as hog cholera. These and other pests could devastate farmers’ crops and livestock. “Once we introduce something that is not part of the environment, there may not be any controls for it in the environment,” notes USDA’s Lisa Davis at the National Dog Detector Training Center in Orlando, Florida. “The best thing for us to do is to prevent it from coming across the border and becoming established.”</p>
        <p>When a beagle sniffs specific food odors, it signals its partner by sitting. The human officer then investigates. When the dog is right—which happens 90 percent of the time—it gets an edible treat.</p>
        <p>“The dog is not out there working,” explains Davis. “It’s out there playing. It’s a game to the dog.” The handlers give the beagles plenty of food and loving. They make sure they get first-class medical attention, too. When the dogs finally retire after 9 to 11 years, the USDA finds caring homes for them. It’s a dog’s life indeed!</p>
        <p>Their people partners work and study somewhat harder. As specialized quarantine officers, most hold degrees in the biological sciences or related sciences.</p>
        <p>How well does the Beagle Brigade do its job? “On the average,” notes Davis, “each year our 54 teams intercept around 75,000 prohibited, restricted items.” Since even one infested item could cause widespread destruction, that’s a great result for America’s agricultural environment. Let’s hear it for Snoopy!</p>

They make sure they get first-class medical attention, too. When the dogs finally retire after 9 to 11 years, the USDA finds caring homes for them. It’s a dog’s life indeed!</p>
        <p>Their people partners work and study somewhat harder. As specialized quarantine officers, most hold degrees in the biological sciences or related sciences.</p>
        <p>How well does the Beagle Brigade do its job? “On the average,” notes Davis, “each year our 54 teams intercept around 75,000 prohibited, restricted items.” Since even one infested item could cause widespread destruction, that’s a great result for America’s agricultural environment. Let’s hear it for Snoopy!</p>

Well, son, I'll tell you:<br>
Life for me ain't been no crystal stair.<br>
It's had tacks in it,<br>
And splinters,<br>
And boards torn up,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br>
And places with no carpet on the floor—<br>
Bare.<br>
But all the time<br>
I'se been a-climbin' on,<br>
And reachin' landin's,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br>
And turnin' corners,"<br>
And sometimes goin' in the dark<br>
Where there ain't been no light.<br>
So, boy, don't you turn back.<br>
Don't you set down on the steps.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15<br>
'Cause you finds it's kinder hard.<br>
Don't you fall now—<br>
For I'se still goin', honey,<br>
I'se still climbin',<br>
And life for me ain't been no crystal stair.&nbsp; &nbsp;20<br>

        <p><strong>Mother to Son</strong><br><br>
Well, son, I'll tell you:<br>
Life for me ain't been no crystal stair.<br>
It's had tacks in it,<br>
And splinters,<br>
And boards torn up,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br>
And places with no carpet on the floor—<br>
Bare.<br>
But all the time<br>
I'se been a-climbin' on,<br>
And reachin' landin's,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br>
And turnin' corners,"<br>
And sometimes goin' in the dark<br>
Where there ain't been no light.<br>
So, boy, don't you turn back.<br>
Don't you set down on the steps.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15<br>
'Cause you finds it's kinder hard.<br>
Don't you fall now—<br>
For I'se still goin', honey,<br>
I'se still climbin',<br>
And life for me ain't been no crystal stair.&nbsp; &nbsp;20<br>
