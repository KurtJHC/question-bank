          <strong>ANIMAL FARM&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by George Orwell&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now, as it turned out, the Rebellion was achieved much earlier and more easily than anyone had expected. In past years Mr. Jones, although a hard master, had been a capable farmer, but of late he had fallen on evil days. He had become much disheartened after losing money in a lawsuit and had taken to drinking more than was good for him. For whole days at a time he would lounge in his Windsor chair in the kitchen, reading the newspapers and occasionally feeding Moses, the raven, on crusts of bread. His men were idle and dishonest, the fields were full of weeds, the buildings wanted roofing, the hedges were neglected, and the animals were underfed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>June came and the hay was almost ready for cutting. On June 21<sup>st</sup> (Midsummer's Eve) which was a Saturday, Mr. Jones went into Willingdon and tired himself out so much at the Red Lion that he did not come back till midday on Sunday. The men had milked the cows in the early morning and then had gone out rabbiting, without bothering to feed the animals.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When Mr. Jones got back, he immediately went to sleep on the drawing-room sofa with the<strong><span class="txt-underline">News of the World</span></strong> over his face, so that when evening came, the animals were still unfed. At last, they could stand it no longer. One of the cows broke in the door of the store-shed with her horn and all the animals began to help themselves from the bins. It was just then that Mr. Jones woke up. The next moment he and his four men were in the store-shed with whips in their hands, lashing out in all directions. This was more than the hungry animals could bear. With one accord, though nothing of the kind had been planned beforehand, they flung themselves upon their tormentors. Jones and his men suddenly found themselves being butted and kicked from all sides. The situation was quite out of their control. They had never seen animals behave like this before, and this sudden uprising of creatures whom they were used to thrashing and maltreating just as they chose, frightened them almost out of their wits. After only a moment or two they gave up trying to defend themselves and took to their heels. A minute later all five of them were in full flight down the cart-track that led to the main road, with the animals pursuing them in triumph.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mrs. Jones looked out of the bedroom window, saw what was happening, hurriedly flung a few possessions into a carpet bag, and slipped out of the farm by another way. Moses sprang off his perch and flapped after her, croaking loudly. Meanwhile the animals had chased Jones and his men out on to the road and slammed the five-barred gate behind them. And so, almost before they knew what was happening, the Rebellion had been successfully carried through: Jones was expelled, and the Manor Farm was theirs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For the first few minutes the animals could hardly believe in their good fortune. Their first act was to gallop in a body right round the boundaries of the farm, as though to make quite sure that no human being was hiding anywhere upon it; then they raced back to the farm&nbsp;buildings to wipe out the last traces of Jones's hated reign. The harness-room at the end of the stables was broken open; the bits, the nose-rings, the dog-chains, the cruel knives, were all flung down the well. The reins, the halters, the blinkers, the degrading nosebags, were thrown on to the rubbish fire which was burning in the yard. So were the whips. All the animals capered with joy when they saw the whips going up in flames. Snowball, the pig, also threw on to the fire the ribbons with which the horses' manes and tails had usually been decorated on market days.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Ribbons," he said, "should be considered as clothes, which are the mark of a human being. All animals should go naked."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When Boxer, the cart horse heard this, he fetched the small straw hat which he wore in summer to keep the flies out of his ears and flung it on to the fire with the rest.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In a very little while the animals had destroyed everything that reminded them of Mr. Jones. Napoleon, the pig, then led them back to the store-shed and served out a double ration of corn to everybody, with two biscuits for each dog. Then they sang '<span class="txt-underline"><strong>Beasts of England</strong></span>' from end to end seven times running, and after that they settled down for the night and slept as they had never slept before.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>ANIMAL FARM&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by George Orwell&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now, as it turned out, the Rebellion was achieved much earlier and more easily than anyone had expected. In past years Mr. Jones, although a hard master, had been a capable farmer, but of late he had fallen on evil days. He had become much disheartened after losing money in a lawsuit and had taken to drinking more than was good for him. For whole days at a time he would lounge in his Windsor chair in the kitchen, reading the newspapers and occasionally feeding Moses, the raven, on crusts of bread. His men were idle and dishonest, the fields were full of weeds, the buildings wanted roofing, the hedges were neglected, and the animals were underfed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>June came and the hay was almost ready for cutting. On June 21<sup>st</sup> (Midsummer's Eve) which was a Saturday, Mr. Jones went into Willingdon and tired himself out so much at the Red Lion that he did not come back till midday on Sunday. The men had milked the cows in the early morning and then had gone out rabbiting, without bothering to feed the animals.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When Mr. Jones got back, he immediately went to sleep on the drawing-room sofa with the<strong><span class="txt-underline">News of the World</span></strong> over his face, so that when evening came, the animals were still unfed. At last, they could stand it no longer. One of the cows broke in the door of the store-shed with her horn and all the animals began to help themselves from the bins. It was just then that Mr. Jones woke up. The next moment he and his four men were in the store-shed with whips in their hands, lashing out in all directions. This was more than the hungry animals could bear. With one accord, though nothing of the kind had been planned beforehand, they flung themselves upon their tormentors. Jones and his men suddenly found themselves being butted and kicked from all sides. The situation was quite out of their control. They had never seen animals behave like this before, and this sudden uprising of creatures whom they were used to thrashing and maltreating just as they chose, frightened them almost out of their wits. After only a moment or two they gave up trying to defend themselves and took to their heels. A minute later all five of them were in full flight down the cart-track that led to the main road, with the animals pursuing them in triumph.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mrs. Jones looked out of the bedroom window, saw what was happening, hurriedly flung a few possessions into a carpet bag, and slipped out of the farm by another way. Moses sprang off his perch and flapped after her, croaking loudly. Meanwhile the animals had chased Jones and his men out on to the road and slammed the five-barred gate behind them. And so, almost before they knew what was happening, the Rebellion had been successfully carried through: Jones was expelled, and the Manor Farm was theirs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For the first few minutes the animals could hardly believe in their good fortune. Their first act was to gallop in a body right round the boundaries of the farm, as though to make quite sure that no human being was hiding anywhere upon it; then they raced back to the farm&nbsp;buildings to wipe out the last traces of Jones's hated reign. The harness-room at the end of the stables was broken open; the bits, the nose-rings, the dog-chains, the cruel knives, were all flung down the well. The reins, the halters, the blinkers, the degrading nosebags, were thrown on to the rubbish fire which was burning in the yard. So were the whips. All the animals capered with joy when they saw the whips going up in flames. Snowball, the pig, also threw on to the fire the ribbons with which the horses' manes and tails had usually been decorated on market days.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Ribbons," he said, "should be considered as clothes, which are the mark of a human being. All animals should go naked."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When Boxer, the cart horse heard this, he fetched the small straw hat which he wore in summer to keep the flies out of his ears and flung it on to the fire with the rest.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In a very little while the animals had destroyed everything that reminded them of Mr. Jones. Napoleon, the pig, then led them back to the store-shed and served out a double ration of corn to everybody, with two biscuits for each dog. Then they sang '<span class="txt-underline"><strong>Beasts of England</strong></span>' from end to end seven times running, and after that they settled down for the night and slept as they had never slept before.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Now, as it turned out, the Rebellion was achieved much earlier and more easily than anyone had expected. In past years Mr. Jones, although a hard master, had been a capable farmer, but of late he had fallen on evil days. He had become much disheartened after losing money in a lawsuit and had taken to drinking more than was good for him. For whole days at a time he would lounge in his Windsor chair in the kitchen, reading the newspapers and occasionally feeding Moses, the raven, on crusts of bread. His men were idle and dishonest, the fields were full of weeds, the buildings wanted roofing, the hedges were neglected, and the animals were underfed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>June came and the hay was almost ready for cutting. On June 21<sup>st</sup> (Midsummer's Eve) which was a Saturday, Mr. Jones went into Willingdon and tired himself out so much at the Red Lion that he did not come back till midday on Sunday. The men had milked the cows in the early morning and then had gone out rabbiting, without bothering to feed the animals.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When Mr. Jones got back, he immediately went to sleep on the drawing-room sofa with the<strong><span class="txt-underline">News of the World</span></strong> over his face, so that when evening came, the animals were still unfed. At last, they could stand it no longer. One of the cows broke in the door of the store-shed with her horn and all the animals began to help themselves from the bins. It was just then that Mr. Jones woke up. The next moment he and his four men were in the store-shed with whips in their hands, lashing out in all directions. This was more than the hungry animals could bear. With one accord, though nothing of the kind had been planned beforehand, they flung themselves upon their tormentors. Jones and his men suddenly found themselves being butted and kicked from all sides. The situation was quite out of their control. They had never seen animals behave like this before, and this sudden uprising of creatures whom they were used to thrashing and maltreating just as they chose, frightened them almost out of their wits. After only a moment or two they gave up trying to defend themselves and took to their heels. A minute later all five of them were in full flight down the cart-track that led to the main road, with the animals pursuing them in triumph.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mrs. Jones looked out of the bedroom window, saw what was happening, hurriedly flung a few possessions into a carpet bag, and slipped out of the farm by another way. Moses sprang off his perch and flapped after her, croaking loudly. Meanwhile the animals had chased Jones and his men out on to the road and slammed the five-barred gate behind them. And so, almost before they knew what was happening, the Rebellion had been successfully carried through: Jones was expelled, and the Manor Farm was theirs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For the first few minutes the animals could hardly believe in their good fortune. Their first act was to gallop in a body right round the boundaries of the farm, as though to make quite sure that no human being was hiding anywhere upon it; then they raced back to the farm&nbsp;buildings to wipe out the last traces of Jones's hated reign. The harness-room at the end of the stables was broken open; the bits, the nose-rings, the dog-chains, the cruel knives, were all flung down the well. The reins, the halters, the blinkers, the degrading nosebags, were thrown on to the rubbish fire which was burning in the yard. So were the whips. All the animals capered with joy when they saw the whips going up in flames. Snowball, the pig, also threw on to the fire the ribbons with which the horses' manes and tails had usually been decorated on market days.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Ribbons," he said, "should be considered as clothes, which are the mark of a human being. All animals should go naked."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When Boxer, the cart horse heard this, he fetched the small straw hat which he wore in summer to keep the flies out of his ears and flung it on to the fire with the rest.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In a very little while the animals had destroyed everything that reminded them of Mr. Jones. Napoleon, the pig, then led them back to the store-shed and served out a double ration of corn to everybody, with two biscuits for each dog. Then they sang '<span class="txt-underline"><strong>Beasts of England</strong></span>' from end to end seven times running, and after that they settled down for the night and slept as they had never slept before.&nbsp;</p>

A minute later all five of them were in full flight down the cart-track that led to the main road, with the animals pursuing them in triumph.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mrs. Jones looked out of the bedroom window, saw what was happening, hurriedly flung a few possessions into a carpet bag, and slipped out of the farm by another way. Moses sprang off his perch and flapped after her, croaking loudly. Meanwhile the animals had chased Jones and his men out on to the road and slammed the five-barred gate behind them. And so, almost before they knew what was happening, the Rebellion had been successfully carried through: Jones was expelled, and the Manor Farm was theirs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For the first few minutes the animals could hardly believe in their good fortune. Their first act was to gallop in a body right round the boundaries of the farm, as though to make quite sure that no human being was hiding anywhere upon it; then they raced back to the farm&nbsp;buildings to wipe out the last traces of Jones's hated reign. The harness-room at the end of the stables was broken open; the bits, the nose-rings, the dog-chains, the cruel knives, were all flung down the well. The reins, the halters, the blinkers, the degrading nosebags, were thrown on to the rubbish fire which was burning in the yard. So were the whips. All the animals capered with joy when they saw the whips going up in flames. Snowball, the pig, also threw on to the fire the ribbons with which the horses' manes and tails had usually been decorated on market days.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Ribbons," he said, "should be considered as clothes, which are the mark of a human being. All animals should go naked."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When Boxer, the cart horse heard this, he fetched the small straw hat which he wore in summer to keep the flies out of his ears and flung it on to the fire with the rest.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In a very little while the animals had destroyed everything that reminded them of Mr. Jones. Napoleon, the pig, then led them back to the store-shed and served out a double ration of corn to everybody, with two biscuits for each dog. Then they sang '<span class="txt-underline"><strong>Beasts of England</strong></span>' from end to end seven times running, and after that they settled down for the night and slept as they had never slept before.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>ANIMAL FARM&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by George Orwell&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now, as it turned out, the Rebellion was achieved much earlier and more easily than anyone had expected. In past years Mr. Jones, although a hard master, had been a capable farmer, but of late he had fallen on evil days. He had become much disheartened after losing money in a lawsuit and had taken to drinking more than was good for him. For whole days at a time he would lounge in his Windsor chair in the kitchen, reading the newspapers and occasionally feeding Moses, the raven, on crusts of bread. His men were idle and dishonest, the fields were full of weeds, the buildings wanted roofing, the hedges were neglected, and the animals were underfed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>June came and the hay was almost ready for cutting. On June 21<sup>st</sup> (Midsummer's Eve) which was a Saturday, Mr. Jones went into Willingdon and tired himself out so much at the Red Lion that he did not come back till midday on Sunday. The men had milked the cows in the early morning and then had gone out rabbiting, without bothering to feed the animals.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When Mr. Jones got back, he immediately went to sleep on the drawing-room sofa with the<strong><span class="txt-underline">News of the World</span></strong> over his face, so that when evening came, the animals were still unfed. At last, they could stand it no longer. One of the cows broke in the door of the store-shed with her horn and all the animals began to help themselves from the bins. It was just then that Mr. Jones woke up. The next moment he and his four men were in the store-shed with whips in their hands, lashing out in all directions. This was more than the hungry animals could bear. With one accord, though nothing of the kind had been planned beforehand, they flung themselves upon their tormentors. Jones and his men suddenly found themselves being butted and kicked from all sides. The situation was quite out of their control. They had never seen animals behave like this before, and this sudden uprising of creatures whom they were used to thrashing and maltreating just as they chose, frightened them almost out of their wits. After only a moment or two they gave up trying to defend themselves and took to their heels. A minute later all five of them were in full flight down the cart-track that led to the main road, with the animals pursuing them in triumph.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mrs. Jones looked out of the bedroom window, saw what was happening, hurriedly flung a few possessions into a carpet bag, and slipped out of the farm by another way. Moses sprang off his perch and flapped after her, croaking loudly. Meanwhile the animals had chased Jones and his men out on to the road and slammed the five-barred gate behind them. And so, almost before they knew what was happening, the Rebellion had been successfully carried through: Jones was expelled, and the Manor Farm was theirs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For the first few minutes the animals could hardly believe in their good fortune. Their first act was to gallop in a body right round the boundaries of the farm, as though to make quite sure that no human being was hiding anywhere upon it; then they raced back to the farm&nbsp;buildings to wipe out the last traces of Jones's hated reign. The harness-room at the end of the stables was broken open; the bits, the nose-rings, the dog-chains, the cruel knives, were all flung down the well. The reins, the halters, the blinkers, the degrading nosebags, were thrown on to the rubbish fire which was burning in the yard. So were the whips. All the animals capered with joy when they saw the whips going up in flames. Snowball, the pig, also threw on to the fire the ribbons with which the horses' manes and tails had usually been decorated on market days.</p>

          <em>Read the poem below by Banjo Paterson then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Clancy of the Overflow&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I had written him a letter which I had, for want of better</p>
        <p>Knowledge, sent to where I met him down the</p>
        <p>Lachlan, years ago, He was shearing when I knew him, so I sent the letter to him,</p>
        <p>Just "<span class="txt-underline"><strong>on spec</strong></span>", addressed as follows, "Clancy, of The Overflow".&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And an answer came directed in a writing unexpected,</p>
        <p>(And I think the same was written with a thumb-nail dipped in tar)</p>
        <p>Twas his shearing mate who wrote it, and verbatim I will quote it:</p>
        <p>"Clancy's gone to Queensland droving, and we don't know where he are."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In my wild erratic fancy, visions come to me of Clancy</p>
        <p>Gone a-droving "down the Cooper" where the Western drovers go;</p>
        <p>As the stock are slowly stringing, Clancy rides behind them singing,</p>
        <p>For the drover's life has pleasures that the townsfolk never know.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And the bush has friends to meet him, and their kindly voices greet him</p>
        <p>In the murmur of the breezes and the river on its bars,</p>
        <p>And he sees the vision splendid of the sunlit plains extended,</p>
        <p>And at night the wond'rous glory of the everlasting stars.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I am sitting in my dingy little office, where a stingy</p>
        <p>Ray of sunlight struggles feebly down between the houses tall,</p>
        <p>And the foetid air and gritty of the dusty, dirty city</p>
        <p>Through the open window floating, spreads its foulness over all.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And in place of lowing cattle, I can hear the fiendish rattle</p>
        <p>Of the tramways and the buses making hurry down the street,</p>
        <p>And the language uninviting of the gutter children fighting,</p>
        <p>Comes fitfully and faintly through the ceaseless tramp of feet.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And the hurrying people daunt me, and their pallid faces haunt me</p>
        <p>As they shoulder one another in their rush and nervous haste,</p>
        <p>With their eager eyes and greedy, and their stunted forms and weedy,</p>
        <p>For townsfolk have no time to grow, they have no time to waste.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And I somehow rather fancy that I'd like to change with Clancy,</p>
        <p>Like to take a turn at droving where the seasons come and go,</p>
        <p>While he faced the round eternal of the cash-book and the journal —</p>
        <p>But I doubt he'd suit the office, Clancy, of "The Overflow".</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Clancy of the Overflow&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I had written him a letter which I had, for want of better</p>
        <p>Knowledge, sent to where I met him down the</p>
        <p>Lachlan, years ago, He was shearing when I knew him, so I sent the letter to him,</p>
        <p>Just "<span class="txt-underline"><strong>on spec</strong></span>", addressed as follows, "Clancy, of The Overflow".&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And an answer came directed in a writing unexpected,</p>
        <p>(And I think the same was written with a thumb-nail dipped in tar)</p>
        <p>Twas his shearing mate who wrote it, and verbatim I will quote it:</p>
        <p>"Clancy's gone to Queensland droving, and we don't know where he are."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In my wild erratic fancy, visions come to me of Clancy</p>
        <p>Gone a-droving "down the Cooper" where the Western drovers go;</p>
        <p>As the stock are slowly stringing, Clancy rides behind them singing,</p>
        <p>For the drover's life has pleasures that the townsfolk never know.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And the bush has friends to meet him, and their kindly voices greet him</p>
        <p>In the murmur of the breezes and the river on its bars,</p>
        <p>And he sees the vision splendid of the sunlit plains extended,</p>
        <p>And at night the wond'rous glory of the everlasting stars.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I am sitting in my dingy little office, where a stingy</p>
        <p>Ray of sunlight struggles feebly down between the houses tall,</p>
        <p>And the foetid air and gritty of the dusty, dirty city</p>
        <p>Through the open window floating, spreads its foulness over all.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And in place of lowing cattle, I can hear the fiendish rattle</p>
        <p>Of the tramways and the buses making hurry down the street,</p>
        <p>And the language uninviting of the gutter children fighting,</p>
        <p>Comes fitfully and faintly through the ceaseless tramp of feet.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And the hurrying people daunt me, and their pallid faces haunt me</p>
        <p>As they shoulder one another in their rush and nervous haste,</p>
        <p>With their eager eyes and greedy, and their stunted forms and weedy,</p>
        <p>For townsfolk have no time to grow, they have no time to waste.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And I somehow rather fancy that I'd like to change with Clancy,</p>
        <p>Like to take a turn at droving where the seasons come and go,</p>
        <p>While he faced the round eternal of the cash-book and the journal —</p>
        <p>But I doubt he'd suit the office, Clancy, of "The Overflow".</p>

          <strong>Clancy of the Overflow&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I had written him a letter which I had, for want of better</p>
        <p>Knowledge, sent to where I met him down the</p>
        <p>Lachlan, years ago, He was shearing when I knew him, so I sent the letter to him,</p>
        <p>Just "<span class="txt-underline"><strong>on spec</strong></span>", addressed as follows, "Clancy, of The Overflow".&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And an answer came directed in a writing unexpected,</p>
        <p>(And I think the same was written with a thumb-nail dipped in tar)</p>
        <p>Twas his shearing mate who wrote it, and verbatim I will quote it:</p>
        <p>"Clancy's gone to Queensland droving, and we don't know where he are."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In my wild erratic fancy, visions come to me of Clancy</p>
        <p>Gone a-droving "down the Cooper" where the Western drovers go;</p>
        <p>As the stock are slowly stringing, Clancy rides behind them singing,</p>
        <p>For the drover's life has pleasures that the townsfolk never know.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And the bush has friends to meet him, and their kindly voices greet him</p>
        <p>In the murmur of the breezes and the river on its bars,</p>
        <p>And he sees the vision splendid of the sunlit plains extended,</p>
        <p>And at night the wond'rous glory of the everlasting stars.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I am sitting in my dingy little office, where a stingy</p>
        <p>Ray of sunlight struggles feebly down between the houses tall,</p>
        <p>And the foetid air and gritty of the dusty, dirty city</p>
        <p>Through the open window floating, spreads its foulness over all.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And in place of lowing cattle, I can hear the fiendish rattle</p>
        <p>Of the tramways and the buses making hurry down the street,</p>
        <p>And the language uninviting of the gutter children fighting,</p>
        <p>Comes fitfully and faintly through the ceaseless tramp of feet.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And the hurrying people daunt me, and their pallid faces haunt me</p>
        <p>As they shoulder one another in their rush and nervous haste,</p>
        <p>With their eager eyes and greedy, and their stunted forms and weedy,</p>
        <p>For townsfolk have no time to grow, they have no time to waste.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And I somehow rather fancy that I'd like to change with Clancy,</p>
        <p>Like to take a turn at droving where the seasons come and go,</p>
        <p>While he faced the round eternal of the cash-book and the journal —</p>
        <p>But I doubt he'd suit the office, Clancy, of "The Overflow".</p>

          <em>Read the poem below by Banjo Paterson then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Clancy of the Overflow&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I had written him a letter which I had, for want of better</p>
        <p>Knowledge, sent to where I met him down the</p>
        <p>Lachlan, years ago, He was shearing when I knew him, so I sent the letter to him,</p>
        <p>Just "<span class="txt-underline"><strong>on spec</strong></span>", addressed as follows, "Clancy, of The Overflow".&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And an answer came directed in a writing unexpected,</p>
        <p>(And I think the same was written with a thumb-nail dipped in tar)</p>
        <p>Twas his shearing mate who wrote it, and verbatim I will quote it:</p>
        <p>"Clancy's gone to Queensland droving, and we don't know where he are."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In my wild erratic fancy, visions come to me of Clancy</p>
        <p>Gone a-droving "down the Cooper" where the Western drovers go;</p>
        <p>As the stock are slowly stringing, Clancy rides behind them singing,</p>
        <p>For the drover's life has pleasures that the townsfolk never know.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And the bush has friends to meet him, and their kindly voices greet him</p>
        <p>In the murmur of the breezes and the river on its bars,</p>
        <p>And he sees the vision splendid of the sunlit plains extended,</p>
        <p>And at night the wond'rous glory of the everlasting stars.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I am sitting in my dingy little office, where a stingy</p>
        <p>Ray of sunlight struggles feebly down between the houses tall,</p>
        <p>And the foetid air and gritty of the dusty, dirty city</p>
        <p>Through the open window floating, spreads its foulness over all.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And in place of lowing cattle, I can hear the fiendish rattle</p>
        <p>Of the tramways and the buses making hurry down the street,</p>
        <p>And the language uninviting of the gutter children fighting,</p>
        <p>Comes fitfully and faintly through the ceaseless tramp of feet.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And the hurrying people daunt me, and their pallid faces haunt me</p>
        <p>As they shoulder one another in their rush and nervous haste,</p>
        <p>With their eager eyes and greedy, and their stunted forms and weedy,</p>
        <p>For townsfolk have no time to grow, they have no time to waste.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And I somehow rather fancy that I'd like to change with Clancy,</p>
        <p>Like to take a turn at droving where the seasons come and go,</p>
        <p>While he faced the round eternal of the cash-book and the journal —</p>
        <p>But I doubt he'd suit the office, Clancy, of "The Overflow".</p>

          <strong>Gunpowder Plot&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Gunpowder Plot was a failed attempt to blow up England’s King James I and the Parliament on November 5, 1605. The plot was organised by Robert Catesby in an effort to end the persecution of Roman Catholics by the English government. Catesby and others hoped to replace the country’s Protestant government with Catholic leadership. Around midnight on November 4, 1605, one of the conspirators, Guy Fawkes, was arrested. <strong>15 ………. </strong>Fawkes and other men involved in the plot were tried and executed for treason. Every November 5, the British celebrate Guy Fawkes Day by burning Fawkes in effigy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At about midnight on the night of November 4-5, Sir Thomas Knyvet, a justice of the peace, found Guy Fawkes lurking in a cellar under the Parliament building.<strong> 16 ………. </strong>The search resulted in thirty-six barrels of gunpowder being found, and Fawkes was taken into custody. After being tortured, Fawkes revealed he was a participant in an English Catholic conspiracy to annihilate England’s Protestant government and replace it with Catholic leadership.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>What became known as the Gunpowder Plot was organised by Robert Catesby, an English Catholic who was out for revenge. <strong>17 ……….</strong> Guy Fawkes had converted to Catholicism. His religious zeal led him to fight in the army of Catholic Spain in the Protestant Netherlands.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Catesby and the handful of other plotters rented a cellar that extended under the House of Lords building, and Fawkes planted the gunpowder there. However, as the November 5 opening meeting of Parliament approached, Lord Monteagle (1575-1622), the brother-inlaw of one of the conspirators, received an anonymous letter. <strong>18 ……….</strong> Monteagle alerted the government hours before the attack was to have taken place. Fawkes and the explosives were found. By torturing Fawkes, King James’ government learned the identities of his co-conspirators. During the next few weeks, English authorities killed or captured all the plotters and put the survivors on trial. Fawkes and the other surviving chief conspirators were sentenced to be hanged in London, but Fawkes jumped from a ladder while climbing to the gallows and died.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In 1606, Parliament established November 5 as a day of public thanksgiving. Guy Fawkes Night is also referred to as Guy Fawkes Day and Bonfire Night. <strong>19 ……….</strong> As dusk falls, villagers and city dwellers across Britain light bonfires, set off fireworks and burn effigies of Fawkes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Today, Guy Fawkes Day is celebrated in the United Kingdom, and in a number of countries that were formerly part of the British Empire, with parades, fireworks, bonfires, and food. Straw effigies of Fawkes are tossed on the bonfire. <strong>20 ………. </strong>But traditionally, children carried these effigies, called “Guys”, through the streets in the days leading up to Guy Fawkes Day, and asked passers-by for “a penny for the guy,” often reciting rhymes associated with the occasion, the best known of which dates from the 18th century:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Remember, remember; The fifth of November; Gunpowder treason and plot</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;We see no reason; Why Gunpowder treason; Should ever be forgot……&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Fireworks, a major component of most Guy Fawkes Day celebrations, represent the explosives that were never used by the plotters. Guards perform an annual search of the Parliament building to check for potential arsonists, although it is more ceremonial than serious.</p>

          <strong>Gunpowder Plot&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Gunpowder Plot was a failed attempt to blow up England’s King James I and the Parliament on November 5, 1605. The plot was organised by Robert Catesby in an effort to end the persecution of Roman Catholics by the English government. Catesby and others hoped to replace the country’s Protestant government with Catholic leadership. Around midnight on November 4, 1605, one of the conspirators, Guy Fawkes, was arrested. <strong>15 ………. </strong>Fawkes and other men involved in the plot were tried and executed for treason. Every November 5, the British celebrate Guy Fawkes Day by burning Fawkes in effigy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At about midnight on the night of November 4-5, Sir Thomas Knyvet, a justice of the peace, found Guy Fawkes lurking in a cellar under the Parliament building.<strong> 16 ………. </strong>The search resulted in thirty-six barrels of gunpowder being found, and Fawkes was taken into custody. After being tortured, Fawkes revealed he was a participant in an English Catholic conspiracy to annihilate England’s Protestant government and replace it with Catholic leadership.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>What became known as the Gunpowder Plot was organised by Robert Catesby, an English Catholic who was out for revenge. <strong>17 ……….</strong> Guy Fawkes had converted to Catholicism. His religious zeal led him to fight in the army of Catholic Spain in the Protestant Netherlands.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Catesby and the handful of other plotters rented a cellar that extended under the House of Lords building, and Fawkes planted the gunpowder there. However, as the November 5 opening meeting of Parliament approached, Lord Monteagle (1575-1622), the brother-inlaw of one of the conspirators, received an anonymous letter. <strong>18 ……….</strong> Monteagle alerted the government hours before the attack was to have taken place. Fawkes and the explosives were found. By torturing Fawkes, King James’ government learned the identities of his co-conspirators. During the next few weeks, English authorities killed or captured all the plotters and put the survivors on trial. Fawkes and the other surviving chief conspirators were sentenced to be hanged in London, but Fawkes jumped from a ladder while climbing to the gallows and died.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In 1606, Parliament established November 5 as a day of public thanksgiving. Guy Fawkes Night is also referred to as Guy Fawkes Day and Bonfire Night. <strong>19 ……….</strong> As dusk falls, villagers and city dwellers across Britain light bonfires, set off fireworks and burn effigies of Fawkes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Today, Guy Fawkes Day is celebrated in the United Kingdom, and in a number of countries that were formerly part of the British Empire, with parades, fireworks, bonfires, and food. Straw effigies of Fawkes are tossed on the bonfire. <strong>20 ………. </strong>But traditionally, children carried these effigies, called “Guys”, through the streets in the days leading up to Guy Fawkes Day, and asked passers-by for “a penny for the guy,” often reciting rhymes associated with the occasion, the best known of which dates from the 18th century:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Remember, remember; The fifth of November; Gunpowder treason and plot</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;We see no reason; Why Gunpowder treason; Should ever be forgot……&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Fireworks, a major component of most Guy Fawkes Day celebrations, represent the explosives that were never used by the plotters. Guards perform an annual search of the Parliament building to check for potential arsonists, although it is more ceremonial than serious.</p>

          <strong>Gunpowder Plot&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Gunpowder Plot was a failed attempt to blow up England’s King James I and the Parliament on November 5, 1605. The plot was organised by Robert Catesby in an effort to end the persecution of Roman Catholics by the English government. Catesby and others hoped to replace the country’s Protestant government with Catholic leadership. Around midnight on November 4, 1605, one of the conspirators, Guy Fawkes, was arrested. <strong>15 ………. </strong>Fawkes and other men involved in the plot were tried and executed for treason. Every November 5, the British celebrate Guy Fawkes Day by burning Fawkes in effigy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At about midnight on the night of November 4-5, Sir Thomas Knyvet, a justice of the peace, found Guy Fawkes lurking in a cellar under the Parliament building.<strong> 16 ………. </strong>The search resulted in thirty-six barrels of gunpowder being found, and Fawkes was taken into custody. After being tortured, Fawkes revealed he was a participant in an English Catholic conspiracy to annihilate England’s Protestant government and replace it with Catholic leadership.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>What became known as the Gunpowder Plot was organised by Robert Catesby, an English Catholic who was out for revenge. <strong>17 ……….</strong> Guy Fawkes had converted to Catholicism. His religious zeal led him to fight in the army of Catholic Spain in the Protestant Netherlands.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Catesby and the handful of other plotters rented a cellar that extended under the House of Lords building, and Fawkes planted the gunpowder there. However, as the November 5 opening meeting of Parliament approached, Lord Monteagle (1575-1622), the brother-inlaw of one of the conspirators, received an anonymous letter. <strong>18 ……….</strong> Monteagle alerted the government hours before the attack was to have taken place. Fawkes and the explosives were found. By torturing Fawkes, King James’ government learned the identities of his co-conspirators. During the next few weeks, English authorities killed or captured all the plotters and put the survivors on trial. Fawkes and the other surviving chief conspirators were sentenced to be hanged in London, but Fawkes jumped from a ladder while climbing to the gallows and died.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In 1606, Parliament established November 5 as a day of public thanksgiving. Guy Fawkes Night is also referred to as Guy Fawkes Day and Bonfire Night. <strong>19 ……….</strong> As dusk falls, villagers and city dwellers across Britain light bonfires, set off fireworks and burn effigies of Fawkes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Today, Guy Fawkes Day is celebrated in the United Kingdom, and in a number of countries that were formerly part of the British Empire, with parades, fireworks, bonfires, and food. Straw effigies of Fawkes are tossed on the bonfire. <strong>20 ………. </strong>But traditionally, children carried these effigies, called “Guys”, through the streets in the days leading up to Guy Fawkes Day, and asked passers-by for “a penny for the guy,” often reciting rhymes associated with the occasion, the best known of which dates from the 18th century:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Remember, remember; The fifth of November; Gunpowder treason and plot</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;We see no reason; Why Gunpowder treason; Should ever be forgot……&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Fireworks, a major component of most Guy Fawkes Day celebrations, represent the explosives that were never used by the plotters. Guards perform an annual search of the Parliament building to check for potential arsonists, although it is more ceremonial than serious.</p>

          <strong>Gunpowder Plot&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Gunpowder Plot was a failed attempt to blow up England’s King James I and the Parliament on November 5, 1605. The plot was organised by Robert Catesby in an effort to end the persecution of Roman Catholics by the English government. Catesby and others hoped to replace the country’s Protestant government with Catholic leadership. Around midnight on November 4, 1605, one of the conspirators, Guy Fawkes, was arrested. <strong>15 ………. </strong>Fawkes and other men involved in the plot were tried and executed for treason. Every November 5, the British celebrate Guy Fawkes Day by burning Fawkes in effigy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At about midnight on the night of November 4-5, Sir Thomas Knyvet, a justice of the peace, found Guy Fawkes lurking in a cellar under the Parliament building.<strong> 16 ………. </strong>The search resulted in thirty-six barrels of gunpowder being found, and Fawkes was taken into custody. After being tortured, Fawkes revealed he was a participant in an English Catholic conspiracy to annihilate England’s Protestant government and replace it with Catholic leadership.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>What became known as the Gunpowder Plot was organised by Robert Catesby, an English Catholic who was out for revenge. <strong>17 ……….</strong> Guy Fawkes had converted to Catholicism. His religious zeal led him to fight in the army of Catholic Spain in the Protestant Netherlands.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Catesby and the handful of other plotters rented a cellar that extended under the House of Lords building, and Fawkes planted the gunpowder there. However, as the November 5 opening meeting of Parliament approached, Lord Monteagle (1575-1622), the brother-inlaw of one of the conspirators, received an anonymous letter. <strong>18 ……….</strong> Monteagle alerted the government hours before the attack was to have taken place. Fawkes and the explosives were found. By torturing Fawkes, King James’ government learned the identities of his co-conspirators. During the next few weeks, English authorities killed or captured all the plotters and put the survivors on trial. Fawkes and the other surviving chief conspirators were sentenced to be hanged in London, but Fawkes jumped from a ladder while climbing to the gallows and died.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In 1606, Parliament established November 5 as a day of public thanksgiving. Guy Fawkes Night is also referred to as Guy Fawkes Day and Bonfire Night. <strong>19 ……….</strong> As dusk falls, villagers and city dwellers across Britain light bonfires, set off fireworks and burn effigies of Fawkes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Today, Guy Fawkes Day is celebrated in the United Kingdom, and in a number of countries that were formerly part of the British Empire, with parades, fireworks, bonfires, and food. Straw effigies of Fawkes are tossed on the bonfire. <strong>20 ………. </strong>But traditionally, children carried these effigies, called “Guys”, through the streets in the days leading up to Guy Fawkes Day, and asked passers-by for “a penny for the guy,” often reciting rhymes associated with the occasion, the best known of which dates from the 18th century:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Remember, remember; The fifth of November; Gunpowder treason and plot</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;We see no reason; Why Gunpowder treason; Should ever be forgot……&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Fireworks, a major component of most Guy Fawkes Day celebrations, represent the explosives that were never used by the plotters. Guards perform an annual search of the Parliament building to check for potential arsonists, although it is more ceremonial than serious.</p>

If you’re anything like me patience is something that doesn’t come easily: whether it be having to stand in endless queues; trying to get hold of someone only to be put on hold having gone through endless options; waiting for your concoctions to cook properly when you’re ‘starving’ (just recently I was so impatient for some pasta to cook that I ended up serving it semi-raw; which would have been delicious had I waited for a whole two more minutes).&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The list is endless… Of course, we are all becoming conditioned to live in the fast lane, with the comparative luxury of things happening quickly and immediately. The monumental technological advances of the last 10 years alone enable us to communicate, book, organise, shop, email, bank, socially connect, and show the world the evidence of all our endeavours at the speed of lightning!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
What is more serious is, having established a major goal in life, to subsequently have to undergo a never-ending WAITING GAME for it to happen – during which time it seems there is no choice but to endure delay after an obstacle or new challenge. But in the majority of situations impatience achieves nothing, apart from making us feel irritated, annoyed, jumpy, unfocused… and certainly does absolutely nothing to hurry things up!<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Once there were two companies who were competitors to each other in selling toothpaste and toothbrushes. After few years, they realised the need for toothbrushes for kids. Both the companies were aware that the first company to come out with the product would have the higher chance of dominating the market.<br>
<br>
The first company, instead of doing any research, took the logical approach. Adults have bigger hands and need long and thick toothbrushes, but kids have smaller hands and need smaller, thinner toothbrushes. Without a second thought, they designed and produced a kid’s toothbrush in a few weeks and launched it in the market.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The second company, however, did extensive research. They went to hundreds of kids and observed the way they held the toothbrush and brushed their teeth. The info they received also included feedback on what kids wanted. The second company decided they needed a toothbrush similar to adults in terms of size but with some grooves, because kids, instead of holding the toothbrush in their fingers like adults, clung to the toothbrush.<br>
<br>
So instead of making a small toothbrush like the first company, they went with a bigger toothbrush which helps the child to brush effectively. In addition, they also added more colours and cartoon characters to the toothbrush to make it attractive to the kids. Soon they launched the toothbrush on the market and sold a record number of toothbrushes, and they started to dominate the market.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
So, how do you learn to be more patient? When establishing a new goal in life, decide whether or not you’re in it for the long-term. Be realistic and prepare yourself for possible delays in the process. Accept that at times you may have to take a few steps back to find a new path, so to speak. Try as much as possible to live in and enjoy the present moment rather than worrying about what needs to happen in the future.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
If you’re struggling with a new task or skill, leave it and come back to it a bit later on, with fresh eyes. Be tolerant, not just with others but with yourself. The person who suffers most from your own impatience is you!&nbsp;<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Robert the Bruce was crowned King of Scotland in 1306 and eventually led Scotland to victory in the First War of Scottish Independence against the English. The king was the one who won Scotland’s independence — it’s no wonder he lives on in legend as a national hero.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But things weren’t always so sunny for King Robert at first, and that’s where the spider comes into the story. After the English had repeatedly defeated his armies, Robert was forced into hiding. Legend has it that when Robert’s spirits were broken, he took refuge in a cave.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Sitting in the cave, he noticed a small spider attempting to weave a web. The spider tried and failed over and over. Each time the spider fell, it climbed back up to try again. Finally, the spider’s silk took hold, and the spider managed to spin a web.<br>
<br>
Robert the Bruce saw himself reflected in the spider’s struggle. After watching the spider finally succeed, Robert found the inspiration to return and fight the English, believing patience and determination would win in the end.<br>
<br>
He was finally victorious against the King of England in the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. This triumph ultimately turned the tides towards later winning the independence of Scotland in 1328.<br>

The monumental technological advances of the last 10 years alone enable us to communicate, book, organise, shop, email, bank, socially connect, and show the world the evidence of all our endeavours at the speed of lightning!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
What is more serious is, having established a major goal in life, to subsequently have to undergo a never-ending WAITING GAME for it to happen – during which time it seems there is no choice but to endure delay after an obstacle or new challenge.

Once there were two companies who were competitors to each other in selling toothpaste and toothbrushes. After few years, they realised the need for toothbrushes for kids. Both the companies were aware that the first company to come out with the product would have the higher chance of dominating the market.<br>
<br>
The first company, instead of doing any research, took the logical approach. Adults have bigger hands and need long and thick toothbrushes, but kids have smaller hands and need smaller, thinner toothbrushes. Without a second thought, they designed and produced a kid’s toothbrush in a few weeks and launched it in the market.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The second company, however, did extensive research. They went to hundreds of kids and observed the way they held the toothbrush and brushed their teeth. The info they received also included feedback on what kids wanted. The second company decided they needed a toothbrush similar to adults in terms of size but with some grooves, because kids, instead of holding the toothbrush in their fingers like adults, clung to the toothbrush.<br>
<br>
So instead of making a small toothbrush like the first company, they went with a bigger toothbrush which helps the child to brush effectively. In addition, they also added more colours and cartoon characters to the toothbrush to make it attractive to the kids. Soon they launched the toothbrush on the market and sold a record number of toothbrushes, and they started to dominate the market.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
So, how do you learn to be more patient? When establishing a new goal in life, decide whether or not you’re in it for the long-term. Be realistic and prepare yourself for possible delays in the process. Accept that at times you may have to take a few steps back to find a new path, so to speak. Try as much as possible to live in and enjoy the present moment rather than worrying about what needs to happen in the future.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
If you’re struggling with a new task or skill, leave it and come back to it a bit later on, with fresh eyes. Be tolerant, not just with others but with yourself. The person who suffers most from your own impatience is you!&nbsp;<br>

Robert the Bruce was crowned King of Scotland in 1306 and eventually led Scotland to victory in the First War of Scottish Independence against the English. The king was the one who won Scotland’s independence — it’s no wonder he lives on in legend as a national hero.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But things weren’t always so sunny for King Robert at first, and that’s where the spider comes into the story. After the English had repeatedly defeated his armies, Robert was forced into hiding. Legend has it that when Robert’s spirits were broken, he took refuge in a cave.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Sitting in the cave, he noticed a small spider attempting to weave a web. The spider tried and failed over and over. Each time the spider fell, it climbed back up to try again. Finally, the spider’s silk took hold, and the spider managed to spin a web.<br>
<br>
Robert the Bruce saw himself reflected in the spider’s struggle. After watching the spider finally succeed, Robert found the inspiration to return and fight the English, believing patience and determination would win in the end.<br>
<br>
He was finally victorious against the King of England in the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. This triumph ultimately turned the tides towards later winning the independence of Scotland in 1328.<br>

In addition, they also added more colours and cartoon characters to the toothbrush to make it attractive to the kids. Soon they launched the toothbrush on the market and sold a record number of toothbrushes, and they started to dominate the market.&nbsp;<br>

So, how do you learn to be more patient? When establishing a new goal in life, decide whether or not you’re in it for the long-term. Be realistic and prepare yourself for possible delays in the process. Accept that at times you may have to take a few steps back to find a new path, so to speak. Try as much as possible to live in and enjoy the present moment rather than worrying about what needs to happen in the future.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
If you’re struggling with a new task or skill, leave it and come back to it a bit later on, with fresh eyes. Be tolerant, not just with others but with yourself. The person who suffers most from your own impatience is you!&nbsp;<br>

Robert the Bruce was crowned King of Scotland in 1306 and eventually led Scotland to victory in the First War of Scottish Independence against the English. The king was the one who won Scotland’s independence — it’s no wonder he lives on in legend as a national hero.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But things weren’t always so sunny for King Robert at first, and that’s where the spider comes into the story. After the English had repeatedly defeated his armies, Robert was forced into hiding. Legend has it that when Robert’s spirits were broken, he took refuge in a cave.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Sitting in the cave, he noticed a small spider attempting to weave a web. The spider tried and failed over and over. Each time the spider fell, it climbed back up to try again. Finally, the spider’s silk took hold, and the spider managed to spin a web.<br>
<br>
Robert the Bruce saw himself reflected in the spider’s struggle. After watching the spider finally succeed, Robert found the inspiration to return and fight the English, believing patience and determination would win in the end.<br>
<br>
He was finally victorious against the King of England in the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. This triumph ultimately turned the tides towards later winning the independence of Scotland in 1328.​<br>

If you’re anything like me patience is something that doesn’t come easily: whether it be having to stand in endless queues; trying to get hold of someone only to be put on hold having gone through endless options; waiting for your concoctions to cook properly when you’re ‘starving’ (just recently I was so impatient for some pasta to cook that I ended up serving it semi-raw; which would have been delicious had I waited for a whole two more minutes).&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The list is endless… Of course, we are all becoming conditioned to live in the fast lane, with the comparative luxury of things happening quickly and immediately. The monumental technological advances of the last 10 years alone enable us to communicate, book, organise, shop, email, bank, socially connect, and show the world the evidence of all our endeavours at the speed of lightning!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
What is more serious is, having established a major goal in life, to subsequently have to undergo a never-ending WAITING GAME for it to happen – during which time it seems there is no choice but to endure delay after an obstacle or new challenge. But in the majority of situations impatience achieves nothing, apart from making us feel irritated, annoyed, jumpy, unfocused… and certainly does absolutely nothing to hurry things up!<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Once there were two companies who were competitors to each other in selling toothpaste and toothbrushes. After few years, they realised the need for toothbrushes for kids. Both the companies were aware that the first company to come out with the product would have the higher chance of dominating the market.<br>
<br>
The first company, instead of doing any research, took the logical approach. Adults have bigger hands and need long and thick toothbrushes, but kids have smaller hands and need smaller, thinner toothbrushes. Without a second thought, they designed and produced a kid’s toothbrush in a few weeks and launched it in the market.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The second company, however, did extensive research. They went to hundreds of kids and observed the way they held the toothbrush and brushed their teeth. The info they received also included feedback on what kids wanted. The second company decided they needed a toothbrush similar to adults in terms of size but with some grooves, because kids, instead of holding the toothbrush in their fingers like adults, clung to the toothbrush.<br>
<br>
So instead of making a small toothbrush like the first company, they went with a bigger toothbrush which helps the child to brush effectively. In addition, they also added more colours and cartoon characters to the toothbrush to make it attractive to the kids. Soon they launched the toothbrush on the market and sold a record number of toothbrushes, and they started to dominate the market.&nbsp;<br>
