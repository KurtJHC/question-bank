I should say that for a cab-horse I was very well off indeed; my driver was my owner, and it was his interest to treat me well and not overwork me, even had he not been so good a man as he was; but there were a great many horses which belonged to the large cab-owners, who let them out to their drivers for so much money a day. As the horses did not belong to these men the only thing they thought of was how to get their money out of them, first, to pay the master, and then to provide for their own living; and a dreadful time some of these horses had of it. Of course, I understood but little, but it was often talked over on the stand, and the governor, who was a kind-hearted man and fond of horses, would sometimes speak up if one came in very much jaded or ill-used.</p>
        <p>One day a shabby, miserable-looking driver, who went by the name of “Seedy Sam”, brought in his horse looking dreadfully beat, and the governor said:</p>
        <p>“You and your horse look more fit for the police station than for this rank.”</p>
        <p>The man flung his tattered rug over the horse, turned full round upon the Governor and said in a voice that sounded almost desperate:</p>
        <p>“If the police have any business with the matter it ought to be with the masters who charge us so much, or with the fares that are fixed so low. If a man has to pay eighteen shillings a day for the use of a cab and two horses, as many of us have to do in the season, and must make that up before we earn a penny for ourselves I say ‘tis more than hard work; nine shillings a day to get out of each horse before you begin to get your own living. You know that’s true, and if the horses don’t work we must starve, and I and my children have known what that is before now. I’ve six of ‘em, and only one earns anything; I am on the stand fourteen or sixteen hours a day, and I haven’t had a Sunday these ten or twelve weeks; you know Skinner never gives a day if he can help it, and if I don’t work hard, tell me who does! I want a warm coat and a mackintosh, but with so many to feed how can a man get it? I had to pledge my clock a week ago to pay Skinner, and I shall never see it again.”</p>
        <p>Some of the other drivers stood round nodding their heads and saying he was right. The man went on: “You that have your own horses and cabs, or drive for good masters, have a chance of getting on and a chance of doing right; I haven’t. We can’t charge more than sixpence a mile after the first, within the four-mile radius. This very morning I had to go a clear six miles and only took three shillings. I could not get a return fare, and had to come all the way back; there’s twelve miles for the horse and three shillings for me. After that I had a three-mile fare, and there were bags and boxes enough to have brought in a good many twopences if they had been put outside; but you know how people do; all that could be piled up inside on the front seat were put in and three heavy boxes went on the top.</p>
        <p>That was sixpence, and the fare one and sixpence; then I got a return for a shilling. Now that makes eighteen miles for the horse and six shillings for me; there’s three shillings still for that horse to earn and nine shillings for the afternoon horse before I touch a penny. Of course, it is not always so bad as that, but you know it often is, and I say ‘tis a mockery to tell a man that he must not overwork his horse, for when a beast is downright tired there’s nothing but the whip that will keep his legs a-going; you can’t help yourself—you must put your wife and children before the horse; the masters must look to that, we can’t. I don’t ill-use my horse for the sake of it; none of you can say I do. There’s wrong lays somewhere—never a day’s rest, never a quiet hour with the wife and children. I often feel like an old man, though I’m only forty-five. You know how quick some of the gentry are to suspect us of cheating and overcharging; why, they stand with their purses in their hands counting it over to a penny and looking at us as if we were pickpockets. I wish some of ‘em had got to sit on my box sixteen hours a day and get a living out of it and eighteen shillings beside, and that in all weathers; they would not be so uncommon particular never to give us a sixpence over or to cram all the luggage inside.</p>
        <p>Of course, some of ‘em tip us pretty handsome now and then, or else we could not live; but you can’t depend upon that.”</p>
        <p>The men who stood round much approved this speech, and one of them said, “It is desperate hard, and if a man sometimes does what is wrong it is no wonder, and if he gets a dram too much who’s to blow him up?”</p>

We can’t charge more than sixpence a mile after the first, within the four-mile radius. This very morning I had to go a clear six miles and only took three shillings. I could not get a return fare, and had to come all the way back; there’s twelve miles for the horse and three shillings for me. After that I had a three-mile fare, and there were bags and boxes enough to have brought in a good many twopences if they had been put outside; but you know how people do; all that could be piled up inside on the front seat were put in and three heavy boxes went on the top.</p>
        <p>That was sixpence, and the fare one and sixpence; then I got a return for a shilling. Now that makes eighteen miles for the horse and six shillings for me; there’s three shillings still for that horse to earn and nine shillings for the afternoon horse before I touch a penny. Of course, it is not always so bad as that, but you know it often is, and I say ‘tis a mockery to tell a man that he must not overwork his horse, for when a beast is downright tired there’s nothing but the whip that will keep his legs a-going; you can’t help yourself—you must put your wife and children before the horse; the masters must look to that, we can’t. I don’t ill-use my horse for the sake of it; none of you can say I do. There’s wrong lays somewhere—never a day’s rest, never a quiet hour with the wife and children. I often feel like an old man, though I’m only forty-five. You know how quick some of the gentry are to suspect us of cheating and overcharging; why, they stand with their purses in their hands counting it over to a penny and looking at us as if we were pickpockets. I wish some of ‘em had got to sit on my box sixteen hours a day and get a living out of it and eighteen shillings beside, and that in all weathers; they would not be so uncommon particular never to give us a sixpence over or to cram all the luggage inside.</p>
        <p>Of course, some of ‘em tip us pretty handsome now and then, or else we could not live; but you can’t depend upon that.”</p>
        <p>The men who stood round much approved this speech, and one of them said, “It is desperate hard, and if a man sometimes does what is wrong it is no wonder, and if he gets a dram too much who’s to blow him up?”</p>

I should say that for a cab-horse I was very well off indeed; my driver was my owner, and it was his interest to treat me well and not overwork me, even had he not been so good a man as he was; but there were a great many horses which belonged to the large cab-owners, who let them out to their drivers for so much money a day. As the horses did not belong to these men the only thing they thought of was how to get their money out of them, first, to pay the master, and then to provide for their own living; and a dreadful time some of these horses had of it. Of course, I understood but little, but it was often talked over on the stand, and the governor, who was a kind-hearted man and fond of horses, would sometimes speak up if one came in very much jaded or ill-used.</p>
        <p>One day a shabby, miserable-looking driver, who went by the name of “Seedy Sam”, brought in his horse looking dreadfully beat, and the governor said:</p>
        <p>“You and your horse look more fit for the police station than for this rank.”</p>
        <p>The man flung his tattered rug over the horse, turned full round upon the Governor and said in a voice that sounded almost desperate:</p>
        <p>“If the police have any business with the matter it ought to be with the masters who charge us so much, or with the fares that are fixed so low. If a man has to pay eighteen shillings a day for the use of a cab and two horses, as many of us have to do in the season, and must make that up before we earn a penny for ourselves I say ‘tis more than hard work; nine shillings a day to get out of each horse before you begin to get your own living. You know that’s true, and if the horses don’t work we must starve, and I and my children have known what that is before now. I’ve six of ‘em, and only one earns anything; I am on the stand fourteen or sixteen hours a day, and I haven’t had a Sunday these ten or twelve weeks; you know Skinner never gives a day if he can help it, and if I don’t work hard, tell me who does! I want a warm coat and a mackintosh, but with so many to feed how can a man get it? I had to pledge my clock a week ago to pay Skinner, and I shall never see it again.”</p>
        <p>Some of the other drivers stood round nodding their heads and saying he was right. The man went on: “You that have your own horses and cabs, or drive for good masters, have a chance of getting on and a chance of doing right; I haven’t. We can’t charge more than sixpence a mile after the first, within the four-mile radius. This very morning I had to go a clear six miles and only took three shillings.

        <p><em>Read the extract below then answer the questions.</em><br><br>
I should say that for a cab-horse I was very well off indeed; my driver was my owner, and it was his interest to treat me well and not overwork me, even had he not been so good a man as he was; but there were a great many horses which belonged to the large cab-owners, who let them out to their drivers for so much money a day. As the horses did not belong to these men the only thing they thought of was how to get their money out of them, first, to pay the master, and then to provide for their own living; and a dreadful time some of these horses had of it. Of course, I understood but little, but it was often talked over on the stand, and the governor, who was a kind-hearted man and fond of horses, would sometimes speak up if one came in very much jaded or ill-used.</p>
        <p>One day a shabby, miserable-looking driver, who went by the name of “Seedy Sam”, brought in his horse looking dreadfully beat, and the governor said:</p>
        <p>“You and your horse look more fit for the police station than for this rank.”</p>
        <p>The man flung his tattered rug over the horse, turned full round upon the Governor and said in a voice that sounded almost desperate:</p>
        <p>“If the police have any business with the matter it ought to be with the masters who charge us so much, or with the fares that are fixed so low. If a man has to pay eighteen shillings a day for the use of a cab and two horses, as many of us have to do in the season, and must make that up before we earn a penny for ourselves I say ‘tis more than hard work; nine shillings a day to get out of each horse before you begin to get your own living. You know that’s true, and if the horses don’t work we must starve, and I and my children have known what that is before now. I’ve six of ‘em, and only one earns anything; I am on the stand fourteen or sixteen hours a day, and I haven’t had a Sunday these ten or twelve weeks; you know Skinner never gives a day if he can help it, and if I don’t work hard, tell me who does! I want a warm coat and a mackintosh, but with so many to feed how can a man get it? I had to pledge my clock a week ago to pay Skinner, and I shall never see it again.”</p>
        <p>Some of the other drivers stood round nodding their heads and saying he was right. The man went on: “You that have your own horses and cabs, or drive for good masters, have a chance of getting on and a chance of doing right; I haven’t. We can’t charge more than sixpence a mile after the first, within the four-mile radius. This very morning I had to go a clear six miles and only took three shillings. I could not get a return fare, and had to come all the way back; there’s twelve miles for the horse and three shillings for me. After that I had a three-mile fare, and there were bags and boxes enough to have brought in a good many twopences if they had been put outside; but you know how people do; all that could be piled up inside on the front seat were put in and three heavy boxes went on the top.</p>
        <p>That was sixpence, and the fare one and sixpence; then I got a return for a shilling. Now that makes eighteen miles for the horse and six shillings for me; there’s three shillings still for that horse to earn and nine shillings for the afternoon horse before I touch a penny. Of course, it is not always so bad as that, but you know it often is, and I say ‘tis a mockery to tell a man that he must not overwork his horse, for when a beast is downright tired there’s nothing but the whip that will keep his legs a-going; you can’t help yourself—you must put your wife and children before the horse; the masters must look to that, we can’t. I don’t ill-use my horse for the sake of it; none of you can say I do. There’s wrong lays somewhere—never a day’s rest, never a quiet hour with the wife and children. I often feel like an old man, though I’m only forty-five. You know how quick some of the gentry are to suspect us of cheating and overcharging; why, they stand with their purses in their hands counting it over to a penny and looking at us as if we were pickpockets. I wish some of ‘em had got to sit on my box sixteen hours a day and get a living out of it and eighteen shillings beside, and that in all weathers; they would not be so uncommon particular never to give us a sixpence over or to cram all the luggage inside.</p>
        <p>Of course, some of ‘em tip us pretty handsome now and then, or else we could not live; but you can’t depend upon that.”</p>
        <p>The men who stood round much approved this speech, and one of them said, “It is desperate hard, and if a man sometimes does what is wrong it is no wonder, and if he gets a dram too much who’s to blow him up?”</p>

        <p><em>Read the extract below then answer the questions.</em><br><br>
I should say that for a cab-horse I was very well off indeed; my driver was my owner, and it was his interest to treat me well and not overwork me, even had he not been so good a man as he was; but there were a great many horses which belonged to the large cab-owners, who let them out to their drivers for so much money a day. As the horses did not belong to these men the only thing they thought of was how to get their money out of them, first, to pay the master, and then to provide for their own living; and a dreadful time some of these horses had of it. Of course, I understood but little, but it was often talked over on the stand, and the governor, who was a kind-hearted man and fond of horses, would sometimes speak up if one came in very much jaded or ill-used.</p>
        <p>One day a shabby, miserable-looking driver, who went by the name of “Seedy Sam”, brought in his horse looking dreadfully beat, and the governor said:</p>
        <p>“You and your horse look more fit for the police station than for this rank.”</p>
        <p>The man flung his tattered rug over the horse, turned full round upon the Governor and said in a voice that sounded almost desperate:</p>
        <p>“If the police have any business with the matter it ought to be with the masters who charge us so much, or with the fares that are fixed so low. If a man has to pay eighteen shillings a day for the use of a cab and two horses, as many of us have to do in the season, and must make that up before we earn a penny for ourselves I say ‘tis more than hard work; nine shillings a day to get out of each horse before you begin to get your own living. You know that’s true, and if the horses don’t work we must starve, and I and my children have known what that is before now. I’ve six of ‘em, and only one earns anything; I am on the stand fourteen or sixteen hours a day, and I haven’t had a Sunday these ten or twelve weeks; you know Skinner never gives a day if he can help it, and if I don’t work hard, tell me who does! I want a warm coat and a mackintosh, but with so many to feed how can a man get it? I had to pledge my clock a week ago to pay Skinner, and I shall never see it again.”</p>
        <p>Some of the other drivers stood round nodding their heads and saying he was right. The man went on: “You that have your own horses and cabs, or drive for good masters, have a chance of getting on and a chance of doing right; I haven’t. We can’t charge more than sixpence a mile after the first, within the four-mile radius. This very morning I had to go a clear six miles and only took three shillings. I could not get a return fare, and had to come all the way back; there’s twelve miles for the horse and three shillings for me. After that I had a three-mile fare, and there were bags and boxes enough to have brought in a good many twopences if they had been put outside; but you know how people do; all that could be piled up inside on the front seat were put in and three heavy boxes went on the top.</p>
        <p>That was sixpence, and the fare one and sixpence; then I got a return for a shilling. Now that makes eighteen miles for the horse and six shillings for me; there’s three shillings still for that horse to earn and nine shillings for the afternoon horse before I touch a penny. Of course, it is not always so bad as that, but you know it often is, and I say ‘tis a mockery to tell a man that he must not overwork his horse, for when a beast is downright tired there’s nothing but the whip that will keep his legs a-going; you can’t help yourself—you must put your wife and children before the horse; the masters must look to that, we can’t. I don’t ill-use my horse for the sake of it; none of you can say I do. There’s wrong lays somewhere—never a day’s rest, never a quiet hour with the wife and children. I often feel like an old man, though I’m only forty-five. You know how quick some of the gentry are to suspect us of cheating and overcharging; why, they stand with their purses in their hands counting it over to a penny and looking at us as if we were pickpockets. I wish some of ‘em had got to sit on my box sixteen hours a day and get a living out of it and eighteen shillings beside, and that in all weathers; they would not be so uncommon particular never to give us a sixpence over or to cram all the luggage inside.</p>
        <p>Of course, some of ‘em tip us pretty handsome now and then, or else we could not live; but you can’t depend upon that.”</p>
        <p>The men who stood round much approved this speech, and one of them said, “It is desperate hard, and if a man sometimes does what is wrong it is no wonder, and if he gets a dram too much who’s to blow him up?”</p>

        <p>Peonies, heavy and pink as ’80s bridesmaid dresses<br>

because I like clashing smells and the car<br>
I drove in college was named that: a pea-green<br>

        <p>Sugar snap peas, which I might as well<br>

Also: sage, mint, and thyme—the clocks<br>

        <p>Lavender for the bees and because I hate<br>
all fake lavender smells. Tomatoes to cut<br>
and place on toasted bread for BLTs, with or without<br>
the b and the l. I’d like, too, to plant<br>
the sweet alyssum that smells like honey and peace,<br>
and for it to bloom even when it’s hot,</p>
        <p>and also lilies, so I have something left<br>
to look at when the rabbits come.<br>
They always come. They are<br>
always hungry. And I think I am done<br>
protecting one sweet thing from another.<br>

          <strong>The Amazing Tunnels of Sydney Harbour</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
                  <img width="100%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766037774/eax2ztie4n6vb1shwotq.png" alt="HD_T4_L5_RS_U08_15 20">


        </p>
        <p>One of the great engineering feats of modern Australia was the construction of the Sydney Harbour Tunnel. For more than 100 years, crossing Sydney Harbour via a tunnel had been just a dream. A tunnel had been suggested as early as 1885, when it was realized that ferries were not the most efficient way to get large numbers of people, carriages and horses across the harbour. When the Sydney Harbour Bridge was built in 1932, traffic was projected at 13,000 crossings per day. <strong>(A)</strong>…………. By 1986, the same number of cars was crossing the bridge in an hour, which led the government to call for alternative traffic solutions.</p>
        <p>Proposals for both bridges and tunnels were submitted, but all were rejected as they involved the demolition of a large number of dwellings. In 1984, an engineering firm approached Transfield to study a solution that would allow a tunnel to be built without any intervention to the inhabited areas north and south of the bridge. A joint venture was then formed with Kumagai Gumi, a Japanese construction company with extensive experience in tunnel construction. In 1986, a crucial meeting took place where the clever solution was devised. <strong>(B)</strong>…………. The new road tunnel could be incorporated into the existing road network on both sides of the harbour.</p>
        <p>The consortium, comprised of Transfield and Kumagai, spent some $4 million developing the proposal as a privately financed project before the NSW State Government made a commitment. <strong>(C)</strong>…………. The decision was taken on the grounds that the consortium had invested millions of dollars in preparing the submission. The agreement was signed on June 29, 1987, and construction started in February 1988.</p>
        <p>The $750 million tunnel was officially opened on August 29, 1992, and was at the time the largest privately financed infrastructure in Australia. The technology used for its construction was very advanced. The eight concrete tube units, each 120 meters long, were built 90 kilometers south of Sydney and then towed to the harbour where they were immersed on site. This was a world-first for reinforced concrete tunnel units of such size being towed in the open sea. <strong>(D)</strong>………….&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>(E)</strong>…………. For example, a large Moreton Bay fig tree, with its roots just over the tunnel system, had to be preserved at all costs. As excavation proceeded, the tree’s root system was propped up from within the tunnel. A similar challenge was faced on the northern side, with the ventilation systems having to be connected through the existing pylons of the Harbour Bridge. At its deepest point, the tunnel is 27 meters below sea level. <strong>(F)</strong>…………. Unlike at the time of the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, when 800 houses had to be demolished, not a single dwelling was lost to make way for the Sydney Harbour Tunnel.</p>

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is broadly defined as the ability of machines to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as problem-solving, learning, and decision-making. Its advantages are evident: AI can analyse massive amounts of data quickly, support medical diagnoses, and automate tedious work. It drives self-driving cars, voice assistants, and even predictive text on smartphones. However, AI also brings challenges. Critics argue that jobs may be lost to automation, widening inequality. Others warn that reliance on algorithms can embed hidden biases, producing unfair or discriminatory outcomes. There is also concern about privacy, as AI systems can track, analyse, and predict human behaviour. While optimists envision AI helping humanity to solve global problems, sceptics fear it may undermine autonomy or even spiral beyond control. Like many technologies, AI is neither inherently good nor bad—it is how humans choose to use it that determines its impact.<br>

<br>
A well-known example of AI’s transformative power can be found in the work of DeepMind’s AlphaGo program. In 2016, AlphaGo defeated Lee Sedol, one of the world’s greatest players of the complex board game Go. This achievement stunned experts, as Go was considered far too intricate for a machine to master. The match showed how AI could develop strategies unimagined by human players, inspiring admiration and anxiety alike. While AlphaGo was built for a game, its technology suggested far broader applications—from optimising energy grids to accelerating medical research. Lee Sedol himself admitted the loss was humbling, yet also beautiful: he described the machine’s creative moves as opening “a new page” in the game’s history. AlphaGo became a symbol of AI’s potential to reshape not just industries, but also how humans think about intelligence and creativity.<br>

Today, AI sparks fierce debate in politics, workplaces, and education. Supporters argue that AI will boost productivity, provide personalised learning, and revolutionise industries. Detractors counter that it risks deepening inequality, spreading misinformation, and concentrating power in the hands of a few tech companies. In classrooms, some see AI tutors as tools to help struggling students; others worry these tools will erode critical thinking and encourage shortcuts. Governments around the world are racing to design laws that regulate AI while still encouraging innovation. The debate is often fuelled by dramatic headlines about machines “taking over,” but in reality, the issues are more subtle: who controls the data, who benefits from the profits, and who is held accountable when things go wrong. Whether AI is celebrated or feared, it is shaping the choices societies must make about fairness, opportunity, and responsibility.<br>

I remember the first time I interacted with AI on a personal level. It was during high school when I used a simple language app to help with my French homework. At first, I treated it as a novelty, laughing when it misunderstood my pronunciation. But gradually, I realised how effective it was. The app corrected my grammar, suggested new vocabulary, and even encouraged me when I got things right. For someone who lacked confidence in languages, this was transformative. My marks improved, but more importantly, my willingness to practise grew. I even began speaking French aloud at home, something I had never dared to do before. Looking back, I see that the AI tutor was not replacing my learning, but amplifying it. What had begun as a tool for convenience became a source of motivation, showing me how technology could nurture growth in unexpected ways.<br>
