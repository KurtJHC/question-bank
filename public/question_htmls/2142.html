        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>The Hubble Space Telescope</strong><br><br>
The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is the first big optical space observatory telescope. Being above the atmosphere means it can see the sky more clearly than a telescope on the ground.&nbsp;<strong>15&nbsp;</strong>………. Named after the astronomer Edwin Hubble, the Hubble Space Telescope can observe 24 hours a day. The main mirror is 94.5 inches (2.4 meters) across. The telescope can take pictures of things so far away it would be nearly impossible to see them from anywhere else.</p>
        <p>It was made by both NASA and the ESA (European Space Agency) working together. It is 600 km in space and was launched on April 24, 1990.&nbsp;<strong>16&nbsp;</strong>………. If you were going this speed on Earth, you would be able to get from New York to San Francisco in 10 minutes. This speed creates difficulty in scheduling observations.</p>
        <p>The Hubble itself is the size of a large school bus, but still small enough to fit inside the cargo bay of a Space Shuttle. It was repaired in 1993 due to problems in the picture quality. The telescope was launched in 1990 by a space shuttle. When it entered orbit, everything seemed fine.&nbsp;<strong>17</strong>&nbsp;………. When the HST took its first pictures, astronomers were happy to see the images, but they were not as sharp and as crisp as expected. Telescopes in space can take better pictures than telescopes on Earth, but for some reason, the pictures were not better than the pictures taken on Earth. They found a problem with the telescope's mirror. The mirror was not curved right.&nbsp;<strong>18&nbsp;</strong>………. Still, this was enough to cause the images to be blurred. Some said that Hubble was near-sighted.</p>
        <p>Another space shuttle was soon sent up to repair the space telescope. The repair was not easy. The astronauts had to install some small mirrors to correct the light from the big mirror. The big mirror could still be used.&nbsp;<strong>19&nbsp;</strong>………. When an astronaut opened one of the doors on Hubble to install a new camera, the door would not close. The astronauts had to think of a creative way to get around the problem. Eventually, Hubble was fixed. Repairs and servicing missions have been made to the Hubble Space Telescope five times to keep it in orbit and make it even better as technology improved. The space shuttle program was kept going longer than planned to send an extra trip up to the Hubble Space Telescope for a final fix.</p>
        <p>Early on, in 1994, Hubble stared at what was thought to be an empty area of space for ten days. It found there were actually many galaxies even there, but very faint and very far away. No other telescope could have seen that.&nbsp;<strong>20&nbsp;</strong>………. It was able to help settle the age of the universe at about 13.7 billion years. Before the Hubble, scientists only knew it was between 10 and 20 billion years old. It took the first picture of a planet outside our solar system and was able to find what type of atmosphere other planets might have.<br>
Hubble will be replaced by the James Webb Space Telescope which will be located even further from Earth. There are now other telescopes in orbit, like the Herschel Space Observatory and the Kepler Spacecraft, which was specially made for finding Earth-like planets around other stars.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>The Hubble Space Telescope</strong><br><br>
The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is the first big optical space observatory telescope. Being above the atmosphere means it can see the sky more clearly than a telescope on the ground.&nbsp;<strong>15&nbsp;</strong>………. Named after the astronomer Edwin Hubble, the Hubble Space Telescope can observe 24 hours a day. The main mirror is 94.5 inches (2.4 meters) across. The telescope can take pictures of things so far away it would be nearly impossible to see them from anywhere else.</p>
        <p>It was made by both NASA and the ESA (European Space Agency) working together. It is 600 km in space and was launched on April 24, 1990.&nbsp;<strong>16&nbsp;</strong>………. If you were going this speed on Earth, you would be able to get from New York to San Francisco in 10 minutes. This speed creates difficulty in scheduling observations.</p>
        <p>The Hubble itself is the size of a large school bus, but still small enough to fit inside the cargo bay of a Space Shuttle. It was repaired in 1993 due to problems in the picture quality. The telescope was launched in 1990 by a space shuttle. When it entered orbit, everything seemed fine.&nbsp;<strong>17&nbsp;</strong>………. When the HST took its first pictures, astronomers were happy to see the images, but they were not as sharp and as crisp as expected. Telescopes in space can take better pictures than telescopes on Earth, but for some reason, the pictures were not better than the pictures taken on Earth. They found a problem with the telescope's mirror. The mirror was not curved right.&nbsp;<strong>18&nbsp;</strong>………. Still, this was enough to cause the images to be blurred. Some said that Hubble was near-sighted.</p>
        <p>Another space shuttle was soon sent up to repair the space telescope. The repair was not easy. The astronauts had to install some small mirrors to correct the light from the big mirror. The big mirror could still be used.&nbsp;<strong>19&nbsp;</strong>………. When an astronaut opened one of the doors on Hubble to install a new camera, the door would not close. The astronauts had to think of a creative way to get around the problem. Eventually, Hubble was fixed. Repairs and servicing missions have been made to the Hubble Space Telescope five times to keep it in orbit and make it even better as technology improved. The space shuttle program was kept going longer than planned to send an extra trip up to the Hubble Space Telescope for a final fix.</p>
        <p>Early on, in 1994, Hubble stared at what was thought to be an empty area of space for ten days. It found there were actually many galaxies even there, but very faint and very far away. No other telescope could have seen that.&nbsp;<strong>20&nbsp;</strong>………. It was able to help settle the age of the universe at about 13.7 billion years. Before the Hubble, scientists only knew it was between 10 and 20 billion years old. It took the first picture of a planet outside our solar system and was able to find what type of atmosphere other planets might have.<br>
Hubble will be replaced by the James Webb Space Telescope which will be located even further from Earth. There are now other telescopes in orbit, like the Herschel Space Observatory and the Kepler Spacecraft, which was specially made for finding Earth-like planets around other stars.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>The Hubble Space Telescope</strong><br><br>
The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is the first big optical space observatory telescope. Being above the atmosphere means it can see the sky more clearly than a telescope on the ground.&nbsp;<strong>15&nbsp;</strong>………. Named after the astronomer Edwin Hubble, the Hubble Space Telescope can observe 24 hours a day. The main mirror is 94.5 inches (2.4 meters) across. The telescope can take pictures of things so far away it would be nearly impossible to see them from anywhere else.</p>
        <p>It was made by both NASA and the ESA (European Space Agency) working together. It is 600 km in space and was launched on April 24, 1990.&nbsp;<strong>16&nbsp;</strong>………. If you were going this speed on Earth, you would be able to get from New York to San Francisco in 10 minutes. This speed creates difficulty in scheduling observations.</p>
        <p>The Hubble itself is the size of a large school bus, but still small enough to fit inside the cargo bay of a Space Shuttle. It was repaired in 1993 due to problems in the picture quality. The telescope was launched in 1990 by a space shuttle. When it entered orbit, everything seemed fine.&nbsp;<strong>17&nbsp;</strong>………. When the HST took its first pictures, astronomers were happy to see the images, but they were not as sharp and as crisp as expected. Telescopes in space can take better pictures than telescopes on Earth, but for some reason, the pictures were not better than the pictures taken on Earth. They found a problem with the telescope's mirror. The mirror was not curved right.&nbsp;<strong>18&nbsp;</strong>………. Still, this was enough to cause the images to be blurred. Some said that Hubble was near-sighted.</p>
        <p>Another space shuttle was soon sent up to repair the space telescope. The repair was not easy. The astronauts had to install some small mirrors to correct the light from the big mirror. The big mirror could still be used.&nbsp;<strong>19&nbsp;</strong>………. When an astronaut opened one of the doors on Hubble to install a new camera, the door would not close. The astronauts had to think of a creative way to get around the problem. Eventually, Hubble was fixed. Repairs and servicing missions have been made to the Hubble Space Telescope five times to keep it in orbit and make it even better as technology improved. The space shuttle program was kept going longer than planned to send an extra trip up to the Hubble Space Telescope for a final fix.</p>
        <p>Early on, in 1994, Hubble stared at what was thought to be an empty area of space for ten days. It found there were actually many galaxies even there, but very faint and very far away. No other telescope could have seen that.&nbsp;<strong>20&nbsp;</strong>………. It was able to help settle the age of the universe at about 13.7 billion years. Before the Hubble, scientists only knew it was between 10 and 20 billion years old. It took the first picture of a planet outside our solar system and was able to find what type of atmosphere other planets might have.<br>
Hubble will be replaced by the James Webb Space Telescope which will be located even further from Earth. There are now other telescopes in orbit, like the Herschel Space Observatory and the Kepler Spacecraft, which was specially made for finding Earth-like planets around other stars.</p>

<p>There was once a boy who was so obsessed with watching TV that wherever he went, he would arrive late. He was so keen to return to the telly that he never finished his breakfast or anything.<br>
<br>
One day, in his post-box, was a mysterious parcel. Inside the parcel were some special spectacles, along with a piece of paper saying, "With these you'll be able to see time".<br>
<br>
The boy didn't understand. He put the glasses on, looked at his brother and saw an enormous pile of flowers on top of his head. The flowers were falling down to the ground, one by one. And it wasn't just his brother. Whenever he looked at anyone through those glasses, exactly the same was happening. The only difference was that the older the person was, the smaller was the pile of flowers on their head. And according to how that person behaved, the pile gained or lost flowers.<br>
<br>
The next morning, while having his breakfast, the boy remembered his glasses. Putting them on, he was horrified to see that, coming from his own pile, was a constant stream of flowers going in the direction of the television. Not only that, but the television now had an enormous mouth, and was ferociously gobbling up all the flowers. And everywhere he went he would see wild-looking televisions devouring flowers.<br>
<br>
Finally, after realising what televisions actually are, the boy decided he would never again allow them to eat up all his time.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
“Hey! Couch potato! Stop watching so much television or you'll rot your brain!”<br>
<br>
Have you ever had someone say something along those lines to you? If you watch as much television as most people do, then a concerned friend or family member may have tried to unglue you from the set and get you outside to play instead.<br>
<br>
Watching television is fun. There's no use in denying it. The entertainment industry makes billions of dollars by producing television programs that delight and entertain us. Whether it's a funny comedy, an action-packed crime drama, a sporting event, or a musical reality show, television programs offer a little something for everyone. Of course, television programs can be educational. You're sure to find interesting programming that can teach you a lot. Many other cable channels also feature fascinating educational content, from biographies and nature shows to historical features and game shows.<br>
<br>
But watching too much television might also actually change your brain in negative ways. Some fear that the brain will change in ways that lead to a shorter attention span that can affect learning.<br>

Since the days of “Howdy Doody”, children have been drawn to their television sets to watch shows made especially for them. While grown-ups get into medical dramas and courtroom hijinks, kids just want to watch characters they love dealing with hilarious problems while learning important lessons in the process.<br>
<br>
Kids’ TV is a genre all its own; with brighter colours, smaller stories, and an element of silliness rarely found during primetime. From animated sponges to a boy named Beaver, the best children’s television shows of all time have been best friends for kids all over the world.<br>
<br>
We organised them into the 100 best programs to ever grace the small screen, here is number #1. Avatar: The Last Airbender [IMDb user rating: 9.2 - Years on air: 2005–2008] It’s an animated show set in an alternate world where people can manipulate the elements. A 12-year-old named Aang and his friends are tasked with bringing peace to the world by ending the Fire Lord’s century-long war. While the series was successful with 61 episodes over three seasons, the live-action adaptation, directed by M. Shyamalan, was universally shown.<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
There's a perception that books are good, while TV is bad. Spend a day curled up with a book and you're an intellectual; spend a day watching your favorite show and you're a couch potato.<br>
<br>
But why is that? Why can't watching TV be just as educational as reading a book? In 2013 a team led by Hiraku Takeuchi at Tohoku University in Japan examined the effects of television on the brains of 276 children. He found that the more TV the kids watched, parts of their brain associated with higher arousal and aggression levels became thicker. Also, the more hours of television the kids watched, the lower their verbal test results became.<br>
<br>
In the same year, a study was done on how reading a novel affected the brain. College students were asked to read Pompeii by Robert Harris, a thriller. After reading the novel, the students had increased connectivity in parts of the brain that were related to language. There was also increased activity in the brain, that suggested readers experienced similar sensations to the characters in the book.<br>
<br>
There are also long-term effects from reading books. Reading keeps your mind alert and delays cognitive decline in elders. Research even found that Alzheimer's is 2.5 times less likely to appear in elderly people who read regularly, while TV was presented as a risk factor. Six minutes of reading can reduce stress levels by 68%.&nbsp;<br>

<p>There was once a boy who was so obsessed with watching TV that wherever he went, he would arrive late. He was so keen to return to the telly that he never finished his breakfast or anything.<br>
<br>
One day, in his post-box, was a mysterious parcel. Inside the parcel were some special spectacles, along with a piece of paper saying, "With these you'll be able to see time".<br>
<br>
The boy didn't understand. He put the glasses on, looked at his brother and saw an enormous pile of flowers on top of his head. The flowers were falling down to the ground, one by one. And it wasn't just his brother. Whenever he looked at anyone through those glasses, exactly the same was happening. The only difference was that the older the person was, the smaller was the pile of flowers on their head. And according to how that person behaved, the pile gained or lost flowers.<br>
<br>
The next morning, while having his breakfast, the boy remembered his glasses. Putting them on, he was horrified to see that, coming from his own pile, was a constant stream of flowers going in the direction of the television. Not only that, but the television now had an enormous mouth, and was ferociously gobbling up all the flowers. And everywhere he went he would see wild-looking televisions devouring flowers.<br>
<br>
Finally, after realising what televisions actually are, the boy decided he would never again allow them to eat up all his time.<br>

While grown-ups get into medical dramas and courtroom hijinks, kids just want to watch characters they love dealing with hilarious problems while learning important lessons in the process.<br>
<br>
Kids’ TV is a genre all its own; with brighter colours, smaller stories, and an element of silliness rarely found during primetime. From animated sponges to a boy named Beaver, the best children’s television shows of all time have been best friends for kids all over the world.<br>
<br>
We organised them into the 100 best programs to ever grace the small screen, here is number #1. Avatar: The Last Airbender [IMDb user rating: 9.2 - Years on air: 2005–2008] It’s an animated show set in an alternate world where people can manipulate the elements. A 12-year-old named Aang and his friends are tasked with bringing peace to the world by ending the Fire Lord’s century-long war. While the series was successful with 61 episodes over three seasons, the live-action adaptation, directed by M. Shyamalan, was universally shown.<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
There's a perception that books are good, while TV is bad. Spend a day curled up with a book and you're an intellectual; spend a day watching your favorite show and you're a couch potato.<br>
<br>
But why is that? Why can't watching TV be just as educational as reading a book? In 2013 a team led by Hiraku Takeuchi at Tohoku University in Japan examined the effects of television on the brains of 276 children. He found that the more TV the kids watched, parts of their brain associated with higher arousal and aggression levels became thicker. Also, the more hours of television the kids watched, the lower their verbal test results became.<br>
<br>
In the same year, a study was done on how reading a novel affected the brain. College students were asked to read Pompeii by Robert Harris, a thriller. After reading the novel, the students had increased connectivity in parts of the brain that were related to language. There was also increased activity in the brain, that suggested readers experienced similar sensations to the characters in the book.<br>
<br>
There are also long-term effects from reading books. Reading keeps your mind alert and delays cognitive decline in elders. Research even found that Alzheimer's is 2.5 times less likely to appear in elderly people who read regularly, while TV was presented as a risk factor. Six minutes of reading can reduce stress levels by 68%.&nbsp;​<br>

<p>There was once a boy who was so obsessed with watching TV that wherever he went, he would arrive late. He was so keen to return to the telly that he never finished his breakfast or anything.<br>
<br>
One day, in his post-box, was a mysterious parcel. Inside the parcel were some special spectacles, along with a piece of paper saying, "With these you'll be able to see time".<br>
<br>
The boy didn't understand. He put the glasses on, looked at his brother and saw an enormous pile of flowers on top of his head. The flowers were falling down to the ground, one by one. And it wasn't just his brother. Whenever he looked at anyone through those glasses, exactly the same was happening. The only difference was that the older the person was, the smaller was the pile of flowers on their head. And according to how that person behaved, the pile gained or lost flowers.<br>
<br>
The next morning, while having his breakfast, the boy remembered his glasses. Putting them on, he was horrified to see that, coming from his own pile, was a constant stream of flowers going in the direction of the television. Not only that, but the television now had an enormous mouth, and was ferociously gobbling up all the flowers. And everywhere he went he would see wild-looking televisions devouring flowers.<br>
<br>
Finally, after realising what televisions actually are, the boy decided he would never again allow them to eat up all his time.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
“Hey! Couch potato! Stop watching so much television or you'll rot your brain!”<br>
<br>
Have you ever had someone say something along those lines to you? If you watch as much television as most people do, then a concerned friend or family member may have tried to unglue you from the set and get you outside to play instead.<br>
<br>
Watching television is fun. There's no use in denying it. The entertainment industry makes billions of dollars by producing television programs that delight and entertain us. Whether it's a funny comedy, an action-packed crime drama, a sporting event, or a musical reality show, television programs offer a little something for everyone. Of course, television programs can be educational. You're sure to find interesting programming that can teach you a lot. Many other cable channels also feature fascinating educational content, from biographies and nature shows to historical features and game shows.<br>
<br>
But watching too much television might also actually change your brain in negative ways. Some fear that the brain will change in ways that lead to a shorter attention span that can affect learning.<br>

While the series was successful with 61 episodes over three seasons, the live-action adaptation, directed by M. Shyamalan, was universally shown.<br>

There's a perception that books are good, while TV is bad. Spend a day curled up with a book and you're an intellectual; spend a day watching your favorite show and you're a couch potato.<br>
<br>
But why is that? Why can't watching TV be just as educational as reading a book? In 2013 a team led by Hiraku Takeuchi at Tohoku University in Japan examined the effects of television on the brains of 276 children. He found that the more TV the kids watched, parts of their brain associated with higher arousal and aggression levels became thicker. Also, the more hours of television the kids watched, the lower their verbal test results became.<br>
<br>
In the same year, a study was done on how reading a novel affected the brain. College students were asked to read Pompeii by Robert Harris, a thriller. After reading the novel, the students had increased connectivity in parts of the brain that were related to language. There was also increased activity in the brain, that suggested readers experienced similar sensations to the characters in the book.<br>
<br>
There are also long-term effects from reading books. Reading keeps your mind alert and delays cognitive decline in elders. Research even found that Alzheimer's is 2.5 times less likely to appear in elderly people who read regularly, while TV was presented as a risk factor. Six minutes of reading can reduce stress levels by 68%.&nbsp;​<br>

<p>There was once a boy who was so obsessed with watching TV that wherever he went, he would arrive late. He was so keen to return to the telly that he never finished his breakfast or anything.<br>
<br>
One day, in his post-box, was a mysterious parcel. Inside the parcel were some special spectacles, along with a piece of paper saying, "With these you'll be able to see time".<br>
<br>
The boy didn't understand. He put the glasses on, looked at his brother and saw an enormous pile of flowers on top of his head. The flowers were falling down to the ground, one by one. And it wasn't just his brother. Whenever he looked at anyone through those glasses, exactly the same was happening. The only difference was that the older the person was, the smaller was the pile of flowers on their head. And according to how that person behaved, the pile gained or lost flowers.<br>
<br>
The next morning, while having his breakfast, the boy remembered his glasses. Putting them on, he was horrified to see that, coming from his own pile, was a constant stream of flowers going in the direction of the television. Not only that, but the television now had an enormous mouth, and was ferociously gobbling up all the flowers. And everywhere he went he would see wild-looking televisions devouring flowers.<br>
<br>
Finally, after realising what televisions actually are, the boy decided he would never again allow them to eat up all his time.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
“Hey! Couch potato! Stop watching so much television or you'll rot your brain!”<br>
<br>
Have you ever had someone say something along those lines to you? If you watch as much television as most people do, then a concerned friend or family member may have tried to unglue you from the set and get you outside to play instead.<br>
<br>
Watching television is fun. There's no use in denying it. The entertainment industry makes billions of dollars by producing television programs that delight and entertain us. Whether it's a funny comedy, an action-packed crime drama, a sporting event, or a musical reality show, television programs offer a little something for everyone. Of course, television programs can be educational. You're sure to find interesting programming that can teach you a lot. Many other cable channels also feature fascinating educational content, from biographies and nature shows to historical features and game shows.<br>
<br>
But watching too much television might also actually change your brain in negative ways. Some fear that the brain will change in ways that lead to a shorter attention span that can affect learning.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Since the days of “Howdy Doody”, children have been drawn to their television sets to watch shows made especially for them. While grown-ups get into medical dramas and courtroom hijinks, kids just want to watch characters they love dealing with hilarious problems while learning important lessons in the process.<br>
<br>
Kids’ TV is a genre all its own; with brighter colours, smaller stories, and an element of silliness rarely found during primetime. From animated sponges to a boy named Beaver, the best children’s television shows of all time have been best friends for kids all over the world.<br>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>The Sound of the Shell&nbsp;</strong><br><em>by William Golding, ‘Lord of the Flies’</em><br><br>
The boy with fair hair lowered himself down the last few feet of rock and began to pick his way toward the lagoon. Though he had taken off his school sweater and trailed it now from one hand, his grey shirt stuck to him and his hair was plastered to his forehead. All round him where the long scar smashed into <span class="txt-underline"><strong>the jungle was a bath of heat</strong></span>. He was clambering heavily among the creepers and broken trunks when a bird, a vision of red and yellow, flashed upwards with a witch-like cry; and this cry was echoed by another.</p>
        <p>“Hi!” it said. “Wait a minute!” The undergrowth at the side of the scar was shaken and a multitude of raindrops fell pattering.</p>
        <p>“Wait a minute,” the voice said. “I got caught up.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fair boy stopped and <span class="txt-underline"><strong>jerked his stockings up</strong></span> with an automatic gesture that made the jungle seem for a moment like the Home Counties. The voice spoke again.</p>
        <p>“I can’t hardly move with all these creeper things.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The owner of the voice came backing out of the undergrowth so that twigs scratched on a greasy wind-breaker. The naked crooks of his knees were plump, caught and scratched by thorns. He bent down, removed the thorns carefully, and turned around. He was shorter than the fair boy and very fat. He came forward, searching out safe lodgments for his feet, and then looked up through thick spectacles. “Where’s the man with the megaphone?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fair boy shook his head. “This is an island. At least I think it’s an island. That’s a reef out in the sea. Perhaps there aren’t any grownups anywhere.”</p>
        <p>The fat boy looked startled. “There was that pilot. But he wasn’t in the passenger cabin, he was up in front.” The fair boy was peering at the reef through screwed-up eyes. “All them other kids,” the fat boy went on. “Some of them must have got out. They must have, mustn’t they?”</p>
        <p>The fair boy began to pick his way as casually as possible toward the water. He tried to be offhand and not too obviously uninterested, but the fat boy hurried after him. “Aren’t there any grownups at all?”</p>
        <p>“I don’t think so.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fair boy said this solemnly; but then the delight of a realised ambition overcame him. In the middle of the scar he stood on his head and grinned at the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>reversed</strong></span> fat boy. “No grownups!”</p>
        <p>The fat boy thought for a moment. “That pilot.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fair boy allowed his feet to come down and sat on the steamy earth. “He must have flown off after he dropped us. He couldn’t land here. Not in a place with wheels.”</p>
        <p>“We was attacked!”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“He’ll be back all right.”</p>
        <p>The fat boy shook his head. “<span class="txt-underline"><strong>When we was coming down I looked through one of them windows</strong></span>. I saw the other part of the plane. There were flames coming out of it.” He looked up and down the scar. “And this is what the cabin done.”</p>
        <p>The fair boy reached out and touched the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>jagged end of a trunk</strong></span>. For a moment he looked interested. “What happened to it?” he asked. “Where’s it got to now?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“That storm dragged it out to sea. It wasn’t half dangerous with all them tree trunks falling.” The shore was fledged with palm trees. These stood or leaned or reclined against the light and their green feathers were a hundred feet up in the air. The ground beneath them was a bank covered with coarse grass, torn everywhere by the upheavals of fallen trees, scattered with decaying coconuts and palm saplings. Behind this was the darkness of the forest proper and the open space of the scar.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>The Sound of the Shell&nbsp;</strong><br><em>by William Golding, ‘Lord of the Flies’</em><br><br>
The boy with fair hair lowered himself down the last few feet of rock and began to pick his way toward the lagoon. Though he had taken off his school sweater and trailed it now from one hand, his grey shirt stuck to him and his hair was plastered to his forehead. All round him where the long scar smashed into <span class="txt-underline"><strong>the jungle was a bath of heat</strong></span>. He was clambering heavily among the creepers and broken trunks when a bird, a vision of red and yellow, flashed upwards with a witch-like cry; and this cry was echoed by another.</p>
        <p>“Hi!” it said. “Wait a minute!” The undergrowth at the side of the scar was shaken and a multitude of raindrops fell pattering.</p>
        <p>“Wait a minute,” the voice said. “I got caught up.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fair boy stopped and <span class="txt-underline"><strong>jerked his stockings up</strong></span> with an automatic gesture that made the jungle seem for a moment like the Home Counties. The voice spoke again.</p>
        <p>“I can’t hardly move with all these creeper things.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The owner of the voice came backing out of the undergrowth so that twigs scratched on a greasy wind-breaker. The naked crooks of his knees were plump, caught and scratched by thorns. He bent down, removed the thorns carefully, and turned around. He was shorter than the fair boy and very fat. He came forward, searching out safe lodgments for his feet, and then looked up through thick spectacles. “Where’s the man with the megaphone?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fair boy shook his head. “This is an island. At least I think it’s an island. That’s a reef out in the sea. Perhaps there aren’t any grownups anywhere.”</p>
        <p>The fat boy looked startled. “There was that pilot. But he wasn’t in the passenger cabin, he was up in front.” The fair boy was peering at the reef through screwed-up eyes. “All them other kids,” the fat boy went on. “Some of them must have got out. They must have, mustn’t they?”</p>
        <p>The fair boy began to pick his way as casually as possible toward the water. He tried to be offhand and not too obviously uninterested, but the fat boy hurried after him. “Aren’t there any grownups at all?”</p>
        <p>“I don’t think so.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fair boy said this solemnly; but then the delight of a realised ambition overcame him. In the middle of the scar he stood on his head and grinned at the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>reversed</strong></span> fat boy. “No grownups!”</p>
        <p>The fat boy thought for a moment. “That pilot.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fair boy allowed his feet to come down and sat on the steamy earth. “He must have flown off after he dropped us. He couldn’t land here. Not in a place with wheels.”</p>
        <p>“We was attacked!”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“He’ll be back all right.”</p>
        <p>The fat boy shook his head. “<span class="txt-underline"><strong>When we was coming down I looked through one of them windows</strong></span>. I saw the other part of the plane. There were flames coming out of it.” He looked up and down the scar. “And this is what the cabin done.”</p>
        <p>The fair boy reached out and touched the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>jagged end of a trunk</strong></span>. For a moment he looked interested. “What happened to it?” he asked. “Where’s it got to now?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“That storm dragged it out to sea. It wasn’t half dangerous with all them tree trunks falling.” The shore was fledged with palm trees. These stood or leaned or reclined against the light and their green feathers were a hundred feet up in the air. The ground beneath them was a bank covered with coarse grass, torn everywhere by the upheavals of fallen trees, scattered with decaying coconuts and palm saplings. Behind this was the darkness of the forest proper and the open space of the scar.</p>

        <p>The owner of the voice came backing out of the undergrowth so that twigs scratched on a greasy wind-breaker. The naked crooks of his knees were plump, caught and scratched by thorns. He bent down, removed the thorns carefully, and turned around. He was shorter than the fair boy and very fat. He came forward, searching out safe lodgments for his feet, and then looked up through thick spectacles. “Where’s the man with the megaphone?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fair boy shook his head. “This is an island. At least I think it’s an island. That’s a reef out in the sea. Perhaps there aren’t any grownups anywhere.”</p>
        <p>The fat boy looked startled. “There was that pilot. But he wasn’t in the passenger cabin, he was up in front.” The fair boy was peering at the reef through screwed-up eyes. “All them other kids,” the fat boy went on. “Some of them must have got out. They must have, mustn’t they?”</p>
        <p>The fair boy began to pick his way as casually as possible toward the water. He tried to be offhand and not too obviously uninterested, but the fat boy hurried after him. “Aren’t there any grownups at all?”</p>
        <p>“I don’t think so.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fair boy said this solemnly; but then the delight of a realised ambition overcame him. In the middle of the scar he stood on his head and grinned at the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>reversed</strong></span> fat boy. “No grownups!”</p>
        <p>The fat boy thought for a moment. “That pilot.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fair boy allowed his feet to come down and sat on the steamy earth. “He must have flown off after he dropped us. He couldn’t land here. Not in a place with wheels.”</p>
        <p>“We was attacked!”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“He’ll be back all right.”</p>
        <p>The fat boy shook his head. “<span class="txt-underline"><strong>When we was coming down I looked through one of them windows</strong></span>. I saw the other part of the plane. There were flames coming out of it.” He looked up and down the scar. “And this is what the cabin done.”</p>
        <p>The fair boy reached out and touched the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>jagged end of a trunk</strong></span>. For a moment he looked interested. “What happened to it?” he asked. “Where’s it got to now?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“That storm dragged it out to sea. It wasn’t half dangerous with all them tree trunks falling.” The shore was fledged with palm trees. These stood or leaned or reclined against the light and their green feathers were a hundred feet up in the air. The ground beneath them was a bank covered with coarse grass, torn everywhere by the upheavals of fallen trees, scattered with decaying coconuts and palm saplings. Behind this was the darkness of the forest proper and the open space of the scar.</p>

by William Golding, ‘Lord of the Flies’<br>
<br>
The boy with fair hair lowered himself down the last few feet of rock and began to pick his way toward the lagoon. Though he had taken off his school sweater and trailed it now from one hand, his grey shirt stuck to him and his hair was plastered to his forehead. All round him where the long scar smashed into <span class="txt-underline"><strong>the jungle was a bath of heat</strong></span>. He was clambering heavily among the creepers and broken trunks when a bird, a vision of red and yellow, flashed upwards with a witch-like cry; and this cry was echoed by another.</p>
        <p>“Hi!” it said. “Wait a minute!” The undergrowth at the side of the scar was shaken and a multitude of raindrops fell pattering.</p>
        <p>“Wait a minute,” the voice said. “I got caught up.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fair boy stopped and <span class="txt-underline"><strong>jerked his stockings up</strong></span> with an automatic gesture that made the jungle seem for a moment like the Home Counties. The voice spoke again.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>The Sound of the Shell&nbsp;</strong><br><em>by William Golding, ‘Lord of the Flies’</em><br><br>
The boy with fair hair lowered himself down the last few feet of rock and began to pick his way toward the lagoon. Though he had taken off his school sweater and trailed it now from one hand, his grey shirt stuck to him and his hair was plastered to his forehead. All round him where the long scar smashed into <span class="txt-underline"><strong>the jungle was a bath of heat</strong></span>. He was clambering heavily among the creepers and broken trunks when a bird, a vision of red and yellow, flashed upwards with a witch-like cry; and this cry was echoed by another.</p>
        <p>“Hi!” it said. “Wait a minute!” The undergrowth at the side of the scar was shaken and a multitude of raindrops fell pattering.</p>
        <p>“Wait a minute,” the voice said. “I got caught up.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fair boy stopped and <span class="txt-underline"><strong>jerked his stockings up</strong></span> with an automatic gesture that made the jungle seem for a moment like the Home Counties. The voice spoke again.</p>
        <p>“I can’t hardly move with all these creeper things.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The owner of the voice came backing out of the undergrowth so that twigs scratched on a greasy wind-breaker. The naked crooks of his knees were plump, caught and scratched by thorns. He bent down, removed the thorns carefully, and turned around. He was shorter than the fair boy and very fat. He came forward, searching out safe lodgments for his feet, and then looked up through thick spectacles. “Where’s the man with the megaphone?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fair boy shook his head. “This is an island. At least I think it’s an island. That’s a reef out in the sea. Perhaps there aren’t any grownups anywhere.”</p>
        <p>The fat boy looked startled. “There was that pilot. But he wasn’t in the passenger cabin, he was up in front.” The fair boy was peering at the reef through screwed-up eyes. “All them other kids,” the fat boy went on. “Some of them must have got out. They must have, mustn’t they?”</p>
        <p>The fair boy began to pick his way as casually as possible toward the water. He tried to be offhand and not too obviously uninterested, but the fat boy hurried after him. “Aren’t there any grownups at all?”</p>
        <p>“I don’t think so.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fair boy said this solemnly; but then the delight of a realised ambition overcame him. In the middle of the scar he stood on his head and grinned at the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>reversed</strong></span> fat boy. “No grownups!”</p>
        <p>The fat boy thought for a moment. “That pilot.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fair boy allowed his feet to come down and sat on the steamy earth. “He must have flown off after he dropped us. He couldn’t land here. Not in a place with wheels.”</p>
        <p>“We was attacked!”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“He’ll be back all right.”</p>
        <p>The fat boy shook his head. “<span class="txt-underline"><strong>When we was coming down I looked through one of them windows</strong></span>. I saw the other part of the plane. There were flames coming out of it.” He looked up and down the scar. “And this is what the cabin done.”</p>
        <p>The fair boy reached out and touched the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>jagged end of a trunk</strong></span>. For a moment he looked interested. “What happened to it?” he asked. “Where’s it got to now?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“That storm dragged it out to sea. It wasn’t half dangerous with all them tree trunks falling.” The shore was fledged with palm trees. These stood or leaned or reclined against the light and their green feathers were a hundred feet up in the air. The ground beneath them was a bank covered with coarse grass, torn everywhere by the upheavals of fallen trees, scattered with decaying coconuts and palm saplings. Behind this was the darkness of the forest proper and the open space of the scar.</p>

          <strong>End of a Splendid Journey [Titanic 1912]&nbsp;</strong>
          <br>
          <br>
          <em>Elizabeth Shutes, aged 40, was governess to nineteen-year-old Margaret Graham who was travelling with her parents. As Shutes and her charge sit in their First Class cabin they feel a shudder travel through the ship. Comforted by her belief in the safety of the ship, Elizabeth’s composure is soon shattered by the realisation of the imminent tragedy:</em>
        </p>
        <p>“Suddenly a strange quivering ran under me, apparently the whole length of the ship. Startled by the very strangeness of the shivering motion, I sprang to the floor. With too perfect a trust in that mighty vessel I again lay down. Someone knocked at my door, and the voice of a friend said: ‘Come quickly to my cabin; an iceberg has just passed our window; I know we have just struck one.’</p>
        <p>No confusion, no noise of any kind, one could believe no danger imminent. Our stewardess came and said she could learn nothing. Looking out into the companionway I saw heads appearing asking questions from half-closed doors. All still, no excitement. I sat down again. Margaret pretended to eat a sandwich. Her hand shook so that the bread kept parting company from the chicken. Then I saw she was frightened, and for the first time I was too, but why get dressed, as no one had given the slightest hint of any possible danger? An officer’s cap passed the door. I asked: ‘Is there an accident or danger of any kind? ‘None, so far as I know’, was his courteous answer, spoken quietly and most kindly. This same officer then entered a cabin a little distance down the companionway and, by this time distrustful of everything, I listened intently, and distinctly heard, ‘We can keep the water out for a while.’ Then, and not until then, did I realise the horror of an accident at sea. Now it was too late to dress; no time for a waist, but a coat and skirt were soon on; slippers were quicker than shoes; the stewardess put on our lifepreservers, and we were just ready when Mr Roebling came to tell us he would take us to our friend’s mother, who was waiting above...</p>

        <p>No laughing throng, but on either side [of the staircases] stood quietly, bravely, the stewards, all equipped with the&nbsp;white, ghostly life-preservers. Always the thing one tries not to see even crossing a ferry. Now only pale faces, each form strapped about with those white bars. So gruesome a scene. We passed on. The awful good-byes. The quiet look of hope in the brave men’s eyes as the wives were put into the lifeboats. Nothing escaped one at this fearful moment. We left from the sun deck, seventy-five feet above the water. Mr Case and Mr Roebling, brave American men, saw us to the lifeboat, made no effort to save themselves, but stepped back on deck. Later they went to an honoured grave.</p>
        <p>Our lifeboat, with thirty-six in it, began lowering to the sea. This was done amid the greatest confusion. Rough seamen all giving different orders. No officer aboard. As only one side of the ropes worked, the lifeboat at one time was in such a position that it seemed we must capsize in mid-air. At last the ropes worked together, and we drew nearer and nearer the black, oily water. The first touch of our lifeboat on that black sea came to me as a last good-bye to life, and so we put off - a tiny boat on a great sea - rowed away from what had been a safe home for five days.</p>
        <p>The first wish on the part of all was to stay near the <em>Titanic</em>. We all felt so much safer near the ship. Surely such a vessel could not sink. I thought the danger must be exaggerated, and we could all be taken aboard again. But surely the outline of that great, good ship was growing less. The bow of the boat was getting black. Light after light was disappearing, and now those rough seamen put to their oars and we were told to hunt under seats, any place, anywhere, for a lantern, a light of any kind. Every place was empty. There was no water - no stimulant of any kind. Not a biscuit - nothing to keep us alive had we drifted long...</p>

        <p>Sitting by me in the lifeboat were a mother and daughter. The mother had left a husband on the <em>Titanic</em>, and the daughter a father and husband, and while we were near the other boats those two stricken women would call out a name and ask, ‘Are you there?’ ‘No,’ would come back the awful answer, but these brave women never lost courage, forgot their own sorrow, telling me to sit close to them to keep warm... The life-preservers helped to keep us warm, but the night was bitter cold, and it grew colder and colder, and just before dawn, the coldest, darkest hour of all, no help seemed possible...</p>
        <p>...The stars slowly disappeared, and in their place came the faint pink glow of another day. Then I heard, ‘A light, a ship.’ I could not, would not, look while there was a bit of doubt, but kept my eyes away. All night long I had heard, ‘A light!’ Each time it proved to be one of our other lifeboats, someone lighting a piece of paper, anything they could find to burn, and now I could not believe. Someone found a newspaper; it was lighted and held up. Then I&nbsp;looked and saw a ship. A ship bright with lights; strong and steady she waited, and we were to be saved. A straw hat was offered it would burn longer. That same ship that had come to save us might run us down. But no; she is still. The two, the ship and the dawn, came together, a living painting.”</p>

          <em>Elizabeth Shutes, aged 40, was governess to nineteen-year-old Margaret Graham who was travelling with her parents. As Shutes and her charge sit in their First Class cabin they feel a shudder travel through the ship. Comforted by her belief in the safety of the ship, Elizabeth’s composure is soon shattered by the realisation of the imminent tragedy:</em>
        </p>
        <p>“Suddenly a strange quivering ran under me, apparently the whole length of the ship. Startled by the very strangeness of the shivering motion, I sprang to the floor. With too perfect a trust in that mighty vessel I again lay down. Someone knocked at my door, and the voice of a friend said: ‘Come quickly to my cabin; an iceberg has just passed our window; I know we have just struck one.’</p>
        <p>No confusion, no noise of any kind, one could believe no danger imminent. Our stewardess came and said she could learn nothing. Looking out into the companionway I saw heads appearing asking questions from half-closed doors. All still, no excitement. I sat down again. Margaret pretended to eat a sandwich. Her hand shook so that the bread kept parting company from the chicken. Then I saw she was frightened, and for the first time I was too, but why get dressed, as no one had given the slightest hint of any possible danger? An officer’s cap passed the door. I asked: ‘Is there an accident or danger of any kind? ‘None, so far as I know’, was his courteous answer, spoken quietly and most kindly. This same officer then entered a cabin a little distance down the companionway and, by this time distrustful of everything, I listened intently, and distinctly heard, ‘We can keep the water out for a while.’ Then, and not until then, did I realise the horror of an accident at sea. Now it was too late to dress; no time for a waist, but a coat and skirt were soon on; slippers were quicker than shoes; the stewardess put on our lifepreservers, and we were just ready when Mr Roebling came to tell us he would take us to our friend’s mother, who was waiting above...</p>

        <p>No laughing throng, but on either side [of the staircases] stood quietly, bravely, the stewards, all equipped with the&nbsp;white, ghostly life-preservers. Always the thing one tries not to see even crossing a ferry. Now only pale faces, each form strapped about with those white bars. So gruesome a scene. We passed on. The awful good-byes. The quiet look of hope in the brave men’s eyes as the wives were put into the lifeboats. Nothing escaped one at this fearful moment. We left from the sun deck, seventy-five feet above the water. Mr Case and Mr Roebling, brave American men, saw us to the lifeboat, made no effort to save themselves, but stepped back on deck. Later they went to an honoured grave.</p>
        <p>Our lifeboat, with thirty-six in it, began lowering to the sea. This was done amid the greatest confusion. Rough seamen all giving different orders. No officer aboard. As only one side of the ropes worked, the lifeboat at one time was in such a position that it seemed we must capsize in mid-air. At last the ropes worked together, and we drew nearer and nearer the black, oily water. The first touch of our lifeboat on that black sea came to me as a last good-bye to life, and so we put off - a tiny boat on a great sea - rowed away from what had been a safe home for five days.</p>
        <p>The first wish on the part of all was to stay near the <em>Titanic</em>. We all felt so much safer near the ship. Surely such a vessel could not sink. I thought the danger must be exaggerated, and we could all be taken aboard again. But surely the outline of that great, good ship was growing less. The bow of the boat was getting black. Light after light was disappearing, and now those rough seamen put to their oars and we were told to hunt under seats, any place, anywhere, for a lantern, a light of any kind. Every place was empty. There was no water - no stimulant of any kind. Not a biscuit - nothing to keep us alive had we drifted long...</p>

        <p>Sitting by me in the lifeboat were a mother and daughter. The mother had left a husband on the <em>Titanic</em>, and the daughter a father and husband, and while we were near the other boats those two stricken women would call out a name and ask, ‘Are you there?’ ‘No,’ would come back the awful answer, but these brave women never lost courage, forgot their own sorrow, telling me to sit close to them to keep warm... The life-preservers helped to keep us warm, but the night was bitter cold, and it grew colder and colder, and just before dawn, the coldest, darkest hour of all, no help seemed possible...</p>
        <p>...The stars slowly disappeared, and in their place came the faint pink glow of another day. Then I heard, ‘A light, a ship.’ I could not, would not, look while there was a bit of doubt, but kept my eyes away. All night long I had heard, ‘A light!’ Each time it proved to be one of our other lifeboats, someone lighting a piece of paper, anything they could find to burn, and now I could not believe. Someone found a newspaper; it was lighted and held up. Then I&nbsp;looked and saw a ship. A ship bright with lights; strong and steady she waited, and we were to be saved. A straw hat was offered it would burn longer. That same ship that had come to save us might run us down. But no; she is still. The two, the ship and the dawn, came together, a living painting.”</p>

          <strong>End of a Splendid Journey [Titanic 1912]&nbsp;</strong>
          <br>
          <br>
          <em>Elizabeth Shutes, aged 40, was governess to nineteen-year-old Margaret Graham who was travelling with her parents. As Shutes and her charge sit in their First Class cabin they feel a shudder travel through the ship. Comforted by her belief in the safety of the ship, Elizabeth’s composure is soon shattered by the realisation of the imminent tragedy:</em>
        </p>
        <p>“Suddenly a strange quivering ran under me, apparently the whole length of the ship. Startled by the very strangeness of the shivering motion, I sprang to the floor. With too perfect a trust in that mighty vessel I again lay down. Someone knocked at my door, and the voice of a friend said: ‘Come quickly to my cabin; an iceberg has just passed our window; I know we have just struck one.’</p>
        <p>No confusion, no noise of any kind, one could believe no danger imminent. Our stewardess came and said she could learn nothing. Looking out into the companionway I saw heads appearing asking questions from half-closed doors. All still, no excitement. I sat down again. Margaret pretended to eat a sandwich. Her hand shook so that the bread kept parting company from the chicken. Then I saw she was frightened, and for the first time I was too, but why get dressed, as no one had given the slightest hint of any possible danger? An officer’s cap passed the door. I asked: ‘Is there an accident or danger of any kind? ‘None, so far as I know’, was his courteous answer, spoken quietly and most kindly. This same officer then entered a cabin a little distance down the companionway and, by this time distrustful of everything, I listened intently, and distinctly heard, ‘We can keep the water out for a while.’ Then, and not until then, did I realise the horror of an accident at sea. Now it was too late to dress; no time for a waist, but a coat and skirt were soon on; slippers were quicker than shoes; the stewardess put on our lifepreservers, and we were just ready when Mr Roebling came to tell us he would take us to our friend’s mother, who was waiting above...</p>
