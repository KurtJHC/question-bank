          <em>by Harlan Coben&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The shot that will decide the championship is slowly arching its way toward the basket.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Everyone else in Indianapolis’s Lucas Oil Stadium stares at the ball with mouth open.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My seat is courtside, of course, near the centre line. An A-list Marvel-Superhero actor sporting a tourniquet-tight, show-biceps black tee sits on my left, you know him, and the celebrated rapper-mogul Swagg Daddy, whose private jet I bought three years ago, dons his own brand of sunglasses to my right. I like Sheldon (that’s Swagg Daddy’s real name), both the man and his music.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As for me, I sport a Savile Row hand-tailored suit of pinstripe azure, a pair of Bedfordshire bespoke Bordeaux-hued shoes created by Basil, the master craftsman at G. J. Cleverley’s, a limited-edition Lilly Pulitzer silk tie of pink and green, and a specially created Hermès pocket square, which flares out from the left breast pocket with celestial precision.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The ball travelling in the air will decide the outcome of the college basketball phenomenon known as March Madness. Odd that, when you think about it. All the blood and sweat and tears, all the strategising and scouting and coaching, all the countless hours of shooting alone in your driveway, of dribbling drills, of the three-man weave, of lifting weights, of doing wind sprints until you hurl, all those years in stale gyms on every level—Biddy basketball, CYO travel all-stars, AAU tournaments, high school, you get the point—all of that boils down to the simple physics of a rudimentary orange sphere back-spinning toward a metallic cylinder at this exact moment.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Either the shot will miss and Duke University will win—or it will go in and South State University and their fans will rush to the court in celebration. The A-list Marvel hero attended South State. Swagg Daddy, like yours truly, attended Duke. They both tense up. The raucous crowd falls into a hush. Time has slowed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Again, even though it’s my alma mater, I don’t care. I don’t get fandom in general. I never care who wins a contest in which I (or someone dear to me) am not an active participant. Why, I often wonder, would anyone?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I hear the buzzer go off. Time is out, though the outcome of the contest is still very much in doubt.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The arena is so hushed that I can actually hear the ball hit the rim.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Swagg grabs my leg. Mr. Marvel A-List swings a muscled tricep across my chest as he spreads his arms in anticipation. The ball hits the rim once, twice, then a third time, as though this inanimate object is teasing the crowd before deciding for itself who lives and who dies.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When the ball rolls all the way off the rim and then drops toward the ground—a definite miss—the Blue Devil section in the arena explodes. In my periphery, I see everyone on the South State bench deflate. I don’t care for the word “crestfallen”—it’s an odd word— but here it is <em><span class="txt-underline"><strong>apropos</strong></span></em>. They deflate and appear crestfallen. Several collapse in devastation and tears as the reality of the loss sinks in.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Again, even though it’s my alma mater, I don’t care. I don’t get fandom in general. I never care who wins a contest in which I (or someone dear to me) am not an active participant. Why, I often wonder, would anyone?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I hear the buzzer go off. Time is out, though the outcome of the contest is still very much in doubt.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The arena is so hushed that I can actually hear the ball hit the rim.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Swagg grabs my leg. Mr. Marvel A-List swings a muscled tricep across my chest as he spreads his arms in anticipation. The ball hits the rim once, twice, then a third time, as though this inanimate object is teasing the crowd before deciding for itself who lives and who dies.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When the ball rolls all the way off the rim and then drops toward the ground—a definite miss—the Blue Devil section in the arena explodes. In my periphery, I see everyone on the South State bench deflate. I don’t care for the word “crestfallen”—it’s an odd word— but here it is <em><span class="txt-underline"><strong>apropos</strong></span></em>. They deflate and appear crestfallen. Several collapse in devastation and tears as the reality of the loss sinks in.&nbsp;</p>

        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Harlan Coben&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The shot that will decide the championship is slowly arching its way toward the basket.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Everyone else in Indianapolis’s Lucas Oil Stadium stares at the ball with mouth open.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My seat is courtside, of course, near the centre line. An A-list Marvel-Superhero actor sporting a tourniquet-tight, show-biceps black tee sits on my left, you know him, and the celebrated rapper-mogul Swagg Daddy, whose private jet I bought three years ago, dons his own brand of sunglasses to my right. I like Sheldon (that’s Swagg Daddy’s real name), both the man and his music.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As for me, I sport a Savile Row hand-tailored suit of pinstripe azure, a pair of Bedfordshire bespoke Bordeaux-hued shoes created by Basil, the master craftsman at G. J. Cleverley’s, a limited-edition Lilly Pulitzer silk tie of pink and green, and a specially created Hermès pocket square, which flares out from the left breast pocket with celestial precision.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The ball travelling in the air will decide the outcome of the college basketball phenomenon known as March Madness. Odd that, when you think about it. All the blood and sweat and tears, all the strategising and scouting and coaching, all the countless hours of shooting alone in your driveway, of dribbling drills, of the three-man weave, of lifting weights, of doing wind sprints until you hurl, all those years in stale gyms on every level—Biddy basketball, CYO travel all-stars, AAU tournaments, high school, you get the point—all of that boils down to the simple physics of a rudimentary orange sphere back-spinning toward a metallic cylinder at this exact moment.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Either the shot will miss and Duke University will win—or it will go in and South State University and their fans will rush to the court in celebration. The A-list Marvel hero attended South State. Swagg Daddy, like yours truly, attended Duke. They both tense up. The raucous crowd falls into a hush. Time has slowed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Again, even though it’s my alma mater, I don’t care. I don’t get fandom in general. I never care who wins a contest in which I (or someone dear to me) am not an active participant. Why, I often wonder, would anyone?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I hear the buzzer go off. Time is out, though the outcome of the contest is still very much in doubt.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The arena is so hushed that I can actually hear the ball hit the rim.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Swagg grabs my leg. Mr. Marvel A-List swings a muscled tricep across my chest as he spreads his arms in anticipation. The ball hits the rim once, twice, then a third time, as though this inanimate object is teasing the crowd before deciding for itself who lives and who dies.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Aliens Stole My Underpants&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To understand the ways&nbsp;</p>
        <p>of alien beings is hard&nbsp;</p>
        <p>and I’ve never worked it out&nbsp;</p>
        <p>why they landed in my backyard.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And I’ve always wondered why&nbsp;</p>
        <p>on their journey from the stars,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>these aliens stole my underpants&nbsp;</p>
        <p>and took them back to Mars.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They came on a Monday night&nbsp;</p>
        <p>when the weekend wash had been done,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>pegged out on the line&nbsp;</p>
        <p>to be dried by the morning sun.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mrs Driver from next door&nbsp;</p>
        <p>was a witness at the scene&nbsp;</p>
        <p>when aliens snatched my underpants&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I’m glad that they were clean!&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It seems they were quite choosy&nbsp;</p>
        <p>as nothing else was taken.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Do aliens wear underpants&nbsp;</p>
        <p>or were they just mistaken?&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I think I have a theory&nbsp;</p>
        <p>as to what they wanted them for,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>they needed to block off a draught&nbsp;</p>
        <p>blowing in through the spacecraft door.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Or maybe some Mars museum&nbsp;</p>
        <p>wanted items bought back from space.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Just think, my pair of Y-fronts&nbsp;</p>
        <p>displayed in their own glass case.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And on the label beneath&nbsp;</p>
        <p>would be written where they got <span class="txt-underline"><strong>‘em</strong></span>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>and how such funny underwear&nbsp;</p>
        <p>once covered an Earthling’s bottom!</p>

          <strong>Aliens Stole My Underpants&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To understand the ways&nbsp;</p>
        <p>of alien beings is hard&nbsp;</p>
        <p>and I’ve never worked it out&nbsp;</p>
        <p>why they landed in my backyard.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And I’ve always wondered why&nbsp;</p>
        <p>on their journey from the stars,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>these aliens stole my underpants&nbsp;</p>
        <p>and took them back to Mars.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They came on a Monday night&nbsp;</p>
        <p>when the weekend wash had been done,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>pegged out on the line&nbsp;</p>
        <p>to be dried by the morning sun.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mrs Driver from next door&nbsp;</p>
        <p>was a witness at the scene&nbsp;</p>
        <p>when aliens snatched my underpants&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I’m glad that they were clean!&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It seems they were quite choosy&nbsp;</p>
        <p>as nothing else was taken.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Do aliens wear underpants&nbsp;</p>
        <p>or were they just mistaken?&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I think I have a theory&nbsp;</p>
        <p>as to what they wanted them for,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>they needed to block off a draught&nbsp;</p>
        <p>blowing in through the spacecraft door.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Or maybe some Mars museum&nbsp;</p>
        <p>wanted items bought back from space.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Just think, my pair of Y-fronts&nbsp;</p>
        <p>displayed in their own glass case.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And on the label beneath&nbsp;</p>
        <p>would be written where they got <span class="txt-underline"><strong>‘em</strong></span>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>and how such funny underwear&nbsp;</p>
        <p>once covered an Earthling’s bottom!</p>

          <strong>Aliens Stole My Underpants&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To understand the ways&nbsp;</p>
        <p>of alien beings is hard&nbsp;</p>
        <p>and I’ve never worked it out&nbsp;</p>
        <p>why they landed in my backyard.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And I’ve always wondered why&nbsp;</p>
        <p>on their journey from the stars,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>these aliens stole my underpants&nbsp;</p>
        <p>and took them back to Mars.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They came on a Monday night&nbsp;</p>
        <p>when the weekend wash had been done,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>pegged out on the line&nbsp;</p>
        <p>to be dried by the morning sun.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mrs Driver from next door&nbsp;</p>
        <p>was a witness at the scene&nbsp;</p>
        <p>when aliens snatched my underpants&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I’m glad that they were clean!&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It seems they were quite choosy&nbsp;</p>
        <p>as nothing else was taken.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Do aliens wear underpants&nbsp;</p>
        <p>or were they just mistaken?&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I think I have a theory&nbsp;</p>
        <p>as to what they wanted them for,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>they needed to block off a draught&nbsp;</p>
        <p>blowing in through the spacecraft door.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Or maybe some Mars museum&nbsp;</p>
        <p>wanted items bought back from space.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Just think, my pair of Y-fronts&nbsp;</p>
        <p>displayed in their own glass case.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And on the label beneath&nbsp;</p>
        <p>would be written where they got <span class="txt-underline"><strong>‘em</strong></span>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>and how such funny underwear&nbsp;</p>
        <p>once covered an Earthling’s bottom!</p>

        <p>Six sentences have been removed from the text. Choose from the sentences (<strong>A – G</strong>) the one which fits each gap (<strong>15 – 20</strong>). There is one extra sentence which you do not need to use.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Light and Matter&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The human eye and brain translate light into colour. Light receptors within the eye transmit messages to the brain, producing the familiar sensation of colour. The retina is covered by millions of light-sensitive cells, some shaped like rods and some like cones, and it’s these receptors that process the light and then send this information to the visual cortex. Rods are mostly concentrated around the edge of the retina and transmit mostly black and white information. <strong>15 ………. </strong>These cells, working in combination with connecting nerve cells, give the brain enough information to interpret and name colours.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Think of atoms like bricks in a wall (chemical compound). <strong>16 ……….</strong> If the wall is smooth or has sharp corners, the ball may jump back in different directions. However, if the wall is filled with holes, the ball may go through the wall or get stuck in one of the tricky corners, respectively. Same with every surface when light hits it. <strong>17 ……….</strong> (transparent things, like glass).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This analogy is far from perfect though because light isn’t like a ball. For instance, the light we get to see, called visible light, is only a fraction of the full range of frequencies. A molecule might absorb photons from anywhere across the whole electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to X-rays, but it will be colourful only if there is a difference in how strongly it absorbs one visible wavelength over another. <strong>18 ………. </strong>So, because electrons in most molecules are bound very tightly, most compounds are white!&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As a conclusion, things do not have colour by themselves — only when light (energy) hits them, we can see colours. <strong>19 ……….</strong> Also, remember our eyes can only see a limited range of colours. But dogs, cats, mice, rats and rabbits have very poor colour vision. In fact, they see mostly greys and some blues and yellows, while bees and butterflies can see colours that we can’t see. Their range of colour vision extends into the ultraviolet, and in fact, they couldn’t have survived otherwise. Evolution led bees to adapt ultraviolet vision because flowers leave scatter ultraviolet patterns, allowing the insects to easily identify targets and pollinate. <strong>20 ……….</strong> This is what spectrometers are for.</p>

          <em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Six sentences have been removed from the text. Choose from the sentences (<strong>A – G</strong>) the one which fits each gap (<strong>15 – 20</strong>). There is one extra sentence which you do not need to use.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Light and Matter&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The human eye and brain translate light into colour. Light receptors within the eye transmit messages to the brain, producing the familiar sensation of colour. The retina is covered by millions of light-sensitive cells, some shaped like rods and some like cones, and it’s these receptors that process the light and then send this information to the visual cortex. Rods are mostly concentrated around the edge of the retina and transmit mostly black and white information. <strong>15 ………. </strong>These cells, working in combination with connecting nerve cells, give the brain enough information to interpret and name colours.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Think of atoms like bricks in a wall (chemical compound). <strong>16 ……….</strong> If the wall is smooth or has sharp corners, the ball may jump back in different directions. However, if the wall is filled with holes, the ball may go through the wall or get stuck in one of the tricky corners, respectively. Same with every surface when light hits it. <strong>17 ……….</strong> (transparent things, like glass).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This analogy is far from perfect though because light isn’t like a ball. For instance, the light we get to see, called visible light, is only a fraction of the full range of frequencies. A molecule might absorb photons from anywhere across the whole electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to X-rays, but it will be colourful only if there is a difference in how strongly it absorbs one visible wavelength over another. <strong>18 ………. </strong>So, because electrons in most molecules are bound very tightly, most compounds are white!&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As a conclusion, things do not have colour by themselves — only when light (energy) hits them, we can see colours. <strong>19 ……….</strong> Also, remember our eyes can only see a limited range of colours. But dogs, cats, mice, rats and rabbits have very poor colour vision. In fact, they see mostly greys and some blues and yellows, while bees and butterflies can see colours that we can’t see. Their range of colour vision extends into the ultraviolet, and in fact, they couldn’t have survived otherwise. Evolution led bees to adapt ultraviolet vision because flowers leave scatter ultraviolet patterns, allowing the insects to easily identify targets and pollinate. <strong>20 ……….</strong> This is what spectrometers are for.</p>

          <strong>Light and Matter&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The human eye and brain translate light into colour. Light receptors within the eye transmit messages to the brain, producing the familiar sensation of colour. The retina is covered by millions of light-sensitive cells, some shaped like rods and some like cones, and it’s these receptors that process the light and then send this information to the visual cortex. Rods are mostly concentrated around the edge of the retina and transmit mostly black and white information. <strong>15 ………. </strong>These cells, working in combination with connecting nerve cells, give the brain enough information to interpret and name colours.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Think of atoms like bricks in a wall (chemical compound). <strong>16 ……….</strong> If the wall is smooth or has sharp corners, the ball may jump back in different directions. However, if the wall is filled with holes, the ball may go through the wall or get stuck in one of the tricky corners, respectively. Same with every surface when light hits it. <strong>17 ……….</strong> (transparent things, like glass).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This analogy is far from perfect though because light isn’t like a ball. For instance, the light we get to see, called visible light, is only a fraction of the full range of frequencies. A molecule might absorb photons from anywhere across the whole electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to X-rays, but it will be colourful only if there is a difference in how strongly it absorbs one visible wavelength over another. <strong>18 ………. </strong>So, because electrons in most molecules are bound very tightly, most compounds are white!&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As a conclusion, things do not have colour by themselves — only when light (energy) hits them, we can see colours. <strong>19 ……….</strong> Also, remember our eyes can only see a limited range of colours. But dogs, cats, mice, rats and rabbits have very poor colour vision. In fact, they see mostly greys and some blues and yellows, while bees and butterflies can see colours that we can’t see. Their range of colour vision extends into the ultraviolet, and in fact, they couldn’t have survived otherwise. Evolution led bees to adapt ultraviolet vision because flowers leave scatter ultraviolet patterns, allowing the insects to easily identify targets and pollinate. <strong>20 ……….</strong> This is what spectrometers are for.</p>

          <em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Six sentences have been removed from the text. Choose from the sentences (<strong>A – G</strong>) the one which fits each gap (<strong>15 – 20</strong>). There is one extra sentence which you do not need to use.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Light and Matter&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The human eye and brain translate light into colour. Light receptors within the eye transmit messages to the brain, producing the familiar sensation of colour. The retina is covered by millions of light-sensitive cells, some shaped like rods and some like cones, and it’s these receptors that process the light and then send this information to the visual cortex. Rods are mostly concentrated around the edge of the retina and transmit mostly black and white information. <strong>15 ………. </strong>These cells, working in combination with connecting nerve cells, give the brain enough information to interpret and name colours.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Think of atoms like bricks in a wall (chemical compound). <strong>16 ……….</strong> If the wall is smooth or has sharp corners, the ball may jump back in different directions. However, if the wall is filled with holes, the ball may go through the wall or get stuck in one of the tricky corners, respectively. Same with every surface when light hits it. <strong>17 ……….</strong> (transparent things, like glass).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This analogy is far from perfect though because light isn’t like a ball. For instance, the light we get to see, called visible light, is only a fraction of the full range of frequencies. A molecule might absorb photons from anywhere across the whole electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to X-rays, but it will be colourful only if there is a difference in how strongly it absorbs one visible wavelength over another. <strong>18 ………. </strong>So, because electrons in most molecules are bound very tightly, most compounds are white!&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As a conclusion, things do not have colour by themselves — only when light (energy) hits them, we can see colours. <strong>19 ……….</strong> Also, remember our eyes can only see a limited range of colours. But dogs, cats, mice, rats and rabbits have very poor colour vision. In fact, they see mostly greys and some blues and yellows, while bees and butterflies can see colours that we can’t see. Their range of colour vision extends into the ultraviolet, and in fact, they couldn’t have survived otherwise. Evolution led bees to adapt ultraviolet vision because flowers leave scatter ultraviolet patterns, allowing the insects to easily identify targets and pollinate. <strong>20 ……….</strong> This is what spectrometers are for.</p>

            <p>Christmas is my favourite time of the year. However, recently I’ve been finding the frenzy of shopping and wrapping gifts very stressful. Worse, I’ve begun to notice my children lose their passion and excitement after opening their 10th gift and I’m left alone under the Christmas tree, surrounded by wrapping paper and ribbons, to finish the task. At such moments I feel Christmas has become far too commercial.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Christmas is a time to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ. It’s a time of God showing his great love for us. It’s also a time for us to be with family and show our love. I’m not saying we should abandon the gift-giving tradition. But Christmas could be less about finding the right present and be as simple as cooking a festive meal for the family, or even making handmade paper snowflakes with the kids. In my group of friends, we no longer exchange Christmas gifts. My kids are allowed to keep five gifts and we donate the rest to orphanages and other charities. I want to teach them to be grateful for what they have and to show compassion to the less privileged. This is the true meaning of Christmas.</p>

            <p>Many have argued Christmas has become too commercial—just a time for toy, card and lighting companies to boost sales. To them I say: “No!”, Christmas remains the season of joy and love. There is nothing more enjoyable than finding the perfect gift for my loved ones. The very quest for these presents encapsulates the caring spirit of Christmas, for these gifts represent my love and thoughts. Nothing fills my heart with more joy than gifting that perfect present to a happy child, and nothing breaks my heart more than a parent who gives those gifts away or tries to teach their kids kindness by depriving them. What is the point? Let them enjoy Christmas and teach them to be charitable all year round and generous by nature. It does not need to become a competition at Christmas about who is least selfish or entitled.</p>

            <p>Christmas is a time to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ. It’s a time of God showing his great love for us. It’s also a time for us to be with family and show our love. I’m not saying we should abandon the gift-giving tradition. But Christmas could be less about finding the right present and be as simple as cooking a festive meal for the family, or even making handmade paper snowflakes with the kids. In my group of friends, we no longer exchange Christmas gifts. My kids are allowed to keep five gifts and we donate the rest to orphanages and other charities. I want to teach them to be grateful for what they have and to show compassion to the less privileged. This is the true meaning of Christmas.</p>

            <p>Many have argued Christmas has become too commercial—just a time for toy, card and lighting companies to boost sales. To them I say: “No!”, Christmas remains the season of joy and love. There is nothing more enjoyable than finding the perfect gift for my loved ones. The very quest for these presents encapsulates the caring spirit of Christmas, for these gifts represent my love and thoughts. Nothing fills my heart with more joy than gifting that perfect present to a happy child, and nothing breaks my heart more than a parent who gives those gifts away or tries to teach their kids kindness by depriving them. What is the point? Let them enjoy Christmas and teach them to be charitable all year round and generous by nature. It does not need to become a competition at Christmas about who is least selfish or entitled.</p>

            <p>Christmas is a time to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ. It’s a time of God showing his great love for us. It’s also a time for us to be with family and show our love. I’m not saying we should abandon the gift-giving tradition. But Christmas could be less about finding the right present and be as simple as cooking a festive meal for the family, or even making handmade paper snowflakes with the kids. In my group of friends, we no longer exchange Christmas gifts. My kids are allowed to keep five gifts and we donate the rest to orphanages and other charities. I want to teach them to be grateful for what they have and to show compassion to the less privileged. This is the true meaning of Christmas.</p>

            <p>My family’s tradition is the perfect example of how the meaning of Christmas is alive and well. As a boy, my son would always ask me to deposit his red money packets from Chinese New Year. One year he asked to keep the money, which I allowed, and he kept it in a small box, which I checked periodically. One day in December I discovered it was gone. When I questioned him, he pulled out a small box containing a tiny charm bracelet that he’d spent the money on and wished me a Merry Christmas. I’ll never forget his huge smile and I’ve kept that bracelet to this day. So, to the cynics out there, stop worrying about the “meaning” of Christmas and just give a little something—for it is in the giving that we share our love and show that we care.</p>

            <p>Christmas is my favourite time of the year. However, recently I’ve been finding the frenzy of shopping and wrapping gifts very stressful. Worse, I’ve begun to notice my children lose their passion and excitement after opening their 10th gift and I’m left alone under the Christmas tree, surrounded by wrapping paper and ribbons, to finish the task. At such moments I feel Christmas has become far too commercial.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>My family’s tradition is the perfect example of how the meaning of Christmas is alive and well. As a boy, my son would always ask me to deposit his red money packets from Chinese New Year. One year he asked to keep the money, which I allowed, and he kept it in a small box, which I checked periodically. One day in December I discovered it was gone. When I questioned him, he pulled out a small box containing a tiny charm bracelet that he’d spent the money on and wished me a Merry Christmas. I’ll never forget his huge smile and I’ve kept that bracelet to this day. So, to the cynics out there, stop worrying about the “meaning” of Christmas and just give a little something—for it is in the giving that we share our love and show that we care.</p>

            <p>Christmas is a time to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ. It’s a time of God showing his great love for us. It’s also a time for us to be with family and show our love. I’m not saying we should abandon the gift-giving tradition. But Christmas could be less about finding the right present and be as simple as cooking a festive meal for the family, or even making handmade paper snowflakes with the kids. In my group of friends, we no longer exchange Christmas gifts. My kids are allowed to keep five gifts and we donate the rest to orphanages and other charities. I want to teach them to be grateful for what they have and to show compassion to the less privileged. This is the true meaning of Christmas.</p>

            <p>Many have argued Christmas has become too commercial—just a time for toy, card and lighting companies to boost sales. To them I say: “No!”, Christmas remains the season of joy and love. There is nothing more enjoyable than finding the perfect gift for my loved ones. The very quest for these presents encapsulates the caring spirit of Christmas, for these gifts represent my love and thoughts. Nothing fills my heart with more joy than gifting that perfect present to a happy child, and nothing breaks my heart more than a parent who gives those gifts away or tries to teach their kids kindness by depriving them. What is the point? Let them enjoy Christmas and teach them to be charitable all year round and generous by nature. It does not need to become a competition at Christmas about who is least selfish or entitled.</p>

            <p>Christmas is a time to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ. It’s a time of God showing his great love for us. It’s also a time for us to be with family and show our love. I’m not saying we should abandon the gift-giving tradition. But Christmas could be less about finding the right present and be as simple as cooking a festive meal for the family, or even making handmade paper snowflakes with the kids. In my group of friends, we no longer exchange Christmas gifts. My kids are allowed to keep five gifts and we donate the rest to orphanages and other charities. I want to teach them to be grateful for what they have and to show compassion to the less privileged. This is the true meaning of Christmas.</p>

            <p>Many have argued Christmas has become too commercial—just a time for toy, card and lighting companies to boost sales. To them I say: “No!”, Christmas remains the season of joy and love. There is nothing more enjoyable than finding the perfect gift for my loved ones. The very quest for these presents encapsulates the caring spirit of Christmas, for these gifts represent my love and thoughts. Nothing fills my heart with more joy than gifting that perfect present to a happy child, and nothing breaks my heart more than a parent who gives those gifts away or tries to teach their kids kindness by depriving them. What is the point? Let them enjoy Christmas and teach them to be charitable all year round and generous by nature. It does not need to become a competition at Christmas about who is least selfish or entitled.</p>

            <p>My family’s tradition is the perfect example of how the meaning of Christmas is alive and well. As a boy, my son would always ask me to deposit his red money packets from Chinese New Year. One year he asked to keep the money, which I allowed, and he kept it in a small box, which I checked periodically. One day in December I discovered it was gone. When I questioned him, he pulled out a small box containing a tiny charm bracelet that he’d spent the money on and wished me a Merry Christmas. I’ll never forget his huge smile and I’ve kept that bracelet to this day. So, to the cynics out there, stop worrying about the “meaning” of Christmas and just give a little something—for it is in the giving that we share our love and show that we care.</p>

            <p>Christmas is my favourite time of the year. However, recently I’ve been finding the frenzy of shopping and wrapping gifts very stressful. Worse, I’ve begun to notice my children lose their passion and excitement after opening their 10th gift and I’m left alone under the Christmas tree, surrounded by wrapping paper and ribbons, to finish the task. At such moments I feel Christmas has become far too commercial.&nbsp;</p>
