Sponsorships are when companies willingly pay influencers to get their brands in front of their audience. Sponsorships are one of the most popular methods by which podcasters make money. However, getting sponsorships can take time. Moreover, you must also keep in mind that the income of the money you make from sponsors or others is often used to create the podcast. For instance, if you earn $10,000 from a sponsor, you may need to invest $5000 into creating another episode for your podcast. Essentially, you will only be keeping the remaining $5000 with you as your income. Various podcast advertising networks can help garner new sponsors.<br>

A lot of podcasters fund their shows out of their own pockets, and some of them turn to their listeners for help. It’s not uncommon for podcasters to set up GoFundMe, Patreon, or Kickstarter accounts to collect donations for their podcasts. Podcasters lead their listeners to crowdfunding websites or ask them to donate directly via other means. For instance, Elecia White and Christopher White turned to Patreon for raising funds to provide their guests with microphones for their podcast Embedded.<br>

While some podcasters choose to fund themselves via sponsors, others prefer the affiliate route. With affiliate links, a podcaster earns a cut of the money that their listeners pay for a brand or service via the podcast, usually by clicking a link. For example, a podcaster could offer listeners a 10% off discount code when using SkillShare. The podcaster will then earn a share of the money that those who used the specific code pay SkillShare.com. Podcasters usually create show notes for their listeners who may include links to the products or services mentioned in the episode.<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
A lot of podcasters have discovered that fans are willing to invest in merchandise to support and promote their favourite podcast. Therefore, a lot of podcasters offer branded merchandise on their website. These can be anything from t-shirts to gift certificates. There are various websites that can be used to distribute these products. Alternatively, podcasters can also buy a product-specific domain name and design a website and a web store from scratch.<br>

Sponsorships are when companies willingly pay influencers to get their brands in front of their audience. Sponsorships are one of the most popular methods by which podcasters make money. However, getting sponsorships can take time. Moreover, you must also keep in mind that the income of the money you make from sponsors or others is often used to create the podcast. For instance, if you earn $10,000 from a sponsor, you may need to invest $5000 into creating another episode for your podcast. Essentially, you will only be keeping the remaining $5000 with you as your income. Various podcast advertising networks can help garner new sponsors.<br>

A lot of podcasters fund their shows out of their own pockets, and some of them turn to their listeners for help. It’s not uncommon for podcasters to set up GoFundMe, Patreon, or Kickstarter accounts to collect donations for their podcasts. Podcasters lead their listeners to crowdfunding websites or ask them to donate directly via other means. For instance, Elecia White and Christopher White turned to Patreon for raising funds to provide their guests with microphones for their podcast Embedded.<br>

While some podcasters choose to fund themselves via sponsors, others prefer the affiliate route. With affiliate links, a podcaster earns a cut of the money that their listeners pay for a brand or service via the podcast, usually by clicking a link. For example, a podcaster could offer listeners a 10% off discount code when using SkillShare. The podcaster will then earn a share of the money that those who used the specific code pay SkillShare.com. Podcasters usually create show notes for their listeners who may include links to the products or services mentioned in the episode.<br>

A lot of podcasters have discovered that fans are willing to invest in merchandise to support and promote their favourite podcast. Therefore, a lot of podcasters offer branded merchandise on their website. These can be anything from t-shirts to gift certificates. There are various websites that can be used to distribute these products. Alternatively, podcasters can also buy a product-specific domain name and design a website and a web store from scratch.<br>

<br>
About crocodiles&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>The crocodilian family consists of 23 kinds of crocodile, alligator, caimans and gharials. They are all reptiles. Crocodiles are large, dangerous reptiles found in tropical climates where the temperatures are very warm all year round. They have longer, narrower snouts than alligators, and the 4th tooth of the lower jaw is outside when the mouth is closed. There are two kinds of crocodile, the estuarine (or saltwater) and the freshwater.</p>
        <p>Their long, flattened tail moves from side to side and propels them through the water, with their legs by their sides. <strong>15 ……….</strong> On land, crocodiles can run very quickly, lifting their bodies up off the ground. The eyes and nostrils are on the top part of the head so that they can lie in the water almost completely hidden from view.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Crocodile Farming and Ranching&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>All crocodilians are protected animals. Many species (kinds) of crocodilian have been saved from extinction by crocodile farming and ranching, in which farmers make their living from crocodile products and from tourism. <strong>16 ……….</strong> Ranching means that farmers have a licence to take a small number of eggs or crocodiles from the wild. This gives more encouragement to people to preserve the wetlands habitat, and therefore the crocodiles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All farming and ranching of crocodiles must meet the strict regulations set by CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna).<strong> 17 ………</strong></p>
        <p>Crocodiles are farmed in Thailand, Indonesia, Australia, and the Philippines, among other countries. Products are made from crocodile skin. <strong>18 ……….</strong> It takes the skins of about four crocodiles to make one bag, as only particular parts of the skin are used. The skin of crocodiles from south-east Asia and Australia are particularly favoured for quality leather goods.</p>
        <p><strong>19 ………. </strong>Thailand supplies the major international fashion companies with crocodile leather to make expensive bags and shoes. The meat is sold for food.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Female crocodiles lay about 50 eggs in a nest. On a crocodile farm, the eggs are removed and placed in an incubator to hatch. The eggs are kept at the correct temperature in the incubator. <strong>20 ………. </strong>The young crocodiles are kept in enclosures until they are about 1.5 metres long.</p>

        <p>Crocodiles are farmed in Thailand, Indonesia, Australia, and the Philippines, among other countries. Products are made from crocodile skin. <strong>18 ……….</strong> It takes the skins of about four crocodiles to make one bag, as only particular parts of the skin are used. The skin of crocodiles from south-east Asia and Australia are particularly favoured for quality leather goods.</p>
        <p><strong>19 ………. </strong>Thailand supplies the major international fashion companies with crocodile leather to make expensive bags and shoes. The meat is sold for food.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Female crocodiles lay about 50 eggs in a nest. On a crocodile farm, the eggs are removed and placed in an incubator to hatch. The eggs are kept at the correct temperature in the incubator. <strong>20 ………. </strong>The young crocodiles are kept in enclosures until they are about 1.5 metres long.</p>

<br>
About crocodiles&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>The crocodilian family consists of 23 kinds of crocodile, alligator, caimans and gharials. They are all reptiles. Crocodiles are large, dangerous reptiles found in tropical climates where the temperatures are very warm all year round. They have longer, narrower snouts than alligators, and the 4th tooth of the lower jaw is outside when the mouth is closed. There are two kinds of crocodile, the estuarine (or saltwater) and the freshwater.</p>
        <p>Their long, flattened tail moves from side to side and propels them through the water, with their legs by their sides. <strong>15 ……….</strong> On land, crocodiles can run very quickly, lifting their bodies up off the ground. The eyes and nostrils are on the top part of the head so that they can lie in the water almost completely hidden from view.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Crocodile Farming and Ranching&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>All crocodilians are protected animals. Many species (kinds) of crocodilian have been saved from extinction by crocodile farming and ranching, in which farmers make their living from crocodile products and from tourism. <strong>16 ……….</strong> Ranching means that farmers have a licence to take a small number of eggs or crocodiles from the wild. This gives more encouragement to people to preserve the wetlands habitat, and therefore the crocodiles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All farming and ranching of crocodiles must meet the strict regulations set by CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna).<strong> 17 ………</strong></p>
        <p>Crocodiles are farmed in Thailand, Indonesia, Australia, and the Philippines, among other countries. Products are made from crocodile skin. <strong>18 ……….</strong> It takes the skins of about four crocodiles to make one bag, as only particular parts of the skin are used. The skin of crocodiles from south-east Asia and Australia are particularly favoured for quality leather goods.</p>
        <p><strong>19 ………. </strong>Thailand supplies the major international fashion companies with crocodile leather to make expensive bags and shoes. The meat is sold for food.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Female crocodiles lay about 50 eggs in a nest. On a crocodile farm, the eggs are removed and placed in an incubator to hatch. The eggs are kept at the correct temperature in the incubator. <strong>20 ………. </strong>The young crocodiles are kept in enclosures until they are about 1.5 metres long.</p>

About crocodiles&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>The crocodilian family consists of 23 kinds of crocodile, alligator, caimans and gharials. They are all reptiles. Crocodiles are large, dangerous reptiles found in tropical climates where the temperatures are very warm all year round. They have longer, narrower snouts than alligators, and the 4th tooth of the lower jaw is outside when the mouth is closed. There are two kinds of crocodile, the estuarine (or saltwater) and the freshwater.</p>
        <p>Their long, flattened tail moves from side to side and propels them through the water, with their legs by their sides. <strong>15 ……….</strong> On land, crocodiles can run very quickly, lifting their bodies up off the ground. The eyes and nostrils are on the top part of the head so that they can lie in the water almost completely hidden from view.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Crocodile Farming and Ranching&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>All crocodilians are protected animals. Many species (kinds) of crocodilian have been saved from extinction by crocodile farming and ranching, in which farmers make their living from crocodile products and from tourism. <strong>16 ……….</strong> Ranching means that farmers have a licence to take a small number of eggs or crocodiles from the wild. This gives more encouragement to people to preserve the wetlands habitat, and therefore the crocodiles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All farming and ranching of crocodiles must meet the strict regulations set by CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna).<strong> 17 ………</strong></p>
        <p>Crocodiles are farmed in Thailand, Indonesia, Australia, and the Philippines, among other countries. Products are made from crocodile skin. <strong>18 ……….</strong> It takes the skins of about four crocodiles to make one bag, as only particular parts of the skin are used. The skin of crocodiles from south-east Asia and Australia are particularly favoured for quality leather goods.</p>
        <p><strong>19 ………. </strong>Thailand supplies the major international fashion companies with crocodile leather to make expensive bags and shoes. The meat is sold for food.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Female crocodiles lay about 50 eggs in a nest. On a crocodile farm, the eggs are removed and placed in an incubator to hatch. The eggs are kept at the correct temperature in the incubator. <strong>20 ………. </strong>The young crocodiles are kept in enclosures until they are about 1.5 metres long.</p>

<br>
About crocodiles&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>The crocodilian family consists of 23 kinds of crocodile, alligator, caimans and gharials. They are all reptiles. Crocodiles are large, dangerous reptiles found in tropical climates where the temperatures are very warm all year round. They have longer, narrower snouts than alligators, and the 4th tooth of the lower jaw is outside when the mouth is closed. There are two kinds of crocodile, the estuarine (or saltwater) and the freshwater.</p>
        <p>Their long, flattened tail moves from side to side and propels them through the water, with their legs by their sides. <strong>15 ……….</strong> On land, crocodiles can run very quickly, lifting their bodies up off the ground. The eyes and nostrils are on the top part of the head so that they can lie in the water almost completely hidden from view.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Crocodile Farming and Ranching&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>All crocodilians are protected animals. Many species (kinds) of crocodilian have been saved from extinction by crocodile farming and ranching, in which farmers make their living from crocodile products and from tourism. <strong>16 ……….</strong> Ranching means that farmers have a licence to take a small number of eggs or crocodiles from the wild. This gives more encouragement to people to preserve the wetlands habitat, and therefore the crocodiles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All farming and ranching of crocodiles must meet the strict regulations set by CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna).<strong> 17 ………</strong></p>
        <p>Crocodiles are farmed in Thailand, Indonesia, Australia, and the Philippines, among other countries. Products are made from crocodile skin. <strong>18 ……….</strong> It takes the skins of about four crocodiles to make one bag, as only particular parts of the skin are used. The skin of crocodiles from south-east Asia and Australia are particularly favoured for quality leather goods.</p>
        <p><strong>19 ………. </strong>Thailand supplies the major international fashion companies with crocodile leather to make expensive bags and shoes. The meat is sold for food.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Female crocodiles lay about 50 eggs in a nest. On a crocodile farm, the eggs are removed and placed in an incubator to hatch. The eggs are kept at the correct temperature in the incubator. <strong>20 ………. </strong>The young crocodiles are kept in enclosures until they are about 1.5 metres long.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>The Sydney Opera House&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
“It stands by itself as one of the indisputable masterpieces of human creativity, not only in the 20th century but in the history of humankind.” Expert evaluation report to the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, 2007.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Sydney Opera House has fused ancient and modernist influences. It was built on a site sacred to the local Gadigal people for thousands of years, <strong>15 ………. </strong>Its design suggests inspiration and imagination. As Pritzker Prize judge Frank Gehry said, “Utzon made a building well ahead of its time, far ahead of available technology. It is a building that has changed the image of an entire country.”</p>
        <p>It was built to “help mould a better and more enlightened community,” said Premier Joseph Cahill in 1954. Today, it is Australia’s number one tourist destination. It welcomes more than 8.2 million visitors a year and is one of the world’s busiest performing arts centres. <strong>16 ………. </strong>The shows come from the work of the seven flagship arts companies to which it is home. It also features First Nations’ arts and culture, talks and ideas, theatre and dance and classical and contemporary music.</p>
        <p>The breadth of those experiences reflects our visionary 1961 Act of Paliament. This charges the Opera House not only with the promotion of artistic taste across all art forms, but also “scientific research into, and the encouragement of, new and improved forms of entertainment.” In 1955, Bennelong Point was declared the site for the proposed new opera house. <strong>17 ………. </strong>The competition guidelines were contained in a 25-page booklet known as the Brown Book. <strong>18 ……….</strong> Competitors were required to register for the competition by paying a fee of 10 Australian pounds.</p>
        <p>Unique among the entries, Utzon’s entry placed the concert halls side by side. Their shellshaped roofs cantilevered out over the end of Bennelong Point, evoking Sydney’s cliffs and the sails on its harbour. It was a sculptural response to both the competition guidelines and the location. It was alone in fully realising the potential of its unique harbour-side location. The building’s design was inspired - entirely unlike anything that had been seen before. <strong>19 ………. </strong>Pressures piled upon its architect, Jørn Utzon, who left Australia midway through construction, never to return to see the building completed.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Utzon’s masterpiece would define his career, and redefine the image of Australia, both to itself and to the world. An exercise in nation building it was an extraordinary collective act of dreaming in public. It was a work of art built for the performance of works of art. <strong>20 ………. </strong>Realising the dream involved us all - visionaries and pragmatists, politicians and architects, engineers, artists and most fundamentally, the people of Australia.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>The Sydney Opera House&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
“It stands by itself as one of the indisputable masterpieces of human creativity, not only in the 20th century but in the history of humankind.” Expert evaluation report to the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, 2007.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Sydney Opera House has fused ancient and modernist influences. It was built on a site sacred to the local Gadigal people for thousands of years, <strong>15 ………. </strong>Its design suggests inspiration and imagination. As Pritzker Prize judge Frank Gehry said, “Utzon made a building well ahead of its time, far ahead of available technology. It is a building that has changed the image of an entire country.”</p>
        <p>It was built to “help mould a better and more enlightened community,” said Premier Joseph Cahill in 1954. Today, it is Australia’s number one tourist destination. It welcomes more than 8.2 million visitors a year and is one of the world’s busiest performing arts centres. <strong>16 ………. </strong>The shows come from the work of the seven flagship arts companies to which it is home. It also features First Nations’ arts and culture, talks and ideas, theatre and dance and classical and contemporary music.</p>
        <p>The breadth of those experiences reflects our visionary 1961 Act of Paliament. This charges the Opera House not only with the promotion of artistic taste across all art forms, but also “scientific research into, and the encouragement of, new and improved forms of entertainment.” In 1955, Bennelong Point was declared the site for the proposed new opera house. <strong>17 ………. </strong>The competition guidelines were contained in a 25-page booklet known as the Brown Book. <strong>18 ……….</strong> Competitors were required to register for the competition by paying a fee of 10 Australian pounds.</p>
        <p>Unique among the entries, Utzon’s entry placed the concert halls side by side. Their shellshaped roofs cantilevered out over the end of Bennelong Point, evoking Sydney’s cliffs and the sails on its harbour. It was a sculptural response to both the competition guidelines and the location. It was alone in fully realising the potential of its unique harbour-side location. The building’s design was inspired - entirely unlike anything that had been seen before. <strong>19 ………. </strong>Pressures piled upon its architect, Jørn Utzon, who left Australia midway through construction, never to return to see the building completed.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Utzon’s masterpiece would define his career, and redefine the image of Australia, both to itself and to the world. An exercise in nation building it was an extraordinary collective act of dreaming in public. It was a work of art built for the performance of works of art. <strong>20 ………. </strong>Realising the dream involved us all - visionaries and pragmatists, politicians and architects, engineers, artists and most fundamentally, the people of Australia.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>The Sydney Opera House&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
“It stands by itself as one of the indisputable masterpieces of human creativity, not only in the 20th century but in the history of humankind.” Expert evaluation report to the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, 2007.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Sydney Opera House has fused ancient and modernist influences. It was built on a site sacred to the local Gadigal people for thousands of years, <strong>15 ………. </strong>Its design suggests inspiration and imagination. As Pritzker Prize judge Frank Gehry said, “Utzon made a building well ahead of its time, far ahead of available technology. It is a building that has changed the image of an entire country.”</p>
        <p>It was built to “help mould a better and more enlightened community,” said Premier Joseph Cahill in 1954. Today, it is Australia’s number one tourist destination. It welcomes more than 8.2 million visitors a year and is one of the world’s busiest performing arts centres. <strong>16 ………. </strong>The shows come from the work of the seven flagship arts companies to which it is home. It also features First Nations’ arts and culture, talks and ideas, theatre and dance and classical and contemporary music.</p>
        <p>The breadth of those experiences reflects our visionary 1961 Act of Paliament. This charges the Opera House not only with the promotion of artistic taste across all art forms, but also “scientific research into, and the encouragement of, new and improved forms of entertainment.” In 1955, Bennelong Point was declared the site for the proposed new opera house. <strong>17 ………. </strong>The competition guidelines were contained in a 25-page booklet known as the Brown Book. <strong>18 ……….</strong> Competitors were required to register for the competition by paying a fee of 10 Australian pounds.</p>
        <p>Unique among the entries, Utzon’s entry placed the concert halls side by side. Their shellshaped roofs cantilevered out over the end of Bennelong Point, evoking Sydney’s cliffs and the sails on its harbour. It was a sculptural response to both the competition guidelines and the location. It was alone in fully realising the potential of its unique harbour-side location. The building’s design was inspired - entirely unlike anything that had been seen before. <strong>19 ………. </strong>Pressures piled upon its architect, Jørn Utzon, who left Australia midway through construction, never to return to see the building completed.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Utzon’s masterpiece would define his career, and redefine the image of Australia, both to itself and to the world. An exercise in nation building it was an extraordinary collective act of dreaming in public. It was a work of art built for the performance of works of art. <strong>20 ………. </strong>Realising the dream involved us all - visionaries and pragmatists, politicians and architects, engineers, artists and most fundamentally, the people of Australia.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>The Sydney Opera House&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
“It stands by itself as one of the indisputable masterpieces of human creativity, not only in the 20th century but in the history of humankind.” Expert evaluation report to the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, 2007.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Sydney Opera House has fused ancient and modernist influences. It was built on a site sacred to the local Gadigal people for thousands of years, <strong>15 ………. </strong>Its design suggests inspiration and imagination. As Pritzker Prize judge Frank Gehry said, “Utzon made a building well ahead of its time, far ahead of available technology. It is a building that has changed the image of an entire country.”</p>
        <p>It was built to “help mould a better and more enlightened community,” said Premier Joseph Cahill in 1954. Today, it is Australia’s number one tourist destination. It welcomes more than 8.2 million visitors a year and is one of the world’s busiest performing arts centres. <strong>16 ………. </strong>The shows come from the work of the seven flagship arts companies to which it is home. It also features First Nations’ arts and culture, talks and ideas, theatre and dance and classical and contemporary music.</p>
        <p>The breadth of those experiences reflects our visionary 1961 Act of Paliament. This charges the Opera House not only with the promotion of artistic taste across all art forms, but also “scientific research into, and the encouragement of, new and improved forms of entertainment.” In 1955, Bennelong Point was declared the site for the proposed new opera house. <strong>17 ………. </strong>The competition guidelines were contained in a 25-page booklet known as the Brown Book. <strong>18 ……….</strong> Competitors were required to register for the competition by paying a fee of 10 Australian pounds.</p>
        <p>Unique among the entries, Utzon’s entry placed the concert halls side by side. Their shellshaped roofs cantilevered out over the end of Bennelong Point, evoking Sydney’s cliffs and the sails on its harbour. It was a sculptural response to both the competition guidelines and the location. It was alone in fully realising the potential of its unique harbour-side location. The building’s design was inspired - entirely unlike anything that had been seen before. <strong>19 ………. </strong>Pressures piled upon its architect, Jørn Utzon, who left Australia midway through construction, never to return to see the building completed.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Utzon’s masterpiece would define his career, and redefine the image of Australia, both to itself and to the world. An exercise in nation building it was an extraordinary collective act of dreaming in public. It was a work of art built for the performance of works of art. <strong>20 ………. </strong>Realising the dream involved us all - visionaries and pragmatists, politicians and architects, engineers, artists and most fundamentally, the people of Australia.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>The Sydney Opera House&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
“It stands by itself as one of the indisputable masterpieces of human creativity, not only in the 20th century but in the history of humankind.” Expert evaluation report to the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, 2007.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Sydney Opera House has fused ancient and modernist influences. It was built on a site sacred to the local Gadigal people for thousands of years, <strong>15 ………. </strong>Its design suggests inspiration and imagination. As Pritzker Prize judge Frank Gehry said, “Utzon made a building well ahead of its time, far ahead of available technology. It is a building that has changed the image of an entire country.”</p>
        <p>It was built to “help mould a better and more enlightened community,” said Premier Joseph Cahill in 1954. Today, it is Australia’s number one tourist destination. It welcomes more than 8.2 million visitors a year and is one of the world’s busiest performing arts centres. <strong>16 ………. </strong>The shows come from the work of the seven flagship arts companies to which it is home. It also features First Nations’ arts and culture, talks and ideas, theatre and dance and classical and contemporary music.</p>
        <p>The breadth of those experiences reflects our visionary 1961 Act of Paliament. This charges the Opera House not only with the promotion of artistic taste across all art forms, but also “scientific research into, and the encouragement of, new and improved forms of entertainment.” In 1955, Bennelong Point was declared the site for the proposed new opera house. <strong>17 ………. </strong>The competition guidelines were contained in a 25-page booklet known as the Brown Book. <strong>18 ……….</strong> Competitors were required to register for the competition by paying a fee of 10 Australian pounds.</p>
        <p>Unique among the entries, Utzon’s entry placed the concert halls side by side. Their shellshaped roofs cantilevered out over the end of Bennelong Point, evoking Sydney’s cliffs and the sails on its harbour. It was a sculptural response to both the competition guidelines and the location. It was alone in fully realising the potential of its unique harbour-side location. The building’s design was inspired - entirely unlike anything that had been seen before. <strong>19 ………. </strong>Pressures piled upon its architect, Jørn Utzon, who left Australia midway through construction, never to return to see the building completed.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Utzon’s masterpiece would define his career, and redefine the image of Australia, both to itself and to the world. An exercise in nation building it was an extraordinary collective act of dreaming in public. It was a work of art built for the performance of works of art. <strong>20 ………. </strong>Realising the dream involved us all - visionaries and pragmatists, politicians and architects, engineers, artists and most fundamentally, the people of Australia.&nbsp;</p>

Do you think you got enough sleep this past week? <strong>15 ……….</strong> If the answer to either of these questions is “no,” you are not alone. <strong>16 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>I doubt you are surprised by this fact, but you may be surprised by the consequences. <strong>17 ……….</strong> substantially increasing your risk of certain diseases. Insufficient sleep appears to be a key lifestyle factor linked to your risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. Inadequate sleep—even moderate reductions for just one week—disrupts blood sugar levels so profoundly that you would be classified as pre-diabetic. <strong>18 ……….</strong>, setting you on a path toward cardiovascular disease, stroke, and congestive heart failure. Fitting Charlotte Brontë’s prophetic wisdom that “a ruffled mind makes a restless pillow,” sleep disruption further contributes to all major psychiatric conditions, including depression and anxiety.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Perhaps you have also noticed a desire to eat more when you’re tired? <strong>19 ……….</strong> Too little sleep swells concentrations of a hormone that makes you feel hungry while suppressing a companion hormone that otherwise signals food satisfaction. <strong>20 ……….</strong> It’s a proven recipe for weight gain in sleep-deficient adults and children alike. Worse, should you attempt to diet but don’t get enough sleep while doing so, it is futile, since most of the weight you lose will come from lean body mass, not fat.</p>

Do you think you got enough sleep this past week? <strong>15 ……….</strong> If the answer to either of these questions is “no,” you are not alone. <strong>16 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>I doubt you are surprised by this fact, but you may be surprised by the consequences. <strong>17 ……….</strong> substantially increasing your risk of certain diseases. Insufficient sleep appears to be a key lifestyle factor linked to your risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. Inadequate sleep—even moderate reductions for just one week—disrupts blood sugar levels so profoundly that you would be classified as pre-diabetic. <strong>18 ……….</strong>, setting you on a path toward cardiovascular disease, stroke, and congestive heart failure. Fitting Charlotte Brontë’s prophetic wisdom that “a ruffled mind makes a restless pillow,” sleep disruption further contributes to all major psychiatric conditions, including depression and anxiety.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Perhaps you have also noticed a desire to eat more when you’re tired? <strong>19 ……….</strong> Too little sleep swells concentrations of a hormone that makes you feel hungry while suppressing a companion hormone that otherwise signals food satisfaction. <strong>20 ……….</strong> It’s a proven recipe for weight gain in sleep-deficient adults and children alike. Worse, should you attempt to diet but don’t get enough sleep while doing so, it is futile, since most of the weight you lose will come from lean body mass, not fat.</p>
