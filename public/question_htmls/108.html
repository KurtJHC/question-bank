        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mr. Alfred Thipps was a small, nervous man, whose flaxen hair was beginning to abandon the unequal struggle with destiny. One might say that his only really marked feature was a large bruise over the left eyebrow, which gave him a faintly dissipated air <strong>incongruous </strong>with the rest of his appearance. Almost in the same breath with his first greeting, he made a self-conscious apology for it, murmuring something about having run against the dining-room door in the dark. He was touched almost to tears by Lord Peter’s thoughtfulness and condescension in calling.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I’m sure it’s most kind of your lordship,” he repeated for the dozenth time, rapidly blinking his weak little eyelids. “I appreciate it very deeply, very deeply, indeed, and so would Mother, only she’s so deaf, I don’t like to trouble you with making her understand. It’s been very hard all day,” he added, “with the policemen in the house and all this commotion. It’s what Mother and me have never been used to, always living very retired, and it’s most distressing to a man of regular habits, my lord, and reely, I’m almost thankful Mother doesn’t understand, for I’m sure it would worry her terribly if she was to know about it. She was upset at first, but she’s made up some idea of her own about it now, and I’m sure it’s all for the best.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The old lady who sat knitting by the fire nodded grimly in response to a look from her son.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I always said as you ought to complain about that bath, Alfred,” she said suddenly, in the high, piping voice peculiar to the deaf, “and it’s to be ’oped the landlord’ll see about it now; not but what I think you might have managed without having the police in, but there! You always were one to make a fuss about a little thing, from chicken-pox up.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“There now,” said Mr. Thipps apologetically, “you see how it is. Not but what it’s just as well she’s settled on that, because she understands we’ve locked up the bathroom and don’t try to go in there. But it’s been a terrible shock to me, sir—my lord, I should say, but there! My nerves are all to pieces. Such a thing has never ’appened—happened to me in all my born days. Such a state I was in this morning—I didn’t know if I was on my head or my heels—I reely didn’t, and my heart not being too strong, I hardly knew how to get out of that horrid room and telephone for the police. It’s affected me, sir, it’s affected me, it reely has—I couldn’t touch a bit of breakfast, nor lunch neither, and what with telephoning and putting off clients and interviewing people all morning, I’ve hardly known what to do with myself.”</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I always said as you ought to complain about that bath, Alfred,” she said suddenly, in the high, piping voice peculiar to the deaf, “and it’s to be ’oped the landlord’ll see about it now; not but what I think you might have managed without having the police in, but there! You always were one to make a fuss about a little thing, from chicken-pox up.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“There now,” said Mr. Thipps apologetically, “you see how it is. Not but what it’s just as well she’s settled on that, because she understands we’ve locked up the bathroom and don’t try to go in there. But it’s been a terrible shock to me, sir—my lord, I should say, but there! My nerves are all to pieces. Such a thing has never ’appened—happened to me in all my born days. Such a state I was in this morning—I didn’t know if I was on my head or my heels—I reely didn’t, and my heart not being too strong, I hardly knew how to get out of that horrid room and telephone for the police. It’s affected me, sir, it’s affected me, it reely has—I couldn’t touch a bit of breakfast, nor lunch neither, and what with telephoning and putting off clients and interviewing people all morning, I’ve hardly known what to do with myself.”</p>

          <strong>Read the following passage and answer questions 43 – 48.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mr. Alfred Thipps was a small, nervous man, whose flaxen hair was beginning to abandon the unequal struggle with destiny. One might say that his only really marked feature was a large bruise over the left eyebrow, which gave him a faintly dissipated air <strong>incongruous </strong>with the rest of his appearance. Almost in the same breath with his first greeting, he made a self-conscious apology for it, murmuring something about having run against the dining-room door in the dark. He was touched almost to tears by Lord Peter’s thoughtfulness and condescension in calling.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I’m sure it’s most kind of your lordship,” he repeated for the dozenth time, rapidly blinking his weak little eyelids. “I appreciate it very deeply, very deeply, indeed, and so would Mother, only she’s so deaf, I don’t like to trouble you with making her understand. It’s been very hard all day,” he added, “with the policemen in the house and all this commotion. It’s what Mother and me have never been used to, always living very retired, and it’s most distressing to a man of regular habits, my lord, and reely, I’m almost thankful Mother doesn’t understand, for I’m sure it would worry her terribly if she was to know about it. She was upset at first, but she’s made up some idea of her own about it now, and I’m sure it’s all for the best.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The old lady who sat knitting by the fire nodded grimly in response to a look from her son.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I always said as you ought to complain about that bath, Alfred,” she said suddenly, in the high, piping voice peculiar to the deaf, “and it’s to be ’oped the landlord’ll see about it now; not but what I think you might have managed without having the police in, but there!

          <strong>Our American Trees</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <em>by Robert C. Birkby</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The largest and oldest living things on earth are trees. Over a thousand kinds grow in the United States, and thousands more flourish in other parts of the world. Trees play a very important role in the health of the environment and in the lives of people. The following are a few of the benefits we enjoy from trees:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Trees pump oxygen into the air. The great forests of the world are essential for purifying the air and maintaining the right balance of oxygen in the atmosphere.</li>
          <li>Leaves on branches and on the ground slow falling rain so that it can seep into the earth. Roots keep dirt from washing away. Fallen leaves decay in the soil and enrich it.</li>
          <li>Trees provide shelter and food for wildlife. A forest is a complicated web of relationships among hundreds of types of plants and animals. That diversity helps all species survive. Strong forests increase the stability of the environment.</li>
          <li>Trees provide shelter and food for humans, too. Lumber goes into homes. Fruits, berries, nuts, and oils feed us. Other products of trees include paper, rubber, spices, and medicines.</li>
          <li>Shaded yards and city parks offer us places close to home where we can relax and play. Hiking and camping let us explore vast forests and wilderness areas.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Parts of a Tree</strong>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Roots</strong>. Much of a tree is out of sight beneath the ground. Growing very quickly, thousands of tiny root hairs push through the earth, absorbing moisture and sending it up into the tree. A root system is also the anchor holding a tree upright even in storms and high winds.</p>
        <p><strong>Trunks</strong>. The <em>bark </em>on a tree trunk gives the plant a tough outer armor. <em>Sapwood </em>underneath the bark transports moisture from the roots up to the leaves. Between the sapwood and bark is a thin layer of tissue called the <em>cambium </em>layer. It channels food produced by the leaves down into the tree trunk and the roots. In the center of the trunk is hardened sapwood called <em>heartwood </em>that gives the tree strength. Each year the cambium builds a new layer of sapwood around the trunk. Count the rings formed by the layers and you’ll know how many years a tree was alive.</p>
        <p><strong>Leaves</strong>. The green chlorophyll in the leaves draws power from sunlight and converts carbon dioxide in the air into nutrients for the tree. Called <em>photosynthesis</em>, this process returns oxygen to the atmosphere. It is an important way for the air to be cleaned and refreshed with oxygen.</p>
        <p>The two large groups of American trees are <em>conifer </em>trees and <em>broadleaf </em>trees. Conifers, also known as <em>evergreens</em>, have needlelike or scalelike leaves that usually stay on the trees for several years. Broadleaf trees have flat leaves that generally fall off in the autumn.</p>
