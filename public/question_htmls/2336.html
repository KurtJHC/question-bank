Mention pro wrestling in public and you’re likely to get a livelier debate than you would with politics or philosophy. <strong>(A)</strong> ………. Who was the greatest wrestler ever? The basic idea of wrestling -- two people competing in a physical combat -- is ancient. The Greeks engaged in a form of wrestling that has survived today as freestyle wrestling. The Roman Empire adopted elements of Greek wrestling with an emphasis on brute strength. <strong>(B)&nbsp;</strong> ………. Freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestling are the two international amateur forms practised today in the Olympic Games. <strong>(C)&nbsp;</strong> ………. Points determine winners, and violations result in disqualifications.</p>
        <p>How is professional wrestling different? <strong>(D)&nbsp;</strong> ………. They also tend to be more skilled. A sporting commission regulates amateur wrestling, but pro wrestling is intentionally unregulated. In its early days, wrestling fell under the state sporting commission authority. League owners soon realised that they could avoid the hassle by classifying their shows as entertainment rather than a competitive sport.</p>
        <p>Does that mean that wrestling is fake? <strong>(E)&nbsp;</strong> ………. Wrestlers aren't really trying to beat up and injure each other. Sometimes, the bitterest enemies in the ring are really best friends, and the outlandish stories surrounding the characters are usually not true. <strong>(F)&nbsp;</strong> ………. When you see a movie, you know that the actor didn't really jump a burning car over an exploding bridge, but you're still entertained. Stunt people and special effects crews worked to make those scenes seem real, and their work can be very impressive.</p>

<br>
The weekend evolved from the religious concept of the sabbath, a day devoted to God and not work. In Jewish tradition, the sabbath is from sunset on Friday to sunset on Saturday. Most Christians eventually adopted Sunday as their day of worship and rest. Over time, workplaces in Western countries began to accommodate those religious observances. Professor Greg Patmore, a labour and business historian at the University of Sydney, says Australia's early convicts were encouraged to spend Sundays at church, which was seen as good for their character.<br>

<br>
The two-day weekend evolved alongside campaigns for a shorter working week. Workers in 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> century Britain started to ask for longer breaks from the harsh working conditions of industrialisation – as opposed to farming, which depended on daylight and the demands of the farm. <em>Waiting for the Weekend</em> author Witold Rybczynski noted that employers were also willing to give workers more time to recover from drinking, which is how many employees spent their time off. A shorter or half-day Saturday was seen as a natural lead-in to Sunday's day of rest. The Oxford English Dictionary traces the first use of the word "weekend" to 1879, when British magazine <em>Notes and Queries</em> observed: "If a person leaves home at the end of his week's work on the Saturday afternoon to spend the evening of Saturday and the following Sunday with friends at a distance, he is said to be spending his week-end at so-and-so."<br>

<br>
Professor Patmore says Melbourne and Sydney stonemasons in 1856 became some of the first people in the world to successfully campaign for an eight-hour workday. They argued that labouring long hours in the Australian heat was bad for their health. Australia earned a reputation around the world as a "working man's paradise". But it wasn't until 1916 that an eight-hour day was commonplace, and even then, most people worked close to nine hours each day Monday through Friday and four hours on Saturday. The work week was finally reduced to 40 hours in 1948 and to 38 hours in 1983. In the postwar era, when families had more time and money for leisurely pursuits and vacation, the two-day weekend became standard.<br>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of weekends. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
While Australians don't go to church in the numbers they once did, the notion of the weekend as a break from labour remains. According to the Productivity Commission's draft report, however, a more "flexible" labour market has made weekend work more common again. "The traditional Monday-Friday week is not dead, but nor is it as predominant as in the past," the report says, noting that one in three working Australians work at least one Saturday or Sunday each week. Consumers now expect certain businesses – particularly in hospitality, entertainment and retail – to open on weekends. Australians want to be able to do their shopping or grab a coffee seven days a week, making it more important for employers to have people working during those hours and less important for them to have people working on Mondays, for example.&nbsp;</div>

What did you pretend to be when you were a child? A doctor? An astronaut? A parent? Perhaps you pretended to be a paleontologist, wearing a camouflage vest and digging up “dinosaur bones”? Playing dress-up as a child is something of a rite of passage. <strong>(A)&nbsp;</strong>………. But did you know there are social and emotional benefits to dressing up? <strong>(B)</strong> ……….&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Dress-up is an ideal way for young children to work on so many early childhood development skills: literacies, life skills, and creative play,” according to Dr. Karen Aronian, a longtime schoolteacher, college professor, and the founder of Aronian Education Design. But that’s not all.</p>
        <p>Dressing up is a form of imaginative play — and imaginative play boosts problem-solving and self-regulation skills. <strong>(C)</strong> ………. They’re able to test out new ideas and behaviours in a comfortable environment. Dress-up encourages creative thinking and communication skills. <strong>(D)</strong> ………. Playing with another child or adult requires teamwork, cooperation, and sharing.</p>
        <p>The act of putting on and taking off costumes or outfits also has physical benefits. <strong>(E)</strong>………. “Children are stretching their imaginations through different identities and occupations in dress up and practising their gross and fine motor skills,” Aronian says. <strong>(F)</strong>………. From buttoning a jacket to negotiating roles and engaging in teamwork, learning opportunities abound. And they can be further developed with a little extra effort. As Aronian suggests, “There are many opportunities to expand literacies by talking about the dress-up scenarios that children fashion.”</p>
        <p>Asking questions about the characters or scenes they’ve created and encouraging them to talk through their play helps them to build conversational skills. She also encourages writing down and posting their new vocabulary in their play space.&nbsp;</p>

<br>
The climatology method of weather prediction offers a simple technique for generating a weather forecast. Meteorologists use this method after reviewing weather statistics gathered over multiple years and calculating the averages. They predict the weather for a specific day and location based on the weather conditions for that same day for several years in the past.<br>
<br>
A forecaster could examine the averages for Labour Day in Virginia, for example, to predict the weather for the upcoming Labour Day. The climatology method works when weather patterns remain in place, but in situations where outside factors change the weather frequently, as in climate changes due to global warming, the climatology method is not the best choice for predicting the weather, as it will more than likely not be accurate.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of dreams. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
The analog method of weather prediction is a difficult method to use when predicting the weather because it requires finding a day in the past with weather similar to the current forecast, which is difficult to do. For example, suppose the current forecast indicates a warm day with a cold front imminent in the region of the forecast.<br>
<br>
The weather person might remember a similar day in the past month, a warm day with a cold front arriving, which led to the development of thunderstorms later in the day. The forecaster could predict the same type of weather based on the analog comparison, but even small differences between the past and the present can change the outcome, which is why the analog method may not be the right choice to compile a weather forecast.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of dreams. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
The persistence and trends method of weather prediction requires little to no skill to predict the weather because it relies on past trends. In an ideal world, the atmosphere changes slowly, which equates to a forecast tomorrow that stays the same as today, with a hat tip to the climate's norm for the specific time of year. This method requires only that you stay abreast of current temperatures and conditions and know the region's climate averages.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of dreams. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Numerical weather prediction method relies on computers to predict the weather. Massive supercomputers, complete with software forecasting models, help meteorologists make weather predictions based on multiple conditions in the atmosphere such as temperatures, wind speed, high- and low-pressure systems, rainfall, snowfall and other conditions.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The weather person reviews the data to determine the weather forecast for the day. The forecast is only as good as the algorithms used by the computer's software to predict the weather. If some of the equations lack precision, they lead to errors. All in all, numerical weather prediction provides the best means to forecast the upcoming meteorological conditions when compared with the other methods.<br>
