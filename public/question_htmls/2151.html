        <p>{^<strong>&nbsp;Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
What makes a good kids’ movie? Well, for me, a good kids’ movie has to appeal to people of all ages, and not just kids. Yes, you need an interesting story and characters, but you can say that about every film project.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The special kids’ / family films have heart and most of them also have an important message to teach. Need examples? How about the early animated Disney films? Were Snow White and Pinocchio and Bambi kids’ films? I would say yes. But, of course, they were much more than that. Everything about these movies is memorable – scenes, characters, dialogue. And while they were thought to be only for kids, as they were cartoons, parents and other adults loved them just as much as the youngsters back when they were first released, and still do today.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Currently, Pixar is the leading studio when it comes to great kids’ movies. ‘Toy Story’, ‘Ratatouille’ and ‘Up’ are among the Pixar films that work for both adults and kids. And, once again, it’s because of their interesting stories and characters.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
DreamWorks and Blue Sky are two other studios who have figured this out, while others continue to try and fail. Hollywood produces so many bad kids’ comedies each year, and most of them have the same things in common: too much slapstick and bathroom humour; silly plots; and unlikeable and unbelievable characters. All of these elements are clearly present in the latest bad kids’ film – ‘Furry Vengeance’ – but you can also find them in ‘Diary of a Wimpy Kid’, ‘Shorts’ and other recent live-action family comedies.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Disney's Africa-set family classic, ‘The Lion King’ has been voted the best animated film of all time - as if that will come as any surprise to you, as it's a stone-cold classic. Yep, now Simba's not only the king of Pride Rock, he's also top dog (or cat) of the animated movie world, having been awarded the number one spot by voters on Ranker.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
"The best animated films of all time are an assortment of animated movies that rank among the best movies of all time," the site says. "While the characters might be brightly coloured and possess abilities most real people could only wish to ever have, the stories and imagery speak to everyone and have set these movies up to become the best animated films ever." The film was followed in the runner-up spots by 1995's Toy Story and 2003's Finding Nemo in second and third place, respectively.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Popular Hollywood kids’ movies traditionally follow a three-act formula. Consider the beginning of Ratatouille, when Remy the rat, lost in the Parisian underground, sniffs his way into the kitchen of legendary restaurant Gusteau’s. In this first act, we uncover the furry protagonist’s central conflict: he yearns to cook, but being a rodent makes it tricky!<br>
<br>
Films can break the three-act structure. James Bonnet, a film writing instructor, says if a movie simply focuses on two elements – the action creating the problem, and the action resolving it – it will still work. Regardless of how many acts a movie has, it must have events that advance the plot, or main story – which screenplay consultant Michael Hauge calls turning points – as well as a likable but complex protagonist, or primary character, who has a problem to solve.<br>

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
What makes a good kids’ movie? Well, for me, a good kids’ movie has to appeal to people of all ages, and not just kids. Yes, you need an interesting story and characters, but you can say that about every film project.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The special kids’ / family films have heart and most of them also have an important message to teach. Need examples? How about the early animated Disney films? Were Snow White and Pinocchio and Bambi kids’ films? I would say yes. But, of course, they were much more than that. Everything about these movies is memorable – scenes, characters, dialogue. And while they were thought to be only for kids, as they were cartoons, parents and other adults loved them just as much as the youngsters back when they were first released, and still do today.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Currently, Pixar is the leading studio when it comes to great kids’ movies. ‘Toy Story’, ‘Ratatouille’ and ‘Up’ are among the Pixar films that work for both adults and kids. And, once again, it’s because of their interesting stories and characters.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
DreamWorks and Blue Sky are two other studios who have figured this out, while others continue to try and fail. Hollywood produces so many bad kids’ comedies each year, and most of them have the same things in common: too much slapstick and bathroom humour; silly plots; and unlikeable and unbelievable characters. All of these elements are clearly present in the latest bad kids’ film – ‘Furry Vengeance’ – but you can also find them in ‘Diary of a Wimpy Kid’, ‘Shorts’ and other recent live-action family comedies.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Disney's Africa-set family classic, ‘The Lion King’ has been voted the best animated film of all time - as if that will come as any surprise to you, as it's a stone-cold classic. Yep, now Simba's not only the king of Pride Rock, he's also top dog (or cat) of the animated movie world, having been awarded the number one spot by voters on Ranker.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
"The best animated films of all time are an assortment of animated movies that rank among the best movies of all time," the site says. "While the characters might be brightly coloured and possess abilities most real people could only wish to ever have, the stories and imagery speak to everyone and have set these movies up to become the best animated films ever." The film was followed in the runner-up spots by 1995's Toy Story and 2003's Finding Nemo in second and third place, respectively.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Popular Hollywood kids’ movies traditionally follow a three-act formula. Consider the beginning of Ratatouille, when Remy the rat, lost in the Parisian underground, sniffs his way into the kitchen of legendary restaurant Gusteau’s. In this first act, we uncover the furry protagonist’s central conflict: he yearns to cook, but being a rodent makes it tricky!<br>
<br>
Films can break the three-act structure. James Bonnet, a film writing instructor, says if a movie simply focuses on two elements – the action creating the problem, and the action resolving it – it will still work. Regardless of how many acts a movie has, it must have events that advance the plot, or main story – which screenplay consultant Michael Hauge calls turning points – as well as a likable but complex protagonist, or primary character, who has a problem to solve.<br>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Dolphins and Porpoises&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Dolphins and porpoises delight us with their playful antics and warm our hearts with their friendly faces. Marine species are the most well-known, but there are several species that live in freshwater rivers. All are air-breathing, warm-blooded mammals that nurse their young.<strong> 15 ……….</strong> Dolphins have longer snouts, bigger mouths, more curved dorsal fins, and longer, leaner bodies than porpoises.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>People use the terms dolphins, porpoises, and whales to describe marine mammals belonging to the order Cetacea (from the Greek work ketos, “large sea creature”). <strong>16 ……</strong> The orca, or killer whale, for example, is actually the largest member of the dolphin family. Dolphins and porpoises are at the top of the food chain and have an important role in the overall balance of the marine environment. They can tell us a lot about the health of the ocean. This includes the presence of pollution or the decline in fish. They are also very popular with tourists.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dolphins are by far more prevalent than porpoises. Most scientists agree that there are 32 dolphin species (plus five closely related species of river dolphin) and only six porpoise species. The harbour porpoise, for example, has small, pointed flippers and no beak. The dorsal fin is small and triangular-shaped.<strong> 17 ……….</strong> Both have large, complex brains and a structure in their foreheads, called the melon. With this they generate sonar (sound waves) to navigate their underwater world.</p>
        <p><strong>18 ……….</strong> Dolphins and porpoises differ in their faces, fins, and body shapes. Dolphins have longer noses, bigger mouths, more curved dorsal fins, and longer, leaner bodies than porpoises. The Northeastern Spotted Dolphin has a falcate, or sickle-shaped dorsal fin and light spotting on the belly.</p>
        <p>Other differences also include their faces (who can forget Flipper’s famous “grin”?), their fins, and their figures. Dolphins tend to have prominent, elongated “beaks”, while porpoises have smaller mouths. But the central distinguishing feature is actually their teeth. Dolphins all have cone-shaped teeth, whereas porpoises have flat, spade- shaped teeth. While this distinction may be apparent on a skull in a museum, it’s a tricky one to make in the field. <strong>19 ……….</strong> The dolphin’s hooked or curved dorsal fin (the one in the middle of the animal’s back) also differs from the porpoise’s triangular dorsal fin. Generally speaking, dolphin bodies are leaner, and porpoises’ bodies are portly.</p>
        <p>Dolphins are also more talkative than porpoises. Dolphins make whistling sounds through their blowholes to communicate with one another underwater. Scientists are pretty sure that porpoises do not do this. <strong>20 ……….</strong> It is likely that more (or fewer) differences&nbsp;between dolphins and porpoises will be revealed as researchers continue to investigate these intriguing sentinels of the sea.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Dolphins and Porpoises&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Dolphins and porpoises delight us with their playful antics and warm our hearts with their friendly faces. Marine species are the most well-known, but there are several species that live in freshwater rivers. All are air-breathing, warm-blooded mammals that nurse their young.&nbsp;<strong>15 ……….</strong>&nbsp;Dolphins have longer snouts, bigger mouths, more curved dorsal fins, and longer, leaner bodies than porpoises.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>People use the terms dolphins, porpoises, and whales to describe marine mammals belonging to the order Cetacea (from the Greek work ketos, “large sea creature”).&nbsp;<strong>16 ……&nbsp;</strong>The orca, or killer whale, for example, is actually the largest member of the dolphin family. Dolphins and porpoises are at the top of the food chain and have an important role in the overall balance of the marine environment. They can tell us a lot about the health of the ocean. This includes the presence of pollution or the decline in fish. They are also very popular with tourists.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dolphins are by far more prevalent than porpoises. Most scientists agree that there are 32 dolphin species (plus five closely related species of river dolphin) and only six porpoise species. The harbour porpoise, for example, has small, pointed flippers and no beak. The dorsal fin is small and triangular-shaped.&nbsp;<strong>17 ……….&nbsp;</strong>Both have large, complex brains and a structure in their foreheads, called the melon. With this they generate sonar (sound waves) to navigate their underwater world.</p>
        <p><strong>18 ……….</strong>&nbsp;Dolphins and porpoises differ in their faces, fins, and body shapes. Dolphins have longer noses, bigger mouths, more curved dorsal fins, and longer, leaner bodies than porpoises. The Northeastern Spotted Dolphin has a falcate, or sickle-shaped dorsal fin and light spotting on the belly.</p>
        <p>Other differences also include their faces (who can forget Flipper’s famous “grin”?), their fins, and their figures. Dolphins tend to have prominent, elongated “beaks”, while porpoises have smaller mouths. But the central distinguishing feature is actually their teeth. Dolphins all have cone-shaped teeth, whereas porpoises have flat, spade- shaped teeth. While this distinction may be apparent on a skull in a museum, it’s a tricky one to make in the field.&nbsp;<strong>19 ……….</strong>&nbsp;The dolphin’s hooked or curved dorsal fin (the one in the middle of the animal’s back) also differs from the porpoise’s triangular dorsal fin. Generally speaking, dolphin bodies are leaner, and porpoises’ bodies are portly.</p>
        <p>Dolphins are also more talkative than porpoises. Dolphins make whistling sounds through their blowholes to communicate with one another underwater. Scientists are pretty sure that porpoises do not do this.&nbsp;<strong>20 ……….</strong>&nbsp;It is likely that more (or fewer) differences&nbsp;between dolphins and porpoises will be revealed as researchers continue to investigate these intriguing sentinels of the sea.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Dolphins and Porpoises&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Dolphins and porpoises delight us with their playful antics and warm our hearts with their friendly faces. Marine species are the most well-known, but there are several species that live in freshwater rivers. All are air-breathing, warm-blooded mammals that nurse their young.<strong> 15 ……….</strong> Dolphins have longer snouts, bigger mouths, more curved dorsal fins, and longer, leaner bodies than porpoises.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>People use the terms dolphins, porpoises, and whales to describe marine mammals belonging to the order Cetacea (from the Greek work ketos, “large sea creature”). <strong>16 ……</strong> The orca, or killer whale, for example, is actually the largest member of the dolphin family. Dolphins and porpoises are at the top of the food chain and have an important role in the overall balance of the marine environment. They can tell us a lot about the health of the ocean. This includes the presence of pollution or the decline in fish. They are also very popular with tourists.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dolphins are by far more prevalent than porpoises. Most scientists agree that there are 32 dolphin species (plus five closely related species of river dolphin) and only six porpoise species. The harbour porpoise, for example, has small, pointed flippers and no beak. The dorsal fin is small and triangular-shaped.<strong> 17 ……….</strong> Both have large, complex brains and a structure in their foreheads, called the melon. With this they generate sonar (sound waves) to navigate their underwater world.</p>
        <p><strong>18 ……….</strong> Dolphins and porpoises differ in their faces, fins, and body shapes. Dolphins have longer noses, bigger mouths, more curved dorsal fins, and longer, leaner bodies than porpoises. The Northeastern Spotted Dolphin has a falcate, or sickle-shaped dorsal fin and light spotting on the belly.</p>
        <p>Other differences also include their faces (who can forget Flipper’s famous “grin”?), their fins, and their figures. Dolphins tend to have prominent, elongated “beaks”, while porpoises have smaller mouths. But the central distinguishing feature is actually their teeth. Dolphins all have cone-shaped teeth, whereas porpoises have flat, spade- shaped teeth. While this distinction may be apparent on a skull in a museum, it’s a tricky one to make in the field. <strong>19 ……….</strong> The dolphin’s hooked or curved dorsal fin (the one in the middle of the animal’s back) also differs from the porpoise’s triangular dorsal fin. Generally speaking, dolphin bodies are leaner, and porpoises’ bodies are portly.</p>
        <p>Dolphins are also more talkative than porpoises. Dolphins make whistling sounds through their blowholes to communicate with one another underwater. Scientists are pretty sure that porpoises do not do this. <strong>20 ……….</strong> It is likely that more (or fewer) differences&nbsp;between dolphins and porpoises will be revealed as researchers continue to investigate these intriguing sentinels of the sea.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>LASSIE COME HOME&nbsp;</strong><br><em>by Eric Knight&nbsp;</em><br><br>
Everyone in Greenall Bridge knew Sam Carraclough’s Lassie. In fact, you might say that she was the best-known dog in the village — and for three reasons.</p>
        <p>First, because nearly every man in the village agreed she was the finest collie he had ever laid eyes on. This was praise indeed, for Greenall Bridge is in the county of Yorkshire, and of all places in the world it is here that the dog is really king. In that bleak part of northern England, the dog seems to thrive as it does nowhere else. The wind and the cold rains sweep over the flat moorlands, making the dogs rich-coated and as sturdy as the people who live there.</p>
        <p>The people love dogs and are clever at raising them. You can go into any one of the hundreds of small mining villages in this largest of England’s counties, and see, walking at the heels of humbly clad workmen, dogs of such a fine breed and aristocratic bearing as to arouse the envy of wealthier dog fanciers from other parts of the world.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And Greenall Bridge was like other Yorkshire villages. Its men knew and understood and loved dogs, and there were many perfect ones that walked at men’s heels; but they all agreed that if a finer dog than Sam Carraclough’s tricolour collie had ever been bred in Greenall Bridge, then it must have been long before they were born.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But there was another reason why Lassie was so well known in the village. It was because, as the women said, “You can set your clock by her.” That had begun many years before, when Lassie was a bright, harum-scarum yearling. One day Sam Carraclough’s boy, Joe, had come home bubbling with excitement.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Mother! I come out of school today, and who do you think was sitting there waiting for me? Lassie! Now how do you think she knew where I was?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“She must have picked up your scent, Joe. That’s all I can figure out.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Whatever it was, Lassie was waiting at the school gate the next day, and the next. And the weeks and the months and the years had gone past, and it had always been the same. Women glancing through the windows of their cottages, or shopkeepers standing in the doors on High Street, would see the proud black-white-and-golden-sable dog go past on a steady trot, and would say:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Must be five minutes to four — there goes Lassie!”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Rain or shine, the dog was always there, waiting for a boy — one of dozens who would come pelting across the concrete playground — but for the dog, the only one who&nbsp;mattered. Always there would be the moment of happy greeting, and then, together, the boy and the dog would go home. For four years it had always been the same.</p>
        <p>Lassie was a well-loved figure in the daily life of the village. Almost everyone knew her. But, most of all, the people of Greenall Bridge were proud of Lassie because she stood for something that they could not have explained readily. It had something to do with their pride. And their pride had something to do with money.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Generally, when a man raised an especially fine dog, some day it would stop being a dog and instead would become something on four legs that was worth money. It was still a dog, of course, but now it was something else, too, for a rich man might hear of it, or the alert dealers or kennelmen might see it, and then they would want to buy it. While a rich man may love a dog just as truly as a poor man, and there is no difference in them in this, there is a difference between them in the way they must look at money. For the poor man sits and thinks about how much coal he will need that winter, and how many pairs of shoes will be necessary, and how much food his children ought to have to keep them sturdy — and then he will go home and say:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Now, I had to do it, so don’t plague me! We’ll raise another dog someday, and ye’ll all love it just as much as ye did this one.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That way, many fine dogs had gone from homes in Greenall Bridge. But not Lassie! Why, the whole village knew that not even the Duke of Rudling had been able to buy Lassie from Sam Carraclough — the very Duke himself who lived in his great estate a mile beyond the village and who had his kennels full of fine dogs. For three years the Duke had been trying to buy Lassie from Sam Carraclough, and Sam had merely stood his ground.</p>
        <p>“It’s no use raising your price again, Your Lordship,” he would say. “It’s just — well, she’s not for sale for no price.”&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>LASSIE COME HOME&nbsp;</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Eric Knight&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>Everyone in Greenall Bridge knew Sam Carraclough’s Lassie. In fact, you might say that she was the best-known dog in the village — and for three reasons.</p>
        <p>First, because nearly every man in the village agreed she was the finest collie he had ever laid eyes on. This was praise indeed, for Greenall Bridge is in the county of Yorkshire, and of all places in the world it is here that the dog is really king. In that bleak part of northern England, the dog seems to thrive as it does nowhere else. The wind and the cold rains sweep over the flat moorlands, making the dogs rich-coated and as sturdy as the people who live there.</p>
        <p>The people love dogs and are clever at raising them. You can go into any one of the hundreds of small mining villages in this largest of England’s counties, and see, walking at the heels of humbly clad workmen, dogs of such a fine breed and aristocratic bearing as to arouse the envy of wealthier dog fanciers from other parts of the world.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And Greenall Bridge was like other Yorkshire villages. Its men knew and understood and loved dogs, and there were many perfect ones that walked at men’s heels; but they all agreed that if a finer dog than Sam Carraclough’s tricolour collie had ever been bred in Greenall Bridge, then it must have been long before they were born.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But there was another reason why Lassie was so well known in the village. It was because, as the women said, “You can set your clock by her.” That had begun many years before, when Lassie was a bright, harum-scarum yearling. One day Sam Carraclough’s boy, Joe, had come home bubbling with excitement.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Mother! I come out of school today, and who do you think was sitting there waiting for me? Lassie! Now how do you think she knew where I was?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“She must have picked up your scent, Joe. That’s all I can figure out.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Whatever it was, Lassie was waiting at the school gate the next day, and the next. And the weeks and the months and the years had gone past, and it had always been the same. Women glancing through the windows of their cottages, or shopkeepers standing in the doors on High Street, would see the proud black-white-and-golden-sable dog go past on a steady trot, and would say:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Must be five minutes to four — there goes Lassie!”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Rain or shine, the dog was always there, waiting for a boy — one of dozens who would come pelting across the concrete playground — but for the dog, the only one who&nbsp;mattered. Always there would be the moment of happy greeting, and then, together, the boy and the dog would go home. For four years it had always been the same.</p>
        <p>Lassie was a well-loved figure in the daily life of the village. Almost everyone knew her. But, most of all, the people of Greenall Bridge were proud of Lassie because she stood for something that they could not have explained readily. It had something to do with their pride. And their pride had something to do with money.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Generally, when a man raised an especially fine dog, some day it would stop being a dog and instead would become something on four legs that was worth money. It was still a dog, of course, but now it was something else, too, for a rich man might hear of it, or the alert dealers or kennelmen might see it, and then they would want to buy it. While a rich man may love a dog just as truly as a poor man, and there is no difference in them in this, there is a difference between them in the way they must look at money. For the poor man sits and thinks about how much coal he will need that winter, and how many pairs of shoes will be necessary, and how much food his children ought to have to keep them sturdy — and then he will go home and say:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Now, I had to do it, so don’t plague me! We’ll raise another dog someday, and ye’ll all love it just as much as ye did this one.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That way, many fine dogs had gone from homes in Greenall Bridge. But not Lassie! Why, the whole village knew that not even the Duke of Rudling had been able to buy Lassie from Sam Carraclough — the very Duke himself who lived in his great estate a mile beyond the village and who had his kennels full of fine dogs. For three years the Duke had been trying to buy Lassie from Sam Carraclough, and Sam had merely stood his ground.</p>
        <p>“It’s no use raising your price again, Your Lordship,” he would say. “It’s just — well, she’s not for sale for no price.”&nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>LASSIE COME HOME&nbsp;</strong><br><em>by Eric Knight&nbsp;</em><br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Everyone in Greenall Bridge knew Sam Carraclough’s Lassie. In fact, you might say that she was the best-known dog in the village — and for three reasons.</p>
        <p>First, because nearly every man in the village agreed she was the finest collie he had ever laid eyes on. This was praise indeed, for Greenall Bridge is in the county of Yorkshire, and of all places in the world it is here that the dog is really king. In that bleak part of northern England, the dog seems to thrive as it does nowhere else. The wind and the cold rains sweep over the flat moorlands, making the dogs rich-coated and as sturdy as the people who live there.</p>
        <p>The people love dogs and are clever at raising them. You can go into any one of the hundreds of small mining villages in this largest of England’s counties, and see, walking at the heels of humbly clad workmen, dogs of such a fine breed and aristocratic bearing as to arouse the envy of wealthier dog fanciers from other parts of the world.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And Greenall Bridge was like other Yorkshire villages. Its men knew and understood and loved dogs, and there were many perfect ones that walked at men’s heels; but they all agreed that if a finer dog than Sam Carraclough’s tricolour collie had ever been bred in Greenall Bridge, then it must have been long before they were born.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But there was another reason why Lassie was so well known in the village. It was because, as the women said, “You can set your clock by her.” That had begun many years before, when Lassie was a bright, harum-scarum yearling. One day Sam Carraclough’s boy, Joe, had come home bubbling with excitement.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Mother! I come out of school today, and who do you think was sitting there waiting for me? Lassie! Now how do you think she knew where I was?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“She must have picked up your scent, Joe. That’s all I can figure out.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Whatever it was, Lassie was waiting at the school gate the next day, and the next. And the weeks and the months and the years had gone past, and it had always been the same. Women glancing through the windows of their cottages, or shopkeepers standing in the doors on High Street, would see the proud black-white-and-golden-sable dog go past on a steady trot, and would say:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Must be five minutes to four — there goes Lassie!”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Rain or shine, the dog was always there, waiting for a boy — one of dozens who would come pelting across the concrete playground — but for the dog, the only one who&nbsp;mattered. Always there would be the moment of happy greeting, and then, together, the boy and the dog would go home. For four years it had always been the same.</p>
        <p>Lassie was a well-loved figure in the daily life of the village. Almost everyone knew her. But, most of all, the people of Greenall Bridge were proud of Lassie because she stood for something that they could not have explained readily. It had something to do with their pride. And their pride had something to do with money.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Generally, when a man raised an especially fine dog, some day it would stop being a dog and instead would become something on four legs that was worth money. It was still a dog, of course, but now it was something else, too, for a rich man might hear of it, or the alert dealers or kennelmen might see it, and then they would want to buy it. While a rich man may love a dog just as truly as a poor man, and there is no difference in them in this, there is a difference between them in the way they must look at money. For the poor man sits and thinks about how much coal he will need that winter, and how many pairs of shoes will be necessary, and how much food his children ought to have to keep them sturdy — and then he will go home and say:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Now, I had to do it, so don’t plague me! We’ll raise another dog someday, and ye’ll all love it just as much as ye did this one.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That way, many fine dogs had gone from homes in Greenall Bridge. But not Lassie! Why, the whole village knew that not even the Duke of Rudling had been able to buy Lassie from Sam Carraclough — the very Duke himself who lived in his great estate a mile beyond the village and who had his kennels full of fine dogs. For three years the Duke had been trying to buy Lassie from Sam Carraclough, and Sam had merely stood his ground.</p>
        <p>“It’s no use raising your price again, Your Lordship,” he would say. “It’s just — well, she’s not for sale for no price.”&nbsp;</p>

        <p>“She must have picked up your scent, Joe. That’s all I can figure out.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Whatever it was, Lassie was waiting at the school gate the next day, and the next. And the weeks and the months and the years had gone past, and it had always been the same. Women glancing through the windows of their cottages, or shopkeepers standing in the doors on High Street, would see the proud black-white-and-golden-sable dog go past on a steady trot, and would say:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Must be five minutes to four — there goes Lassie!”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Rain or shine, the dog was always there, waiting for a boy — one of dozens who would come pelting across the concrete playground — but for the dog, the only one who&nbsp;mattered. Always there would be the moment of happy greeting, and then, together, the boy and the dog would go home. For four years it had always been the same.</p>
        <p>Lassie was a well-loved figure in the daily life of the village. Almost everyone knew her. But, most of all, the people of Greenall Bridge were proud of Lassie because she stood for something that they could not have explained readily. It had something to do with their pride. And their pride had something to do with money.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Generally, when a man raised an especially fine dog, some day it would stop being a dog and instead would become something on four legs that was worth money. It was still a dog, of course, but now it was something else, too, for a rich man might hear of it, or the alert dealers or kennelmen might see it, and then they would want to buy it. While a rich man may love a dog just as truly as a poor man, and there is no difference in them in this, there is a difference between them in the way they must look at money. For the poor man sits and thinks about how much coal he will need that winter, and how many pairs of shoes will be necessary, and how much food his children ought to have to keep them sturdy — and then he will go home and say:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Now, I had to do it, so don’t plague me! We’ll raise another dog someday, and ye’ll all love it just as much as ye did this one.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That way, many fine dogs had gone from homes in Greenall Bridge. But not Lassie! Why, the whole village knew that not even the Duke of Rudling had been able to buy Lassie from Sam Carraclough — the very Duke himself who lived in his great estate a mile beyond the village and who had his kennels full of fine dogs. For three years the Duke had been trying to buy Lassie from Sam Carraclough, and Sam had merely stood his ground.</p>
        <p>“It’s no use raising your price again, Your Lordship,” he would say. “It’s just — well, she’s not for sale for no price.”&nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>LASSIE COME HOME&nbsp;</strong><br><em>by Eric Knight&nbsp;</em><br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Everyone in Greenall Bridge knew Sam Carraclough’s Lassie. In fact, you might say that she was the best-known dog in the village — and for three reasons.</p>
        <p>First, because nearly every man in the village agreed she was the finest collie he had ever laid eyes on. This was praise indeed, for Greenall Bridge is in the county of Yorkshire, and of all places in the world it is here that the dog is really king. In that bleak part of northern England, the dog seems to thrive as it does nowhere else. The wind and the cold rains sweep over the flat moorlands, making the dogs rich-coated and as sturdy as the people who live there.</p>
        <p>The people love dogs and are clever at raising them. You can go into any one of the hundreds of small mining villages in this largest of England’s counties, and see, walking at the heels of humbly clad workmen, dogs of such a fine breed and aristocratic bearing as to arouse the envy of wealthier dog fanciers from other parts of the world.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And Greenall Bridge was like other Yorkshire villages. Its men knew and understood and loved dogs, and there were many perfect ones that walked at men’s heels; but they all agreed that if a finer dog than Sam Carraclough’s tricolour collie had ever been bred in Greenall Bridge, then it must have been long before they were born.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But there was another reason why Lassie was so well known in the village. It was because, as the women said, “You can set your clock by her.” That had begun many years before, when Lassie was a bright, harum-scarum yearling. One day Sam Carraclough’s boy, Joe, had come home bubbling with excitement.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Mother! I come out of school today, and who do you think was sitting there waiting for me? Lassie! Now how do you think she knew where I was?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“She must have picked up your scent, Joe. That’s all I can figure out.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Whatever it was, Lassie was waiting at the school gate the next day, and the next. And the weeks and the months and the years had gone past, and it had always been the same. Women glancing through the windows of their cottages, or shopkeepers standing in the doors on High Street, would see the proud black-white-and-golden-sable dog go past on a steady trot, and would say:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Must be five minutes to four — there goes Lassie!”&nbsp;</p>

Always there would be the moment of happy greeting, and then, together, the boy and the dog would go home. For four years it had always been the same.</p>
        <p>Lassie was a well-loved figure in the daily life of the village. Almost everyone knew her. But, most of all, the people of Greenall Bridge were proud of Lassie because she stood for something that they could not have explained readily. It had something to do with their pride. And their pride had something to do with money.&nbsp;</p>

It was still a dog, of course, but now it was something else, too, for a rich man might hear of it, or the alert dealers or kennelmen might see it, and then they would want to buy it.

The hairs about his muzzle tipped with wet;<br>
The last sun glinting on his tawny mane,<br>
And burnishing his hide; veiled eyes that yet<br>
So slumbrous-solemn flash and slowly wane.<br>
<br>
Veiled slumbrous-solemn eyes, that half-asleep<br>
Seem utter-careless of the wild around;<br>
Soft seeming-careless steps that seek the deep<br>
Gloomed bush, — but <span class="txt-underline"><strong>give no shadow of a sound.</strong></span><br>
<br>
Loose-limbed, he slouches shambling in the cool;<br>
Head down, hide rippling over lazy might;<br>
Thoughtful and terrible he leaves the pool —<br>
Shumba the Lion, passing to the night.<br>
<br>
A grass-blade breaking!<br>
Swift, in awful calm,<br>
The mighty limbs at length along the ground;<br>
Steel muscles tightening —<br>
A sense of harm, Intangible... no shadow of a sound...<br>
<br>
But savage eyes unveiled,<br>
Intense as death;<br>
Pursed lips and lowered ears and bated breath,<br>
Dread vigour hailed<br>
From every nerve and tissue — crouching there<br>
Blent with grass, — incarnate, awful FEAR!&nbsp;<br>
<br>
A leap — a scream — a thud;<br>
And it is done.<br>
Silence awhile, and the hot smell of blood.<br>
Silence, then slowly, with the sinking sun,<br>
The rend of flesh.... The crickets wake and sing,<br>
The frogs take up their song, the night-jars wing<br>
Weird in the azure dusk. As had been willed,<br>
Chance brought him food; and Fate has been fulfilled.</p>

Pursed lips and lowered ears and bated breath,<br>

Silence awhile, and the hot smell of blood.<br>
Silence, then slowly, with the sinking sun,<br>
The rend of flesh.... The crickets wake and sing,<br>
The frogs take up their song, the night-jars wing<br>
Weird in the azure dusk. As had been willed,<br>
​Chance brought him food; and Fate has been fulfilled.</p>

A sense of harm, Intangible... no shadow of a sound...<br>
<br>
But savage eyes unveiled,<br>
Intense as death;<br>
Pursed lips and lowered ears and bated breath,<br>
Dread vigour hailed<br>
From every nerve and tissue — crouching there<br>
Blent with grass, — incarnate, awful FEAR!&nbsp;<br>
<br>
A leap — a scream — a thud;<br>
And it is done.<br>
Silence awhile, and the hot smell of blood.<br>
Silence, then slowly, with the sinking sun,<br>
The rend of flesh.... The crickets wake and sing,<br>
The frogs take up their song, the night-jars wing<br>
Weird in the azure dusk. As had been willed,<br>
​Chance brought him food; and Fate has been fulfilled.</p>

        <p><em>Read the poem below by Kingsley Fairbridge then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>The Hunting of Shumba&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
The hairs about his muzzle tipped with wet;<br>
The last sun glinting on his tawny mane,<br>
And burnishing his hide; veiled eyes that yet<br>
So slumbrous-solemn flash and slowly wane.<br>
<br>
Veiled slumbrous-solemn eyes, that half-asleep<br>
Seem utter-careless of the wild around;<br>
Soft seeming-careless steps that seek the deep<br>
Gloomed bush, — but&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline"><strong>give no shadow of a sound</strong></span>.<br>
<br>
Loose-limbed, he slouches shambling in the cool;<br>
Head down, hide rippling over lazy might;<br>
Thoughtful and terrible he leaves the pool —<br>
Shumba the Lion, passing to the night.<br>
<br>
A grass-blade breaking!<br>
Swift, in awful calm,<br>
The mighty limbs at length along the ground;<br>
Steel muscles tightening —<br>
A sense of harm, Intangible... no shadow of a sound...<br>
<br>
But savage eyes unveiled,<br>
Intense as death;<br>
Pursed lips and lowered ears and bated breath,<br>
Dread vigour hailed<br>
From every nerve and tissue — crouching there<br>
Blent with grass, — incarnate, awful FEAR!&nbsp;<br>
<br>
A leap — a scream — a thud;<br>
And it is done.<br>
Silence awhile, and the hot smell of blood.<br>
Silence, then slowly, with the sinking sun,<br>
The rend of flesh.... The crickets wake and sing,<br>
The frogs take up their song, the night-jars wing<br>
Weird in the azure dusk. As had been willed,<br>
​Chance brought him food; and Fate has been fulfilled.</p>
