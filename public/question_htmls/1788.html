When I was a child, I could spend all day at Shining Time Station, the fictive train depot with its own eponymous TV show, where Thomas the Tank Engine and all his plate-faced locomotive friends worked and lived. To my undeveloped brain, each episode seemed like a beautiful daydream, in which an orderly, magical, trance-inducing universe ticked on under bluebird skies. For company, there was the Conductor, voiced first by Ringo Starr and later by George Carlin, and then the trains: gentle blue Edward, moody green Henry, big strong Gordon, little red James, and, of course, Thomas, with his pointed eyebrows and perpetual smile. The show, which included segments that had first aired on a British show called “Thomas &amp; Friends,” began airing on PBS in 1989, and each episode opened with a Joe Cocker-ish theme song: “Reach for the steam, reach for the whistle, go where the railway runs/ Reach for the words, reach for the story, follow the rainbow sun.” I would hum along. Though “Shining Time Station” ended in the nineties, Thomas the Tank Engine shows have aired almost continuously since. “Thomas &amp; Friends” has gone on in some form for twenty seasons, two of which featured Alec Baldwin as the narrator.<br>

The steam engine was one of the most important inventions of the Industrial Revolution. Steam engines were used in all sorts of applications including factories, mines, locomotives, and steamboats. Steam engines use hot steam from boiling water to drive a piston (or pistons) back and forth. The movement of the piston was then used to power a machine or turn a wheel. To create the steam, most steam engines heated the water by burning coal. The steam engine helped to power the Industrial Revolution. Before steam power, most factories and mills were powered by water, wind, horse, or man. Water was a good source of power, but factories had to be located near a river. Both water and wind power could be unreliable as sometimes rivers could dry up during a drought or freeze during the winter and wind didn't always blow.<br>

Brought to contemporary fame through Wes Anderson’s movie Darjeeling Limited, you might be surprised to read that the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway steam train is not just a figment of his dazzling imagination. Quite on the contrary - the precipice-topping train is actually UNESCO-listed and has been operating in some form since the late 19th century. Affectionately nicknamed “toy train” by locals, the legendary train zigzags through the breathtaking scenery of cloud-topped valleys, undulating foothills and lush tea plantations so characteristic of the Eastern Himalayas and is sure to provide you with a mesmerizing and once-in-a-lifetime experience.<br>

The steam engine kickstarted a new era in transportation. It allowed passengers to travel in comfort and speed, with many amenities travelers have never seen before. Freight was easily transported across land, as the steam locomotive was extremely powerful, as even early steam engines could pull up to thirty cars. Before the advent of the steam locomotive the only option for travel was by horseback or maritime. For many, railways were much more convenient as they were easily accessible, and in most cases, quicker than maritime travel. When steam locomotives were first introduced, people around that time were in awe of its power and size, as in the early nineteenth century, there were not many machines with similar power and size. People began to catch on to the idea of the steam engine, and many railways were built throughout the world. The United States, seeking western expansion, built towns and businesses along the railway to ship their goods and travel. The steam locomotive did not just change transportation, it changed the way people lived.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

For many, railways were much more convenient as they were easily accessible, and in most cases, quicker than maritime travel. When steam locomotives were first introduced, people around that time were in awe of its power and size, as in the early nineteenth century, there were not many machines with similar power and size. People began to catch on to the idea of the steam engine, and many railways were built throughout the world. The United States, seeking western expansion, built towns and businesses along the railway to ship their goods and travel. The steam locomotive did not just change transportation, it changed the way people lived.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
