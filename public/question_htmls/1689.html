In Unlikely Heroes, Ms. Holland uncovers and celebrates yet another side of animals that we often think belongs primarily to people—heroism, that indefinable quality of going above and beyond, often for altruistic reasons, often at great personal risk. These 37 inspiring true tales show animals whose quick acts have saved lives, like the pod of dolphins who protected swimmers in New Zealand from a great white shark by forming a screen around them. There are stories of animals who simply and unselfishly give, like Rojo the llama, who shines his very special light of loving kindness on the elderly patients in an Oregon rehab centre.<br>
<br>
And there are compelling stories of heroic resilience: like Naki’o, the abandoned puppy who lost all four paws to frostbite but found the grit not only to overcome that terrible hardship but to reclaim the joy of life—that’s him, smiling on the cover of the book. In her heartwarming New York Times bestsellers Unlikely Friendships and 2013’s Unlikely Loves, Jennifer Holland revealed the surprising emotional bonds that exist between animals of different species. Her books spent dozens of weeks on bestseller lists and caught the attention of major media from CBS This Morning to USA Today. Why? Because she opened our eyes to the rich inner lives of animals, showing us that the power of love and friendship is not for humans only.<br>

When a humpback whale began pushing and guiding scientist Nan Hauser in the water, she didn’t know what to think. At first, she was scared and confused, until she realised the whale noticed something she didn’t – a large tiger shark swimming nearby. Upon seeing the shark, Nan understood that the whale was trying to protect her and guide her back to her boat. Nan, who has dedicated her life to protecting whales, had never experienced anything like that before, though she knew that whales sometimes displayed a similar behaviour when protecting seals from killer whales. Though she doesn’t know exactly what goes through the minds of these whales, she knows that they have this altruistic desire to help animals of other species.<br>

"There's something wrong, sir," said John, and he sprang out of the dog-cart and came to my head and looked all about. He tried to lead me forward. "Come on, Beauty, what's the matter?" Of course I could not tell him, but I knew very well that the bridge was not safe. Just then the man at the toll-gate on the other side ran out of the house, tossing a torch about like one mad.<br>
"Hoy, hoy, hoy! halloo! stop!" he cried.<br>
"What's the matter?" shouted my master.<br>
"The bridge is broken in the middle, and part of it is carried away; if you come on you'll be into the river." "Thank God!" said my master. "You Beauty!" said John, and took the bridle and gently turned me round to the right-hand road by the river side. The sun had set some time; the wind seemed to have lulled off after that furious blast which tore up the tree. It grew darker and darker, stiller and stiller. I trotted quietly along, the wheels hardly making a sound on the soft road. For a good while neither master nor John spoke, and then master began in a serious voice. I could not understand much of what they said, but I found they thought, if I had gone on as the master wanted me, most likely the bridge would have given way under us, and horse, chaise, master, and man would have fallen into the river; and as the current was flowing very strongly, and there was no light and no help at hand, it was more than likely we should all have been drowned. Master said, God had given men reason, by which they could find out things for themselves; but he had given animals knowledge which did not depend on reason, and which was much more prompt and perfect in its way, and by which they had often saved the lives of men.<br>

Have you heard of the potbellied pig who saved her owner’s life by playing dead in the middle of the road? LuLu is that heroic pig and after performing her brave and selfless act she was catapulted to celebrity status.<br>
<br>
Her human, Jo Ann Altsman, suffered a heart attack while vacationing in the North Woods of Presque Isle, Pennsylvania back in 1998. Jo Ann was struck down in her camping mobile home and desperately needed help.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, Jo Ann’s husband, Jack, was on a fishing trip and the only other soul around was LuLu. After Jo Ann unsuccessfully tried calling for help, LuLu realised the danger her mom was in and sprung into action. LuLu squeezed through the pet door, somehow managed to get the gate open and ran into&nbsp; the street and laid down in front of traffic. Several cars just drove by her, but one man got out to see what the matter was. LuLu instantly got up and started toward the mobile home where Jo Ann was.<br>
<br>
The man, who had seen some cuts on LuLu (which she got in her efforts), yelled out, “Your pig’s in distress.” That’s when he heard Jo Ann holler back, “I’m in distress, too. I’m having a heart attack. Please call an ambulance.” She was rushed to the hospital and into emergency surgery. Luckily, she pulled through, all thanks to LuLu’s ingenuity and action!<br>

Upon seeing the shark, Nan understood that the whale was trying to protect her and guide her back to her boat. Nan, who has dedicated her life to protecting whales, had never experienced anything like that before, though she knew that whales sometimes displayed a similar behaviour when protecting seals from killer whales. Though she doesn’t know exactly what goes through the minds of these whales, she knows that they have this altruistic desire to help animals of other species.<br>

"There's something wrong, sir," said John, and he sprang out of the dog-cart and came to my head and looked all about. He tried to lead me forward. "Come on, Beauty, what's the matter?" Of course I could not tell him, but I knew very well that the bridge was not safe. Just then the man at the toll-gate on the other side ran out of the house, tossing a torch about like one mad.<br>
"Hoy, hoy, hoy! halloo! stop!" he cried.<br>
"What's the matter?" shouted my master.<br>
"The bridge is broken in the middle, and part of it is carried away; if you come on you'll be into the river." "Thank God!" said my master. "You Beauty!" said John, and took the bridle and gently turned me round to the right-hand road by the river side. The sun had set some time; the wind seemed to have lulled off after that furious blast which tore up the tree. It grew darker and darker, stiller and stiller. I trotted quietly along, the wheels hardly making a sound on the soft road. For a good while neither master nor John spoke, and then master began in a serious voice. I could not understand much of what they said, but I found they thought, if I had gone on as the master wanted me, most likely the bridge would have given way under us, and horse, chaise, master, and man would have fallen into the river; and as the current was flowing very strongly, and there was no light and no help at hand, it was more than likely we should all have been drowned. Master said, God had given men reason, by which they could find out things for themselves; but he had given animals knowledge which did not depend on reason, and which was much more prompt and perfect in its way, and by which they had often saved the lives of men.<br>

Have you heard of the potbellied pig who saved her owner’s life by playing dead in the middle of the road? LuLu is that heroic pig and after performing her brave and selfless act she was catapulted to celebrity status.<br>
<br>
Her human, Jo Ann Altsman, suffered a heart attack while vacationing in the North Woods of Presque Isle, Pennsylvania back in 1998. Jo Ann was struck down in her camping mobile home and desperately needed help.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, Jo Ann’s husband, Jack, was on a fishing trip and the only other soul around was LuLu. After Jo Ann unsuccessfully tried calling for help, LuLu realised the danger her mom was in and sprung into action. LuLu squeezed through the pet door, somehow managed to get the gate open and ran into&nbsp; the street and laid down in front of traffic. Several cars just drove by her, but one man got out to see what the matter was. LuLu instantly got up and started toward the mobile home where Jo Ann was.<br>
<br>
The man, who had seen some cuts on LuLu (which she got in her efforts), yelled out, “Your pig’s in distress.” That’s when he heard Jo Ann holler back, “I’m in distress, too. I’m having a heart attack. Please call an ambulance.” She was rushed to the hospital and into emergency surgery. Luckily, she pulled through, all thanks to LuLu’s ingenuity and action!<br>

In Unlikely Heroes, Ms. Holland uncovers and celebrates yet another side of animals that we often think belongs primarily to people—heroism, that indefinable quality of going above and beyond, often for altruistic reasons, often at great personal risk. These 37 inspiring true tales show animals whose quick acts have saved lives, like the pod of dolphins who protected swimmers in New Zealand from a great white shark by forming a screen around them. There are stories of animals who simply and unselfishly give, like Rojo the llama, who shines his very special light of loving kindness on the elderly patients in an Oregon rehab centre.<br>
<br>
And there are compelling stories of heroic resilience: like Naki’o, the abandoned puppy who lost all four paws to frostbite but found the grit not only to overcome that terrible hardship but to reclaim the joy of life—that’s him, smiling on the cover of the book. In her heartwarming New York Times bestsellers Unlikely Friendships and 2013’s Unlikely Loves, Jennifer Holland revealed the surprising emotional bonds that exist between animals of different species. Her books spent dozens of weeks on bestseller lists and caught the attention of major media from CBS This Morning to USA Today. Why? Because she opened our eyes to the rich inner lives of animals, showing us that the power of love and friendship is not for humans only.<br>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>The Travelling Cat Chronicles</strong><br><br><em>by Hiro Arikawa</em><br><br>
I am a cat. As yet, I have no name. There's a famous cat in our country who once made this very statement. I have no clue how great that cat was, but at least when it comes to having a name I got there first.<br>
<br>
Back then, I used to sleep on the bonnet of a silver van in the parking lot of an apartment building. Even in winter, the sun made it all warm and toasty, the perfect spot for a daytime nap.<br>
<br>
I stayed there until spring arrived, which meant I'd survived one whole cycle of seasons. One day, I was lying curled up, having a snooze, when I suddenly sensed a warm, intense gaze upon me. I unglued my eyelids a touch and saw a tall, lanky young man, eyes narrowed, staring down at me as I lay prone.<br>
<br>
'Do you always sleep there?' he asked.<br>
<br>
I suppose so. Do you have a problem with that?<br>
<br>
'You're really cute, do you know that?'<br>
<br>
So they tell me.<br>
<br>
'Is it okay if I stroke you?'<br>
<br>
No, thanks. I batted one front paw at him in what I hoped to be a gently threatening way.<br>
<br>
'Aren't you a stingy one?' the man said, pulling a face.<br>
<br>
Well, how would you like it if you were sleeping and somebody came by and rubbed you all over?<br>
<br>
'I guess you want something in exchange for being stroked?'<br>
<br>
Quick on the draw, this one. Quite right. Got to get something in return for having my sleep disturbed. I heard a rustling and popped my head up. The man's hand had disappeared into a plastic bag.<br>
<br>
'I don't seem to have bought anything cat-suitable.'<br>
<br>
No sweat, mate. Feline beggars can't be choosers. That scallop jerky looks tasty.<br>
<br>
I sniffed at the package sticking out of the plastic bag and the man, smiling wryly, tapped&nbsp;me on the head with his fingers.<br>
<br>
Hey there, let's not jump the gun.<br>
<br>
'That's not good for you, cat,' he said. 'Plus it's too spicy.'<br>
<br>
Too spicy, says you? Do you think a hungry stray like me gives a ratsmonkey about his health? Getting something into my stomach right this minute – that's my top priority.<br>
<br>
At last, the man liberated a slice of fried chicken from a sandwich, stripping off the batter, laying the flesh on his palm and holding it out to me.<br>
<br>
You want me to eat right out of your hand? You think you'll get all friendly with me by doing that? I'm not that easy. Then again, it's not often I get to indulge in fresh meat – and it looks kind of succulent – so perhaps a little compromise is in order.<br>
<br>
As I chomped down on the chicken, I felt a couple of human fingers slide from under my chin to behind my ears. He scratched me softly. I mean, I'll permit a human who feeds me to touch me for a second, but this guy was pretty clever about it. If he were to give me a couple more tidbits, scratching under my chin would be up for grabs, too. I rubbed my cheek against his hand.<br>
<br>
The man smiled, pulled the meat from the second half of the sandwich, stripped off the batter, and held it out. I wanted to tell him I wouldn't be impartial to the batter, either. It would fill me up even more.<br>
<br>
I let him stroke me properly to repay him for the food, but now it was time to close up shop.<br>
<br>
Just as I began to raise a front paw and send him on his way, the man said, 'Okay, see you later.' He retrieved his hand and walked off, heading up the stairs of the apartment building.<br>
<br>
That's how we first met. It wasn't until a little later that he finally gave me my name.<br>
<br>
From that moment on, I found crunchy cat food underneath the silver van every night. One human fistful – a full meal for a cat – just behind the rear tyre.<br>
<br>
If I was around when the man turned up to leave food, he'd wrest some touch-time from me, but when I wasn't there he'd humbly leave an offering and disappear.<br>
<br>
Sometimes, another cat would beat me to it, or the man would be away and I'd wait in vain till morning for my crunchies. But, by and large, I could count on him for one square meal a day. Humans are quite flighty, so I don't rely on them a hundred per cent. A stray cat's skill lies in building up a complex web of connections in order to survive on the streets.<br>
<br>
Acquaintances who understood each other, that's what the man and I had become. But when he and I had settled into a comfortable relationship, <span class="txt-underline"><strong>fate intervened</strong></span> to change everything.<br>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>The Travelling Cat Chronicles</strong><br><br><em>by Hiro Arikawa</em><br><br>
I am a cat. As yet, I have no name. There's a famous cat in our country who once made this very statement. I have no clue how great that cat was, but at least when it comes to having a name I got there first.<br>
<br>
Back then, I used to sleep on the bonnet of a silver van in the parking lot of an apartment building. Even in winter, the sun made it all warm and toasty, the perfect spot for a daytime nap.<br>
<br>
I stayed there until spring arrived, which meant I'd survived one whole cycle of seasons. One day, I was lying curled up, having a snooze, when I suddenly sensed a warm, intense gaze upon me. I unglued my eyelids a touch and saw a tall, lanky young man, eyes narrowed, staring down at me as I lay prone.<br>
<br>
'Do you always sleep there?' he asked.<br>
<br>
I suppose so. Do you have a problem with that?<br>
<br>
'You're really cute, do you know that?'<br>
<br>
So they tell me.<br>
<br>
'Is it okay if I stroke you?'<br>
<br>
No, thanks. I batted one front paw at him in what I hoped to be a gently threatening way.<br>
<br>
'Aren't you a stingy one?' the man said, pulling a face.<br>
<br>
Well, how would you like it if you were sleeping and somebody came by and rubbed you all over?<br>
<br>
'I guess you want something in exchange for being stroked?'<br>
<br>
Quick on the draw, this one. Quite right. Got to get something in return for having my sleep disturbed. I heard a rustling and popped my head up. The man's hand had disappeared into a plastic bag.<br>
<br>
'I don't seem to have bought anything cat-suitable.'<br>
<br>
No sweat, mate. Feline beggars can't be choosers. That scallop jerky looks tasty.<br>
<br>
I sniffed at the package sticking out of the plastic bag and the man, smiling wryly, tapped&nbsp;me on the head with his fingers.<br>
<br>
Hey there, let's not jump the gun.<br>
<br>
'That's not good for you, cat,' he said. 'Plus it's too spicy.'<br>
<br>
Too spicy, says you? Do you think a hungry stray like me gives a ratsmonkey about his health? Getting something into my stomach right this minute – that's my top priority.<br>
<br>
At last, the man liberated a slice of fried chicken from a sandwich, stripping off the batter, laying the flesh on his palm and holding it out to me.<br>
<br>
You want me to eat right out of your hand? You think you'll get all friendly with me by doing that? I'm not that easy. Then again, it's not often I get to indulge in fresh meat – and it looks kind of succulent – so perhaps a little compromise is in order.<br>
<br>
As I chomped down on the chicken, I felt a couple of human fingers slide from under my chin to behind my ears. He scratched me softly. I mean, I'll permit a human who feeds me to touch me for a second, but this guy was pretty clever about it.

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>The Travelling Cat Chronicles</strong><br><br><em>by Hiro Arikawa</em><br><br>
I am a cat. As yet, I have no name. There's a famous cat in our country who once made this very statement. I have no clue how great that cat was, but at least when it comes to having a name I got there first.<br>
<br>
Back then, I used to sleep on the bonnet of a silver van in the parking lot of an apartment building. Even in winter, the sun made it all warm and toasty, the perfect spot for a daytime nap.<br>
<br>
I stayed there until spring arrived, which meant I'd survived one whole cycle of seasons. One day, I was lying curled up, having a snooze, when I suddenly sensed a warm, intense gaze upon me. I unglued my eyelids a touch and saw a tall, lanky young man, eyes narrowed, staring down at me as I lay prone.<br>
<br>
'Do you always sleep there?' he asked.<br>
<br>
I suppose so. Do you have a problem with that?<br>
<br>
'You're really cute, do you know that?'<br>
<br>
So they tell me.<br>
<br>
'Is it okay if I stroke you?'<br>
<br>
No, thanks. I batted one front paw at him in what I hoped to be a gently threatening way.<br>
<br>
'Aren't you a stingy one?' the man said, pulling a face.<br>
<br>
Well, how would you like it if you were sleeping and somebody came by and rubbed you all over?<br>
<br>
'I guess you want something in exchange for being stroked?'<br>
<br>
Quick on the draw, this one. Quite right. Got to get something in return for having my sleep disturbed. I heard a rustling and popped my head up. The man's hand had disappeared into a plastic bag.<br>
<br>
'I don't seem to have bought anything cat-suitable.'<br>
<br>
No sweat, mate. Feline beggars can't be choosers. That scallop jerky looks tasty.<br>
<br>
I sniffed at the package sticking out of the plastic bag and the man, smiling wryly, tapped&nbsp;me on the head with his fingers.<br>
<br>
Hey there, let's not jump the gun.<br>
<br>
'That's not good for you, cat,' he said. 'Plus it's too spicy.'<br>
<br>
Too spicy, says you? Do you think a hungry stray like me gives a ratsmonkey about his health? Getting something into my stomach right this minute – that's my top priority.<br>
<br>
At last, the man liberated a slice of fried chicken from a sandwich, stripping off the batter, laying the flesh on his palm and holding it out to me.<br>
<br>
You want me to eat right out of your hand? You think you'll get all friendly with me by doing that? I'm not that easy. Then again, it's not often I get to indulge in fresh meat – and it looks kind of succulent – so perhaps a little compromise is in order.<br>
<br>
As I chomped down on the chicken, I felt a couple of human fingers slide from under my chin to behind my ears. He scratched me softly. I mean, I'll permit a human who feeds me to touch me for a second, but this guy was pretty clever about it. If he were to give me a couple more tidbits, scratching under my chin would be up for grabs, too. I rubbed my cheek against his hand.<br>
<br>
The man smiled, pulled the meat from the second half of the sandwich, stripped off the batter, and held it out. I wanted to tell him I wouldn't be impartial to the batter, either. It would fill me up even more.<br>
<br>
I let him stroke me properly to repay him for the food, but now it was time to close up shop.<br>
<br>
Just as I began to raise a front paw and send him on his way, the man said, 'Okay, see you later.' He retrieved his hand and walked off, heading up the stairs of the apartment building.<br>
<br>
That's how we first met. It wasn't until a little later that he finally gave me my name.<br>
<br>
From that moment on, I found crunchy cat food underneath the silver van every night. One human fistful – a full meal for a cat – just behind the rear tyre.<br>
<br>
If I was around when the man turned up to leave food, he'd wrest some touch-time from me, but when I wasn't there he'd humbly leave an offering and disappear.<br>
<br>
Sometimes, another cat would beat me to it, or the man would be away and I'd wait in vain till morning for my crunchies. But, by and large, I could count on him for one square meal a day. Humans are quite flighty, so I don't rely on them a hundred per cent. A stray cat's skill lies in building up a complex web of connections in order to survive on the streets.<br>
<br>
Acquaintances who understood each other, that's what the man and I had become. But when he and I had settled into a comfortable relationship, <span class="txt-underline"><strong>fate intervened</strong></span> to change everything.<br>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>The Travelling Cat Chronicles</strong><br><br><em>by Hiro Arikawa</em><br><br>
I am a cat. As yet, I have no name. There's a famous cat in our country who once made this very statement. I have no clue how great that cat was, but at least when it comes to having a name I got there first.<br>
<br>
Back then, I used to sleep on the bonnet of a silver van in the parking lot of an apartment building. Even in winter, the sun made it all warm and toasty, the perfect spot for a daytime nap.<br>
<br>
I stayed there until spring arrived, which meant I'd survived one whole cycle of seasons. One day, I was lying curled up, having a snooze, when I suddenly sensed a warm, intense gaze upon me. I unglued my eyelids a touch and saw a tall, lanky young man, eyes narrowed, staring down at me as I lay prone.<br>
<br>
'Do you always sleep there?' he asked.<br>
<br>
I suppose so. Do you have a problem with that?<br>
<br>
'You're really cute, do you know that?'<br>
<br>
So they tell me.<br>
<br>
'Is it okay if I stroke you?'<br>
<br>
No, thanks. I batted one front paw at him in what I hoped to be a gently threatening way.<br>
<br>
'Aren't you a stingy one?' the man said, pulling a face.<br>
<br>
Well, how would you like it if you were sleeping and somebody came by and rubbed you all over?<br>
<br>
'I guess you want something in exchange for being stroked?'<br>
<br>
Quick on the draw, this one. Quite right. Got to get something in return for having my sleep disturbed. I heard a rustling and popped my head up. The man's hand had disappeared into a plastic bag.<br>
<br>
'I don't seem to have bought anything cat-suitable.'<br>
<br>
No sweat, mate. Feline beggars can't be choosers. That scallop jerky looks tasty.<br>
<br>
I sniffed at the package sticking out of the plastic bag and the man, smiling wryly, tapped&nbsp;me on the head with his fingers.<br>
<br>
Hey there, let's not jump the gun.<br>
<br>
'That's not good for you, cat,' he said. 'Plus it's too spicy.'<br>
<br>
Too spicy, says you? Do you think a hungry stray like me gives a ratsmonkey about his health? Getting something into my stomach right this minute – that's my top priority.<br>
<br>
At last, the man liberated a slice of fried chicken from a sandwich, stripping off the batter, laying the flesh on his palm and holding it out to me.<br>
<br>
You want me to eat right out of your hand? You think you'll get all friendly with me by doing that? I'm not that easy. Then again, it's not often I get to indulge in fresh meat – and it looks kind of succulent – so perhaps a little compromise is in order.<br>
<br>
As I chomped down on the chicken, I felt a couple of human fingers slide from under my chin to behind my ears. He scratched me softly. I mean, I'll permit a human who feeds me to touch me for a second, but this guy was pretty clever about it. If he were to give me a couple more tidbits, scratching under my chin would be up for grabs, too. I rubbed my cheek against his hand.<br>
<br>
The man smiled, pulled the meat from the second half of the sandwich, stripped off the batter, and held it out. I wanted to tell him I wouldn't be impartial to the batter, either. It would fill me up even more.<br>
<br>
I let him stroke me properly to repay him for the food, but now it was time to close up shop.<br>
<br>
Just as I began to raise a front paw and send him on his way, the man said, 'Okay, see you later.' He retrieved his hand and walked off, heading up the stairs of the apartment building.<br>
<br>
That's how we first met. It wasn't until a little later that he finally gave me my name.<br>
<br>
From that moment on, I found crunchy cat food underneath the silver van every night. One human fistful – a full meal for a cat – just behind the rear tyre.<br>
<br>
If I was around when the man turned up to leave food, he'd wrest some touch-time from me, but when I wasn't there he'd humbly leave an offering and disappear.<br>
<br>
Sometimes, another cat would beat me to it, or the man would be away and I'd wait in vain till morning for my crunchies. But, by and large, I could count on him for one square meal a day. Humans are quite flighty, so I don't rely on them a hundred per cent. A stray cat's skill lies in building up a complex web of connections in order to survive on the streets.<br>
<br>
Acquaintances who understood each other, that's what the man and I had become. But when he and I had settled into a comfortable relationship, <span class="txt-underline"><strong>fate intervened</strong></span> to change everything.<br>

<br><br>
The moon was shining sulkily,<br>
Because she thought the sun<br>
Had got no business to be there<br>
After the day was done—<br>
"It's very rude of him," she said,<br>
"To come and spoil the fun!"<br>
<br>
The sea was wet as wet could be,<br>
The sands were dry as dry.<br>
You could not see a cloud because<br>
No cloud was in the sky:<br>
No birds were flying overhead—<br>
There were no birds to fly.<br>
<br>
"0 Oysters, come and walk with us!"<br>
The Walrus did beseech.<br>
"A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,<br>
Along the briny beach:<br>
We cannot do with more than four,<br>
To give a hand to each."<br>
<br>
The eldest Oyster looked at him,<br>
But never a word he said;<br>
The eldest Oyster winked his eye,<br>
And shook his heavy head—<br>
Meaning to say he did not choose<br>
To leave the oyster-bed.<br>
<br>
But four young Oysters hurried up,<br>
All eager for the treat:<br>
Their coats were brushed, their faces<br>
washed,<br>
Their shoes were clean and neat—<br>
And this was odd, because, you know,<br>
They hadn't any feet.<br>
<br>
"A loaf of bread," the Walrus said,<br>
"Is what we chiefly need:<br>
Pepper and vinegar besides<br>
Are very good indeed—<br>
Now, if you're ready, Oysters dear,<br>
We can begin to feed."<br>
<br>
"But not on us!" the Oysters cried,<br>
Turning a little blue.<br>
"After such kindness, that would be<br>
A dismal thing to do!"<br>
"The night is fine," the Walrus said,<br>
"Do you admire the view?<br>
<br>
"It was so kind of you to come!<br>
And you are very nice!"<br>
The Carpenter said nothing but<br>
"Cut us another slice.<br>
I wish you were not quite so deaf—<br>
I've had to ask you twice!"<br>
<br>
"It seems a shame," the Walrus said,<br>
"To play them such a trick.<br>
After we've brought them out so far,<br>
And made them trot so quick!"<br>
The Carpenter said nothing but<br>
"The butter's spread too thick!"<br>
<br>
"I weep for you," the Walrus said:<br>
"I deeply sympathise."<br>
With sobs and tears he sorted out<br>
Those of the largest size,<br>
Holding his pocket-handkerchief<br>
Before his streaming eyes.<br>
<br>
"0 Oysters," said the Carpenter,<br>
"You've had a pleasant run!<br>
Shall we be trotting home again?"<br>
But answer came there none—<br>
And this was scarcely odd, because<br>
They'd eaten everyone.</div>

<br><br>
The moon was shining sulkily,<br>
Because she thought the sun<br>
Had got no business to be there<br>
After the day was done—<br>
"It's very rude of him," she said,<br>
"To come and spoil the fun!"<br>
<br>
The sea was wet as wet could be,<br>
The sands were dry as dry.<br>
You could not see a cloud because<br>
No cloud was in the sky:<br>
No birds were flying overhead—<br>
There were no birds to fly.<br>
<br>
"0 Oysters, come and walk with us!"<br>
The Walrus did beseech.<br>
"A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,<br>
Along the briny beach:<br>
We cannot do with more than four,<br>
To give a hand to each."<br>
<br>
The eldest Oyster looked at him,<br>
But never a word he said;<br>
The eldest Oyster winked his eye,<br>
And shook his heavy head—<br>
Meaning to say he did not choose<br>
To leave the oyster-bed.<br>
<br>
But four young Oysters hurried up,<br>
All eager for the treat:<br>
Their coats were brushed, their faces<br>
washed,<br>
Their shoes were clean and neat—<br>
And this was odd, because, you know,<br>
They hadn't any feet.<br>
<br>
"A loaf of bread," the Walrus said,<br>
"Is what we chiefly need:<br>
Pepper and vinegar besides<br>
Are very good indeed—<br>
Now, if you're ready, Oysters dear,<br>
We can begin to feed."<br>
<br>
"But not on us!" the Oysters cried,<br>
Turning a little blue.<br>
"After such kindness, that would be<br>
A dismal thing to do!"<br>
"The night is fine," the Walrus said,<br>
"Do you admire the view?<br>
<br>
"It was so kind of you to come!<br>
And you are very nice!"<br>
The Carpenter said nothing but<br>
"Cut us another slice.<br>
I wish you were not quite so deaf—<br>
I've had to ask you twice!"<br>
<br>
"It seems a shame," the Walrus said,<br>
"To play them such a trick.<br>
After we've brought them out so far,<br>
And made them trot so quick!"<br>
The Carpenter said nothing but<br>
"The butter's spread too thick!"<br>
<br>
"I weep for you," the Walrus said:<br>
"I deeply sympathise."<br>
With sobs and tears he sorted out<br>
Those of the largest size,<br>
Holding his pocket-handkerchief<br>
Before his streaming eyes.<br>
<br>
"0 Oysters," said the Carpenter,<br>
"You've had a pleasant run!<br>
Shall we be trotting home again?"<br>
But answer came there none—<br>
And this was scarcely odd, because<br>
They'd eaten everyone.</div>

<br><br>
The moon was shining sulkily,<br>
Because she thought the sun<br>
Had got no business to be there<br>
After the day was done—<br>
"It's very rude of him," she said,<br>
"To come and spoil the fun!"<br>
<br>
The sea was wet as wet could be,<br>
The sands were dry as dry.<br>
You could not see a cloud because<br>
No cloud was in the sky:<br>
No birds were flying overhead—<br>
There were no birds to fly.<br>
<br>
"0 Oysters, come and walk with us!"<br>
The Walrus did beseech.<br>
"A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,<br>
Along the briny beach:<br>
We cannot do with more than four,<br>
To give a hand to each."<br>
<br>
The eldest Oyster looked at him,<br>
But never a word he said;<br>
The eldest Oyster winked his eye,<br>
And shook his heavy head—<br>
Meaning to say he did not choose<br>
To leave the oyster-bed.<br>
<br>
But four young Oysters hurried up,<br>
All eager for the treat:<br>
Their coats were brushed, their faces<br>
washed,<br>
Their shoes were clean and neat—<br>
And this was odd, because, you know,<br>
They hadn't any feet.<br>
<br>
"A loaf of bread," the Walrus said,<br>
"Is what we chiefly need:<br>
Pepper and vinegar besides<br>
Are very good indeed—<br>
Now, if you're ready, Oysters dear,<br>
We can begin to feed."<br>
<br>
"But not on us!" the Oysters cried,<br>
Turning a little blue.<br>
"After such kindness, that would be<br>
A dismal thing to do!"<br>
"The night is fine," the Walrus said,<br>
"Do you admire the view?<br>
<br>
"It was so kind of you to come!<br>
And you are very nice!"<br>
The Carpenter said nothing but<br>
"Cut us another slice.<br>
I wish you were not quite so deaf—<br>
I've had to ask you twice!"<br>
<br>
"It seems a shame," the Walrus said,<br>
"To play them such a trick.<br>
After we've brought them out so far,<br>
And made them trot so quick!"<br>
The Carpenter said nothing but<br>
"The butter's spread too thick!"<br>
<br>
"I weep for you," the Walrus said:<br>
"I deeply sympathise."<br>
With sobs and tears he sorted out<br>
Those of the largest size,<br>
Holding his pocket-handkerchief<br>
Before his streaming eyes.<br>
<br>
"0 Oysters," said the Carpenter,<br>
"You've had a pleasant run!<br>
Shall we be trotting home again?"<br>
But answer came there none—<br>
And this was scarcely odd, because<br>
They'd eaten everyone.</div>

<strong>These Glowing Plants Could One Day Light Our Homes</strong><br>
<br>
In the apartment in the brick tenement building, the people are having a party. They’re smiling and chatting with each other. But the mood lighting is a bit strange. <strong>12 .......... .</strong> Instead, the light comes from enormous green-glowing plants in the centre of the table.<br>
<br>
What?<br>
<br>
We should explain: This is a model, part of an exhibit inside the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in New York. The “people” are small silver figurines. But the plants are real. They’re watercress embedded with nanoparticles that turn their stored<br>
energy into light. <strong>13 ..........</strong> . Now, Strano has partnered with an architect, Sheila Kennedy, to explore how these plants might be part of our sustainable energy future.<br>
<br>
The pair is one of 62 design teams involved in the Cooper Hewitt’s Design Triennial, which highlights innovative ways humans are engaging with nature. The plants in the exhibit are newer, brighter versions of the watercress plants Strano developed in 2017. Their glow is based on an enzyme called luciferase, which is what gives fireflies their light.<br>
<br>
In the exhibit, <strong>14 .......... </strong>, a world where sustainability is a priority. In this world, glowing plants might be not just a source of electricity, but a central part of our homes and lives. “For the last two decades, plants have been a part of architecture, but they’ve always been relegated to being very obedient and conforming to the surfaces of architecture—green walls, green roofs,” Kennedy says. “We wanted to challenge that a little bit.”<br>
<br>
The plants in Kennedy’s models don’t grow neatly in confined spaces. <strong>15 ..........</strong> . The rooms, which can be viewed through a peephole in the model tenement building, conform to the plants rather than the other way around. There’s an oval reading nook illuminated by a plant as high as its ceiling. There’s the “party room,” where guests mingle beneath the leaves. There's even a mock "soil auction," an event for a world where dirt is like gold.<br>
<br>
Visitors are encouraged to snap photos of the plants through the peephole and upload them to Instagram, tagging the MIT lab, @plantproperties. <strong>16 ..........</strong> .<br>
<br>
Kennedy, who is a professor of architecture at MIT and principal at Kennedy and Violich Architecture, is known for her work with clean energy. <strong>17 ..........</strong> . She and her team had to figure out how to get enough light into an old-fashioned building, how to bring in sufficient water, and where to put and contain enormous amounts of soil. The resulting model rooms have modifications like lightwells cut in the ceilings, ports to allow in pollinating insects, and retaining walls to hold in dirt.<br>
<br>
“We depend on plants for oxygen, for nutrition, for medicine,” Kennedy says. “We’re just adding one more dependency, which is light.”</div>

<strong>These Glowing Plants Could One Day Light Our Homes</strong><br>
<br>
In the apartment in the brick tenement building, the people are having a party. They’re smiling and chatting with each other. But the mood lighting is a bit strange. <strong>12 .......... .</strong> Instead, the light comes from enormous green-glowing plants in the centre of the table.<br>
<br>
What?<br>
<br>
We should explain: This is a model, part of an exhibit inside the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in New York. The “people” are small silver figurines. But the plants are real. They’re watercress embedded with nanoparticles that turn their stored<br>
energy into light. <strong>13 ..........</strong> . Now, Strano has partnered with an architect, Sheila Kennedy, to explore how these plants might be part of our sustainable energy future.<br>
<br>
The pair is one of 62 design teams involved in the Cooper Hewitt’s Design Triennial, which highlights innovative ways humans are engaging with nature. The plants in the exhibit are newer, brighter versions of the watercress plants Strano developed in 2017. Their glow is based on an enzyme called luciferase, which is what gives fireflies their light.<br>
<br>
In the exhibit, <strong>14 .......... </strong>, a world where sustainability is a priority. In this world, glowing plants might be not just a source of electricity, but a central part of our homes and lives. “For the last two decades, plants have been a part of architecture, but they’ve always been relegated to being very obedient and conforming to the surfaces of architecture—green walls, green roofs,” Kennedy says. “We wanted to challenge that a little bit.”<br>
<br>
The plants in Kennedy’s models don’t grow neatly in confined spaces. <strong>15 ..........</strong> . The rooms, which can be viewed through a peephole in the model tenement building, conform to the plants rather than the other way around. There’s an oval reading nook illuminated by a plant as high as its ceiling. There’s the “party room,” where guests mingle beneath the leaves. There's even a mock "soil auction," an event for a world where dirt is like gold.<br>
<br>
Visitors are encouraged to snap photos of the plants through the peephole and upload them to Instagram, tagging the MIT lab, @plantproperties. <strong>16 ..........</strong> .<br>
<br>
Kennedy, who is a professor of architecture at MIT and principal at Kennedy and Violich Architecture, is known for her work with clean energy. <strong>17 ..........</strong> . She and her team had to figure out how to get enough light into an old-fashioned building, how to bring in sufficient water, and where to put and contain enormous amounts of soil. The resulting model rooms have modifications like lightwells cut in the ceilings, ports to allow in pollinating insects, and retaining walls to hold in dirt.<br>
<br>
“We depend on plants for oxygen, for nutrition, for medicine,” Kennedy says. “We’re just adding one more dependency, which is light.”</div>

<strong>These Glowing Plants Could One Day Light Our Homes</strong><br>
<br>
In the apartment in the brick tenement building, the people are having a party. They’re smiling and chatting with each other. But the mood lighting is a bit strange. <strong>12 .......... .</strong> Instead, the light comes from enormous green-glowing plants in the centre of the table.<br>
<br>
What?<br>
<br>
We should explain: This is a model, part of an exhibit inside the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in New York. The “people” are small silver figurines. But the plants are real. They’re watercress embedded with nanoparticles that turn their stored<br>
energy into light. <strong>13 ..........</strong> . Now, Strano has partnered with an architect, Sheila Kennedy, to explore how these plants might be part of our sustainable energy future.<br>
<br>
The pair is one of 62 design teams involved in the Cooper Hewitt’s Design Triennial, which highlights innovative ways humans are engaging with nature. The plants in the exhibit are newer, brighter versions of the watercress plants Strano developed in 2017. Their glow is based on an enzyme called luciferase, which is what gives fireflies their light.<br>
<br>
In the exhibit, <strong>14 .......... </strong>, a world where sustainability is a priority. In this world, glowing plants might be not just a source of electricity, but a central part of our homes and lives. “For the last two decades, plants have been a part of architecture, but they’ve always been relegated to being very obedient and conforming to the surfaces of architecture—green walls, green roofs,” Kennedy says. “We wanted to challenge that a little bit.”<br>
<br>
The plants in Kennedy’s models don’t grow neatly in confined spaces. <strong>15 ..........</strong> . The rooms, which can be viewed through a peephole in the model tenement building, conform to the plants rather than the other way around. There’s an oval reading nook illuminated by a plant as high as its ceiling. There’s the “party room,” where guests mingle beneath the leaves. There's even a mock "soil auction," an event for a world where dirt is like gold.<br>
<br>
Visitors are encouraged to snap photos of the plants through the peephole and upload them to Instagram, tagging the MIT lab, @plantproperties. <strong>16 ..........</strong> .<br>
<br>
Kennedy, who is a professor of architecture at MIT and principal at Kennedy and Violich Architecture, is known for her work with clean energy. <strong>17 ..........</strong> . She and her team had to figure out how to get enough light into an old-fashioned building, how to bring in sufficient water, and where to put and contain enormous amounts of soil. The resulting model rooms have modifications like lightwells cut in the ceilings, ports to allow in pollinating insects, and retaining walls to hold in dirt.<br>
<br>
“We depend on plants for oxygen, for nutrition, for medicine,” Kennedy says. “We’re just adding one more dependency, which is light.”</div>

<strong>These Glowing Plants Could One Day Light Our Homes</strong><br>
<br>
In the apartment in the brick tenement building, the people are having a party. They’re smiling and chatting with each other. But the mood lighting is a bit strange. <strong>12 .......... .</strong> Instead, the light comes from enormous green-glowing plants in the centre of the table.<br>
<br>
What?<br>
<br>
We should explain: This is a model, part of an exhibit inside the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in New York. The “people” are small silver figurines. But the plants are real. They’re watercress embedded with nanoparticles that turn their stored<br>
energy into light. <strong>13 ..........</strong> . Now, Strano has partnered with an architect, Sheila Kennedy, to explore how these plants might be part of our sustainable energy future.<br>
<br>
The pair is one of 62 design teams involved in the Cooper Hewitt’s Design Triennial, which highlights innovative ways humans are engaging with nature. The plants in the exhibit are newer, brighter versions of the watercress plants Strano developed in 2017. Their glow is based on an enzyme called luciferase, which is what gives fireflies their light.<br>
<br>
In the exhibit, <strong>14 .......... </strong>, a world where sustainability is a priority. In this world, glowing plants might be not just a source of electricity, but a central part of our homes and lives. “For the last two decades, plants have been a part of architecture, but they’ve always been relegated to being very obedient and conforming to the surfaces of architecture—green walls, green roofs,” Kennedy says. “We wanted to challenge that a little bit.”<br>
<br>
The plants in Kennedy’s models don’t grow neatly in confined spaces. <strong>15 ..........</strong> . The rooms, which can be viewed through a peephole in the model tenement building, conform to the plants rather than the other way around. There’s an oval reading nook illuminated by a plant as high as its ceiling. There’s the “party room,” where guests mingle beneath the leaves. There's even a mock "soil auction," an event for a world where dirt is like gold.<br>
<br>
Visitors are encouraged to snap photos of the plants through the peephole and upload them to Instagram, tagging the MIT lab, @plantproperties. <strong>16 ..........</strong> .<br>
<br>
Kennedy, who is a professor of architecture at MIT and principal at Kennedy and Violich Architecture, is known for her work with clean energy. <strong>17 ..........</strong> . She and her team had to figure out how to get enough light into an old-fashioned building, how to bring in sufficient water, and where to put and contain enormous amounts of soil. The resulting model rooms have modifications like lightwells cut in the ceilings, ports to allow in pollinating insects, and retaining walls to hold in dirt.<br>
<br>
“We depend on plants for oxygen, for nutrition, for medicine,” Kennedy says. “We’re just adding one more dependency, which is light.”</div>

In Unlikely Heroes, Ms. Holland uncovers and celebrates yet another side of animals that we often think belongs primarily to people—heroism, that indefinable quality of going above and beyond, often for altruistic reasons, often at great personal risk. These 37 inspiring true tales show animals whose quick acts have saved lives, like the pod of dolphins who protected swimmers in New Zealand from a great white shark by forming a screen around them. There are stories of animals who simply and unselfishly give, like Rojo the llama, who shines his very special light of loving kindness on the elderly patients in an Oregon rehab centre.<br>
<br>
And there are compelling stories of heroic resilience: like Naki’o, the abandoned puppy who lost all four paws to frostbite but found the grit not only to overcome that terrible hardship but to reclaim the joy of life—that’s him, smiling on the cover of the book. In her heartwarming New York Times bestsellers Unlikely Friendships and 2013’s Unlikely Loves, Jennifer Holland revealed the surprising emotional bonds that exist between animals of different species. Her books spent dozens of weeks on bestseller lists and caught the attention of major media from CBS This Morning to USA Today. Why? Because she opened our eyes to the rich inner lives of animals, showing us that the power of love and friendship is not for humans only.<br>

When a humpback whale began pushing and guiding scientist Nan Hauser in the water, she didn’t know what to think. At first, she was scared and confused, until she realised the whale noticed something she didn’t – a large tiger shark swimming nearby. Upon seeing the shark, Nan understood that the whale was trying to protect her and guide her back to her boat. Nan, who has dedicated her life to protecting whales, had never experienced anything like that before, though she knew that whales sometimes displayed a similar behaviour when protecting seals from killer whales. Though she doesn’t know exactly what goes through the minds of these whales, she knows that they have this altruistic desire to help animals of other species.<br>

"There's something wrong, sir," said John, and he sprang out of the dog-cart and came to my head and looked all about. He tried to lead me forward. "Come on, Beauty, what's the matter?" Of course I could not tell him, but I knew very well that the bridge was not safe. Just then the man at the toll-gate on the other side ran out of the house, tossing a torch about like one mad.<br>
"Hoy, hoy, hoy! halloo! stop!" he cried.<br>
"What's the matter?" shouted my master.<br>
"The bridge is broken in the middle, and part of it is carried away; if you come on you'll be into the river." "Thank God!" said my master. "You Beauty!" said John, and took the bridle and gently turned me round to the right-hand road by the river side. The sun had set some time; the wind seemed to have lulled off after that furious blast which tore up the tree. It grew darker and darker, stiller and stiller. I trotted quietly along, the wheels hardly making a sound on the soft road. For a good while neither master nor John spoke, and then master began in a serious voice. I could not understand much of what they said, but I found they thought, if I had gone on as the master wanted me, most likely the bridge would have given way under us, and horse, chaise, master, and man would have fallen into the river; and as the current was flowing very strongly, and there was no light and no help at hand, it was more than likely we should all have been drowned. Master said, God had given men reason, by which they could find out things for themselves; but he had given animals knowledge which did not depend on reason, and which was much more prompt and perfect in its way, and by which they had often saved the lives of men.<br>

Have you heard of the potbellied pig who saved her owner’s life by playing dead in the middle of the road? LuLu is that heroic pig and after performing her brave and selfless act she was catapulted to celebrity status.<br>
<br>
Her human, Jo Ann Altsman, suffered a heart attack while vacationing in the North Woods of Presque Isle, Pennsylvania back in 1998. Jo Ann was struck down in her camping mobile home and desperately needed help.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, Jo Ann’s husband, Jack, was on a fishing trip and the only other soul around was LuLu. After Jo Ann unsuccessfully tried calling for help, LuLu realised the danger her mom was in and sprung into action. LuLu squeezed through the pet door, somehow managed to get the gate open and ran into&nbsp; the street and laid down in front of traffic. Several cars just drove by her, but one man got out to see what the matter was. LuLu instantly got up and started toward the mobile home where Jo Ann was.<br>
<br>
The man, who had seen some cuts on LuLu (which she got in her efforts), yelled out, “Your pig’s in distress.” That’s when he heard Jo Ann holler back, “I’m in distress, too. I’m having a heart attack. Please call an ambulance.” She was rushed to the hospital and into emergency surgery. Luckily, she pulled through, all thanks to LuLu’s ingenuity and action!<br>

Nan, who has dedicated her life to protecting whales, had never experienced anything like that before, though she knew that whales sometimes displayed a similar behaviour when protecting seals from killer whales. Though she doesn’t know exactly what goes through the minds of these whales, she knows that they have this altruistic desire to help animals of other species.<br>

"There's something wrong, sir," said John, and he sprang out of the dog-cart and came to my head and looked all about. He tried to lead me forward. "Come on, Beauty, what's the matter?" Of course I could not tell him, but I knew very well that the bridge was not safe. Just then the man at the toll-gate on the other side ran out of the house, tossing a torch about like one mad.<br>
"Hoy, hoy, hoy! halloo! stop!" he cried.<br>
"What's the matter?" shouted my master.<br>
"The bridge is broken in the middle, and part of it is carried away; if you come on you'll be into the river." "Thank God!" said my master. "You Beauty!" said John, and took the bridle and gently turned me round to the right-hand road by the river side. The sun had set some time; the wind seemed to have lulled off after that furious blast which tore up the tree. It grew darker and darker, stiller and stiller. I trotted quietly along, the wheels hardly making a sound on the soft road. For a good while neither master nor John spoke, and then master began in a serious voice. I could not understand much of what they said, but I found they thought, if I had gone on as the master wanted me, most likely the bridge would have given way under us, and horse, chaise, master, and man would have fallen into the river; and as the current was flowing very strongly, and there was no light and no help at hand, it was more than likely we should all have been drowned. Master said, God had given men reason, by which they could find out things for themselves; but he had given animals knowledge which did not depend on reason, and which was much more prompt and perfect in its way, and by which they had often saved the lives of men.<br>

{^ <strong>Extract D</strong> ^}<br>
Have you heard of the potbellied pig who saved her owner’s life by playing dead in the middle of the road? LuLu is that heroic pig and after performing her brave and selfless act she was catapulted to celebrity status.<br>
<br>
Her human, Jo Ann Altsman, suffered a heart attack while vacationing in the North Woods of Presque Isle, Pennsylvania back in 1998. Jo Ann was struck down in her camping mobile home and desperately needed help.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, Jo Ann’s husband, Jack, was on a fishing trip and the only other soul around was LuLu. After Jo Ann unsuccessfully tried calling for help, LuLu realised the danger her mom was in and sprung into action. LuLu squeezed through the pet door, somehow managed to get the gate open and ran into&nbsp; the street and laid down in front of traffic. Several cars just drove by her, but one man got out to see what the matter was. LuLu instantly got up and started toward the mobile home where Jo Ann was.<br>
<br>
The man, who had seen some cuts on LuLu (which she got in her efforts), yelled out, “Your pig’s in distress.” That’s when he heard Jo Ann holler back, “I’m in distress, too. I’m having a heart attack. Please call an ambulance.” She was rushed to the hospital and into emergency surgery. Luckily, she pulled through, all thanks to LuLu’s ingenuity and action!<br>
