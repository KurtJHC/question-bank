          <em>“I want to express my feelings, not illustrate them.” - Jackson Pollack</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>IN the late 1940’s and early 1950’s, the American painter Jackson Pollack was the leading proponent of action painting. He is now considered to be the most influential and important painter of the mid-twentieth century. He broke all past traditions and carved the way for a completely new direction in painting.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Pollock was the first to use drip-painting techniques to create abstract works, often on large, mural sized canvases. He swirled, flung, dripped and pushed paint around his canvases with sticks, knives or whatever he could find. At one stage he rode a bicycle over one of his paintings. At the time, critics labelled him ‘Jack the Dripper’; unaware of the huge influence he was to have on the art world.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>JACKSON POLLOCK: And we have mechanical means of representing objects in nature, such as the camera and the photograph. The modern artist is expressing an inner world, expressing the energy, the motion and other inner forces. The modern artist is working with space and time and expressing his feelings rather than illustrating.</p>
        <p>Jackson Pollock, the Abstract Expressionist painter, changed the face of art in America. A new exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in New York focuses on his work and his influence.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>JEFFREY BROWN: Hans Namuth photographed Pollock in his studio and filmed him in action outside for better light.</p>
        <p>JACKSON POLLOCK: I don't work from drawings or coloured sketches. My painting is direct. I usually paint on the floor. I enjoy working on a large canvas. I feel more at home, more at ease in a large area. Having the canvas on the floor, I feel nearer, more a part of the painting. This way I can walk around it, work from all four sides, and be in the painting.</p>
        <p>KIRK VARNEDOE: You cannot imagine the impact these photographs, as distinct from the paintings, had on artists worldwide when they were first published in the fifties; to see a man making up art like this. To see him standing into his canvas, to see him throwing down paint was so radical that the pictures had a huge impact on the popular image of Pollock.</p>
        <p>JEFFREY BROWN: Like the paintings, with their large scale and bursting energy, the image of Pollock the artist was recognised as distinctly American. In 1949, <em>Life Magazine made him a celebrity – a cultural icon of the post-war years</em>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He died in a car accident in 1956, never having made any substantial profits from his work.</p>

          <strong>Jackson Pollack</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>“I want to express my feelings, not illustrate them.” - Jackson Pollack</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>IN the late 1940’s and early 1950’s, the American painter Jackson Pollack was the leading proponent of action painting. He is now considered to be the most influential and important painter of the mid-twentieth century. He broke all past traditions and carved the way for a completely new direction in painting.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Pollock was the first to use drip-painting techniques to create abstract works, often on large, mural sized canvases. He swirled, flung, dripped and pushed paint around his canvases with sticks, knives or whatever he could find. At one stage he rode a bicycle over one of his paintings. At the time, critics labelled him ‘Jack the Dripper’; unaware of the huge influence he was to have on the art world.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>JACKSON POLLOCK: And we have mechanical means of representing objects in nature, such as the camera and the photograph. The modern artist is expressing an inner world, expressing the energy, the motion and other inner forces. The modern artist is working with space and time and expressing his feelings rather than illustrating.</p>
        <p>Jackson Pollock, the Abstract Expressionist painter, changed the face of art in America. A new exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in New York focuses on his work and his influence.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>JEFFREY BROWN: Hans Namuth photographed Pollock in his studio and filmed him in action outside for better light.</p>
        <p>JACKSON POLLOCK: I don't work from drawings or coloured sketches. My painting is direct. I usually paint on the floor. I enjoy working on a large canvas. I feel more at home, more at ease in a large area. Having the canvas on the floor, I feel nearer, more a part of the painting. This way I can walk around it, work from all four sides, and be in the painting.</p>
        <p>KIRK VARNEDOE: You cannot imagine the impact these photographs, as distinct from the paintings, had on artists worldwide when they were first published in the fifties; to see a man making up art like this. To see him standing into his canvas, to see him throwing down paint was so radical that the pictures had a huge impact on the popular image of Pollock.</p>
        <p>JEFFREY BROWN: Like the paintings, with their large scale and bursting energy, the image of Pollock the artist was recognised as distinctly American. In 1949, Life Magazine made him a celebrity – a cultural icon of the post-war years.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He died in a car accident in 1956, never having made any substantial profits from his work.</p>

  A piece of string is initially held end-to-end in a straight line. A mark is made in the middle of the string. The string is then folded in half and the new ends again pulled tight. A mark is made in the middle of the strands of folded string. This process is then repeated a third time.<br>

The string is then unfolded and its ends pulled so that it is once again in its initial straight line.<br>
