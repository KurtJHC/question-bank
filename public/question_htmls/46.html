        <p>“Bridge to Terabithia” is a fantasy/adventure story of friendship, family and the power of imagination. Jess Aarons is an outsider at school and even in his own family. Jess has trained all summer to become the fastest kid in his middle school class but his goal is unexpectedly thwarted by the new girl in school, Leslie Burke who competes in the "boys only" race and wins. Despite their awkward introduction, the two outsiders quickly become best friends. Leslie loves to tell stories of fantasy and magic. Jess loves to draw, but until he met Leslie, it was something he kept to himself. Leslie opens a new world of imagination for Jess. Together they create the secret kingdom of Terabithia, a magical place only accessible by swinging on an old rope over a stream in the woods near their homes. There, the friends rule the kingdom, fight the Dark Master and his creatures and plot against the school bullies. Thanks to his friendship with Leslie, Jess is changed for good. Brimming with fantastical creatures, palaces and beautiful forests, the world of Terabithia is brought to life.</p>

            <strong>Review Two</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>This big-screen adaptation of Katherine Paterson’s award-winning 1977 children’s book (preceded by a serviceable 1985 television movie) isn’t likely to displace anyone’s memory of the popular tome, but its winning cast and generally faithful script are more than earnest enough to capture the powerful and bittersweet spirit that has, for decades, continued to make the story a favourite of children and adults alike.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Following their monumentally successful teaming on The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Walden Media and Walt Disney Pictures went looking for comparably revered subject matter with which to forge a follow-up. Bridge to Terabithia is unquestionably comparably revered, but it’s hardly the same class of story, an intimate and oftentimes challenging story of outcast rural teenagers, Jesse and Leslie (Josh Hutcherson) and Anna (Sophia Robb) who find refuge from the pain of reality in the creation of an elaborate imaginary world in the woods.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Contrary to the film’s elaborate ad campaign, which suggests a fully realised CGI re-creation of the world of Terabithia, the movie contains surprisingly little CGI, instead focusing on the kids, their unique bond and the powerful life lessons that come as a result of their adventures. Director Gabor Csupo, cofounder of famed Rugrats animation house Klasky-Csupo, makes an auspicious feature directorial debut here, careful to avoid any stylistic indulgences that might undercut character or theme.</p>
        <p>One can imagine, however, that the reigns from the Paterson estate were fairly rigid as Paterson’s son David, whose own childhood experiences inspired the original book, is credited as both a producer and co-screenwriter along with Jeff Stockwell (2002’s The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys). Still, it’s hard to imagine that Paterson herself could have imagined two more suitable stars than Hutcherson and the absolutely&nbsp;dazzling Robb, two immensely talented performers who capture the essence of teenage angst and joy so completely that the film’s handful of minor shortcomings almost seem to evaporate.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Robert Patrick and Zooey Deschanel topline the fine supporting cast, while solid scoring and cinematography by Aaron Zigman and Michael Chapman, respectively, anchor the technical contributions.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>“Still Here With Me” by Suzanne Sjoquvist</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Twins Charlotte and Marcus were 14 and on holiday in Thailand when the tsunami struck. The family was separated and the children never saw their mother and father alive again.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>Charlotte</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>Boxing Day in Khao Lak, 2004, Mum, Dad and I are lying on the sunbeds. Marcus had stayed in our room, watching a film. Mum is reading her diving magazine. I rub sun lotion all over myself. Dad is looking out to sea in a strange way. Mum and I look up and see the water disappear, leaving all the fish on the sand. We see children running out to help the fish back into the water, so that they do not die. Dad wants me to fetch the camera from the hotel so that we can film the water disappearing. I am too lazy. Dad gets up to fetch it himself, but first he and Mum have a little argument. Dad thinks that the water is drawing out. Mum and I shriek, "It's coming in."</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Calm down – of course it isn't coming in," says Dad, on his way to the hotel. I have not seen him since.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mum and I see the wave. We take our stuff and run. Mum runs away ahead of me. I hear her voice: "For goodness sake run, Charlotte! Whatever happens I will always love you." I have not seen her since. She disappears without bothering to check whether I am behind her. I run in panic, upwards, as far as I can. I get to a flight of steps where there is chaos. A small child is standing by the steps crying. The mother has left the child alone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I am holding tightly on to the stair rail when the wave roars in over the whole of Khao Lak. I feel the wave rolling over me and pulling away the rail. I go with the wave out to sea and in again, several times. Under the surface, I swallow gulps of salty water when I try to get air. I will not survive if I do not come up to the surface. In the end, I can take deep breaths. With my eyes closed. I am hanging in something, a tree? The roof of a house? The thing I am hanging on snaps and I am pulled out to sea again, out and in. After perhaps seven minutes I open my eyes. I have landed up by the hotel and see masses of people lying there, blood everywhere.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I am in a lot of pain and very frightened. My foot is bluish-purple and crooked. I cannot stand on it. A couple of Thai women carry me on a stretcher and drive off with me in an ambulance. The Thai women say there may be more waves on the way. The man who is driving the ambulance stops and runs away uphill without helping me. I creep and hop up the hill. My foot is starting to turn brown.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A family live up there and they give me water and clothes. The woman helps me to scrape off the blood with some leaves. After seven hours the danger is over. We climb back down the hill. The woman helps me. That is much better than being alone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We leave for the hospital, where they wash my body and my hair, fix all the wounds and bandage my foot. Then we go back to the woman's home. Her family gives me clothes, food and flip-flops. At night, I sleep with her in her bed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On the second evening, the woman's brother asks if I want to send an email to anyone. I write this to my friend: "Hi! How are you? I'm fine but something has happened. A giant wave came and took away Mummy, Marcus and Daddy. I am staying with a Thai family and don't know how to get home. Have no mobile, money or passport and think I lost everything else in the wave. Love you, sweetie. Hope to see you soon. Kisses from Lotti."</p>

        <p>I am holding tightly on to the stair rail when the wave roars in over the whole of Khao Lak. I feel the wave rolling over me and pulling away the rail. I go with the wave out to sea and in again, several times. Under the surface, I swallow gulps of salty water when I try to get air. I will not survive if I do not come up to the surface. In the end, I can take deep breaths. With my eyes closed. I am hanging in something, a tree? The roof of a house? The thing I am hanging on snaps and I am pulled out to sea again, out and in. After perhaps seven minutes I open my eyes. I have landed up by the hotel and see masses of people lying there, blood everywhere.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I am in a lot of pain and very frightened. My foot is bluish-purple and crooked. I cannot stand on it. A couple of Thai women carry me on a stretcher and drive off with me in an ambulance. The Thai women say there may be more waves on the way. The man who is driving the ambulance stops and runs away uphill without helping me. I creep and hop up the hill. My foot is starting to turn brown.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A family live up there and they give me water and clothes. The woman helps me to scrape off the blood with some leaves. After seven hours the danger is over. We climb back down the hill. The woman helps me. That is much better than being alone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We leave for the hospital, where they wash my body and my hair, fix all the wounds and bandage my foot. Then we go back to the woman's home. Her family gives me clothes, food and flip-flops. At night, I sleep with her in her bed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On the second evening, the woman's brother asks if I want to send an email to anyone. I write this to my friend: "Hi! How are you? I'm fine but something has happened. A giant wave came and took away Mummy, Marcus and Daddy. I am staying with a Thai family and don't know how to get home. Have no mobile, money or passport and think I lost everything else in the wave. Love you, sweetie. Hope to see you soon. Kisses from Lotti."</p>

          <strong>“Still Here With Me” by Suzanne Sjoquvist</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Twins Charlotte and Marcus were 14 and on holiday in Thailand when the tsunami struck. The family was separated and the children never saw their mother and father alive again.&nbsp;</p>

            <strong>Charlotte</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>Boxing Day in Khao Lak, 2004, Mum, Dad and I are lying on the sunbeds. Marcus had stayed in our room, watching a film. Mum is reading her diving magazine. I rub sun lotion all over myself. Dad is looking out to sea in a strange way. Mum and I look up and see the water disappear, leaving all the fish on the sand. We see children running out to help the fish back into the water, so that they do not die. Dad wants me to fetch the camera from the hotel so that we can film the water disappearing. I am too lazy. Dad gets up to fetch it himself, but first he and Mum have a little argument. Dad thinks that the water is drawing out. Mum and I shriek, "It's coming in."</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Calm down – of course it isn't coming in," says Dad, on his way to the hotel. I have not seen him since.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mum and I see the wave. We take our stuff and run. Mum runs away ahead of me. I hear her voice: "For goodness sake run, Charlotte! Whatever happens I will always love you." I have not seen her since. She disappears without bothering to check whether I am behind her. I run in panic, upwards, as far as I can. I get to a flight of steps where there is chaos. A small child is standing by the steps crying. The mother has left the child alone.</p>

          <strong>“Still Here With Me” by Suzanne Sjoquvist</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Twins Charlotte and Marcus were 14 and on holiday in Thailand when the tsunami struck. The family was separated and the children never saw their mother and father alive again.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>Charlotte</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>Boxing Day in Khao Lak, 2004, Mum, Dad and I are lying on the sunbeds. Marcus had stayed in our room, watching a film. Mum is reading her diving magazine. I rub sun lotion all over myself. Dad is looking out to sea in a strange way. Mum and I look up and see the water disappear, leaving all the fish on the sand. We see children running out to help the fish back into the water, so that they do not die. Dad wants me to fetch the camera from the hotel so that we can film the water disappearing. I am too lazy. Dad gets up to fetch it himself, but first he and Mum have a little argument. Dad thinks that the water is drawing out. Mum and I shriek, "It's coming in."</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Calm down – of course it isn't coming in," says Dad, on his way to the hotel. I have not seen him since.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mum and I see the wave. We take our stuff and run. Mum runs away ahead of me. I hear her voice: "For goodness sake run, Charlotte! Whatever happens I will always love you." I have not seen her since. She disappears without bothering to check whether I am behind her. I run in panic, upwards, as far as I can. I get to a flight of steps where there is chaos. A small child is standing by the steps crying. The mother has left the child alone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I am holding tightly on to the stair rail when the wave roars in over the whole of Khao Lak. I feel the wave rolling over me and pulling away the rail. I go with the wave out to sea and in again, several times. Under the surface, I swallow gulps of salty water when I try to get air. I will not survive if I do not come up to the surface. In the end, I can take deep breaths. With my eyes closed. I am hanging in something, a tree? The roof of a house? The thing I am hanging on snaps and I am pulled out to sea again, out and in. After perhaps seven minutes I open my eyes. I have landed up by the hotel and see masses of people lying there, blood everywhere.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I am in a lot of pain and very frightened. My foot is bluish-purple and crooked. I cannot stand on it. A couple of Thai women carry me on a stretcher and drive off with me in an ambulance. The Thai women say there may be more waves on the way. The man who is driving the ambulance stops and runs away uphill without helping me. I creep and hop up the hill. My foot is starting to turn brown.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A family live up there and they give me water and clothes. The woman helps me to scrape off the blood with some leaves. After seven hours the danger is over. We climb back down the hill. The woman helps me. That is much better than being alone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We leave for the hospital, where they wash my body and my hair, fix all the wounds and bandage my foot. Then we go back to the woman's home. Her family gives me clothes, food and flip-flops. At night, I sleep with her in her bed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On the second evening, the woman's brother asks if I want to send an email to anyone. I write this to my friend: "Hi! How are you? I'm fine but something has happened. A giant wave came and took away Mummy, Marcus and Daddy. I am staying with a Thai family and don't know how to get home. Have no mobile, money or passport and think I lost everything else in the wave. Love you, sweetie. Hope to see you soon. Kisses from Lotti."</p>

          <strong>The History of the Toothbrush</strong>

        <p>Have you ever wondered about the origins of the humble toothbrush? Historians are divided as to when the real toothbrush was first invented but records show that the toothbrush is a device that has been used in oral hygiene for countless centuries.</p>
        <p>It is believed that the Chinese invented the first real toothbrush in the 1400s; however these were quite different to the ones that we are familiar with today. The bristles of these toothbrushes were not made from nylon but from the coarse hair of the Siberian wild boar and the handles were crafted from bamboo rather than plastic. This toothbrush is believed to be the ‘ancestor’ of the one that we use today.</p>
        <p>There is evidence, however, that the toothbrush existed in another form, dating up to 3000 years before the birth of Christ. This evidence suggests that the toothbrush (in one form or another) is one of the oldest devices used by man, outdated only by the wheel. The toothbrush in this form was found within the pyramids of the ancient Egyptians. Crafted from a stick, these toothbrushes did not use boar hair bristles but were rather flayed on the end so that the fibres of the wood were more soft. The Egyptians would then rub this stick against their teeth to maintain some form of oral hygiene.</p>
        <p>Whilst the Egyptian form of the toothbrush did not spread much further than Egypt itself, the Chinese version spread to Europe. The downside of this particular toothbrush was that the wild boar hairs used for bristles were very rough on the gums. People began to replace boar hairs for the hairs found on the back of horses, these were much easier on gums and on teeth. In spite of the softness of the horse hair bristles, people preferred to use the boar hair bristles due to the fact that horses were more valuable to Europeans during this time.</p>
        <p>The boar hair toothbrush was used until the early 1900s. The invention of nylon in 1937 by Wallace H. Carothers brought about a profound change in the toothbrush as well as other devices that depended on fibrous material. The new toothbrush with softer, nylon bristles was called Dr West’s Miracle toothbrush. Interestingly, it wasn’t until World War II that people started to take oral hygiene more seriously.</p>

        <p>Have you ever wondered about the origins of the humble toothbrush? Historians are divided as to when the real toothbrush was first invented but records show that the toothbrush is a device that has been used in oral hygiene for countless centuries.</p>
        <p>It is believed that the Chinese invented the first real toothbrush in the 1400s; however these were quite different to the ones that we are familiar with today. The bristles of these toothbrushes were not made from nylon but from the coarse hair of the Siberian wild boar and the handles were crafted from bamboo rather than plastic. This toothbrush is believed to be the ‘ancestor’ of the one that we use today.</p>
        <p>There is evidence, however, that the toothbrush existed in another form, dating up to 3000 years before the birth of Christ. This evidence suggests that the toothbrush (in one form or another) is one of the oldest devices used by man, outdated only by the wheel. The toothbrush in this form was found within the pyramids of the ancient Egyptians. Crafted from a stick, these toothbrushes did not use boar hair bristles but were rather flayed on the end so that the fibres of the wood were more soft. The Egyptians would then rub this stick against their teeth to maintain some form of oral hygiene.</p>
        <p>Whilst the Egyptian form of the toothbrush did not spread much further than Egypt itself, the Chinese version spread to Europe. The downside of this particular toothbrush was that the wild boar hairs used for bristles were very rough on the gums. People began to replace boar hairs for the hairs found on the back of horses, these were much easier on gums and on teeth. In spite of the softness of the horse hair bristles, people preferred to use the boar hair bristles due to the fact that horses were more valuable to Europeans during this time.</p>
        <p>The boar hair toothbrush was used until the early 1900s. The invention of nylon in 1937 by Wallace H. Carothers brought about a profound change in the toothbrush as well as other devices that depended on fibrous material. The new toothbrush with softer, nylon bristles was called Dr West’s Miracle toothbrush. Interestingly, it wasn’t until World War II that people started to take oral hygiene more seriously.</p>

</p><p><em>Illustrated by Thomas Mitton</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sti'Tumma had always wanted to have beautiful beaded ‘shooflies’ attached to her saddle, on the breastplate and under the horse's tummy on the cinch. She had already made a couple for her favourite bridle! The shooflies were made from a small amount of horsehair being folded in half, wrapped with buckskin, and beadwork put over the buckskin. The shoofly would then be clipped onto the favourite spot selected by each rider. So when the horses had their tails cleaned, the hair was saved for Sti'Tumma who then went to work to make herself some beautiful and colourful shooflies. Sometimes Gilly, Sti'Tumma's sister, would do the beadwork on a dozen shooflies at a time for the trail guides. The shooflies would move with the horse and keep some of the flies from settling on the horse!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was a beautiful Saturday morning and time to get ready to meet the scheduled trail riders at the lake for the 20-mile ride through the beautiful countryside. Her nephew and youngest brother saddled her horse while she went to select the shooflies to attach to her saddle today. Across the breastplate she clipped six, on the cinch she clipped two, and on the rear of the saddle she clipped two. She stood back to take a good look, and said to herself, "Today both Zoomer and I will look good!"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At the lake she stayed on horseback due to the pain she was feeling in her back and neck; getting off and on would only make it worse. Today she wanted to be able to complete the ride to show off all her hard work on the beautiful and colourful shooflies. By wearing her new ribbon shirt, she looked elegant upon that gorgeous horse with all the beadwork showing on the shooflies. She met the riders, gathered the riding fees, which were placed in the beaded bag tied tight to her saddle, and even had some pictures taken of her and Zoomer!</p><p>Today Sti'Tumma would begin the trail ride by trailing the riders. She took her time, although Zoomer wanted to be in the lead of the pack. What a lovely day, open views for nice photos, and she noticed that the riders were taking some lovely shots. Zoomer was becoming impatient, so Sti'Tumma let him walk a bit faster to get to the head of the riders. She was almost at the front of the riders when a pair of riders, an elder cowboy and his wife, moved up to talk to her. The lady asked, "We were wondering if you are a medicine lady, you have all the scalps with beadwork on them displayed on your saddle. And we wanted to know how you got anyone to actually touch the scalps to put the beadwork on them."</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
Sti'Tumma started chuckling, and then broke out in laughter! Her younger brother, the lead trail guide for today, stopped the group to check on his sister. Sti'Tumma decided this was a good spot to take a break and talk about the shooflies she was so proud of. By the time the riders started off again on the ride, the whole Country Trail Ride crew were amazed at how many of these city cowboys and cowgirls didn't understand the Native Americans at all, they still believed there was scalping and raiding going on within the reservation! Scalps, what a joke! Now every trail guide would want to be decorated with the "scalps" displayed on their horse to show their "honour within the Tribe"!

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since that ride, and all the jokes and laughter about the medicine lady and her scalps, Gilly has been able to have a dozen "imitation scalps" beaded and ready for sale at each trail ride during the lunch break at the wonderful and remodelled old campsite.</p>

</p><p><em>Illustrated by Thomas Mitton</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sti'Tumma had always wanted to have beautiful beaded ‘shooflies’ attached to her saddle, on the breastplate and under the horse's tummy on the cinch. She had already made a couple for her favourite bridle! The shooflies were made from a small amount of horsehair being folded in half, wrapped with buckskin, and beadwork put over the buckskin. The shoofly would then be clipped onto the favourite spot selected by each rider. So when the horses had their tails cleaned, the hair was saved for Sti'Tumma who then went to work to make herself some beautiful and colourful shooflies. Sometimes Gilly, Sti'Tumma's sister, would do the beadwork on a dozen shooflies at a time for the trail guides. The shooflies would move with the horse and keep some of the flies from settling on the horse!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was a beautiful Saturday morning and time to get ready to meet the scheduled trail riders at the lake for the 20-mile ride through the beautiful countryside. Her nephew and youngest brother saddled her horse while she went to select the shooflies to attach to her saddle today. Across the breastplate she clipped six, on the cinch she clipped two, and on the rear of the saddle she clipped two. She stood back to take a good look, and said to herself, "Today both Zoomer and I will look good!"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At the lake she stayed on horseback due to the pain she was feeling in her back and neck; getting off and on would only make it worse. Today she wanted to be able to complete the ride to show off all her hard work on the beautiful and colourful shooflies. By wearing her new ribbon shirt, she looked elegant upon that gorgeous horse with all the beadwork showing on the shooflies. She met the riders, gathered the riding fees, which were placed in the beaded bag tied tight to her saddle, and even had some pictures taken of her and Zoomer!</p><p>Today Sti'Tumma would begin the trail ride by trailing the riders. She took her time, although Zoomer wanted to be in the lead of the pack. What a lovely day, open views for nice photos, and she noticed that the riders were taking some lovely shots. Zoomer was becoming impatient, so Sti'Tumma let him walk a bit faster to get to the head of the riders. She was almost at the front of the riders when a pair of riders, an elder cowboy and his wife, moved up to talk to her. The lady asked, "We were wondering if you are a medicine lady, you have all the scalps with beadwork on them displayed on your saddle. And we wanted to know how you got anyone to actually touch the scalps to put the beadwork on them."</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
Sti'Tumma started chuckling, and then broke out in laughter! Her younger brother, the lead trail guide for today, stopped the group to check on his sister. Sti'Tumma decided this was a good spot to take a break and talk about the shooflies she was so proud of. By the time the riders started off again on the ride, the whole Country Trail Ride crew were amazed at how many of these city cowboys and cowgirls didn't understand the Native Americans at all, they still believed there was scalping and raiding going on within the reservation! Scalps, what a joke! Now every trail guide would want to be decorated with the "scalps" displayed on their horse to show their "honour within the Tribe"!

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since that ride, and all the jokes and laughter about the medicine lady and her scalps, Gilly has been able to have a dozen "imitation scalps" beaded and ready for sale at each trail ride during the lunch break at the wonderful and remodelled old campsite.</p>

          <strong>IS BOTTLED WATER BETTER?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Bottled water manufacturers’ marketing campaigns capitalize on isolated instances of <strong>contaminated </strong>public drinking water supplies by encouraging the perception that their products are purer and safer than tap water. But the reality is that tap water is actually held to more <strong>stringent </strong>quality standards than bottled water, and some brands of bottled water are just tap water in disguise. What’s more, our increasing consumption of bottled water – more than 22 gallons per U.S. citizen in 2004 according to the Earth Policy Institute – fuels an <strong>unsustainable </strong>industry that takes a heavy toll on the environment.</p>

            <strong>Environmental Impact</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>Fossil fuel consumption</strong></em>. Approximately 1.5 million gallons of oil – enough to run 100,000 cars for a whole year – are used to make plastic water bottles, while transporting these bottles burns thousands more gallons of oil. In addition, the burning of oil and other fossil fuels (which are also used to generate the energy that powers the manufacturing process) emits global warming pollution into the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em><strong>Water consumption</strong></em>. The growth in bottled water production has increased water extraction in areas near bottling plants, leading to water shortages that affect nearby consumers and farmers. In addition to the millions of gallons of water used in the plastic-making process, two gallons of water are wasted in the purification process for every gallon that goes into the bottles.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em><strong>Waste</strong></em>. Only about 10 percent of water bottles are recycled, leaving the rest in landfills where it takes thousands of years for the plastic to decompose.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The next time you feel thirsty, forgo the bottle and turn to the tap. You’ll not only lower your environmental impact but also save money – bottled water can cost up to 10,000 times more per gallon than tap water, and because the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s standards for tap water are more stringent than the Food and Drug Administration’s standards for bottled water, you’ll be drinking water that is just as safe as, or safer than, bottled.</p>

          <strong>IS BOTTLED WATER BETTER?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Bottled water manufacturers’ marketing campaigns capitalize on isolated instances of <strong>contaminated </strong>public drinking water supplies by encouraging the perception that their products are purer and safer than tap water. But the reality is that tap water is actually held to more <strong>stringent </strong>quality standards than bottled water, and some brands of bottled water are just tap water in disguise. What’s more, our increasing consumption of bottled water – more than 22 gallons per U.S. citizen in 2004 according to the Earth Policy Institute – fuels an <strong>unsustainable </strong>industry that takes a heavy toll on the environment.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>Environmental Impact</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>Fossil fuel consumption</strong></em>. Approximately 1.5 million gallons of oil – enough to run 100,000 cars for a whole year – are used to make plastic water bottles, while transporting these bottles burns thousands more gallons of oil. In addition, the burning of oil and other fossil fuels (which are also used to generate the energy that powers the manufacturing process) emits global warming pollution into the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em><strong>Water consumption</strong></em>. The growth in bottled water production has increased water extraction in areas near bottling plants, leading to water shortages that affect nearby consumers and farmers. In addition to the millions of gallons of water used in the plastic-making process, two gallons of water are wasted in the purification process for every gallon that goes into the bottles.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em><strong>Waste</strong></em>. Only about 10 percent of water bottles are recycled, leaving the rest in landfills where it takes thousands of years for the plastic to decompose.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>The Simple (and Cheaper) Solution</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>The next time you feel thirsty, forgo the bottle and turn to the tap. You’ll not only lower your environmental impact but also save money – bottled water can cost up to 10,000 times more per gallon than tap water, and because the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s standards for tap water are more stringent than the Food and Drug Administration’s standards for bottled water, you’ll be drinking water that is just as safe as, or safer than, bottled.</p>

          <strong>Building a Worm Farm</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Presenter: Jane Edmanson [20/01/2007]</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>Jane explains the benefits of worm farms</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>There can be no doubt that worms are the best thing for your garden. Not ordinary worms, but true composting worms - red worms from the Amazon and Tiger Worms. Their job is to live in a worm farm and decompose organic matter to produce marvellous stuff called worm castings, which gives the garden a surge.</p>
        <p>It is easy to get a worm farm established. It’s made up of levels of plastic containers. Start with a solid base, and then add others with perforation. The aim is to build layers for the worms to move through. Look for a base that collects the liquid, (which will drain from the top), and a tap at the bottom means it’s possible to collect the liquid in a bottle. It is absolutely fantastic for watering all your pot plants but it needs to be diluted at 10 to 1.</p>
        <p>When setting up a worm farm firstly consider where to put it. A cool, dry space is fine, but not in the hot afternoon sun. Next step is to set up the base, or bedding area, which needs to be put down with a layer of moistened newspaper.</p>
        <p>The worms are available in bulk from hardware stores or a general nursery. About 500 come in a little bag with some bedding material, which is usually sawdust. Just spread that out.</p>
        <p>Only feed a little bit at this stage because they are getting settled into the bedding material. Use lettuce, old bits of banana, anything that you've got that's wasteful in the kitchen sink. Then add just enough newspaper or hessian over the top to keep them moist. Always make sure that the newspaper, or hessian, is kept moist. They will start to feed and after about two weeks, add the next layer on top and that's the time to start feeding all organic waste and the worms will travel up through the perforations.</p>
        <p>Worms like moistened cardboard or newspaper, food scraps, and they love eggshells, but crunch them up a little. It gives them variety in their diet. Coffee grindings and tea leaves are absolutely fantastic and throw in all the kitchen scraps. But don’t add too much citrus and onions, which are acidic and worms don't like them that much. Just use a few.</p>
        <p>Things to avoid include tough garden clippings because it takes a long time for a worm to chew through them and meat, because that attracts vermin. But dog hair and vacuum cleaning bags are fantastic. Then put the lid on to seal it.</p>
        <p>If the worm farm is too dry and has ants, then add vegetable matter that rots down and some water to ensure it isn't too dry. Little vinegar flies hovering means it's too acidic, so add some lime and ruffle it up a little.</p>
        <p>After four or five months the worm casts or vermicast on the bottom level will be ready to use. It’s powerful stuff. To get the worms out before putting the vermicast onto the garden, just put them in the sunlight and scrape the top layer of the worm castings off. The worms will then tunnel down to get away from the sunlight. Use vermicast wisely because it is potent. A piece about 10cm is enough to put around a shrub or pot plant. Just sprinkle it around plants and they will love it.</p>
        <p>Many people think worms are yucky, but in fact they are quite clean. They have no known diseases and their digestive system destroys pathogens. The job they do cannot be compared to anything else. If everyone had a worm farm our compostable garbage would be reduced by 1 tonne per person per year. That's an amazing amount and worms do it all for you. They are really fantastic - so happy worm farming.</p>

        </p>
        <p>There can be no doubt that worms are the best thing for your garden. Not ordinary worms, but true composting worms - red worms from the Amazon and Tiger Worms. Their job is to live in a worm farm and decompose organic matter to produce marvellous stuff called worm castings, which gives the garden a surge.</p>
        <p>It is easy to get a worm farm established. It’s made up of levels of plastic containers. Start with a solid base, and then add others with perforation. The aim is to build layers for the worms to move through. Look for a base that collects the liquid, (which will drain from the top), and a tap at the bottom means it’s possible to collect the liquid in a bottle. It is absolutely fantastic for watering all your pot plants but it needs to be diluted at 10 to 1.</p>
        <p>When setting up a worm farm firstly consider where to put it. A cool, dry space is fine, but not in the hot afternoon sun. Next step is to set up the base, or bedding area, which needs to be put down with a layer of moistened newspaper.</p>
        <p>The worms are available in bulk from hardware stores or a general nursery. About 500 come in a little bag with some bedding material, which is usually sawdust. Just spread that out.</p>
        <p>Only feed a little bit at this stage because they are getting settled into the bedding material. Use lettuce, old bits of banana, anything that you've got that's wasteful in the kitchen sink. Then add just enough newspaper or hessian over the top to keep them moist. Always make sure that the newspaper, or hessian, is kept moist. They will start to feed and after about two weeks, add the next layer on top and that's the time to start feeding all organic waste and the worms will travel up through the perforations.</p>
        <p>Worms like moistened cardboard or newspaper, food scraps, and they love eggshells, but crunch them up a little. It gives them variety in their diet. Coffee grindings and tea leaves are absolutely fantastic and throw in all the kitchen scraps. But don’t add too much citrus and onions, which are acidic and worms don't like them that much. Just use a few.</p>
        <p>Things to avoid include tough garden clippings because it takes a long time for a worm to chew through them and meat, because that attracts vermin. But dog hair and vacuum cleaning bags are fantastic. Then put the lid on to seal it.</p>
        <p>If the worm farm is too dry and has ants, then add vegetable matter that rots down and some water to ensure it isn't too dry. Little vinegar flies hovering means it's too acidic, so add some lime and ruffle it up a little.</p>
        <p>After four or five months the worm casts or vermicast on the bottom level will be ready to use. It’s powerful stuff. To get the worms out before putting the vermicast onto the garden, just put them in the sunlight and scrape the top layer of the worm castings off. The worms will then tunnel down to get away from the sunlight. Use vermicast wisely because it is potent. A piece about 10cm is enough to put around a shrub or pot plant. Just sprinkle it around plants and they will love it.</p>
        <p>Many people think worms are yucky, but in fact they are quite clean. They have no known diseases and their digestive system destroys pathogens. The job they do cannot be compared to anything else. If everyone had a worm farm our compostable garbage would be reduced by 1 tonne per person per year. That's an amazing amount and worms do it all for you. They are really fantastic - so happy worm farming.</p>

To get the worms out before putting the vermicast onto the garden, just put them in the sunlight and scrape the top layer of the worm castings off. The worms will then tunnel down to get away from the sunlight. Use vermicast wisely because it is potent. A piece about 10cm is enough to put around a shrub or pot plant. Just sprinkle it around plants and they will love it.</p>
        <p>Many people think worms are yucky, but in fact they are quite clean. They have no known diseases and their digestive system destroys pathogens. The job they do cannot be compared to anything else. If everyone had a worm farm our compostable garbage would be reduced by 1 tonne per person per year. That's an amazing amount and worms do it all for you. They are really fantastic - so happy worm farming.</p>

          <strong>Building a Worm Farm</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Presenter: Jane Edmanson [20/01/2007]</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>Jane explains the benefits of worm farms</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>There can be no doubt that worms are the best thing for your garden. Not ordinary worms, but true composting worms - red worms from the Amazon and Tiger Worms. Their job is to live in a worm farm and decompose organic matter to produce marvellous stuff called worm castings, which gives the garden a surge.</p>
        <p>It is easy to get a worm farm established. It’s made up of levels of plastic containers. Start with a solid base, and then add others with perforation. The aim is to build layers for the worms to move through. Look for a base that collects the liquid, (which will drain from the top), and a tap at the bottom means it’s possible to collect the liquid in a bottle. It is absolutely fantastic for watering all your pot plants but it needs to be diluted at 10 to 1.</p>
        <p>When setting up a worm farm firstly consider where to put it. A cool, dry space is fine, but not in the hot afternoon sun. Next step is to set up the base, or bedding area, which needs to be put down with a layer of moistened newspaper.</p>
        <p>The worms are available in bulk from hardware stores or a general nursery. About 500 come in a little bag with some bedding material, which is usually sawdust. Just spread that out.</p>
        <p>Only feed a little bit at this stage because they are getting settled into the bedding material. Use lettuce, old bits of banana, anything that you've got that's wasteful in the kitchen sink. Then add just enough newspaper or hessian over the top to keep them moist. Always make sure that the newspaper, or hessian, is kept moist. They will start to feed and after about two weeks, add the next layer on top and that's the time to start feeding all organic waste and the worms will travel up through the perforations.</p>
        <p>Worms like moistened cardboard or newspaper, food scraps, and they love eggshells, but crunch them up a little. It gives them variety in their diet. Coffee grindings and tea leaves are absolutely fantastic and throw in all the kitchen scraps. But don’t add too much citrus and onions, which are acidic and worms don't like them that much. Just use a few.</p>
        <p>Things to avoid include tough garden clippings because it takes a long time for a worm to chew through them and meat, because that attracts vermin. But dog hair and vacuum cleaning bags are fantastic. Then put the lid on to seal it.</p>
        <p>If the worm farm is too dry and has ants, then add vegetable matter that rots down and some water to ensure it isn't too dry. Little vinegar flies hovering means it's too acidic, so add some lime and ruffle it up a little.</p>
        <p>After four or five months the worm casts or vermicast on the bottom level will be ready to use. It’s powerful stuff. To get the worms out before putting the vermicast onto the garden, just put them in the sunlight and scrape the top layer of the worm castings off. The worms will then tunnel down to get away from the sunlight. Use vermicast wisely because it is potent. A piece about 10cm is enough to put around a shrub or pot plant. Just sprinkle it around plants and they will love it.</p>
        <p>Many people think worms are yucky, but in fact they are quite clean. They have no known diseases and their digestive system destroys pathogens. The job they do cannot be compared to anything else. If everyone had a worm farm our compostable garbage would be reduced by 1 tonne per person per year. That's an amazing amount and worms do it all for you. They are really fantastic - so happy worm farming.</p>

        <p>Washington College<br>
<em>Lexington Jan 23 1861</em><br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dear Sister,</p>
        <p>The time has again come round for me to write home. And it must be done tonight or you will not get one this week. Because we have a little more spare time Wednesday night than any other, and precious little then, for in addition to our regular studies we have a poor chance to do for examinations; two of which we will have next week - Greek, Mathematics.</p>
        <p>We are very well. The anniversary of the Graham Society was on last night. It was such a pleasant and beautiful moonlight that there was a large crowd. The anniversary address was delivered by Mr. Paxton of Rockbridge. It was a very good address, well written and very well delivered.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The question, "If Turkey fails to protect her [should] Christian nations interfere" was then discussed by four other members of the Society, whose names it is not necessary to mention. All the front of the college was illuminated and made a very pretty appearance.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>From all I can hear, I think that the secessionists are rapidly gaining ground in Virginia, and would not be surprised if that convention should declare Virginia out of the Union. From present appearances it seems that we are almost sure to have civil war. There are such extensive military preparations going on in the north and from the threatening and insulting way in which the Republican papers and from the overbearing and contemptuous actions of Congress in refusing compromises giving the South the barest justice, it must be Lincoln's intention to compel the South to remain in the Union, if he can. And if he attempts that, the whole South will and ought to unite and oppose it.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Writing letters is the hardest work that I have to do at College and since there is nothing here that will interest you, and believing that I have done remarkably well in having written this much, I quit.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Love to all,<br>
your brother<br>
<br>
A. Brooks</p>

        <p>Washington College<br>
<em>Lexington Jan 23 1861</em><br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dear Sister,</p>
        <p>The time has again come round for me to write home. And it must be done tonight or you will not get one this week. Because we have a little more spare time Wednesday night than any other, and precious little then, for in addition to our regular studies we have a poor chance to do for examinations; two of which we will have next week - Greek, Mathematics.</p>
        <p>We are very well. The anniversary of the Graham Society was on last night. It was such a pleasant and beautiful moonlight that there was a large crowd. The anniversary address was delivered by Mr. Paxton of Rockbridge. It was a very good address, well written and very well delivered.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The question, "If Turkey fails to protect her [should] Christian nations interfere" was then discussed by four other members of the Society, whose names it is not necessary to mention. All the front of the college was illuminated and made a very pretty appearance.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>From all I can hear, I think that the secessionists are rapidly gaining ground in Virginia, and would not be surprised if that convention should declare Virginia out of the Union. From present appearances it seems that we are almost sure to have civil war. There are such extensive military preparations going on in the north and from the threatening and insulting way in which the Republican papers and from the overbearing and contemptuous actions of Congress in refusing compromises giving the South the barest justice, it must be Lincoln's intention to compel the South to remain in the Union, if he can. And if he attempts that, the whole South will and ought to unite and oppose it.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Writing letters is the hardest work that I have to do at College and since there is nothing here that will interest you, and believing that I have done remarkably well in having written this much, I quit.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Love to all,<br>
your brother<br>
<br>
A. Brooks</p>
