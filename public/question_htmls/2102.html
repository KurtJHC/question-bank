          <strong>The Elephant's Child</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by&nbsp;Rudyard Kipling&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (shortened)</em>
        </p>
        <p>In the High and Far-Off Times the Elephant, O Best Beloved, had no trunk. He had only a blackish, bulgy nose, as big as a boot, that he could wriggle about from side to side; but he couldn't pick up things with it. But there was one Elephant--a new Elephant--an Elephant's Child--who was full of 'satiable&nbsp;curtiosity, and that means he asked ever so many questions. He asked questions about everything that he saw, or heard, or felt, or smelt, or touched, and all his uncles and his aunts spanked him. And still he was full of 'satiable curtiosity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ……………………………………………………</p>
        <p>One fine morning in the middle of the Precession of the Equinoxes this 'satiable Elephant's Child asked a new fine question that he had never asked before. He asked, "What does the crocodile have for dinner?" Then everybody said, "Hush!" in a loud and dretful tone, and they spanked him immediately and directly, without stopping, for a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>……………………………………………………</p>
        <p>The Kolokolo Bird said, with a mournful cry, "Go to the banks of the great grey-green, greasy&nbsp;Limpopo River, all set about with fever-trees, and find out." &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;………………………………………..</p>
        <p>"Come hither, Little One," said the Crocodile, "for I am the Crocodile," and he wept crocodile tears to show it was quite true.</p>
        <p>Then the Elephants' child grew all breathless, and panted, and kneeled down on the bank and said, "You are the very person I have been looking for all these long days. Will you please tell me what you have for dinner?"</p>
        <p>"Come hither, Little One," said the Crocodile, "and I'll whisper."</p>
        <p>Then the Elephant's Child put his head down close to the Crocodile's musky, tusky mouth, and the Crocodile caught him by his little nose, which up to that very week, day, hour, and minute, had been no bigger than a boot, though much more useful.</p>
        <p>"I think," said the Crocodile--and he said it between his teeth, like this--"I think to-day I will begin with Elephant's Child!"</p>
        <p>At this, O Best Beloved, the Elephant's Child was much annoyed, and he said, speaking through his nose, like this, "Led go! You are hurtig be!"</p>
        <p>Then the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake scuffled down from the bank and said, "My young friend, if you do not now, immediately and instantly, pull as hard as ever you can, it is my opinion that your acquaintance in the large-pattern leather ulster" and by this he meant the Crocodile "will jerk you into yonder limpid stream before you can say Jack Robinson."</p>
        <p>This is the way Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake always talked.</p>
        <p>Then the Elephant's child sat back on his little haunches, and pulled, and pulled, and pulled, and his nose began to stretch. And the Crocodile floundered into the water, making it all creamy with great sweeps of his tail, and&nbsp;he&nbsp;pulled, and pulled, and pulled.</p>
        <p>And the Elephant's Child's nose kept on stretching; and the Elephant's child spread all his little four legs and pulled, and pulled, and pulled, and his nose kept on stretching; and the Crocodile threshed his tail like an oar, and&nbsp;he&nbsp;pulled, and pulled, and pulled, and at each pull the Elephant's Child's nose grew longer and longer--and it hurt him hijjus!!</p>
        <p>Then the Elephant's Child felt his legs slipping, and he said through his nose, which was now nearly five feet long, "This is to butch for be!"</p>
        <p>Then the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake came down from the bank, and knotted himself in a double-clove-hitch round the Elephant's Child's hind legs.</p>
        <p>So he pulled, and the Elephant's Child pulled, and the Crocodile pulled, but the Elephant's Child and the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake pulled hardest; and at last the Crocodile let go of the Elephant's Child's nose with a plop that you could hear all up and down the Limpopo.</p>
        <p>Then the Elephant's Child sat down most hard and sudden; but first he was careful to say "Thank you" to the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake; and next he was kind to his poor pulled nose, and wrapped it all up in cool banana leaves, and hung it in the great grey-green greasy Limpopo to cool.</p>
        <p>"What are you doing that for?" said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake.</p>
        <p>"'Scuse me," said the Elephant's Child, "but my nose is badly out of shape, and I am waiting for it to shrink."</p>
        <p>"Then you will have to wait a long time," said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake. "Some people do not know what is good for them."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Elephant's Child sat there for three days waiting for his nose to shrink. But it never grew any shorter, and, besides, it made him squint. For, O Best Beloved, you will understand that the Crocodile had pulled it out into a really truly trunk, same as all Elephant's have today.</p>
        <p>At the end of the third day a fly came and stung him on the shoulder, and before he knew what he was doing he lifted up his trunk and hit that fly dead with the end of it.</p>
        <p>"'Vantage number one!" said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake. "You couldn't have done that with a mere-smear nose. Try and eat a little now."</p>
        <p>Before he thought what he was doing the Elephant's Child put out his trunk and plucked a large bundle of grass, dusted it clean against his forelegs, and stuffed it into his mouth.</p>
        <p>"'Vantage number two!" said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake. "You couldn't have done that with a mere-smear nose. Don't you think the sun is very hot here?"</p>
        <p>"It is," said the Elephant's Child, and before he thought what he was doing he schlooped up a schloop of mud from the banks of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo, and slapped it on his head, where it made a cool schloopy-sloshy mud-cap all trickly behind his ears.</p>
        <p>"'Vantage number three!" said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake. "You couldn't have done that with a mere-smear nose. You will find that new nose of yours very useful to spank people with."</p>
        <p>So the Elephant's Child went home across Africa frisking and whisking his trunk. When he wanted fruit to eat he pulled fruit down from a tree, instead of waiting for it to fall as he used to do. When he wanted grass he plucked grass up from the ground, instead of going on his knees as he used to do. When the flies bit him he broke off the branch of a tree and used it as a fly-whisk; and he made himself a new, cool slushy-squshy mud-cap whenever the sun was hot. When he felt lonely walking through Africa he sang to himself down his trunk, and the noise was louder than several brass bands. He went especially out of his way to find a broad Hippopotamus she was no relation of his, and he spanked her very hard, to make sure that the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake had spoken the truth about his new trunk. The rest of the time he picked up the melon rinds that he had dropped on his way to the Limpopo--for he was a Tidy&nbsp;Pachyderm.</p>
        <p>One dark evening he came back to all his dear families, and he coiled up his trunk and said, "How do you do?" They were very glad to see him, and immediately said, "Come here and be spanked for your 'satiable curtiosity."</p>
        <p>"Pooh," said the Elephant's Child. "I don't think you people's know anything about spanking; but&nbsp;I&nbsp;do, and I'll show you."</p>
        <p>Then he uncurled his trunk and knocked two of his dear brothers head over heels.</p>
        <p>"O Bananas!" said they, "Where did you learn that trick, and what have you done to your nose?"</p>
        <p>"I got a new one from the Crocodile on the banks of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo River," said the Elephant's Child. "I asked him what he had for dinner, and he gave me this to keep."</p>
        <p>"It looks very ugly," said his hairy uncle, the Baboon.</p>
        <p>"It does," said the Elephant's Child. "But it's very useful," and he picked up his hairy uncle, the Baboon, by one hairy leg, and hove him into a hornets' nest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ……………………………………………………..</p>
        <p>Then that bad Elephant's Child spanked all his dear families for a long time, till they were very warm and greatly astonished. He pulled out his tall Ostrich aunt's tail-feathers; and he caught his tall uncle, the Giraffe, by the hind-leg, and dragged him through a thorn-bush; and he shouted at his broad aunt, the Hippopotamus, and blew bubbles into her ear when she was sleeping in the water after meals; but he never let any one touch the Kolokolo Bird.</p>
        <p>At last things grew so exciting that his dear families went off one by one in a hurry to the banks of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo River, all set about with fever-trees, to borrow new noses from the Crocodile. When they came back nobody spanked anybody anymore; and ever since that day, O Best Beloved, all the Elephants you will ever see besides all those that you won't, have trunks precisely like the trunk of the 'satiable Elephant's Child.</p>

          <strong>The Elephant's Child</strong>

        <p>"It does," said the Elephant's Child. "But it's very useful," and he picked up his hairy uncle, the Baboon, by one hairy leg, and hove him into a hornets' nest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ……………………………………………………..</p>
        <p>Then that bad Elephant's Child spanked all his dear families for a long time, till they were very warm and greatly astonished. He pulled out his tall Ostrich aunt's tail-feathers; and he caught his tall uncle, the Giraffe, by the hind-leg, and dragged him through a thorn-bush; and he shouted at his broad aunt, the Hippopotamus, and blew bubbles into her ear when she was sleeping in the water after meals; but he never let any one touch the Kolokolo Bird.</p>
        <p>At last things grew so exciting that his dear families went off one by one in a hurry to the banks of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo River, all set about with fever-trees, to borrow new noses from the Crocodile. When they came back nobody spanked anybody anymore; and ever since that day, O Best Beloved, all the Elephants you will ever see besides all those that you won't, have trunks precisely like the trunk of the 'satiable Elephant's Child.</p>

          <strong>The Elephant's Child</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by&nbsp;Rudyard Kipling&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (shortened)</em>
        </p>
        <p>In the High and Far-Off Times the Elephant, O Best Beloved, had no trunk. He had only a blackish, bulgy nose, as big as a boot, that he could wriggle about from side to side; but he couldn't pick up things with it. But there was one Elephant--a new Elephant--an Elephant's Child--who was full of 'satiable&nbsp;curtiosity, and that means he asked ever so many questions. He asked questions about everything that he saw, or heard, or felt, or smelt, or touched, and all his uncles and his aunts spanked him. And still he was full of 'satiable curtiosity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ……………………………………………………</p>
        <p>One fine morning in the middle of the Precession of the Equinoxes this 'satiable Elephant's Child asked a new fine question that he had never asked before. He asked, "What does the crocodile have for dinner?" Then everybody said, "Hush!" in a loud and dretful tone, and they spanked him immediately and directly, without stopping, for a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>……………………………………………………</p>
        <p>The Kolokolo Bird said, with a mournful cry, "Go to the banks of the great grey-green, greasy&nbsp;Limpopo River, all set about with fever-trees, and find out." &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;………………………………………..</p>
        <p>"Come hither, Little One," said the Crocodile, "for I am the Crocodile," and he wept crocodile tears to show it was quite true.</p>
        <p>Then the Elephants' child grew all breathless, and panted, and kneeled down on the bank and said, "You are the very person I have been looking for all these long days. Will you please tell me what you have for dinner?"</p>
        <p>"Come hither, Little One," said the Crocodile, "and I'll whisper."</p>
        <p>Then the Elephant's Child put his head down close to the Crocodile's musky, tusky mouth, and the Crocodile caught him by his little nose, which up to that very week, day, hour, and minute, had been no bigger than a boot, though much more useful.</p>
        <p>"I think," said the Crocodile--and he said it between his teeth, like this--"I think to-day I will begin with Elephant's Child!"</p>
        <p>At this, O Best Beloved, the Elephant's Child was much annoyed, and he said, speaking through his nose, like this, "Led go! You are hurtig be!"</p>
        <p>Then the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake scuffled down from the bank and said, "My young friend, if you do not now, immediately and instantly, pull as hard as ever you can, it is my opinion that your acquaintance in the large-pattern leather ulster" and by this he meant the Crocodile "will jerk you into yonder limpid stream before you can say Jack Robinson."</p>
        <p>This is the way Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake always talked.</p>
        <p>Then the Elephant's child sat back on his little haunches, and pulled, and pulled, and pulled, and his nose began to stretch. And the Crocodile floundered into the water, making it all creamy with great sweeps of his tail, and&nbsp;he&nbsp;pulled, and pulled, and pulled.</p>
        <p>And the Elephant's Child's nose kept on stretching; and the Elephant's child spread all his little four legs and pulled, and pulled, and pulled, and his nose kept on stretching; and the Crocodile threshed his tail like an oar, and&nbsp;he&nbsp;pulled, and pulled, and pulled, and at each pull the Elephant's Child's nose grew longer and longer--and it hurt him hijjus!!</p>
        <p>Then the Elephant's Child felt his legs slipping, and he said through his nose, which was now nearly five feet long, "This is to butch for be!"</p>
        <p>Then the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake came down from the bank, and knotted himself in a double-clove-hitch round the Elephant's Child's hind legs.</p>
        <p>So he pulled, and the Elephant's Child pulled, and the Crocodile pulled, but the Elephant's Child and the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake pulled hardest; and at last the Crocodile let go of the Elephant's Child's nose with a plop that you could hear all up and down the Limpopo.</p>
        <p>Then the Elephant's Child sat down most hard and sudden; but first he was careful to say "Thank you" to the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake; and next he was kind to his poor pulled nose, and wrapped it all up in cool banana leaves, and hung it in the great grey-green greasy Limpopo to cool.</p>
        <p>"What are you doing that for?" said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake.</p>
        <p>"'Scuse me," said the Elephant's Child, "but my nose is badly out of shape, and I am waiting for it to shrink."</p>
        <p>"Then you will have to wait a long time," said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake. "Some people do not know what is good for them."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Elephant's Child sat there for three days waiting for his nose to shrink. But it never grew any shorter, and, besides, it made him squint. For, O Best Beloved, you will understand that the Crocodile had pulled it out into a really truly trunk, same as all Elephant's have today.</p>
        <p>At the end of the third day a fly came and stung him on the shoulder, and before he knew what he was doing he lifted up his trunk and hit that fly dead with the end of it.</p>
        <p>"'Vantage number one!" said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake. "You couldn't have done that with a mere-smear nose. Try and eat a little now."</p>
        <p>Before he thought what he was doing the Elephant's Child put out his trunk and plucked a large bundle of grass, dusted it clean against his forelegs, and stuffed it into his mouth.</p>
        <p>"'Vantage number two!" said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake. "You couldn't have done that with a mere-smear nose. Don't you think the sun is very hot here?"</p>
        <p>"It is," said the Elephant's Child, and before he thought what he was doing he schlooped up a schloop of mud from the banks of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo, and slapped it on his head, where it made a cool schloopy-sloshy mud-cap all trickly behind his ears.</p>
        <p>"'Vantage number three!" said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake. "You couldn't have done that with a mere-smear nose. You will find that new nose of yours very useful to spank people with."</p>
        <p>So the Elephant's Child went home across Africa frisking and whisking his trunk. When he wanted fruit to eat he pulled fruit down from a tree, instead of waiting for it to fall as he used to do. When he wanted grass he plucked grass up from the ground, instead of going on his knees as he used to do. When the flies bit him he broke off the branch of a tree and used it as a fly-whisk; and he made himself a new, cool slushy-squshy mud-cap whenever the sun was hot. When he felt lonely walking through Africa he sang to himself down his trunk, and the noise was louder than several brass bands. He went especially out of his way to find a broad Hippopotamus she was no relation of his, and he spanked her very hard, to make sure that the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake had spoken the truth about his new trunk. The rest of the time he picked up the melon rinds that he had dropped on his way to the Limpopo--for he was a Tidy&nbsp;Pachyderm.</p>
        <p>One dark evening he came back to all his dear families, and he coiled up his trunk and said, "How do you do?" They were very glad to see him, and immediately said, "Come here and be spanked for your 'satiable curtiosity."</p>
        <p>"Pooh," said the Elephant's Child. "I don't think you people's know anything about spanking; but&nbsp;I&nbsp;do, and I'll show you."</p>
        <p>Then he uncurled his trunk and knocked two of his dear brothers head over heels.</p>
        <p>"O Bananas!" said they, "Where did you learn that trick, and what have you done to your nose?"</p>
        <p>"I got a new one from the Crocodile on the banks of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo River," said the Elephant's Child. "I asked him what he had for dinner, and he gave me this to keep."</p>
        <p>"It looks very ugly," said his hairy uncle, the Baboon.</p>
        <p>"It does," said the Elephant's Child. "But it's very useful," and he picked up his hairy uncle, the Baboon, by one hairy leg, and hove him into a hornets' nest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ……………………………………………………..</p>
        <p>Then that bad Elephant's Child spanked all his dear families for a long time, till they were very warm and greatly astonished. He pulled out his tall Ostrich aunt's tail-feathers; and he caught his tall uncle, the Giraffe, by the hind-leg, and dragged him through a thorn-bush; and he shouted at his broad aunt, the Hippopotamus, and blew bubbles into her ear when she was sleeping in the water after meals; but he never let any one touch the Kolokolo Bird.</p>
        <p>At last things grew so exciting that his dear families went off one by one in a hurry to the banks of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo River, all set about with fever-trees, to borrow new noses from the Crocodile. When they came back nobody spanked anybody anymore; and ever since that day, O Best Beloved, all the Elephants you will ever see besides all those that you won't, have trunks precisely like the trunk of the 'satiable Elephant's Child.</p>

          <strong>The Elephant's Child</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by&nbsp;Rudyard Kipling&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (shortened)</em>
        </p>
        <p>In the High and Far-Off Times the Elephant, O Best Beloved, had no trunk. He had only a blackish, bulgy nose, as big as a boot, that he could wriggle about from side to side; but he couldn't pick up things with it. But there was one Elephant--a new Elephant--an Elephant's Child--who was full of 'satiable&nbsp;curtiosity, and that means he asked ever so many questions. He asked questions about everything that he saw, or heard, or felt, or smelt, or touched, and all his uncles and his aunts spanked him. And still he was full of 'satiable curtiosity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ……………………………………………………</p>
        <p>One fine morning in the middle of the Precession of the Equinoxes this 'satiable Elephant's Child asked a new fine question that he had never asked before. He asked, "What does the crocodile have for dinner?" Then everybody said, "Hush!" in a loud and dretful tone, and they spanked him immediately and directly, without stopping, for a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>……………………………………………………</p>
        <p>The Kolokolo Bird said, with a mournful cry, "Go to the banks of the great grey-green, greasy&nbsp;Limpopo River, all set about with fever-trees, and find out." &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;………………………………………..</p>
        <p>"Come hither, Little One," said the Crocodile, "for I am the Crocodile," and he wept crocodile tears to show it was quite true.</p>
        <p>Then the Elephants' child grew all breathless, and panted, and kneeled down on the bank and said, "You are the very person I have been looking for all these long days. Will you please tell me what you have for dinner?"</p>
        <p>"Come hither, Little One," said the Crocodile, "and I'll whisper."</p>
        <p>Then the Elephant's Child put his head down close to the Crocodile's musky, tusky mouth, and the Crocodile caught him by his little nose, which up to that very week, day, hour, and minute, had been no bigger than a boot, though much more useful.</p>
        <p>"I think," said the Crocodile--and he said it between his teeth, like this--"I think to-day I will begin with Elephant's Child!"</p>
        <p>At this, O Best Beloved, the Elephant's Child was much annoyed, and he said, speaking through his nose, like this, "Led go! You are hurtig be!"</p>
        <p>Then the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake scuffled down from the bank and said, "My young friend, if you do not now, immediately and instantly, pull as hard as ever you can, it is my opinion that your acquaintance in the large-pattern leather ulster" and by this he meant the Crocodile "will jerk you into yonder limpid stream before you can say Jack Robinson."</p>
        <p>This is the way Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake always talked.</p>
        <p>Then the Elephant's child sat back on his little haunches, and pulled, and pulled, and pulled, and his nose began to stretch. And the Crocodile floundered into the water, making it all creamy with great sweeps of his tail, and&nbsp;he&nbsp;pulled, and pulled, and pulled.</p>
        <p>And the Elephant's Child's nose kept on stretching; and the Elephant's child spread all his little four legs and pulled, and pulled, and pulled, and his nose kept on stretching; and the Crocodile threshed his tail like an oar, and&nbsp;he&nbsp;pulled, and pulled, and pulled, and at each pull the Elephant's Child's nose grew longer and longer--and it hurt him hijjus!!</p>
        <p>Then the Elephant's Child felt his legs slipping, and he said through his nose, which was now nearly five feet long, "This is to butch for be!"</p>
        <p>Then the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake came down from the bank, and knotted himself in a double-clove-hitch round the Elephant's Child's hind legs.</p>
        <p>So he pulled, and the Elephant's Child pulled, and the Crocodile pulled, but the Elephant's Child and the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake pulled hardest; and at last the Crocodile let go of the Elephant's Child's nose with a plop that you could hear all up and down the Limpopo.</p>
        <p>Then the Elephant's Child sat down most hard and sudden; but first he was careful to say "Thank you" to the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake; and next he was kind to his poor pulled nose, and wrapped it all up in cool banana leaves, and hung it in the great grey-green greasy Limpopo to cool.</p>
        <p>"What are you doing that for?" said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake.</p>
        <p>"'Scuse me," said the Elephant's Child, "but my nose is badly out of shape, and I am waiting for it to shrink."</p>
        <p>"Then you will have to wait a long time," said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake. "Some people do not know what is good for them."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Elephant's Child sat there for three days waiting for his nose to shrink. But it never grew any shorter, and, besides, it made him squint. For, O Best Beloved, you will understand that the Crocodile had pulled it out into a really truly trunk, same as all Elephant's have today.</p>
        <p>At the end of the third day a fly came and stung him on the shoulder, and before he knew what he was doing he lifted up his trunk and hit that fly dead with the end of it.</p>
        <p>"'Vantage number one!" said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake. "You couldn't have done that with a mere-smear nose. Try and eat a little now."</p>
        <p>Before he thought what he was doing the Elephant's Child put out his trunk and plucked a large bundle of grass, dusted it clean against his forelegs, and stuffed it into his mouth.</p>
        <p>"'Vantage number two!" said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake. "You couldn't have done that with a mere-smear nose. Don't you think the sun is very hot here?"</p>
        <p>"It is," said the Elephant's Child, and before he thought what he was doing he schlooped up a schloop of mud from the banks of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo, and slapped it on his head, where it made a cool schloopy-sloshy mud-cap all trickly behind his ears.</p>
        <p>"'Vantage number three!" said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake. "You couldn't have done that with a mere-smear nose. You will find that new nose of yours very useful to spank people with."</p>
        <p>So the Elephant's Child went home across Africa frisking and whisking his trunk. When he wanted fruit to eat he pulled fruit down from a tree, instead of waiting for it to fall as he used to do. When he wanted grass he plucked grass up from the ground, instead of going on his knees as he used to do. When the flies bit him he broke off the branch of a tree and used it as a fly-whisk; and he made himself a new, cool slushy-squshy mud-cap whenever the sun was hot. When he felt lonely walking through Africa he sang to himself down his trunk, and the noise was louder than several brass bands. He went especially out of his way to find a broad Hippopotamus she was no relation of his, and he spanked her very hard, to make sure that the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake had spoken the truth about his new trunk. The rest of the time he picked up the melon rinds that he had dropped on his way to the Limpopo--for he was a Tidy&nbsp;Pachyderm.</p>
        <p>One dark evening he came back to all his dear families, and he coiled up his trunk and said, "How do you do?" They were very glad to see him, and immediately said, "Come here and be spanked for your 'satiable curtiosity."</p>
        <p>"Pooh," said the Elephant's Child. "I don't think you people's know anything about spanking; but&nbsp;I&nbsp;do, and I'll show you."</p>
        <p>Then he uncurled his trunk and knocked two of his dear brothers head over heels.</p>
        <p>"O Bananas!" said they, "Where did you learn that trick, and what have you done to your nose?"</p>
        <p>"I got a new one from the Crocodile on the banks of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo River," said the Elephant's Child. "I asked him what he had for dinner, and he gave me this to keep."</p>
        <p>"It looks very ugly," said his hairy uncle, the Baboon.</p>
        <p>"It does," said the Elephant's Child. "But it's very useful," and he picked up his hairy uncle, the Baboon, by one hairy leg, and hove him into a hornets' nest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ……………………………………………………..</p>
        <p>Then that bad Elephant's Child spanked all his dear families for a long time, till they were very warm and greatly astonished. He pulled out his tall Ostrich aunt's tail-feathers; and he caught his tall uncle, the Giraffe, by the hind-leg, and dragged him through a thorn-bush; and he shouted at his broad aunt, the Hippopotamus, and blew bubbles into her ear when she was sleeping in the water after meals; but he never let any one touch the Kolokolo Bird.</p>
        <p>At last things grew so exciting that his dear families went off one by one in a hurry to the banks of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo River, all set about with fever-trees, to borrow new noses from the Crocodile. When they came back nobody spanked anybody anymore; and ever since that day, O Best Beloved, all the Elephants you will ever see besides all those that you won't, have trunks precisely like the trunk of the 'satiable Elephant's Child.</p>

          <strong>The Elephant's Child</strong>

He pulled out his tall Ostrich aunt's tail-feathers; and he caught his tall uncle, the Giraffe, by the hind-leg, and dragged him through a thorn-bush; and he shouted at his broad aunt, the Hippopotamus, and blew bubbles into her ear when she was sleeping in the water after meals; but he never let any one touch the Kolokolo Bird.</p>
        <p>At last things grew so exciting that his dear families went off one by one in a hurry to the banks of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo River, all set about with fever-trees, to borrow new noses from the Crocodile. When they came back nobody spanked anybody anymore; and ever since that day, O Best Beloved, all the Elephants you will ever see besides all those that you won't, have trunks precisely like the trunk of the 'satiable Elephant's Child.</p>

          <strong>The Elephant's Child</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by&nbsp;Rudyard Kipling&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (shortened)</em>
        </p>
        <p>In the High and Far-Off Times the Elephant, O Best Beloved, had no trunk. He had only a blackish, bulgy nose, as big as a boot, that he could wriggle about from side to side; but he couldn't pick up things with it. But there was one Elephant--a new Elephant--an Elephant's Child--who was full of 'satiable&nbsp;curtiosity, and that means he asked ever so many questions. He asked questions about everything that he saw, or heard, or felt, or smelt, or touched, and all his uncles and his aunts spanked him. And still he was full of 'satiable curtiosity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ……………………………………………………</p>
        <p>One fine morning in the middle of the Precession of the Equinoxes this 'satiable Elephant's Child asked a new fine question that he had never asked before. He asked, "What does the crocodile have for dinner?" Then everybody said, "Hush!" in a loud and dretful tone, and they spanked him immediately and directly, without stopping, for a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>……………………………………………………</p>
        <p>The Kolokolo Bird said, with a mournful cry, "Go to the banks of the great grey-green, greasy&nbsp;Limpopo River, all set about with fever-trees, and find out." &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;………………………………………..</p>
        <p>"Come hither, Little One," said the Crocodile, "for I am the Crocodile," and he wept crocodile tears to show it was quite true.</p>
        <p>Then the Elephants' child grew all breathless, and panted, and kneeled down on the bank and said, "You are the very person I have been looking for all these long days. Will you please tell me what you have for dinner?"</p>
        <p>"Come hither, Little One," said the Crocodile, "and I'll whisper."</p>
        <p>Then the Elephant's Child put his head down close to the Crocodile's musky, tusky mouth, and the Crocodile caught him by his little nose, which up to that very week, day, hour, and minute, had been no bigger than a boot, though much more useful.</p>
        <p>"I think," said the Crocodile--and he said it between his teeth, like this--"I think to-day I will begin with Elephant's Child!"</p>
        <p>At this, O Best Beloved, the Elephant's Child was much annoyed, and he said, speaking through his nose, like this, "Led go! You are hurtig be!"</p>
        <p>Then the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake scuffled down from the bank and said, "My young friend, if you do not now, immediately and instantly, pull as hard as ever you can, it is my opinion that your acquaintance in the large-pattern leather ulster" and by this he meant the Crocodile "will jerk you into yonder limpid stream before you can say Jack Robinson."</p>
        <p>This is the way Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake always talked.</p>
        <p>Then the Elephant's child sat back on his little haunches, and pulled, and pulled, and pulled, and his nose began to stretch. And the Crocodile floundered into the water, making it all creamy with great sweeps of his tail, and&nbsp;he&nbsp;pulled, and pulled, and pulled.</p>
        <p>And the Elephant's Child's nose kept on stretching; and the Elephant's child spread all his little four legs and pulled, and pulled, and pulled, and his nose kept on stretching; and the Crocodile threshed his tail like an oar, and&nbsp;he&nbsp;pulled, and pulled, and pulled, and at each pull the Elephant's Child's nose grew longer and longer--and it hurt him hijjus!!</p>
        <p>Then the Elephant's Child felt his legs slipping, and he said through his nose, which was now nearly five feet long, "This is to butch for be!"</p>
        <p>Then the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake came down from the bank, and knotted himself in a double-clove-hitch round the Elephant's Child's hind legs.</p>
        <p>So he pulled, and the Elephant's Child pulled, and the Crocodile pulled, but the Elephant's Child and the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake pulled hardest; and at last the Crocodile let go of the Elephant's Child's nose with a plop that you could hear all up and down the Limpopo.</p>
        <p>Then the Elephant's Child sat down most hard and sudden; but first he was careful to say "Thank you" to the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake; and next he was kind to his poor pulled nose, and wrapped it all up in cool banana leaves, and hung it in the great grey-green greasy Limpopo to cool.</p>
        <p>"What are you doing that for?" said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake.</p>
        <p>"'Scuse me," said the Elephant's Child, "but my nose is badly out of shape, and I am waiting for it to shrink."</p>
        <p>"Then you will have to wait a long time," said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake. "Some people do not know what is good for them."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Elephant's Child sat there for three days waiting for his nose to shrink. But it never grew any shorter, and, besides, it made him squint. For, O Best Beloved, you will understand that the Crocodile had pulled it out into a really truly trunk, same as all Elephant's have today.</p>
        <p>At the end of the third day a fly came and stung him on the shoulder, and before he knew what he was doing he lifted up his trunk and hit that fly dead with the end of it.</p>
        <p>"'Vantage number one!" said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake. "You couldn't have done that with a mere-smear nose. Try and eat a little now."</p>
        <p>Before he thought what he was doing the Elephant's Child put out his trunk and plucked a large bundle of grass, dusted it clean against his forelegs, and stuffed it into his mouth.</p>
        <p>"'Vantage number two!" said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake. "You couldn't have done that with a mere-smear nose. Don't you think the sun is very hot here?"</p>
        <p>"It is," said the Elephant's Child, and before he thought what he was doing he schlooped up a schloop of mud from the banks of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo, and slapped it on his head, where it made a cool schloopy-sloshy mud-cap all trickly behind his ears.</p>
        <p>"'Vantage number three!" said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake. "You couldn't have done that with a mere-smear nose. You will find that new nose of yours very useful to spank people with."</p>
        <p>So the Elephant's Child went home across Africa frisking and whisking his trunk. When he wanted fruit to eat he pulled fruit down from a tree, instead of waiting for it to fall as he used to do. When he wanted grass he plucked grass up from the ground, instead of going on his knees as he used to do. When the flies bit him he broke off the branch of a tree and used it as a fly-whisk; and he made himself a new, cool slushy-squshy mud-cap whenever the sun was hot. When he felt lonely walking through Africa he sang to himself down his trunk, and the noise was louder than several brass bands. He went especially out of his way to find a broad Hippopotamus she was no relation of his, and he spanked her very hard, to make sure that the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake had spoken the truth about his new trunk. The rest of the time he picked up the melon rinds that he had dropped on his way to the Limpopo--for he was a Tidy&nbsp;Pachyderm.</p>
        <p>One dark evening he came back to all his dear families, and he coiled up his trunk and said, "How do you do?" They were very glad to see him, and immediately said, "Come here and be spanked for your 'satiable curtiosity."</p>
        <p>"Pooh," said the Elephant's Child. "I don't think you people's know anything about spanking; but&nbsp;I&nbsp;do, and I'll show you."</p>
        <p>Then he uncurled his trunk and knocked two of his dear brothers head over heels.</p>
        <p>"O Bananas!" said they, "Where did you learn that trick, and what have you done to your nose?"</p>
        <p>"I got a new one from the Crocodile on the banks of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo River," said the Elephant's Child. "I asked him what he had for dinner, and he gave me this to keep."</p>
        <p>"It looks very ugly," said his hairy uncle, the Baboon.</p>
        <p>"It does," said the Elephant's Child. "But it's very useful," and he picked up his hairy uncle, the Baboon, by one hairy leg, and hove him into a hornets' nest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ……………………………………………………..</p>
        <p>Then that bad Elephant's Child spanked all his dear families for a long time, till they were very warm and greatly astonished. He pulled out his tall Ostrich aunt's tail-feathers; and he caught his tall uncle, the Giraffe, by the hind-leg, and dragged him through a thorn-bush; and he shouted at his broad aunt, the Hippopotamus, and blew bubbles into her ear when she was sleeping in the water after meals; but he never let any one touch the Kolokolo Bird.</p>
        <p>At last things grew so exciting that his dear families went off one by one in a hurry to the banks of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo River, all set about with fever-trees, to borrow new noses from the Crocodile. When they came back nobody spanked anybody anymore; and ever since that day, O Best Beloved, all the Elephants you will ever see besides all those that you won't, have trunks precisely like the trunk of the 'satiable Elephant's Child.</p>

          <br>
          <em>by&nbsp;Rudyard Kipling&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (shortened)</em>
        </p>
        <p>In the High and Far-Off Times the Elephant, O Best Beloved, had no trunk. He had only a blackish, bulgy nose, as big as a boot, that he could wriggle about from side to side; but he couldn't pick up things with it. But there was one Elephant--a new Elephant--an Elephant's Child--who was full of 'satiable&nbsp;curtiosity, and that means he asked ever so many questions. He asked questions about everything that he saw, or heard, or felt, or smelt, or touched, and all his uncles and his aunts spanked him. And still he was full of 'satiable curtiosity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ……………………………………………………</p>
        <p>One fine morning in the middle of the Precession of the Equinoxes this 'satiable Elephant's Child asked a new fine question that he had never asked before. He asked, "What does the crocodile have for dinner?" Then everybody said, "Hush!" in a loud and dretful tone, and they spanked him immediately and directly, without stopping, for a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>……………………………………………………</p>
        <p>The Kolokolo Bird said, with a mournful cry, "Go to the banks of the great grey-green, greasy&nbsp;Limpopo River, all set about with fever-trees, and find out." &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;………………………………………..</p>
        <p>"Come hither, Little One," said the Crocodile, "for I am the Crocodile," and he wept crocodile tears to show it was quite true.</p>
        <p>Then the Elephants' child grew all breathless, and panted, and kneeled down on the bank and said, "You are the very person I have been looking for all these long days. Will you please tell me what you have for dinner?"</p>
        <p>"Come hither, Little One," said the Crocodile, "and I'll whisper."</p>
        <p>Then the Elephant's Child put his head down close to the Crocodile's musky, tusky mouth, and the Crocodile caught him by his little nose, which up to that very week, day, hour, and minute, had been no bigger than a boot, though much more useful.</p>
        <p>"I think," said the Crocodile--and he said it between his teeth, like this--"I think to-day I will begin with Elephant's Child!"</p>
        <p>At this, O Best Beloved, the Elephant's Child was much annoyed, and he said, speaking through his nose, like this, "Led go! You are hurtig be!"</p>
        <p>Then the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake scuffled down from the bank and said, "My young friend, if you do not now, immediately and instantly, pull as hard as ever you can, it is my opinion that your acquaintance in the large-pattern leather ulster" and by this he meant the Crocodile "will jerk you into yonder limpid stream before you can say Jack Robinson."</p>
        <p>This is the way Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake always talked.</p>
        <p>Then the Elephant's child sat back on his little haunches, and pulled, and pulled, and pulled, and his nose began to stretch. And the Crocodile floundered into the water, making it all creamy with great sweeps of his tail, and&nbsp;he&nbsp;pulled, and pulled, and pulled.</p>
        <p>And the Elephant's Child's nose kept on stretching; and the Elephant's child spread all his little four legs and pulled, and pulled, and pulled, and his nose kept on stretching; and the Crocodile threshed his tail like an oar, and&nbsp;he&nbsp;pulled, and pulled, and pulled, and at each pull the Elephant's Child's nose grew longer and longer--and it hurt him hijjus!!</p>
        <p>Then the Elephant's Child felt his legs slipping, and he said through his nose, which was now nearly five feet long, "This is to butch for be!"</p>
        <p>Then the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake came down from the bank, and knotted himself in a double-clove-hitch round the Elephant's Child's hind legs.</p>
        <p>So he pulled, and the Elephant's Child pulled, and the Crocodile pulled, but the Elephant's Child and the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake pulled hardest; and at last the Crocodile let go of the Elephant's Child's nose with a plop that you could hear all up and down the Limpopo.</p>
        <p>Then the Elephant's Child sat down most hard and sudden; but first he was careful to say "Thank you" to the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake; and next he was kind to his poor pulled nose, and wrapped it all up in cool banana leaves, and hung it in the great grey-green greasy Limpopo to cool.</p>
        <p>"What are you doing that for?" said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake.</p>
        <p>"'Scuse me," said the Elephant's Child, "but my nose is badly out of shape, and I am waiting for it to shrink."</p>
        <p>"Then you will have to wait a long time," said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake. "Some people do not know what is good for them."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Elephant's Child sat there for three days waiting for his nose to shrink. But it never grew any shorter, and, besides, it made him squint. For, O Best Beloved, you will understand that the Crocodile had pulled it out into a really truly trunk, same as all Elephant's have today.</p>
        <p>At the end of the third day a fly came and stung him on the shoulder, and before he knew what he was doing he lifted up his trunk and hit that fly dead with the end of it.</p>
        <p>"'Vantage number one!" said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake. "You couldn't have done that with a mere-smear nose. Try and eat a little now."</p>
        <p>Before he thought what he was doing the Elephant's Child put out his trunk and plucked a large bundle of grass, dusted it clean against his forelegs, and stuffed it into his mouth.</p>
        <p>"'Vantage number two!" said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake. "You couldn't have done that with a mere-smear nose. Don't you think the sun is very hot here?"</p>
        <p>"It is," said the Elephant's Child, and before he thought what he was doing he schlooped up a schloop of mud from the banks of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo, and slapped it on his head, where it made a cool schloopy-sloshy mud-cap all trickly behind his ears.</p>
        <p>"'Vantage number three!" said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake. "You couldn't have done that with a mere-smear nose. You will find that new nose of yours very useful to spank people with."</p>
        <p>So the Elephant's Child went home across Africa frisking and whisking his trunk. When he wanted fruit to eat he pulled fruit down from a tree, instead of waiting for it to fall as he used to do. When he wanted grass he plucked grass up from the ground, instead of going on his knees as he used to do. When the flies bit him he broke off the branch of a tree and used it as a fly-whisk; and he made himself a new, cool slushy-squshy mud-cap whenever the sun was hot. When he felt lonely walking through Africa he sang to himself down his trunk, and the noise was louder than several brass bands. He went especially out of his way to find a broad Hippopotamus she was no relation of his, and he spanked her very hard, to make sure that the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake had spoken the truth about his new trunk. The rest of the time he picked up the melon rinds that he had dropped on his way to the Limpopo--for he was a Tidy&nbsp;Pachyderm.</p>
        <p>One dark evening he came back to all his dear families, and he coiled up his trunk and said, "How do you do?" They were very glad to see him, and immediately said, "Come here and be spanked for your 'satiable curtiosity."</p>
        <p>"Pooh," said the Elephant's Child. "I don't think you people's know anything about spanking; but&nbsp;I&nbsp;do, and I'll show you."</p>
        <p>Then he uncurled his trunk and knocked two of his dear brothers head over heels.</p>
        <p>"O Bananas!" said they, "Where did you learn that trick, and what have you done to your nose?"</p>
        <p>"I got a new one from the Crocodile on the banks of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo River," said the Elephant's Child. "I asked him what he had for dinner, and he gave me this to keep."</p>
        <p>"It looks very ugly," said his hairy uncle, the Baboon.</p>
        <p>"It does," said the Elephant's Child. "But it's very useful," and he picked up his hairy uncle, the Baboon, by one hairy leg, and hove him into a hornets' nest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ……………………………………………………..</p>
        <p>Then that bad Elephant's Child spanked all his dear families for a long time, till they were very warm and greatly astonished. He pulled out his tall Ostrich aunt's tail-feathers; and he caught his tall uncle, the Giraffe, by the hind-leg, and dragged him through a thorn-bush; and he shouted at his broad aunt, the Hippopotamus, and blew bubbles into her ear when she was sleeping in the water after meals; but he never let any one touch the Kolokolo Bird.</p>
        <p>At last things grew so exciting that his dear families went off one by one in a hurry to the banks of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo River, all set about with fever-trees, to borrow new noses from the Crocodile. When they came back nobody spanked anybody anymore; and ever since that day, O Best Beloved, all the Elephants you will ever see besides all those that you won't, have trunks precisely like the trunk of the 'satiable Elephant's Child.</p>

          <strong>The Elephant's Child</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by&nbsp;Rudyard Kipling&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (shortened)</em>
        </p>
        <p>In the High and Far-Off Times the Elephant, O Best Beloved, had no trunk. He had only a blackish, bulgy nose, as big as a boot, that he could wriggle about from side to side; but he couldn't pick up things with it. But there was one Elephant--a new Elephant--an Elephant's Child--who was full of 'satiable&nbsp;curtiosity, and that means he asked ever so many questions. He asked questions about everything that he saw, or heard, or felt, or smelt, or touched, and all his uncles and his aunts spanked him. And still he was full of 'satiable curtiosity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ……………………………………………………</p>
        <p>One fine morning in the middle of the Precession of the Equinoxes this 'satiable Elephant's Child asked a new fine question that he had never asked before. He asked, "What does the crocodile have for dinner?" Then everybody said, "Hush!" in a loud and dretful tone, and they spanked him immediately and directly, without stopping, for a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>……………………………………………………</p>
        <p>The Kolokolo Bird said, with a mournful cry, "Go to the banks of the great grey-green, greasy&nbsp;Limpopo River, all set about with fever-trees, and find out." &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;………………………………………..</p>
        <p>"Come hither, Little One," said the Crocodile, "for I am the Crocodile," and he wept crocodile tears to show it was quite true.</p>
        <p>Then the Elephants' child grew all breathless, and panted, and kneeled down on the bank and said, "You are the very person I have been looking for all these long days. Will you please tell me what you have for dinner?"</p>
        <p>"Come hither, Little One," said the Crocodile, "and I'll whisper."</p>
        <p>Then the Elephant's Child put his head down close to the Crocodile's musky, tusky mouth, and the Crocodile caught him by his little nose, which up to that very week, day, hour, and minute, had been no bigger than a boot, though much more useful.</p>
        <p>"I think," said the Crocodile--and he said it between his teeth, like this--"I think to-day I will begin with Elephant's Child!"</p>
        <p>At this, O Best Beloved, the Elephant's Child was much annoyed, and he said, speaking through his nose, like this, "Led go! You are hurtig be!"</p>
        <p>Then the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake scuffled down from the bank and said, "My young friend, if you do not now, immediately and instantly, pull as hard as ever you can, it is my opinion that your acquaintance in the large-pattern leather ulster" and by this he meant the Crocodile "will jerk you into yonder limpid stream before you can say Jack Robinson."</p>
        <p>This is the way Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake always talked.</p>
        <p>Then the Elephant's child sat back on his little haunches, and pulled, and pulled, and pulled, and his nose began to stretch. And the Crocodile floundered into the water, making it all creamy with great sweeps of his tail, and&nbsp;he&nbsp;pulled, and pulled, and pulled.</p>
        <p>And the Elephant's Child's nose kept on stretching; and the Elephant's child spread all his little four legs and pulled, and pulled, and pulled, and his nose kept on stretching; and the Crocodile threshed his tail like an oar, and&nbsp;he&nbsp;pulled, and pulled, and pulled, and at each pull the Elephant's Child's nose grew longer and longer--and it hurt him hijjus!!</p>
        <p>Then the Elephant's Child felt his legs slipping, and he said through his nose, which was now nearly five feet long, "This is to butch for be!"</p>
        <p>Then the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake came down from the bank, and knotted himself in a double-clove-hitch round the Elephant's Child's hind legs.</p>
        <p>So he pulled, and the Elephant's Child pulled, and the Crocodile pulled, but the Elephant's Child and the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake pulled hardest; and at last the Crocodile let go of the Elephant's Child's nose with a plop that you could hear all up and down the Limpopo.</p>
        <p>Then the Elephant's Child sat down most hard and sudden; but first he was careful to say "Thank you" to the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake; and next he was kind to his poor pulled nose, and wrapped it all up in cool banana leaves, and hung it in the great grey-green greasy Limpopo to cool.</p>
        <p>"What are you doing that for?" said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake.</p>
        <p>"'Scuse me," said the Elephant's Child, "but my nose is badly out of shape, and I am waiting for it to shrink."</p>
        <p>"Then you will have to wait a long time," said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake. "Some people do not know what is good for them."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Elephant's Child sat there for three days waiting for his nose to shrink. But it never grew any shorter, and, besides, it made him squint. For, O Best Beloved, you will understand that the Crocodile had pulled it out into a really truly trunk, same as all Elephant's have today.</p>
        <p>At the end of the third day a fly came and stung him on the shoulder, and before he knew what he was doing he lifted up his trunk and hit that fly dead with the end of it.</p>
        <p>"'Vantage number one!" said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake. "You couldn't have done that with a mere-smear nose. Try and eat a little now."</p>
        <p>Before he thought what he was doing the Elephant's Child put out his trunk and plucked a large bundle of grass, dusted it clean against his forelegs, and stuffed it into his mouth.</p>
        <p>"'Vantage number two!" said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake. "You couldn't have done that with a mere-smear nose. Don't you think the sun is very hot here?"</p>
        <p>"It is," said the Elephant's Child, and before he thought what he was doing he schlooped up a schloop of mud from the banks of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo, and slapped it on his head, where it made a cool schloopy-sloshy mud-cap all trickly behind his ears.</p>
        <p>"'Vantage number three!" said the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake. "You couldn't have done that with a mere-smear nose. You will find that new nose of yours very useful to spank people with."</p>
        <p>So the Elephant's Child went home across Africa frisking and whisking his trunk. When he wanted fruit to eat he pulled fruit down from a tree, instead of waiting for it to fall as he used to do. When he wanted grass he plucked grass up from the ground, instead of going on his knees as he used to do. When the flies bit him he broke off the branch of a tree and used it as a fly-whisk; and he made himself a new, cool slushy-squshy mud-cap whenever the sun was hot. When he felt lonely walking through Africa he sang to himself down his trunk, and the noise was louder than several brass bands. He went especially out of his way to find a broad Hippopotamus she was no relation of his, and he spanked her very hard, to make sure that the Bi-Coloured-Python-Rock-Snake had spoken the truth about his new trunk. The rest of the time he picked up the melon rinds that he had dropped on his way to the Limpopo--for he was a Tidy&nbsp;Pachyderm.</p>
        <p>One dark evening he came back to all his dear families, and he coiled up his trunk and said, "How do you do?" They were very glad to see him, and immediately said, "Come here and be spanked for your 'satiable curtiosity."</p>
        <p>"Pooh," said the Elephant's Child. "I don't think you people's know anything about spanking; but&nbsp;I&nbsp;do, and I'll show you."</p>
        <p>Then he uncurled his trunk and knocked two of his dear brothers head over heels.</p>
        <p>"O Bananas!" said they, "Where did you learn that trick, and what have you done to your nose?"</p>
        <p>"I got a new one from the Crocodile on the banks of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo River," said the Elephant's Child. "I asked him what he had for dinner, and he gave me this to keep."</p>
        <p>"It looks very ugly," said his hairy uncle, the Baboon.</p>
        <p>"It does," said the Elephant's Child. "But it's very useful," and he picked up his hairy uncle, the Baboon, by one hairy leg, and hove him into a hornets' nest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ……………………………………………………..</p>
        <p>Then that bad Elephant's Child spanked all his dear families for a long time, till they were very warm and greatly astonished. He pulled out his tall Ostrich aunt's tail-feathers; and he caught his tall uncle, the Giraffe, by the hind-leg, and dragged him through a thorn-bush; and he shouted at his broad aunt, the Hippopotamus, and blew bubbles into her ear when she was sleeping in the water after meals; but he never let any one touch the Kolokolo Bird.</p>
        <p>At last things grew so exciting that his dear families went off one by one in a hurry to the banks of the great grey-green, greasy Limpopo River, all set about with fever-trees, to borrow new noses from the Crocodile. When they came back nobody spanked anybody anymore; and ever since that day, O Best Beloved, all the Elephants you will ever see besides all those that you won't, have trunks precisely like the trunk of the 'satiable Elephant's Child.</p>

        <p><em>Below is an example of an Australian Aboriginal myth. Read it and answer the questions that follow.</em><br><br><strong>The Great Fight</strong><br><br>
The two men stood facing each other some distance apart; each held a long spear poised for throwing in one hand, while in the other was held a wooden shield. At a given signal from the younger brother the fight commenced. The spears flew through the air like beams of light, and their long shafts quivered as they missed their mark.</p>
        <p>Both the men were very skilled spear-throwers, and the fight was a long one. No sound was heard except the hissing of the spears in flight, the heavy breathing of the men, and the dull thud of their feet on the grass. In a desperate effort to end the fight, Byama threw a spear at his enemy's throat with all his strength. Thoorkook saw it coming, and instantly raised his shield to guard himself. The spear was hurled with such force, however, that it pierced the wooden shield, entered Thoorkook's throat, and came out on the other side.</p>
        <p>At the death of their enemy, the brothers rejoiced, and, before leaving for their camp, they turned his body into a Mopoke, a dismal night bird with a very harsh cry.

When you hear the mournful cry of the Curlews in the bush, you will know it is the mothers crying for their little boys they lost so long ago.</p>

        <p><em>Below is an example of an Australian Aboriginal myth. Read it and answer the questions that follow.</em><br><br><strong>The Great Fight</strong><br><br>
The two men stood facing each other some distance apart; each held a long spear poised for throwing in one hand, while in the other was held a wooden shield. At a given signal from the younger brother the fight commenced. The spears flew through the air like beams of light, and their long shafts quivered as they missed their mark.</p>
        <p>Both the men were very skilled spear-throwers, and the fight was a long one. No sound was heard except the hissing of the spears in flight, the heavy breathing of the men, and the dull thud of their feet on the grass. In a desperate effort to end the fight, Byama threw a spear at his enemy's throat with all his strength. Thoorkook saw it coming, and instantly raised his shield to guard himself. The spear was hurled with such force, however, that it pierced the wooden shield, entered Thoorkook's throat, and came out on the other side.</p>
        <p>At the death of their enemy, the brothers rejoiced, and, before leaving for their camp, they turned his body into a Mopoke, a dismal night bird with a very harsh cry. When they returned to their camp the brothers found that the mothers of the dead boys would not cease crying, and they were so moved with pity at the women's grief that they turned them into Curlews. When you hear the mournful cry of the Curlews in the bush, you will know it is the mothers crying for their little boys they lost so long ago.</p>

A Sailor, bound on a long voyage, took with him a Monkey to amuse him while on shipboard.</p>
        <p>As he sailed off the coast of Greece, a violent tempest arose, in which the ship was wrecked, and he, his Monkey and all the crew were obliged to swim for their lives.</p>
        <p>A Dolphin saw the Monkey contending with the waves, and supposing him to be a man (whom he is always said to befriend), came and placed himself under him, to convey him on his back in safety to the shore.</p>
        <p>When the Dolphin arrived with his burden in sight of land not far from Athens, he demanded of the Monkey if he were an Athenian, who answered that he was, and that he was descended from one of the noblest families in that city.</p>
        <p>The Dolphin then inquired if he knew the Piræus (the famous harbor of Athens).</p>
        <p>The Monkey, supposing that a man was meant, and being obliged to support his previous lie, answered that he knew him very well, and that he was an intimate friend, who would, no doubt, be very glad to see him.</p>
        <p>The Dolphin, indignant at these falsehoods, dipped the Monkey under the water, and drowned him.</p>

A Sailor, bound on a long voyage, took with him a Monkey to amuse him while on shipboard.</p>
        <p>As he sailed off the coast of Greece, a violent tempest arose, in which the ship was wrecked, and he, his Monkey and all the crew were obliged to swim for their lives.</p>
        <p>A Dolphin saw the Monkey contending with the waves, and supposing him to be a man (whom he is always said to befriend), came and placed himself under him, to convey him on his back in safety to the shore.</p>
        <p>When the Dolphin arrived with his burden in sight of land not far from Athens, he demanded of the Monkey if he were an Athenian, who answered that he was, and that he was descended from one of the noblest families in that city.</p>
        <p>The Dolphin then inquired if he knew the Piræus (the famous harbor of Athens).</p>
        <p>The Monkey, supposing that a man was meant, and being obliged to support his previous lie, answered that he knew him very well, and that he was an intimate friend, who would, no doubt, be very glad to see him.</p>
        <p>The Dolphin, indignant at these falsehoods, dipped the Monkey under the water, and drowned him.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below and answer the questions that follow.</em><br><br><strong>The Monkey and the Dolphin</strong><br><em>&nbsp;An Aesop’s Fable</em><br><br>
A Sailor, bound on a long voyage, took with him a Monkey to amuse him while on shipboard.</p>
        <p>As he sailed off the coast of Greece, a violent tempest arose, in which the ship was wrecked, and he, his Monkey and all the crew were obliged to swim for their lives.</p>
        <p>A Dolphin saw the Monkey contending with the waves, and supposing him to be a man (whom he is always said to befriend), came and placed himself under him, to convey him on his back in safety to the shore.</p>
        <p>When the Dolphin arrived with his burden in sight of land not far from Athens, he demanded of the Monkey if he were an Athenian, who answered that he was, and that he was descended from one of the noblest families in that city.</p>
        <p>The Dolphin then inquired if he knew the Piræus (the famous harbor of Athens).</p>
        <p>The Monkey, supposing that a man was meant, and being obliged to support his previous lie, answered that he knew him very well, and that he was an intimate friend, who would, no doubt, be very glad to see him.</p>
        <p>The Dolphin, indignant at these falsehoods, dipped the Monkey under the water, and drowned him.</p>

Oh! I have slipped the surly bonds of earth,<br>

Of sun-split clouds, --and done a hundred things<br>

Oh! I have slipped the surly bonds of earth,<br>
And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings;<br>
Sunward I've climbed, and joined the tumbling mirth<br>
Of sun-split clouds, --and done a hundred things<br>
You have not dreamed of --Wheeled and soared and swung<br>
High in the sunlit silence. Hov'ring there<br>
I've chased the shouting wind along, and flung<br>
My eager craft through footless halls of air...<br>
Up, up the long, delirious, burning blue<br>
I've topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace<br>
Where never lark or even eagle flew --<br>
And, while with silent lifting mind I've trod<br>
The high untrespassed sanctity of space,<br>
Put out my hand, and touched the face of God.</p>

        <p><em>Read text that follows, taking careful note of the use of imagery in it. Then answer the questions that follow.</em><br><br><strong>High Flight</strong><br><em>John Gillespie Magee, Jr</em><br><br>
Oh! I have slipped the surly bonds of earth,<br>
And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings;<br>
Sunward I've climbed, and joined the tumbling mirth<br>
Of sun-split clouds, --and done a hundred things<br>
You have not dreamed of --Wheeled and soared and swung<br>
High in the sunlit silence. Hov'ring there<br>
I've chased the shouting wind along, and flung<br>
My eager craft through footless halls of air...<br>
Up, up the long, delirious, burning blue<br>
I've topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace<br>
Where never lark or even eagle flew --<br>
And, while with silent lifting mind I've trod<br>
The high untrespassed sanctity of space,<br>
Put out my hand, and touched the face of God.</p>

        <p><strong>Inside a raging beast: what it's like inside a bushfire</strong><br><br>
We had arrived around two hours earlier, at Winmalee in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney, the predicted flashpoint of the day's activity, based on the prevailing wind and the bushfires which had been burning their way through hectares of trees and brush all night. The air stank of burnt out wood. Even the water I sipped from my water bottle seemed to have been infected by it. I was leaning against the fire truck, which felt hot against my body. I casually made conversation with a Rural Fire Service officer.</p>
        <p>"What's that noise - are there helicopters on the way?"</p>
        <p>"No," the firie said, "that's the fire"</p>
        <p>It sounds like a freight train and as it burns towards us, spurting fireballs ahead across the tops of the trees, it is like a kind of raging beast.</p>
        <p>Then it jumps the creek, and the firestorm howls up the riverbank to within 50 metres of where the firies are hosing down houses and a few remaining residents linger in awe and fear. The acrid smell of ash burns into our nostrils and chokes our breathing.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The firie turns to us and screams, "Get out&nbsp;now!"</p>
        <p>We hesitate, the two photographers desperately snapping their final pictures in the eerie light.</p>
        <p>Then the firestorm seems to angrily shake the air and suck in all the available oxygen and suddenly a tree explodes in front of us, flames torching up its trunk like a giant candle.</p>
        <p>The firie turns to us again and screams, "RUN!"</p>

        <p><strong>Inside a raging beast: what it's like inside a bushfire</strong><br><br>
We had arrived around two hours earlier, at Winmalee in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney, the predicted flashpoint of the day's activity, based on the prevailing wind and the bushfires which had been burning their way through hectares of trees and brush all night. The air stank of burnt out wood. Even the water I sipped from my water bottle seemed to have been infected by it. I was leaning against the fire truck, which felt hot against my body. I casually made conversation with a Rural Fire Service officer.</p>
        <p>"What's that noise - are there helicopters on the way?"</p>
        <p>"No," the firie said, "that's the fire"</p>
        <p>It sounds like a freight train and as it burns towards us, spurting fireballs ahead across the tops of the trees, it is like a kind of raging beast.</p>
        <p>Then it jumps the creek, and the firestorm howls up the riverbank to within 50 metres of where the firies are hosing down houses and a few remaining residents linger in awe and fear. The acrid smell of ash burns into our nostrils and chokes our breathing.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The firie turns to us and screams, "Get out&nbsp;now!"</p>
        <p>We hesitate, the two photographers desperately snapping their final pictures in the eerie light.</p>
        <p>Then the firestorm seems to angrily shake the air and suck in all the available oxygen and suddenly a tree explodes in front of us, flames torching up its trunk like a giant candle.</p>
        <p>The firie turns to us again and screams, "RUN!"</p>
