        <p>Wendy clutched her Slime Sisters comic book. She saved her allowance to buy all kinds of things that were in the back of the comic. She had bought talking fish, dancing dolls, a living pet rock, giant super heroes, and all kinds of other stuff.</p>
        <p>She'd run to get the mail. "My giant super heroes are here!" Wendy had opened it up, but they weren't as big as a child, like in the ad. In small print were the words "not actual size".</p>
        <p>All the other things she had sent for didn't work right either. The dolls didn't have batteries and broke after just two days. The living rock was not alive, and all the other toys and games she bought were lying twisted and broken in a heap on her bed.</p>
        <p>She sat on the floor and frowned.</p>
        <p>"Can I come in?" her Mom, Mrs. Delane, asked.</p>
        <p>Wendy nodded. Mrs. Delane moved some of the junk away and sat down. She had a tiny package in her hand. "Maybe you shouldn't send for any more toys?" Mrs. Delane asked.</p>

          <strong>Bubble Memory</strong>
        </p>
        <p>When I was a young boy, wonderful free gifts came in cereal boxes. Things like Flash Gordon space rings and Dick Tracy detective membership cards.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One morning while emptying the cereal box a strange object fell out. It looked like a flattened grey coloured ice cream cone. Little did I know what magic was in store for me.</p>
        <p>I popped open the absorbent paper object into a funnel or cone shape and then mixed up a soap solution as instructed on the cereal box.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I was familiar with the bubble blowing solution sold with a plastic or wire blowing ring available at our neighbourhood corner store. I was an expert at blowing bubbles, nothing could surprise me.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I submerged the funnel into the bowl of soap solution and started blowing a bubble. At first everything was normal, I blew what I thought were large 15cm bubbles and set them floating in the air separating them from the funnel with a snap of the wrist. Soon I was blowing larger bubbles 20, 25 and 30cm bubbles. I learned that as the bubbles became larger, the slower your movements must be so as not to dislodge the bubble from the cone. I soon was blowing 60cm diameter, long lasting bubbles with no problem at all.</p>

          <strong>Who Did Patrick's Homework?</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-rgt">
          <em>by Carol Moore</em>
        </p>
        <p>Patrick never did homework. "Too boring," he said. He played baseball and basketball and Nintendo instead. His teachers told him, "Patrick! Do your homework or you won't learn a thing." And it's true, sometimes he did feel like a ding-a-ling.</p>
        <p>But what could he do? He hated homework.</p>
        <p>Then on St. Patrick's Day his cat was playing with a little doll and he grabbed it away. To his surprise it wasn't a doll at all, but a man of the tiniest size. He had a little wool shirt with old fashioned britches and a high tall hat much like a witch's. He yelled, "Save me! Don't give me back to that cat. I'll grant you a wish, I promise you that."</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Patrick couldn't believe how lucky he was! Here was the answer to all of his problems. So he said, "Only if you do all my homework 'til the end of the semester, that's 35 days. If you do a good enough job, I could even get A's."</p>
        <p>The little man's face wrinkled like a dishcloth thrown in the hamper. He kicked his legs and doubled his fists and he grimaced and scowled and pursed his lips, "Oh, am I cursed! But I'll do it."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And true to his word, that little elf began to do Patrick's homework. Except there was one glitch. The elf didn't always know what to do and he needed help. "Help me! Help me!" he'd say. And Patrick would have to help – in whatever way.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"I don't know this word," the elf squeaked while reading Patrick's homework. "Get me a dictionary. No, what's even better. Look up the word and sound it out by each letter."</p>
        <p>When it came to math, Patrick was out of luck. "What are times tables?" the elf shrieked. "We elves never need that. And addition and subtraction and division and fractions? Here, sit down beside me, you simply must guide me."</p>
        <p>Elves know nothing of human history, to them it's a mystery. So the little elf, already a shouter, just got louder "Go to the library, I need books. More and more books. And you can help me read them too."</p>
        <p>As a matter of fact every day in every way that little elf was a nag! Patrick was working harder than ever and was it a drag! He was staying up nights, had never felt so weary, was going to school with his eyes puffed and bleary.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Finally the last day of school arrived and the elf was free to go. As for homework, there was no more, so he quietly and slyly slipped out the back door.</p>
        <p>Patrick got his A's; his classmates were amazed; his teachers smiled and were full of praise. And his parents? They wondered what had happened to Patrick. He was now the model kid. Cleaned his room, did his chores, was cheerful, never rude, like he had developed a whole new attitude.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You see, in the end Patrick still thought he'd made that tiny man do all his homework. But I'll share a secret, just between you and me. It wasn't the elf; Patrick had done it himself!&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Who Did Patrick's Homework?</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-rgt">
          <em>by Carol Moore</em>
        </p>
        <p>Patrick never did homework. "Too boring," he said. He played baseball and basketball and Nintendo instead. His teachers told him, "Patrick! Do your homework or you won't learn a thing." And it's true, sometimes he did feel like a ding-a-ling.</p>
        <p>But what could he do? He hated homework.</p>
        <p>Then on St. Patrick's Day his cat was playing with a little doll and he grabbed it away. To his surprise it wasn't a doll at all, but a man of the tiniest size. He had a little wool shirt with old fashioned britches and a high tall hat much like a witch's. He yelled, "Save me! Don't give me back to that cat. I'll grant you a wish, I promise you that."</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Patrick couldn't believe how lucky he was! Here was the answer to all of his problems. So he said, "Only if you do all my homework 'til the end of the semester, that's 35 days. If you do a good enough job, I could even get A's."</p>
        <p>The little man's face wrinkled like a dishcloth thrown in the hamper. He kicked his legs and doubled his fists and he grimaced and scowled and pursed his lips, "Oh, am I cursed! But I'll do it."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And true to his word, that little elf began to do Patrick's homework. Except there was one glitch. The elf didn't always know what to do and he needed help. "Help me! Help me!" he'd say. And Patrick would have to help – in whatever way.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"I don't know this word," the elf squeaked while reading Patrick's homework. "Get me a dictionary. No, what's even better. Look up the word and sound it out by each letter."</p>
        <p>When it came to math, Patrick was out of luck. "What are times tables?" the elf shrieked. "We elves never need that. And addition and subtraction and division and fractions? Here, sit down beside me, you simply must guide me."</p>
        <p>Elves know nothing of human history, to them it's a mystery. So the little elf, already a shouter, just got louder "Go to the library, I need books. More and more books. And you can help me read them too."</p>
        <p>As a matter of fact every day in every way that little elf was a nag! Patrick was working harder than ever and was it a drag! He was staying up nights, had never felt so weary, was going to school with his eyes puffed and bleary.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Finally the last day of school arrived and the elf was free to go. As for homework, there was no more, so he quietly and slyly slipped out the back door.</p>
        <p>Patrick got his A's; his classmates were amazed; his teachers smiled and were full of praise. And his parents? They wondered what had happened to Patrick. He was now the model kid. Cleaned his room, did his chores, was cheerful, never rude, like he had developed a whole new attitude.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Who Did Patrick's Homework?</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-rgt">
          <em>by Carol Moore</em>
        </p>
        <p>Patrick never did homework. "Too boring," he said. He played baseball and basketball and Nintendo instead. His teachers told him, "Patrick! Do your homework or you won't learn a thing." And it's true, sometimes he did feel like a ding-a-ling.</p>
        <p>But what could he do? He hated homework.</p>
        <p>Then on St. Patrick's Day his cat was playing with a little doll and he grabbed it away. To his surprise it wasn't a doll at all, but a man of the tiniest size. He had a little wool shirt with old fashioned britches and a high tall hat much like a witch's. He yelled, "Save me! Don't give me back to that cat. I'll grant you a wish, I promise you that."</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Patrick couldn't believe how lucky he was! Here was the answer to all of his problems. So he said, "Only if you do all my homework 'til the end of the semester, that's 35 days. If you do a good enough job, I could even get A's."</p>
        <p>The little man's face wrinkled like a dishcloth thrown in the hamper. He kicked his legs and doubled his fists and he grimaced and scowled and pursed his lips, "Oh, am I cursed! But I'll do it."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And true to his word, that little elf began to do Patrick's homework. Except there was one glitch. The elf didn't always know what to do and he needed help. "Help me! Help me!" he'd say. And Patrick would have to help – in whatever way.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"I don't know this word," the elf squeaked while reading Patrick's homework. "Get me a dictionary. No, what's even better. Look up the word and sound it out by each letter."</p>
        <p>When it came to math, Patrick was out of luck. "What are times tables?" the elf shrieked. "We elves never need that. And addition and subtraction and division and fractions? Here, sit down beside me, you simply must guide me."</p>
        <p>Elves know nothing of human history, to them it's a mystery. So the little elf, already a shouter, just got louder "Go to the library, I need books. More and more books. And you can help me read them too."</p>
        <p>As a matter of fact every day in every way that little elf was a nag! Patrick was working harder than ever and was it a drag! He was staying up nights, had never felt so weary, was going to school with his eyes puffed and bleary.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Finally the last day of school arrived and the elf was free to go. As for homework, there was no more, so he quietly and slyly slipped out the back door.</p>
        <p>Patrick got his A's; his classmates were amazed; his teachers smiled and were full of praise. And his parents? They wondered what had happened to Patrick. He was now the model kid. Cleaned his room, did his chores, was cheerful, never rude, like he had developed a whole new attitude.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You see, in the end Patrick still thought he'd made that tiny man do all his homework. But I'll share a secret, just between you and me. It wasn't the elf; Patrick had done it himself!&nbsp;</p>

        <p>The little man's face wrinkled like a dishcloth thrown in the hamper. He kicked his legs and doubled his fists and he grimaced and scowled and pursed his lips, "Oh, am I cursed! But I'll do it."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And true to his word, that little elf began to do Patrick's homework. Except there was one glitch. The elf didn't always know what to do and he needed help. "Help me! Help me!" he'd say. And Patrick would have to help – in whatever way.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"I don't know this word," the elf squeaked while reading Patrick's homework. "Get me a dictionary. No, what's even better. Look up the word and sound it out by each letter."</p>
        <p>When it came to math, Patrick was out of luck. "What are times tables?" the elf shrieked. "We elves never need that. And addition and subtraction and division and fractions? Here, sit down beside me, you simply must guide me."</p>
        <p>Elves know nothing of human history, to them it's a mystery. So the little elf, already a shouter, just got louder "Go to the library, I need books. More and more books. And you can help me read them too."</p>
        <p>As a matter of fact every day in every way that little elf was a nag! Patrick was working harder than ever and was it a drag! He was staying up nights, had never felt so weary, was going to school with his eyes puffed and bleary.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Finally the last day of school arrived and the elf was free to go. As for homework, there was no more, so he quietly and slyly slipped out the back door.</p>
        <p>Patrick got his A's; his classmates were amazed; his teachers smiled and were full of praise. And his parents? They wondered what had happened to Patrick. He was now the model kid. Cleaned his room, did his chores, was cheerful, never rude, like he had developed a whole new attitude.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You see, in the end Patrick still thought he'd made that tiny man do all his homework. But I'll share a secret, just between you and me. It wasn't the elf; Patrick had done it himself!&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Spelling Long Words: The Syllable-Building Strategy</strong>
        </p>
        <p>A long word is a word that has more than one syllable (i.e., multisyllabic). A syllable is a word or part of a word that is spoken with a single sound of the voice. The Syllable-Building Strategy will help you spell long words such as democratic.</p>
        <p>Here is how a student named William used the steps in the Syllable-Building Strategy to learn to spell democratic. He came across this word while reading his social studies textbook.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 1</strong>. William carefully copied the word into his notebook. He checked what he wrote to be sure that he had spelled the word correctly.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2</strong>. William then located the word democratic in his dictionary.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3</strong>. William used the phonetic respelling of democratic in the dictionary to help him pronounce the word. William knew that if he still could not pronounce democratic, he could ask his teacher for help.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4</strong>. From the dictionary, William learned that democratic was a four-syllable word. William wrote democratic leaving a space between each syllable. Here is what he wrote.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5</strong>. William wrote the first syllable of democratic three times. He pronounced this syllable each time he wrote it. Here is what he wrote.</p>
        <p>William then covered what he had written and wrote the first syllable of democratic from memory. Here is what he wrote.</p>
        <p>He looked to see if he had spelled the first syllable correctly and found that he had. William then wrote the first two syllables of democratic together three times. He pronounced the two syllables together as he wrote them. Here is what he wrote.</p>
        <p>He covered what he had written and wrote the first two syllables from memory. Here is what he wrote.</p>
        <p>William then looked to see if he had spelled the first two syllables correctly and found that he had not. Therefore, he once again wrote the first two syllables of democratic three times, pronouncing them as he did so. Here is what he wrote.</p>
        <p>William covered what he had written and wrote the first two syllables from memory. Here is what he wrote.</p>
        <p>He looked to see if he had spelled the first two syllables correctly and found that he had.</p>
        <p>William continued this procedure for the first three syllables of democratic and then for the entire word.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 6</strong>. Once William had correctly spelled the entire word from memory, he wrote democratic on his personal spelling list. He wrote both the entire word and the word broken into syllables.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 7</strong>. William periodically reviewed the spelling of democratic using the following Spell and Say Review Procedure:</p>
        <p>1. He pronounced democratic aloud.</p>
        <p>2. He pronounced and spelled aloud each syllable.</p>
        <p>3. He spelled the entire word aloud.</p>
        <p>4. He wrote democratic three times.</p>
        <p>Using the Syllable-Building Strategy will make you a better speller.</p>

          <strong>Spelling Long Words: The Syllable-Building Strategy</strong>
        </p>
        <p>A long word is a word that has more than one syllable (i.e., multisyllabic). A syllable is a word or part of a word that is spoken with a single sound of the voice. The Syllable-Building Strategy will help you spell long words such as democratic.</p>
        <p>Here is how a student named William used the steps in the Syllable-Building Strategy to learn to spell democratic. He came across this word while reading his social studies textbook.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 1</strong>. William carefully copied the word into his notebook. He checked what he wrote to be sure that he had spelled the word correctly.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2</strong>. William then located the word democratic in his dictionary.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3</strong>. William used the phonetic respelling of democratic in the dictionary to help him pronounce the word. William knew that if he still could not pronounce democratic, he could ask his teacher for help.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4</strong>. From the dictionary, William learned that democratic was a four-syllable word. William wrote democratic leaving a space between each syllable. Here is what he wrote.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5</strong>. William wrote the first syllable of democratic three times. He pronounced this syllable each time he wrote it. Here is what he wrote.</p>
        <p>William then covered what he had written and wrote the first syllable of democratic from memory. Here is what he wrote.</p>
        <p>He looked to see if he had spelled the first syllable correctly and found that he had. William then wrote the first two syllables of democratic together three times. He pronounced the two syllables together as he wrote them. Here is what he wrote.</p>
        <p>He covered what he had written and wrote the first two syllables from memory. Here is what he wrote.</p>
        <p>William then looked to see if he had spelled the first two syllables correctly and found that he had not. Therefore, he once again wrote the first two syllables of democratic three times, pronouncing them as he did so. Here is what he wrote.</p>
        <p>William covered what he had written and wrote the first two syllables from memory. Here is what he wrote.</p>
        <p>He looked to see if he had spelled the first two syllables correctly and found that he had.</p>
        <p>William continued this procedure for the first three syllables of democratic and then for the entire word.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 6</strong>. Once William had correctly spelled the entire word from memory, he wrote democratic on his personal spelling list. He wrote both the entire word and the word broken into syllables.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 7</strong>. William periodically reviewed the spelling of democratic using the following Spell and Say Review Procedure:</p>
        <p>1. He pronounced democratic aloud.</p>
        <p>2. He pronounced and spelled aloud each syllable.</p>
        <p>3. He spelled the entire word aloud.</p>
        <p>4. He wrote democratic three times.</p>
        <p>Using the Syllable-Building Strategy will make you a better speller.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2</strong>. William then located the word democratic in his dictionary.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3</strong>. William used the phonetic respelling of democratic in the dictionary to help him pronounce the word. William knew that if he still could not pronounce democratic, he could ask his teacher for help.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4</strong>. From the dictionary, William learned that democratic was a four-syllable word. William wrote democratic leaving a space between each syllable. Here is what he wrote.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5</strong>. William wrote the first syllable of democratic three times. He pronounced this syllable each time he wrote it. Here is what he wrote.</p>
        <p>William then covered what he had written and wrote the first syllable of democratic from memory. Here is what he wrote.</p>
        <p>He looked to see if he had spelled the first syllable correctly and found that he had. William then wrote the first two syllables of democratic together three times. He pronounced the two syllables together as he wrote them. Here is what he wrote.</p>
        <p>He covered what he had written and wrote the first two syllables from memory. Here is what he wrote.</p>
        <p>William then looked to see if he had spelled the first two syllables correctly and found that he had not. Therefore, he once again wrote the first two syllables of democratic three times, pronouncing them as he did so. Here is what he wrote.</p>
        <p>William covered what he had written and wrote the first two syllables from memory. Here is what he wrote.</p>
        <p>He looked to see if he had spelled the first two syllables correctly and found that he had.</p>
        <p>William continued this procedure for the first three syllables of democratic and then for the entire word.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 6</strong>. Once William had correctly spelled the entire word from memory, he wrote democratic on his personal spelling list. He wrote both the entire word and the word broken into syllables.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 7</strong>. William periodically reviewed the spelling of democratic using the following Spell and Say Review Procedure:</p>
        <p>1. He pronounced democratic aloud.</p>
        <p>2. He pronounced and spelled aloud each syllable.</p>
        <p>3. He spelled the entire word aloud.</p>
        <p>4. He wrote democratic three times.</p>
        <p>Using the Syllable-Building Strategy will make you a better speller.</p>

        <p>Project background: Jeff is a cancer survivor. He’s in his fifth remission and has been free of cancer for 2 years. During the years when he was seeking treatment, he became attached to a rabbit that lived in the playroom at the hospital where he went. He became interested in the idea of pet therapy in helping alleviate anxiety and stress for children who visited the oncology clinic.</p>
        <p>Tactics and results: Jeff began by receiving the approval of his school and the Children’s Hospital’s Institutional Review Board (IRB), which must approve all studies done with their patients. Jeff then brought a licensed pet therapy dog and her owner to the oncology centre at his local Children’s Hospital. The dog played with 6 of 11 children that visited the clinic the day before their scheduled procedures or treatments.</p>
        <p>Jeff questioned all 11 children afterwards about their level of discomfort. He found that the ones who had encountered the dog had a marked decrease in their discomfort during treatment.</p>

        <p>Project background: Jeff is a cancer survivor. He’s in his fifth remission and has been free of cancer for 2 years. During the years when he was seeking treatment, he became attached to a rabbit that lived in the playroom at the hospital where he went. He became interested in the idea of pet therapy in helping alleviate anxiety and stress for children who visited the oncology clinic.</p>
        <p>Tactics and results: Jeff began by receiving the approval of his school and the Children’s Hospital’s Institutional Review Board (IRB), which must approve all studies done with their patients. Jeff then brought a licensed pet therapy dog and her owner to the oncology centre at his local Children’s Hospital. The dog played with 6 of 11 children that visited the clinic the day before their scheduled procedures or treatments.</p>
        <p>Jeff questioned all 11 children afterwards about their level of discomfort. He found that the ones who had encountered the dog had a marked decrease in their discomfort during treatment.</p>

        <p>Project background: Jeff is a cancer survivor. He’s in his fifth remission and has been free of cancer for 2 years. During the years when he was seeking treatment, he became attached to a rabbit that lived in the playroom at the hospital where he went. He became interested in the idea of pet therapy in helping alleviate anxiety and stress for children who visited the oncology clinic.</p>
        <p>Tactics and results: Jeff began by receiving the approval of his school and the Children’s Hospital’s Institutional Review Board (IRB), which must approve all studies done with their patients. Jeff then brought a licensed pet therapy dog and her owner to the oncology centre at his local Children’s Hospital. The dog played with 6 of 11 children that visited the clinic the day before their scheduled procedures or treatments.</p>
        <p>Jeff questioned all 11 children afterwards about their level of discomfort. He found that the ones who had encountered the dog had a marked decrease in their discomfort during treatment.</p>
