          <strong>Tracks surf magazine<br>
Returns to its Roots</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Tracks surf magazine, an iconic publication in the surfing world, has undergone a significant transformation as it returns to its roots under new ownership. The magazine, first published in 1970, has been acquired by a group of surfers from commercial publishers Next Media. This return to surfer ownership is seen as completing a full circle for the magazine, which has always held a special place in the hearts of Australian surfers. <strong>(A)</strong> ……………&nbsp; He highlighted the significance of the publication’s cultural and historical impact on the surfing community.</p>
        <p>Tracks magazine has long been a cornerstone of Australian surfing culture. <strong>(B)</strong> …………….&nbsp; Over the years, it has cemented its position as a major voice in the surfing world, offering more than just surfing tips and tricks but embodying a state of mind. The magazine faced significant challenges in 2020, from devastating bushfires to the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic, which saw many magazines, including Tracks, temporarily cease printing. The publication’s 50th anniversary in October 2020 came with the uncertainty of its future.</p>
        <p>Determined to preserve Tracks’ legacy, editor Luke Kennedy and four other surfers acquired the magazine in February. This group, including long-time Tracks employee and advertising director Damian Martin, felt the weight of their responsibility to uphold the magazine’s storied heritage. <strong>(C)</strong> ……………&nbsp; Despite the current challenges in the print media industry, the new owners are optimistic and passionate about the magazine’s future, seeing it as a labour of love and a critical part of the surfing community.</p>
        <p>Tracks magazine’s new ownership comes at a time when surfing is gaining mainstream attention, highlighted by its inclusion in the upcoming Tokyo Olympics. <strong>(D)</strong> ……………&nbsp; John Witzig, who co-founded the magazine after being let go from Surf International, recalls the inspiration from influential American publications like Rolling Stone. Tracks quickly became a success, resonating deeply with the surfing community and addressing environmental concerns long before they were widely recognized.<br>
Under its new ownership, Tracks is committed to continuing its advocacy for environmental and social issues, aiming to maintain a distinct voice different from mainstream media.</p>
        <p><strong>(E)</strong> ……………&nbsp; This criticism came to a head in 2014 when a young female surfer wrote a letter criticizing the magazine’s portrayal of women. The new owners acknowledge this shortcoming and are dedicated to being more inclusive and representative of female surfers in the future, striving to correct past failings and better reflect the diversity of the surfing community.</p>
        <p><strong>(F)</strong> …………… They aim to balance respect for the magazine’s legacy with the need to engage a new generation of readers. While there are concerns about the commercialization and crowded nature of modern surfing spots, the new owners are determined to ensure Tracks remains a vital part of the surfing world. The magazine’s survival, especially in the face of the recent closure of the United States’ leading surfing magazine, Surfer, is seen as a testament to its enduring significance and the passion of its readership. Tracks continues to leave its mark on surfing culture, providing a sense of identity for Australian surfers and reflecting the evolving nature of the sport.</p>

The Space Race competition gained Western public attention with the ‘Sputnik crisis’, when the USSR achieved the first successful satellite launch into space, Sputnik 1, on October 4, 1957. The Space Race gained momentum when the USSR sent the first human, Yuri Gagarin, into space with the orbital flight of Vostok 1 on April 12, 1961. These were followed by a string of other firsts achieved by the Soviets over the next few years. Gagarin’s flight led US President John F. Kennedy to raise the stakes on May 25, 1961, by asking the US Congress to commit to the goal of “landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth” before the end of the decade. Both countries began developing super heavy-lift launch vehicles, with the US successfully deploying the Saturn V, which was large enough to send a three-person orbiter and two-person lander to the Moon. Kennedy’s Moon landing goal was achieved in July 1969, with the flight of Apollo 11. The successful conclusion of Apollo 11 is regarded by most as ending the Space Race with an American victory.<br>

In 1961, President Kennedy said the following in a speech: “First, I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space, and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish. We propose to accelerate the development of the appropriate lunar spacecraft. We propose to develop alternate liquid and solid fuel boosters, much larger than any being developed now, until it is certain which is superior. We propose additional funds for other engine development and for unmanned explorations – explorations which are particularly important for one purpose that this nation will never overlook: the survival of the man who first makes this daring flight. But in a very real sense, it will not be one man going to the moon – if we make this judgment affirmatively, it will be an entire nation. For all of us must work to put him there.”<br>

NASA officials selected astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins to make the historic trip from Earth on Apollo 11. Just four days after launching, the spacecraft neared the moon’s surface. Collins remained on Apollo 11’s command module, the Columbia, to remain in orbit around the moon. Armstrong and Aldrin boarded Apollo 11’s lunar module, the Eagle, and began to descend to the moon’s surface. The Eagle made a risky landing in a shallow moon crater named the Sea of Tranquillity. Armstrong and Aldrin looked out at the lifeless and barren lunar landscape and prepared to exit the module. As mission commander, Armstrong stepped out first and became the first person on the moon. Twenty minutes later, Aldrin climbed down the ladder. After reading a plaque that said they “came in peace for all mankind”, the two planted the United States’ flag on&nbsp;the surface. President Richard Nixon called to congratulate the astronauts. Armstrong and Aldrin then collected samples of moon rocks and dust. After two hours, the astronauts brought 47 pounds back onto the lunar module and prepared to rejoin Collins. It was time to go home.<br>

NASA announced updates to its Artemis campaign, which will establish the foundation for long-term scientific exploration on the Moon. To safely carry out these missions, agency leaders are adjusting the schedules for Artemis II and Artemis III to allow teams to work through challenges associated with first-time developments, operations, and integration. NASA will now target September 2025 for Artemis II, the first crewed Artemis mission around the Moon, and September 2026 for Artemis III, which is planned to land the first astronauts near the lunar South Pole. Artemis IV, the first mission to the ‘Gateway’ lunar space station, remains on track for 2028.<br>
