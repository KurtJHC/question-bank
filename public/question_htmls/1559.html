For questions <strong>21 – 30</strong>, choose the option (<strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, <strong>C</strong> or <strong>D</strong>) which you think best answers the question.<br>
<br>
<strong>Extract A</strong><br>
So how do volcanoes erupt? Deep within the Earth it is so hot that some rocks slowly melt and become a thick flowing substance called magma. Since it is lighter than the solid rock around it, magma rises and collects in magma chambers. Eventually, some of the magma pushes through vents and fissures to the Earth's surface. Magma that has erupted is called lava.<br>
<br>
Some volcanic eruptions are explosive and others are not. If magma is thin and runny, gases can escape easily from it. When this type of magma erupts, it flows out of the volcano. A good example is the eruptions at Hawaii’s volcanoes. Lava flows rarely kill people because they move slowly enough for people to get out of their way. If magma is thick and sticky, gases cannot escape easily. Pressure builds up until the gases escape violently and explode. A good example is the eruption of Washington’s Mount St. Helens. In this type of eruption, the magma blasts into the air and breaks apart into pieces called tephra. Tephra can range in size from tiny particles of ash to house-size boulders.<br>
<br>
Explosive volcanic eruptions can be dangerous and deadly. They can blast out clouds of hot tephra from the side or top of a volcano. These fiery clouds race down mountainsides destroying almost everything in their path. Ash erupted into the sky falls back to Earth like powdery snow. If thick enough, blankets of ash can suffocate plants, animals, and humans. When hot volcanic materials mix with water from streams or melted snow and ice, mudflows form. Mudflows have buried entire communities located near erupting volcanoes.<br>
<br>
<strong>Extract B</strong><br>
The ancient cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum thrived near the base of Mount Vesuvius at the Bay of Naples in the modern-day Italy. In the time of the early Roman Empire, 20,000 people lived in Pompeii, including merchants, manufacturers, and farmers who exploited the rich soil of the region with numerous vineyards and orchards. None suspected that the black fertile earth was the legacy of earlier eruptions of Mount Vesuvius.<br>
<br>
On August 24, 79 AD, after centuries of dormancy, Mount Vesuvius erupted in southern Italy, devastating the prosperous Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum and killing thousands. The cities, buried under a thick layer of volcanic material and mud, were never rebuilt and largely forgotten in the course of history. In the 18th century, Pompeii and Herculaneum were rediscovered and excavated, providing an archaeological record of everyday life in ancient civilisation, startlingly preserved in sudden death.<br>
<br>
Today, Mount Vesuvius is the only active volcano on the European mainland. Its last eruption was in 1944 and its last major eruption in 1631. Another eruption is expected in the near future, which could be devastating for 700,000 people who live in “death zones” around Vesuvius.<br>
<br>
<strong>Extract C</strong><br>
Diamonds are brought to the surface from the Earth’s mantle in a rare type of volcanic magma called kimberlite and erupted at a rare type of volcanic vent called a diatreme or pipe. Kimberlite is a gas-rich igneous rock that contains diamonds and other upper mantle minerals. The source depth for kimberlite magmas is estimated at 200 km, more than twice as deep as the source region for most magmas. At a depth of 200 km the pressure is 60,000 times greater than the surface and the temperature is about 1500 C. Kimberlite magmas are rich in carbon dioxide and water which brings the magma quickly and violently to the surface. Kimberlite was named for the rock associated with diamonds in Kimberley, South Africa. Kimberlite magmas form "pipes" as they erupt. A tuff cone is at the surface and formed by base-surge deposits. In the subsurface, a funnel-shaped body narrows to a depth of hundreds of meters. The pipe (also called a diatreme) is filled with kimberlite, with or without diamonds (only 1 in 5 of the pipes at Kimberley contain diamonds).<br>
<br>
<strong>Extract D</strong><br>
On Aug. 27, 1883, just after 10 a.m., the eruption of the Krakatoa volcano in Indonesia made the loudest sound known to history — a terrifying roar that sent sound waves around the world four times and could be heard 3,000 miles away on the island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean. That, for purpose of comparison, is the same as Californians hearing a noise made in New York. In Rodrigues, as in other distant places, the noise was taken to be cannon fire. In western Australia, 2,000 miles distant, people thought war had erupted. In Batavia (now Jakarta), a gas works barometer spiked to an equivalent of 172 decibels, meaning the sound, even 100 miles from its origin, was still many times louder than a jet engine. The devastation from the explosion — which packed power equivalent to 10,000 Hiroshima-sized atomic bombs — made the Krakatoa eruption one of history’s deadliest natural disasters. More than 36,400 people died, from lava flows that raced at 60 miles per hour and tsunamis that reached a height of 120 feet and wiped out some 165 coastal villages. Little was left of the Krakatoa Island in the wake of the explosion. In 1927, a volcanic island known as Anak Krakatoa (child of Krakatoa) emerged from the caldera left behind by the big blast.</p>

          <em>Read the four extracts below on the theme of Australian animals that are unique.</em>
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Extract A&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Australia has a unique fauna because it was isolated from the rest of the world for very long periods. The Australian continent was surrounded by ocean for many millions of years and so the plants and animals on a continent like a very large life raft were able to evolve in distinctive ways. Some 180 million years ago, the super continent of Gondwana split. One of the breakaway landmasses from that separation, contained what would become the continents of Australia and Antarctica. By 30 million years ago Australia had fully separated and journeyed north on its own. Since then, changes in land formation and climate, and the physical separation from the rest of the world, led to the unique flora and fauna that we know in Australia today. More than 80% of our plants, mammals, reptiles and frogs are unique to Australia and are found nowhere else in the world. Some of our unique Australian animals are very well known, like kangaroos, dingos, wallabies and wombats and of course the koala, platypus and echidna. However, there is still so much we don’t know about Australia’s native animals.<br>
<br>
<strong>Extract B&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>Echidnas, also known as spiny anteaters, are quill-covered monotremes (egg-laying mammals) belonging to the family Tachyglossidae. The four species of echidnas and the platypus are the only living mammals that lay eggs and the only surviving members of the order Monotremata. The diet of some species consists of ants and termites, but they are not closely related to the true anteaters of the American continents, which (along with sloths and armadillos) are xenarthrans. Echidnas live in Australia and New Guinea. Echidnas evolved many million years ago, descending from a platypus-like monotreme. This ancestor was aquatic, but echidnas adapted to life on land. The Echidna has porcupine-like spines, a bird-like beak, quoll-like pouch and lays eggs like a reptile. It also feeds their young on milk (like all mammals) – the milk just oozes out of the skin in the pouch and the puggle (baby echidna) licks it up. This strange mix of characteristics is why it’s named after “Echidna”, a half-woman and half-snake creature from Greek mythology, as the animal was seen to have qualities of mammals and reptiles.<br>
<br>
<strong>Extract C</strong></p>
        <p>Over 80 years ago, the last Thylacine (Tasmanian Tiger) sadly died at Hobart Zoo. It earned its more common name at the time, Tasmanian Tiger, because of the distinctive tiger-like stripes along its lower back and tail. In fact, this was no tiger or Tasmanian Wolf, as it was also known, but a marsupial and therefore not closely related to cats or dogs at all. It had the characteristic pouch of other Australian national treasures such as the wombat, koala and kangaroo. In most marsupial species, only females possess pouches, which they use to suckle and protect their young. Oddly enough, Thylacine males had pouches too. It acted like a protective sheath to cover their external reproductive organs when running through thick bush. That’s not the only similarity to other marsupials. The Thylacine had strong hind legs which were longer than its front legs. It also had a strong stiff tail similar to that of a kangaroo. This, together with its rigid tail, gave the Thylacine a stiff awkward walk not suitable for sprinting. What is really unusual, is that it could stand upright on its hind legs with its tail acting as a tripod support, just like a kangaroo! It could hop short distances which was its quickest form of getaway when it was frightened or alarmed.<br>
<br>
<strong>Extract D&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>Kangaroos are a special breed of animals. They are popular for having pouches in their bellies where they carry their young ones until they can fend for themselves. Their young ones are called joeys. Secondly, the kangaroos are unique in that their movements are characterised by hopping. In addition, kangaroos are herbivorous and chew cud. That means that they regurgitate their food, and re-chew it before the food is finally digested and absorbed. Although most kangaroos have their habitat in Australia, the origin of kangaroos was in the South American continent, where they are no longer found. At the time all continents were part of the super continent known as Gondwanaland. However, hundreds of million years ago, the continents split away occupying their present locations. Those that are found outside Australia were introduced to those parts by humans. About 60 species of kangaroos exist. However, there are four main species: the antilopine kangaroo, the western gray kangaroo, the red kangaroo, and the eastern gray kangaroo. All these types of kangaroo belong to the genus Macropus. According to the Australian government, approximately 34.3 million kangaroos lived in Australia in 2011. Kangaroos are a national symbol of Australia found even on its coat of arms.&nbsp;</p>

Some 180 million years ago, the super continent of Gondwana split. One of the breakaway landmasses from that separation, contained what would become the continents of Australia and Antarctica. By 30 million years ago Australia had fully separated and journeyed north on its own. Since then, changes in land formation and climate, and the physical separation from the rest of the world, led to the unique flora and fauna that we know in Australia today. More than 80% of our plants, mammals, reptiles and frogs are unique to Australia and are found nowhere else in the world. Some of our unique Australian animals are very well known, like kangaroos, dingos, wallabies and wombats and of course the koala, platypus and echidna. However, there is still so much we don’t know about Australia’s native animals.<br>

<strong>Extract B&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>Echidnas, also known as spiny anteaters, are quill-covered monotremes (egg-laying mammals) belonging to the family Tachyglossidae. The four species of echidnas and the platypus are the only living mammals that lay eggs and the only surviving members of the order Monotremata. The diet of some species consists of ants and termites, but they are not closely related to the true anteaters of the American continents, which (along with sloths and armadillos) are xenarthrans. Echidnas live in Australia and New Guinea. Echidnas evolved many million years ago, descending from a platypus-like monotreme. This ancestor was aquatic, but echidnas adapted to life on land. The Echidna has porcupine-like spines, a bird-like beak, quoll-like pouch and lays eggs like a reptile. It also feeds their young on milk (like all mammals) – the milk just oozes out of the skin in the pouch and the puggle (baby echidna) licks it up. This strange mix of characteristics is why it’s named after “Echidna”, a half-woman and half-snake creature from Greek mythology, as the animal was seen to have qualities of mammals and reptiles.<br>

<strong>Extract C</strong></p>
        <p>Over 80 years ago, the last Thylacine (Tasmanian Tiger) sadly died at Hobart Zoo. It earned its more common name at the time, Tasmanian Tiger, because of the distinctive tiger-like stripes along its lower back and tail. In fact, this was no tiger or Tasmanian Wolf, as it was also known, but a marsupial and therefore not closely related to cats or dogs at all. It had the characteristic pouch of other Australian national treasures such as the wombat, koala and kangaroo. In most marsupial species, only females possess pouches, which they use to suckle and protect their young. Oddly enough, Thylacine males had pouches too. It acted like a protective sheath to cover their external reproductive organs when running through thick bush. That’s not the only similarity to other marsupials. The Thylacine had strong hind legs which were longer than its front legs. It also had a strong stiff tail similar to that of a kangaroo. This, together with its rigid tail, gave the Thylacine a stiff awkward walk not suitable for sprinting. What is really unusual, is that it could stand upright on its hind legs with its tail acting as a tripod support, just like a kangaroo! It could hop short distances which was its quickest form of getaway when it was frightened or alarmed.<br>

        <p>Kangaroos are a special breed of animals. They are popular for having pouches in their bellies where they carry their young ones until they can fend for themselves. Their young ones are called joeys. Secondly, the kangaroos are unique in that their movements are characterised by hopping. In addition, kangaroos are herbivorous and chew cud. That means that they regurgitate their food, and re-chew it before the food is finally digested and absorbed. Although most kangaroos have their habitat in Australia, the origin of kangaroos was in the South American continent, where they are no longer found. At the time all continents were part of the super continent known as Gondwanaland. However, hundreds of million years ago, the continents split away occupying their present locations. Those that are found outside Australia were introduced to those parts by humans. About 60 species of kangaroos exist. However, there are four main species: the antilopine kangaroo, the western gray kangaroo, the red kangaroo, and the eastern gray kangaroo. All these types of kangaroo belong to the genus Macropus. According to the Australian government, approximately 34.3 million kangaroos lived in Australia in 2011. Kangaroos are a national symbol of Australia found even on its coat of arms.&nbsp;</p>

It also feeds their young on milk (like all mammals) – the milk just oozes out of the skin in the pouch and the puggle (baby echidna) licks it up. This strange mix of characteristics is why it’s named after “Echidna”, a half-woman and half-snake creature from Greek mythology, as the animal was seen to have qualities of mammals and reptiles.<br>

        <p>Over 80 years ago, the last Thylacine (Tasmanian Tiger) sadly died at Hobart Zoo. It earned its more common name at the time, Tasmanian Tiger, because of the distinctive tiger-like stripes along its lower back and tail. In fact, this was no tiger or Tasmanian Wolf, as it was also known, but a marsupial and therefore not closely related to cats or dogs at all. It had the characteristic pouch of other Australian national treasures such as the wombat, koala and kangaroo. In most marsupial species, only females possess pouches, which they use to suckle and protect their young. Oddly enough, Thylacine males had pouches too. It acted like a protective sheath to cover their external reproductive organs when running through thick bush. That’s not the only similarity to other marsupials. The Thylacine had strong hind legs which were longer than its front legs. It also had a strong stiff tail similar to that of a kangaroo. This, together with its rigid tail, gave the Thylacine a stiff awkward walk not suitable for sprinting. What is really unusual, is that it could stand upright on its hind legs with its tail acting as a tripod support, just like a kangaroo! It could hop short distances which was its quickest form of getaway when it was frightened or alarmed.<br>

        <p>Kangaroos are a special breed of animals. They are popular for having pouches in their bellies where they carry their young ones until they can fend for themselves. Their young ones are called joeys. Secondly, the kangaroos are unique in that their movements are characterised by hopping. In addition, kangaroos are herbivorous and chew cud. That means that they regurgitate their food, and re-chew it before the food is finally digested and absorbed. Although most kangaroos have their habitat in Australia, the origin of kangaroos was in the South American continent, where they are no longer found. At the time all continents were part of the super continent known as Gondwanaland. However, hundreds of million years ago, the continents split away occupying their present locations. Those that are found outside Australia were introduced to those parts by humans. About 60 species of kangaroos exist. However, there are four main species: the antilopine kangaroo, the western gray kangaroo, the red kangaroo, and the eastern gray kangaroo. All these types of kangaroo belong to the genus Macropus. According to the Australian government, approximately 34.3 million kangaroos lived in Australia in 2011. Kangaroos are a national symbol of Australia found even on its coat of arms.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Extract A&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Australia has a unique fauna because it was isolated from the rest of the world for very long periods. The Australian continent was surrounded by ocean for many millions of years and so the plants and animals on a continent like a very large life raft were able to evolve in distinctive ways. Some 180 million years ago, the super continent of Gondwana split. One of the breakaway landmasses from that separation, contained what would become the continents of Australia and Antarctica. By 30 million years ago Australia had fully separated and journeyed north on its own. Since then, changes in land formation and climate, and the physical separation from the rest of the world, led to the unique flora and fauna that we know in Australia today. More than 80% of our plants, mammals, reptiles and frogs are unique to Australia and are found nowhere else in the world. Some of our unique Australian animals are very well known, like kangaroos, dingos, wallabies and wombats and of course the koala, platypus and echidna. However, there is still so much we don’t know about Australia’s native animals.<br>
<br>
<strong>Extract B&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>Echidnas, also known as spiny anteaters, are quill-covered monotremes (egg-laying mammals) belonging to the family Tachyglossidae. The four species of echidnas and the platypus are the only living mammals that lay eggs and the only surviving members of the order Monotremata. The diet of some species consists of ants and termites, but they are not closely related to the true anteaters of the American continents, which (along with sloths and armadillos) are xenarthrans. Echidnas live in Australia and New Guinea. Echidnas evolved many million years ago, descending from a platypus-like monotreme. This ancestor was aquatic, but echidnas adapted to life on land.

On the other hand, there were also very small dinosaurs that looked a lot more similar in size to today’s birds and lizards. For instance, there were dinosaurs that were only about 1 foot tall.</p>
        <p>There was a very large range in the sizes and types of dinosaurs. Some of them were very large but only ate plants, and some of them were smaller and could run very fast, and ate meat.

The 2,200 people on board were not aware of the danger just ahead. At 2:20 a.m. early the next morning, the ship ran into an iceberg. It tore a 300-foot hole into the ship’s hull. As it flooded, people ran to the lifeboats. But although there were many luxuries on the ship, the Titanic had only 20 lifeboats. That was only enough to hold one third of the people on board. Only about 700 people would survive the sinking of the Titanic. And the ship, which took three years to build, would sink in less than three hours.</div>

        <p>Myotonic goats are known as “fainting goats” because when something surprises or frightens them, their muscles go stiff for a short time, and they fall over! They’re also known as wooden-leg goats, stiff-leg goats, scare goats, and other funny nicknames.</p>
        <p>The reaction doesn’t hurt, and it’s not really fainting. Usually, the animal stays awake and just bounces back up once the stiffness goes away. The locking up is caused by a rare genetic disorder called myotonia congenita. It makes the goats’ skeletal muscles, especially in their back legs, suddenly tighten up and then slowly loosen again. Lots of other animals can have this condition too, including people, horses, dogs, cats, and mice.</p>
