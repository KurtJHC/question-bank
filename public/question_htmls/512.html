As I grew older, this was embarrassing, especially since none of my clothes had the brand names that my classmates valued so highly, nor was my personal style ever quite up to date. Mom didn’t care; she was happy to save money on clothes and use it for other, more interesting investments, such as music lessons and travel. I know we've been talking about the benefits of thrift stores for years, but it is a good time to revisit why we love them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1. Thrift Stores Make It Easier to Dress Your Kids</strong></p><p>As a parent, there’s no better way to dress growing kids than by going to the thrift store. Kids often grow out of their clothes long before they’re worn out, so it’s easy to find&nbsp;quality kids’ clothes&nbsp;in top-notch condition for just a few dollars.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. Thrift Stores Allow You to Experiment</strong></p><p>Because thrift store items are so cheap, it’s fun to experiment with styles or colours that you might not usually buy. If you only wear that hot pink shirt or embroidered pants a few times, hey, it was only $3, instead of $30... or, heaven forbid, $300.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3. Thrift Stores Have High-Quality Items</strong></p>
Thrift store items are typically higher quality simply by virtue of being there. They’ve withstood one person’s use already and still have resale value, which means they’re not like your typical H&amp;M, Zara, or Forever21 cheap “fast fashion” shirts that stretch and lose their shape after a few washes.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>4. Clothes From Thrift Stores Don't Shrink</strong></p>

<p>Which leads me to the next point... that clothes at the thrift store are always laundered before selling, so you’ll get the same fit after washing them yourself.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>5. Thrift Stores Are an Opportunity to Develop Your Own Unique Sense of Style</strong></p>

<p>Shopping without mannequins to show you what’s trendy might be terrifying, especially if you’re like me and feel lost when it comes to piecing together funky outfits, but with practice comes confidence. When everyone shops at the same trendy, brand name stores, it’s inevitable that someday you’ll meet an unexpected twin in public, wearing the exact same shirt or dress as you. Believe me, no one wants to be that person.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>6. There Really Are Fabulous Finds on All the Racks at the Thrift Store</strong></p>

<p>Since there’s still a bit of stigma associated with second-hand shopping, there’s not as much competition as there should be for the designer jeans, coats, and vintage leather bags that you can find with only a bit of patience.&nbsp;Keep going back&nbsp;with low expectations and you’ll be pleasantly surprised.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>7. Thrift Stores Don't Have Salespeople Hounding You to Buy Something</strong></p>

<p>There are no hovering salespeople waiting to make a commission off your purchase. In fact, most employees at the Salvation Army are volunteers, so they really don’t care if you buy anything at all.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>8. Thrift Stores Have More Than Just Clothes</strong></p>

<p>Thrift stores go beyond clothes. They’re the ultimate one-stop shopping experience, a much cooler version of Wal-Mart superstores. Most of my home furnishings come from the thrift store – the pine harvest table, cotton bed sheets, an armchair, baskets, picture frames, dishes, glasses, curtains, futon cover, bath mat, baking pans, and mirrors. If there’s anything you need, check the thrift store first, since they’ve probably got it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>9. Shopping at the Thrift Store Leads to Less Hoarding</strong></p>

<p>Because there’s a much smaller financial investment in each item, it’s not as hard to let go. You know that pair of jeans that cost so much, but they just don’t fit right, and you can’t bring yourself to get rid of them because you spent so much? Not the case with thrift store jeans that cost $3 a pop! If something doesn’t work, donate it back and try again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>10. Supporting Thrift Stores Supports the Community</strong></p>
Many thrift stores support the community. The Salvation Army donates all profits to its charity work, so you can be sure that your dollars are being put to good use.</div>

<p>Thrift stores go beyond clothes. They’re the ultimate one-stop shopping experience, a much cooler version of Wal-Mart superstores. Most of my home furnishings come from the thrift store – the pine harvest table, cotton bed sheets, an armchair, baskets, picture frames, dishes, glasses, curtains, futon cover, bath mat, baking pans, and mirrors. If there’s anything you need, check the thrift store first, since they’ve probably got it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>9. Shopping at the Thrift Store Leads to Less Hoarding</strong></p>

<p>Because there’s a much smaller financial investment in each item, it’s not as hard to let go. You know that pair of jeans that cost so much, but they just don’t fit right, and you can’t bring yourself to get rid of them because you spent so much? Not the case with thrift store jeans that cost $3 a pop! If something doesn’t work, donate it back and try again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>10. Supporting Thrift Stores Supports the Community</strong></p>
Many thrift stores support the community. The Salvation Army donates all profits to its charity work, so you can be sure that your dollars are being put to good use.</div>

As I grew older, this was embarrassing, especially since none of my clothes had the brand names that my classmates valued so highly, nor was my personal style ever quite up to date. Mom didn’t care; she was happy to save money on clothes and use it for other, more interesting investments, such as music lessons and travel. I know we've been talking about the benefits of thrift stores for years, but it is a good time to revisit why we love them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1. Thrift Stores Make It Easier to Dress Your Kids</strong></p><p>As a parent, there’s no better way to dress growing kids than by going to the thrift store. Kids often grow out of their clothes long before they’re worn out, so it’s easy to find&nbsp;quality kids’ clothes&nbsp;in top-notch condition for just a few dollars.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. Thrift Stores Allow You to Experiment</strong></p><p>Because thrift store items are so cheap, it’s fun to experiment with styles or colours that you might not usually buy. If you only wear that hot pink shirt or embroidered pants a few times, hey, it was only $3, instead of $30... or, heaven forbid, $300.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3. Thrift Stores Have High-Quality Items</strong></p>
Thrift store items are typically higher quality simply by virtue of being there. They’ve withstood one person’s use already and still have resale value, which means they’re not like your typical H&amp;M, Zara, or Forever21 cheap “fast fashion” shirts that stretch and lose their shape after a few washes.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>4. Clothes From Thrift Stores Don't Shrink</strong></p>

<p>Which leads me to the next point... that clothes at the thrift store are always laundered before selling, so you’ll get the same fit after washing them yourself.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>5. Thrift Stores Are an Opportunity to Develop Your Own Unique Sense of Style</strong></p>

<p>Shopping without mannequins to show you what’s trendy might be terrifying, especially if you’re like me and feel lost when it comes to piecing together funky outfits, but with practice comes confidence. When everyone shops at the same trendy, brand name stores, it’s inevitable that someday you’ll meet an unexpected twin in public, wearing the exact same shirt or dress as you. Believe me, no one wants to be that person.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>6. There Really Are Fabulous Finds on All the Racks at the Thrift Store</strong></p>

<p>Since there’s still a bit of stigma associated with second-hand shopping, there’s not as much competition as there should be for the designer jeans, coats, and vintage leather bags that you can find with only a bit of patience.&nbsp;Keep going back&nbsp;with low expectations and you’ll be pleasantly surprised.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>7. Thrift Stores Don't Have Salespeople Hounding You to Buy Something</strong></p>

<p>There are no hovering salespeople waiting to make a commission off your purchase. In fact, most employees at the Salvation Army are volunteers, so they really don’t care if you buy anything at all.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>8. Thrift Stores Have More Than Just Clothes</strong></p>

<p>Thrift stores go beyond clothes. They’re the ultimate one-stop shopping experience, a much cooler version of Wal-Mart superstores.

        <p>Read the following the text to answer Questions 31 - 35.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>A woman is reflecting on her son’s recent death.</em><br>
I never thought that I, as a mother, would ever have to do this.&nbsp; In some ways, I don’t think I have accepted it either. The last couple of days have felt like an extremely bad nightmare and I keep hoping that I would wake up from it soon. No mother should ever have to bury her own child. It’s not fair; it’s just simply not fair.</p>
        <p>Dan was a healthy young man. He loved what he did and had a genuine concern for others, even those who may not have cared about him. I was always uncomfortable about him working with the juvenile crime department, but he said that was where his passion lay. Dan had quite a bit of trouble with the law too when he was younger; I think it’s largely the reason he invests so much of his energy working with troubled adolescents; he sees a lot of who he was in them. I am so proud of who he is and what he’s overcome, but I still couldn’t understand why his young life was cut so short.</p>
        <p>But, yesterday I received a letter from another young man and some of what he wrote brought me to tears, “I know that there’s nothing I could write that would bring him back. But, I’d like you to know that your son was a remarkable young man. Because of him many others have changed to lead better lives. He is part of the reason that I am still here writing this letter. So please know that your son did not die in vain.”</p>

        <p><em>A woman is reflecting on her son’s recent death.</em><br>
I never thought that I, as a mother, would ever have to do this.&nbsp; In some ways, I don’t think I have accepted it either. The last couple of days have felt like an extremely bad nightmare and I keep hoping that I would wake up from it soon. No mother should ever have to bury her own child. It’s not fair; it’s just simply not fair.</p>
        <p>Dan was a healthy young man. He loved what he did and had a genuine concern for others, even those who may not have cared about him. I was always uncomfortable about him working with the juvenile crime department, but he said that was where his passion lay. Dan had quite a bit of trouble with the law too when he was younger; I think it’s largely the reason he invests so much of his energy working with troubled adolescents; he sees a lot of who he was in them. I am so proud of who he is and what he’s overcome, but I still couldn’t understand why his young life was cut so short.</p>
        <p>But, yesterday I received a letter from another young man and some of what he wrote brought me to tears, “I know that there’s nothing I could write that would bring him back. But, I’d like you to know that your son was a remarkable young man. Because of him many others have changed to lead better lives. He is part of the reason that I am still here writing this letter. So please know that your son did not die in vain.”</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>A woman is reflecting on her son’s recent death.</em><br>
I never thought that I, as a mother, would ever have to do this.&nbsp; In some ways, I don’t think I have accepted it either. The last couple of days have felt like an extremely bad nightmare and I keep hoping that I would wake up from it soon. No mother should ever have to bury her own child. It’s not fair; it’s just simply not fair.</p>
        <p>Dan was a healthy young man. He loved what he did and had a genuine concern for others, even those who may not have cared about him. I was always uncomfortable about him working with the juvenile crime department, but he said that was where his passion lay. Dan had quite a bit of trouble with the law too when he was younger; I think it’s largely the reason he invests so much of his energy working with troubled adolescents; he sees a lot of who he was in them. I am so proud of who he is and what he’s overcome, but I still couldn’t understand why his young life was cut so short.</p>
        <p>But, yesterday I received a letter from another young man and some of what he wrote brought me to tears, “I know that there’s nothing I could write that would bring him back. But, I’d like you to know that your son was a remarkable young man. Because of him many others have changed to lead better lives. He is part of the reason that I am still here writing this letter. So please know that your son did not die in vain.”</p>

          <strong>Dark Matter</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dark matter is one of the Universe's greatest mysteries. Something is out there generating gravitational force that can't be accounted for by detectable matter. The way the&nbsp;stars and galaxies move&nbsp;indicates that up to 85 percent of the matter in the Universe is actually dark matter.</p>
        <p>We have yet to detect it, but it could be producing signatures that we have the ability to detect, if we can refine our technology and know what to look for.</p>
        <p>One of these potential signatures is produced by hypothetical 'weakly interacting massive particles,' known as&nbsp;WIMPs. If these particles exist, we should be able to detect them via their collisions with&nbsp;electrons or atomic nuclei, which would cause charged particles on Earth to recoil, producing light that could be picked up by&nbsp;liquid xenon&nbsp;or&nbsp;crystal&nbsp;detectors.</p>
        <p>DAMA has been recording WIMP detections since 1995, observed as an&nbsp;annual fluctuation&nbsp;in the number of light flashes detected.</p>
        <p>Because of the orbit of Earth around the Sun, and the Solar System's orbit around the galactic centre, Earth&nbsp;should theoretically be exposed&nbsp;to dark matter flux from the galactic halo peaking at around 2 June and ebbing at around 2 December.</p>
        <p>This is because the faster we are moving through space, the more dark matter should pound us, and mid-year is when the orbital speeds of Earth and the Solar System combine.</p>
        <p>This is exactly what DAMA scientists claim their results show, but no other dark matter detector has come close to replicating it -&nbsp;not even XENON1T, hailed as&nbsp;our best shot&nbsp;at finding the elusive stuff.</p>
        <p>But for all that, we're still in shrug emoji territory.</p>

          <strong>Dark Matter</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dark matter is one of the Universe's greatest mysteries. Something is out there generating gravitational force that can't be accounted for by detectable matter. The way the&nbsp;stars and galaxies move&nbsp;indicates that up to 85 percent of the matter in the Universe is actually dark matter.</p>
        <p>We have yet to detect it, but it could be producing signatures that we have the ability to detect, if we can refine our technology and know what to look for.</p>
        <p>One of these potential signatures is produced by hypothetical 'weakly interacting massive particles,' known as&nbsp;WIMPs. If these particles exist, we should be able to detect them via their collisions with&nbsp;electrons or atomic nuclei, which would cause charged particles on Earth to recoil, producing light that could be picked up by&nbsp;liquid xenon&nbsp;or&nbsp;crystal&nbsp;detectors.</p>
        <p>DAMA has been recording WIMP detections since 1995, observed as an&nbsp;annual fluctuation&nbsp;in the number of light flashes detected.</p>
        <p>Because of the orbit of Earth around the Sun, and the Solar System's orbit around the galactic centre, Earth&nbsp;should theoretically be exposed&nbsp;to dark matter flux from the galactic halo peaking at around 2 June and ebbing at around 2 December.</p>
        <p>This is because the faster we are moving through space, the more dark matter should pound us, and mid-year is when the orbital speeds of Earth and the Solar System combine.</p>
        <p>This is exactly what DAMA scientists claim their results show, but no other dark matter detector has come close to replicating it -&nbsp;not even XENON1T, hailed as&nbsp;our best shot&nbsp;at finding the elusive stuff.</p>
        <p>But for all that, we're still in shrug emoji territory.</p>

          <strong>Dark Matter</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dark matter is one of the Universe's greatest mysteries. Something is out there generating gravitational force that can't be accounted for by detectable matter. The way the&nbsp;stars and galaxies move&nbsp;indicates that up to 85 percent of the matter in the Universe is actually dark matter.</p>
        <p>We have yet to detect it, but it could be producing signatures that we have the ability to detect, if we can refine our technology and know what to look for.</p>
        <p>One of these potential signatures is produced by hypothetical 'weakly interacting massive particles,' known as&nbsp;WIMPs. If these particles exist, we should be able to detect them via their collisions with&nbsp;electrons or atomic nuclei, which would cause charged particles on Earth to recoil, producing light that could be picked up by&nbsp;liquid xenon&nbsp;or&nbsp;crystal&nbsp;detectors.</p>
        <p>DAMA has been recording WIMP detections since 1995, observed as an&nbsp;annual fluctuation&nbsp;in the number of light flashes detected.</p>
        <p>Because of the orbit of Earth around the Sun, and the Solar System's orbit around the galactic centre, Earth&nbsp;should theoretically be exposed&nbsp;to dark matter flux from the galactic halo peaking at around 2 June and ebbing at around 2 December.</p>
        <p>This is because the faster we are moving through space, the more dark matter should pound us, and mid-year is when the orbital speeds of Earth and the Solar System combine.</p>
        <p>This is exactly what DAMA scientists claim their results show, but no other dark matter detector has come close to replicating it -&nbsp;not even XENON1T, hailed as&nbsp;our best shot&nbsp;at finding the elusive stuff.</p>
        <p>But for all that, we're still in shrug emoji territory.</p>

          <strong>Questions 9 - 11 relate to the extract from “The Secret Garden” by Frances Hodgsen Burnett:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was the sweetest, most mysterious-looking place anyone could imagine. The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of climbing roses, which were so thick that they were matted together. Mary Lennox knew they were roses because she had seen a great many roses in India. All the ground was covered with grass of a wintry brown, and out of it grew clumps of bushes which were surely rose-bushes if they were alive. There were numbers of standard roses which had so spread their branches that they were like little trees. There were other trees in the garden, and one of the things which made the place look strangest and loveliest was that climbing roses had run all over them and swung down long tendrils which made light swaying curtains, and here and there they had caught at each other or at a far-reaching branch and had crept from one tree to another and made lovely bridges of themselves. There were neither leaves nor roses on them now, and Mary did not know whether they were dead or alive, but their thin grey or brown branches and sprays looked like a sort of hazy mantle spreading over everything, walls and trees and even brown grass, where they had fallen from their fastenings and run along the ground. It was this hazy tangle from tree to tree which made it look so mysterious. Mary had thought it must be different from other gardens which had not been left all by themselves so long; and indeed, it was different from any other place she had ever seen in her life.</p>
        <p>“How still it is!” she whispered. “How still!”</p>
        <p>Then she waited a moment and listened at the stillness. The robin, who had flown to his tree-top, was still as all the rest. He did not even flutter his wings; he sat without stirring, and looked at Mary.</p>
        <p>“No wonder it is still,” she whispered again. “I am the first person who has spoken in here for ten years.”</p>
        <p>She moved away from the door, stepping as softly as if she were afraid of awakening someone. She was glad that there was grass under her feet and that her steps made no sounds. She walked under one of the fairy-like arches between the trees and looked up at the sprays and tendrils which formed them.</p>
        <p>“I wonder if they are all quite dead,” she said. “Is it all a quite dead garden? I wish it wasn’t.”</p>
