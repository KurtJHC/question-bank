          <strong>Like Mother <em>by Cassandra Austin</em>&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Her baby’s fingers look like small furled leaves and Louise lifts them to her lips to kiss. They are lying together on the spare bed in the nursery, quiet and peaceful. Dolores – or Lolly, as they like to call her – should be in her cot but sometimes, often, it is easier just to lie down with her and get her to sleep this way.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>How lucky that they had nowhere else for the spare bed. But is it luck, or foolishness? Her mother says she is making a rod for her back, but there are so many rules when it comes to getting babies to sleep, so many rights and wrongs, and none of them help. Louise often gives up and does whatever works, and today that is lying down with her daughter and humming nursery rhymes. So here they are, mother shelled around the little pearl of daughter, curtains drawn against the dying light of the day, and sleep upon them both. Nothing could be lovelier.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Louise shifts onto her back and closes her eyes, though only for a minute. Steven is in their bedroom packing for his week on the road and if she wants to spend time with him before he leaves, she should get up now. Put Lolly in the cot now. But there are thorns that prickle when she thinks about the conversation that will spill from her – how she wishes he wasn’t back at work only two short months after the birth, how lonely she gets – and the mix of guilt and appeasement that appears on his face whenever she brings up these things swims into view.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But in the end, there is no conversation. She’s closed her eyes for a fraction too long and now her limbs have loosened and she drifts away from the soft rasp of pillow against her ear. It’s strange, this drift. She hears a car purring along the street and is following it without leaving the bed. How? She is not outside but she is no longer in the bedroom either; she is floating away on the sound of her breath into the vast, silent world that awaits. And what is that sprinkle of soft light? Stars? Stars. They are up with the stars, for she sees that Lolly has come too, and now they are like earth and moon, dancing around each other in a slow spin. A spin of love. Around them, in turn, black folds of velvety night circle ever higher, ever further, expanding outwards into infinity.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A great feeling of joy washes through her. An exultation. She and Lolly, boundless. She hadn’t known her heart was capable of this endless cascade of feeling and she never wants it to end.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She feels such wonder as the gentle points of light get brighter. Perhaps too bright.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One of the stars is becoming a sun. Pulling them off orbit. Soon, they are hurtling towards it. She can hear a voice. Her mother’s voice. Scolding. Warning.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Louise?’ She startles, the rush back to earth complete. ‘Come on, darling.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It’s Steven. He’s only whispering, though it seems so loud. She blinks, her vision blurring with the effort it requires.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Shall I lift her up for you?’ He’s leaning over her, smiling, his glasses dancing before her delirious eyes. ‘We can’t do this, love. It might be <span class="txt-underline"><strong>dangerous</strong></span>, remember?’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Louise jerks fully awake at this, heart hammering as she checks the peanut shape of her baby snuggled in to her side. But Lolly is fine, just asleep. Sound asleep with a smile on her face, still dancing with the stars. Louise sighs, relaxing back onto the pillow.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Lou . . .’ Her husband is on the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>verge of saying more</strong></span>, but instead cocks his head, looking down at her. Then he slips onto the bed to cradle her as she cradles Lolly. A family making its own constellation. She lifts a hand to fondly, drowsily, pat his cheek.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If only it could stay like this.&nbsp;</p>

But there are thorns that prickle when she thinks about the conversation that will spill from her – how she wishes he wasn’t back at work only two short months after the birth, how lonely she gets – and the mix of guilt and appeasement that appears on his face whenever she brings up these things swims into view.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But in the end, there is no conversation. She’s closed her eyes for a fraction too long and now her limbs have loosened and she drifts away from the soft rasp of pillow against her ear. It’s strange, this drift. She hears a car purring along the street and is following it without leaving the bed. How? She is not outside but she is no longer in the bedroom either; she is floating away on the sound of her breath into the vast, silent world that awaits. And what is that sprinkle of soft light? Stars? Stars. They are up with the stars, for she sees that Lolly has come too, and now they are like earth and moon, dancing around each other in a slow spin. A spin of love. Around them, in turn, black folds of velvety night circle ever higher, ever further, expanding outwards into infinity.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A great feeling of joy washes through her. An exultation. She and Lolly, boundless. She hadn’t known her heart was capable of this endless cascade of feeling and she never wants it to end.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She feels such wonder as the gentle points of light get brighter. Perhaps too bright.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One of the stars is becoming a sun. Pulling them off orbit. Soon, they are hurtling towards it. She can hear a voice. Her mother’s voice. Scolding. Warning.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Louise?’ She startles, the rush back to earth complete. ‘Come on, darling.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It’s Steven. He’s only whispering, though it seems so loud. She blinks, her vision blurring with the effort it requires.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Shall I lift her up for you?’ He’s leaning over her, smiling, his glasses dancing before her delirious eyes. ‘We can’t do this, love. It might be <span class="txt-underline"><strong>dangerous</strong></span>, remember?’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Louise jerks fully awake at this, heart hammering as she checks the peanut shape of her baby snuggled in to her side. But Lolly is fine, just asleep. Sound asleep with a smile on her face, still dancing with the stars. Louise sighs, relaxing back onto the pillow.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Lou . . .’ Her husband is on the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>verge of saying more</strong></span>, but instead cocks his head, looking down at her. Then he slips onto the bed to cradle her as she cradles Lolly. A family making its own constellation. She lifts a hand to fondly, drowsily, pat his cheek.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If only it could stay like this.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Louise jerks fully awake at this, heart hammering as she checks the peanut shape of her baby snuggled in to her side. But Lolly is fine, just asleep. Sound asleep with a smile on her face, still dancing with the stars. Louise sighs, relaxing back onto the pillow.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Like Mother <em>by Cassandra Austin</em>&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Her baby’s fingers look like small furled leaves and Louise lifts them to her lips to kiss. They are lying together on the spare bed in the nursery, quiet and peaceful. Dolores – or Lolly, as they like to call her – should be in her cot but sometimes, often, it is easier just to lie down with her and get her to sleep this way.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>How lucky that they had nowhere else for the spare bed. But is it luck, or foolishness? Her mother says she is making a rod for her back, but there are so many rules when it comes to getting babies to sleep, so many rights and wrongs, and none of them help. Louise often gives up and does whatever works, and today that is lying down with her daughter and humming nursery rhymes. So here they are, mother shelled around the little pearl of daughter, curtains drawn against the dying light of the day, and sleep upon them both. Nothing could be lovelier.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Louise shifts onto her back and closes her eyes, though only for a minute. Steven is in their bedroom packing for his week on the road and if she wants to spend time with him before he leaves, she should get up now. Put Lolly in the cot now. But there are thorns that prickle when she thinks about the conversation that will spill from her – how she wishes he wasn’t back at work only two short months after the birth, how lonely she gets – and the mix of guilt and appeasement that appears on his face whenever she brings up these things swims into view.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But in the end, there is no conversation. She’s closed her eyes for a fraction too long and now her limbs have loosened and she drifts away from the soft rasp of pillow against her ear. It’s strange, this drift. She hears a car purring along the street and is following it without leaving the bed. How? She is not outside but she is no longer in the bedroom either; she is floating away on the sound of her breath into the vast, silent world that awaits. And what is that sprinkle of soft light? Stars? Stars. They are up with the stars, for she sees that Lolly has come too, and now they are like earth and moon, dancing around each other in a slow spin. A spin of love. Around them, in turn, black folds of velvety night circle ever higher, ever further, expanding outwards into infinity.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A great feeling of joy washes through her. An exultation. She and Lolly, boundless. She hadn’t known her heart was capable of this endless cascade of feeling and she never wants it to end.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She feels such wonder as the gentle points of light get brighter. Perhaps too bright.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One of the stars is becoming a sun. Pulling them off orbit. Soon, they are hurtling towards it. She can hear a voice. Her mother’s voice. Scolding. Warning.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Louise?’ She startles, the rush back to earth complete. ‘Come on, darling.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It’s Steven. He’s only whispering, though it seems so loud. She blinks, her vision blurring with the effort it requires.</p>

        <p>‘Shall I lift her up for you?’ He’s leaning over her, smiling, his glasses dancing before her delirious eyes. ‘We can’t do this, love. It might be <span class="txt-underline"><strong>dangerous</strong></span>, remember?’&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Like Mother <em>by Cassandra Austin</em>&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Her baby’s fingers look like small furled leaves and Louise lifts them to her lips to kiss. They are lying together on the spare bed in the nursery, quiet and peaceful. Dolores – or Lolly, as they like to call her – should be in her cot but sometimes, often, it is easier just to lie down with her and get her to sleep this way.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>How lucky that they had nowhere else for the spare bed. But is it luck, or foolishness? Her mother says she is making a rod for her back, but there are so many rules when it comes to getting babies to sleep, so many rights and wrongs, and none of them help. Louise often gives up and does whatever works, and today that is lying down with her daughter and humming nursery rhymes. So here they are, mother shelled around the little pearl of daughter, curtains drawn against the dying light of the day, and sleep upon them both. Nothing could be lovelier.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Louise shifts onto her back and closes her eyes, though only for a minute. Steven is in their bedroom packing for his week on the road and if she wants to spend time with him before he leaves, she should get up now. Put Lolly in the cot now. But there are thorns that prickle when she thinks about the conversation that will spill from her – how she wishes he wasn’t back at work only two short months after the birth, how lonely she gets – and the mix of guilt and appeasement that appears on his face whenever she brings up these things swims into view.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But in the end, there is no conversation. She’s closed her eyes for a fraction too long and now her limbs have loosened and she drifts away from the soft rasp of pillow against her ear. It’s strange, this drift. She hears a car purring along the street and is following it without leaving the bed. How? She is not outside but she is no longer in the bedroom either; she is floating away on the sound of her breath into the vast, silent world that awaits. And what is that sprinkle of soft light? Stars? Stars. They are up with the stars, for she sees that Lolly has come too, and now they are like earth and moon, dancing around each other in a slow spin. A spin of love. Around them, in turn, black folds of velvety night circle ever higher, ever further, expanding outwards into infinity.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A great feeling of joy washes through her. An exultation. She and Lolly, boundless. She hadn’t known her heart was capable of this endless cascade of feeling and she never wants it to end.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She feels such wonder as the gentle points of light get brighter. Perhaps too bright.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One of the stars is becoming a sun. Pulling them off orbit. Soon, they are hurtling towards it. She can hear a voice. Her mother’s voice. Scolding. Warning.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Louise?’ She startles, the rush back to earth complete. ‘Come on, darling.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It’s Steven. He’s only whispering, though it seems so loud. She blinks, her vision blurring with the effort it requires.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Shall I lift her up for you?’ He’s leaning over her, smiling, his glasses dancing before her delirious eyes. ‘We can’t do this, love. It might be <span class="txt-underline"><strong>dangerous</strong></span>, remember?’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Louise jerks fully awake at this, heart hammering as she checks the peanut shape of her baby snuggled in to her side. But Lolly is fine, just asleep. Sound asleep with a smile on her face, still dancing with the stars. Louise sighs, relaxing back onto the pillow.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Lou . . .’ Her husband is on the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>verge of saying more</strong></span>, but instead cocks his head, looking down at her. Then he slips onto the bed to cradle her as she cradles Lolly. A family making its own constellation. She lifts a hand to fondly, drowsily, pat his cheek.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If only it could stay like this.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Slicing the Bread&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Her mother’s hunger. One huge pot of hot water&nbsp;</p>
        <p>with some chopped weeds –<em> komesa, lebioda-</em></p>
        <p>She taught her to <span class="txt-underline"><strong>recognise their leaves</strong></span>,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>just in case – plus a spoonful of flour,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>for flavour. Lunch for twenty people&nbsp;</p>
        <p>crammed into a two-bedroom house.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The spring was the worst-flowers, birdsong,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>and nothing to eat. You had to wait&nbsp;</p>
        <p>for the rye and potatoes to grow. The pantry&nbsp;</p>
        <p>was empty. She was hungry. Always hungry.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She ate raw wheat sometimes. Too green,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The kernels she chewed – still milky – made her sick.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Thirty years after the war,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>her mother stashed paper bags with sliced, dried bread&nbsp;</p>
        <p>on top shelves in her Warsaw kitchen.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Twenty, thirty bags… enough food for a month.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>Don’t ever throw any bread away</em>, her mother said.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>Remember, war is hunger.&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Every week, her mother ate <em>dziad</em> soup –</p>
        <p><span class="txt-underline"><strong>fit for a beggar</strong></span>, made with crumbled wheat buns,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>stale sourdough loaves, pieces of dark rye&nbsp;</p>
        <p>soaked in hot tea with honey.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She liked it. She wanted to remember&nbsp;</p>
        <p>its taste.</p>

        <p>Her mother’s hunger. One huge pot of hot water&nbsp;</p>
        <p>with some chopped weeds –<em> komesa, lebioda-</em></p>
        <p>She taught her to <span class="txt-underline"><strong>recognise their leaves</strong></span>,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>just in case – plus a spoonful of flour,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>for flavour. Lunch for twenty people&nbsp;</p>
        <p>crammed into a two-bedroom house.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The spring was the worst-flowers, birdsong,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>and nothing to eat. You had to wait&nbsp;</p>
        <p>for the rye and potatoes to grow. The pantry&nbsp;</p>
        <p>was empty. She was hungry. Always hungry.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She ate raw wheat sometimes. Too green,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The kernels she chewed – still milky – made her sick.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Thirty years after the war,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>her mother stashed paper bags with sliced, dried bread&nbsp;</p>
        <p>on top shelves in her Warsaw kitchen.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Twenty, thirty bags… enough food for a month.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>Don’t ever throw any bread away</em>, her mother said.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>Remember, war is hunger.&nbsp;</em>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;<br><br><strong>The Relationship Between Math and Music&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>There are studies that show a correlation between how learning a musical instrument might benefit students struggling to keep up with their peers. <strong>15 ……….</strong> By concentrating on the problem at hand (left brain) while playing the piano or violin (right brain), <strong>16……… </strong>Exactly how much students benefit may depend on the type of music they listen to and whether they choose to learn how to play instruments.<br>
<br>
<strong>Where Math and Music Meet in the Brain </strong></p>
        <p>Some research finds that music activates the same areas of the brain that subjects use while solving spatial-temporal reasoning problems. Based on extensive research and knowledge that certain types and frequencies of sound are processed by the two hemispheres of the brain differently, using specific music and sounds may help to stimulate one hemisphere more than the other and possibly create more balance in the brain. <strong>17 ……….</strong> As recently as 2012, one study showed that listening to music during a math test could improve performance by 40 percent.<br>
<br>
<strong>Listening to Music May Improve Math Skills and Cognition</strong></p>
        <p>A considerable amount of research suggests that listening to music may improve cognitive skills. More recent studies show that the Mozart Effect, as it is known, has very little to do with listening to Mozart and more to do with listening to music that activates a certain portion of the brain. <strong>18 ……….</strong> Over the years, Dr. Robert Melillo has worked with a composer to develop a line of music that specifically addresses strengthening each hemisphere.<br>
<br>
<strong>Performing Music Teaches Valuable Lessons to Students </strong></p>
        <p>While listening to enjoyable music may improve cognition and math skills, performing music offers more advantages. Learning music improves math skills because, at some level, all music is math. <strong>19 ……….</strong> Performing music, therefore, reinforces parts of the brain used when doing math. Studies even show that children who play instruments are able to complete complex mathematical problems better than peers who do not play instruments.</p>
        <p>Students who commit themselves to learning an instrument may also learn other skills that help them perform better in school. It takes a considerable amount of patience to practice scales, <strong>20 ………. </strong>Fine motor skills are also improved by playing musical instruments.</p>
        <p>Taking time to appreciate music is a reward on its own. For the teachers and parents trying to help children succeed, that time could also improve math and academic skills.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;<br><br><strong>The Relationship Between Math and Music&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>There are studies that show a correlation between how learning a musical instrument might benefit students struggling to keep up with their peers. <strong>15 ……….</strong> By concentrating on the problem at hand (left brain) while playing the piano or violin (right brain), <strong>16……… </strong>Exactly how much students benefit may depend on the type of music they listen to and whether they choose to learn how to play instruments.<br>
<br>
<strong>Where Math and Music Meet in the Brain </strong></p>
        <p>Some research finds that music activates the same areas of the brain that subjects use while solving spatial-temporal reasoning problems. Based on extensive research and knowledge that certain types and frequencies of sound are processed by the two hemispheres of the brain differently, using specific music and sounds may help to stimulate one hemisphere more than the other and possibly create more balance in the brain. <strong>17 ……….</strong> As recently as 2012, one study showed that listening to music during a math test could improve performance by 40 percent.<br>
<br>
<strong>Listening to Music May Improve Math Skills and Cognition</strong></p>
        <p>A considerable amount of research suggests that listening to music may improve cognitive skills. More recent studies show that the Mozart Effect, as it is known, has very little to do with listening to Mozart and more to do with listening to music that activates a certain portion of the brain. <strong>18 ……….</strong> Over the years, Dr. Robert Melillo has worked with a composer to develop a line of music that specifically addresses strengthening each hemisphere.<br>
<br>
<strong>Performing Music Teaches Valuable Lessons to Students </strong></p>
        <p>While listening to enjoyable music may improve cognition and math skills, performing music offers more advantages. Learning music improves math skills because, at some level, all music is math. <strong>19 ……….</strong> Performing music, therefore, reinforces parts of the brain used when doing math. Studies even show that children who play instruments are able to complete complex mathematical problems better than peers who do not play instruments.</p>
        <p>Students who commit themselves to learning an instrument may also learn other skills that help them perform better in school. It takes a considerable amount of patience to practice scales, <strong>20 ………. </strong>Fine motor skills are also improved by playing musical instruments.</p>
        <p>Taking time to appreciate music is a reward on its own. For the teachers and parents trying to help children succeed, that time could also improve math and academic skills.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;<br><br><strong>The Relationship Between Math and Music&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>There are studies that show a correlation between how learning a musical instrument might benefit students struggling to keep up with their peers. <strong>15 ……….</strong> By concentrating on the problem at hand (left brain) while playing the piano or violin (right brain), <strong>16……… </strong>Exactly how much students benefit may depend on the type of music they listen to and whether they choose to learn how to play instruments.<br>
<br>
<strong>Where Math and Music Meet in the Brain </strong></p>
        <p>Some research finds that music activates the same areas of the brain that subjects use while solving spatial-temporal reasoning problems. Based on extensive research and knowledge that certain types and frequencies of sound are processed by the two hemispheres of the brain differently, using specific music and sounds may help to stimulate one hemisphere more than the other and possibly create more balance in the brain. <strong>17 ……….</strong> As recently as 2012, one study showed that listening to music during a math test could improve performance by 40 percent.<br>
<br>
<strong>Listening to Music May Improve Math Skills and Cognition</strong></p>
        <p>A considerable amount of research suggests that listening to music may improve cognitive skills. More recent studies show that the Mozart Effect, as it is known, has very little to do with listening to Mozart and more to do with listening to music that activates a certain portion of the brain. <strong>18 ……….</strong> Over the years, Dr. Robert Melillo has worked with a composer to develop a line of music that specifically addresses strengthening each hemisphere.<br>
<br>
<strong>Performing Music Teaches Valuable Lessons to Students </strong></p>
        <p>While listening to enjoyable music may improve cognition and math skills, performing music offers more advantages. Learning music improves math skills because, at some level, all music is math. <strong>19 ……….</strong> Performing music, therefore, reinforces parts of the brain used when doing math. Studies even show that children who play instruments are able to complete complex mathematical problems better than peers who do not play instruments.</p>
        <p>Students who commit themselves to learning an instrument may also learn other skills that help them perform better in school. It takes a considerable amount of patience to practice scales, <strong>20 ………. </strong>Fine motor skills are also improved by playing musical instruments.</p>
        <p>Taking time to appreciate music is a reward on its own. For the teachers and parents trying to help children succeed, that time could also improve math and academic skills.</p>

        <p>Taking time to appreciate music is a reward on its own. For the teachers and parents trying to help children succeed, that time could also improve math and academic skills.</p>

Sponsorships are when companies willingly pay influencers to get their brands in front of their audience. Sponsorships are one of the most popular methods by which podcasters make money. However, getting sponsorships can take time. Moreover, you must also keep in mind that the income of the money you make from sponsors or others is often used to create the podcast. For instance, if you earn $10,000 from a sponsor, you may need to invest $5000 into creating another episode for your podcast. Essentially, you will only be keeping the remaining $5000 with you as your income. Various podcast advertising networks can help garner new sponsors.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
A lot of podcasters fund their shows out of their own pockets, and some of them turn to their listeners for help. It’s not uncommon for podcasters to set up GoFundMe, Patreon, or Kickstarter accounts to collect donations for their podcasts. Podcasters lead their listeners to crowdfunding websites or ask them to donate directly via other means. For instance, Elecia White and Christopher White turned to Patreon for raising funds to provide their guests with microphones for their podcast Embedded.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
While some podcasters choose to fund themselves via sponsors, others prefer the affiliate route. With affiliate links, a podcaster earns a cut of the money that their listeners pay for a brand or service via the podcast, usually by clicking a link. For example, a podcaster could offer listeners a 10% off discount code when using SkillShare. The podcaster will then earn a share of the money that those who used the specific code pay SkillShare.com. Podcasters usually create show notes for their listeners who may include links to the products or services mentioned in the episode.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
A lot of podcasters have discovered that fans are willing to invest in merchandise to support and promote their favourite podcast. Therefore, a lot of podcasters offer branded merchandise on their website. These can be anything from t-shirts to gift certificates. There are various websites that can be used to distribute these products. Alternatively, podcasters can also buy a product-specific domain name and design a website and a web store from scratch.<br>

Podcasters usually create show notes for their listeners who may include links to the products or services mentioned in the episode.<br>

Sponsorships are when companies willingly pay influencers to get their brands in front of their audience. Sponsorships are one of the most popular methods by which podcasters make money. However, getting sponsorships can take time. Moreover, you must also keep in mind that the income of the money you make from sponsors or others is often used to create the podcast. For instance, if you earn $10,000 from a sponsor, you may need to invest $5000 into creating another episode for your podcast. Essentially, you will only be keeping the remaining $5000 with you as your income. Various podcast advertising networks can help garner new sponsors.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
A lot of podcasters fund their shows out of their own pockets, and some of them turn to their listeners for help. It’s not uncommon for podcasters to set up GoFundMe, Patreon, or Kickstarter accounts to collect donations for their podcasts. Podcasters lead their listeners to crowdfunding websites or ask them to donate directly via other means. For instance, Elecia White and Christopher White turned to Patreon for raising funds to provide their guests with microphones for their podcast Embedded.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
While some podcasters choose to fund themselves via sponsors, others prefer the affiliate route. With affiliate links, a podcaster earns a cut of the money that their listeners pay for a brand or service via the podcast, usually by clicking a link. For example, a podcaster could offer listeners a 10% off discount code when using SkillShare. The podcaster will then earn a share of the money that those who used the specific code pay SkillShare.com.
