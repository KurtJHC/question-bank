          <strong>The Osage Firebird</strong>
          <br>
          <em>By Sudipta Bardhan</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; As a child, Betty Marie Tallchief listened for hours to her grandmother’s stories of fire spirits and animals that could talk. Much of what Betty Marie knew about her Osage heritage came from Grandmother Tall Chief. She never forgot the tales, or the pride, that she learned at her grandmother’s feet.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp;&nbsp; Born in 1925, Betty Marie spent part of her childhood on an Osage <span class="txt-underline">reservation</span> in Oklahoma. She saw herself as “a typical Indian girl-shy, docile, introverted.” Ballet brought her out of her shell. She took her first ballet lesson when she was four years old. From that moment, Betty Marie had her heart set on becoming a ballerina.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Talent Isn’t Enough</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Betty Marie soon became a local star, performing at rodeos and county fairs. Her natural talent made it easy for her to learn everything taught by her hometown dance instructor. But Betty Marie soon learned that having talent wasn't enough to make her a success. There was always more work to do.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;One instructor said that despite her talent, she hadn't properly learned the basics. “He insisted we go back to the beginning,” she explained. At first, Betty Marie was frustrated by this criticism. But she soon realized that no matter how well she danced, she could always do better.</p>

          <strong>Facing Prejudice</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Betty Marie's skills grew and grew. People in the world of dancing considered her special. But outside that World, Sometimes she encountered prejudice. When the Tallchief family moved from the reservation to California, Betty Marie was teased because she was a Native American.</p>
        <p>“At Beverly Vista School I was made to feel different,” she remembers. “Some of the students made fun of my last name. A few made war whoops whenever they saw me, and asked why I didn't wear feathers.” Though being singled out because of her race bothered Betty Marie, the teasing did not lessen her pride in being an Osage Indian. She would still announce<br>
her name to new classmates with pleasure-Tallchief.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>What's in a Name?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Later in her career as a ballerina, Tallchief did change her first name. She began using the name Maria instead of Betty Marie. She thought it sounded more sophisticated. Since most professional ballerinas at the time were white and European, she might have chosen to change her last name as well. A European last name would have seemed more traditional and might have helped her career. But Tallchief refused to deny her heritage. Nothing would ever make her change her last name.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Woman of Two Worlds</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Maria Tallchief went on to do great things as a dancer. She became prima ballerina of the New York City Ballet. She was the first American in a century to dance for the Paris Opera Ballet. In 1953, President Eisenhower honored Tallchief, naming her “Woman of the Year.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;That same year, the state of Oklahoma declared June 29 “Maria Tallchief Day.” She was given a special title by the Osage tribe. Grandmother Tall Chief chose the title, naming Betty Marie <em>Wa-Xth-Thonba</em>, which means “woman of two worlds.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Tallchief was touched by this recognition. She knew what her grandmother was saying when she chose that title. “While I was a ballerina with an important career on the stage, I was also her grandchild, an Osage woman and a daughter of the tribe.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In her long career, Tallchief's most famous performance was in The Firebird. Based on a Russian folktale, this ballet tells the story of a strange creature that is half woman and half bird. Those who watched her perform said that Tallchief had achieved the unbelievable-she had truly become a bird of fire. As she danced, Tallchief must have remembered her grandmother's voice recounting the Osage legends of fire spirits walking the earth. Performing <em>The Firebird</em>, Tallchief combined her heritage with the ballet, and truly became a woman of two worlds.</p>

          <strong>The Osage Firebird</strong>
          <br>
          <em>By Sudipta Bardhan</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; As a child, Betty Marie Tallchief listened for hours to her grandmother’s stories of fire spirits and animals that could talk. Much of what Betty Marie knew about her Osage heritage came from Grandmother Tall Chief. She never forgot the tales, or the pride, that she learned at her grandmother’s feet.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp;&nbsp; Born in 1925, Betty Marie spent part of her childhood on an Osage <span class="txt-underline">reservation</span> in Oklahoma. She saw herself as “a typical Indian girl-shy, docile, introverted.” Ballet brought her out of her shell. She took her first ballet lesson when she was four years old. From that moment, Betty Marie had her heart set on becoming a ballerina.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Talent Isn’t Enough</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Betty Marie soon became a local star, performing at rodeos and county fairs. Her natural talent made it easy for her to learn everything taught by her hometown dance instructor. But Betty Marie soon learned that having talent wasn't enough to make her a success. There was always more work to do.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;One instructor said that despite her talent, she hadn't properly learned the basics. “He insisted we go back to the beginning,” she explained. At first, Betty Marie was frustrated by this criticism. But she soon realized that no matter how well she danced, she could always do better.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Facing Prejudice</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Betty Marie's skills grew and grew. People in the world of dancing considered her special. But outside that World, Sometimes she encountered prejudice. When the Tallchief family moved from the reservation to California, Betty Marie was teased because she was a Native American.</p>
        <p>“At Beverly Vista School I was made to feel different,” she remembers. “Some of the students made fun of my last name. A few made war whoops whenever they saw me, and asked why I didn't wear feathers.” Though being singled out because of her race bothered Betty Marie, the teasing did not lessen her pride in being an Osage Indian. She would still announce<br>
her name to new classmates with pleasure-Tallchief.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>What's in a Name?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Later in her career as a ballerina, Tallchief did change her first name. She began using the name Maria instead of Betty Marie. She thought it sounded more sophisticated. Since most professional ballerinas at the time were white and European, she might have chosen to change her last name as well. A European last name would have seemed more traditional and might have helped her career. But Tallchief refused to deny her heritage. Nothing would ever make her change her last name.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Woman of Two Worlds</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Maria Tallchief went on to do great things as a dancer. She became prima ballerina of the New York City Ballet. She was the first American in a century to dance for the Paris Opera Ballet. In 1953, President Eisenhower honored Tallchief, naming her “Woman of the Year.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;That same year, the state of Oklahoma declared June 29 “Maria Tallchief Day.” She was given a special title by the Osage tribe. Grandmother Tall Chief chose the title, naming Betty Marie <em>Wa-Xth-Thonba</em>, which means “woman of two worlds.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Tallchief was touched by this recognition. She knew what her grandmother was saying when she chose that title. “While I was a ballerina with an important career on the stage, I was also her grandchild, an Osage woman and a daughter of the tribe.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In her long career, Tallchief's most famous performance was in The Firebird. Based on a Russian folktale, this ballet tells the story of a strange creature that is half woman and half bird. Those who watched her perform said that Tallchief had achieved the unbelievable-she had truly become a bird of fire. As she danced, Tallchief must have remembered her grandmother's voice recounting the Osage legends of fire spirits walking the earth. Performing <em>The Firebird</em>, Tallchief combined her heritage with the ballet, and truly became a woman of two worlds.</p>

          <strong>The Osage Firebird</strong>
          <br>
          <em>By Sudipta Bardhan</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; As a child, Betty Marie Tallchief listened for hours to her grandmother’s stories of fire spirits and animals that could talk. Much of what Betty Marie knew about her Osage heritage came from Grandmother Tall Chief. She never forgot the tales, or the pride, that she learned at her grandmother’s feet.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp;&nbsp; Born in 1925, Betty Marie spent part of her childhood on an Osage <span class="txt-underline">reservation</span> in Oklahoma. She saw herself as “a typical Indian girl-shy, docile, introverted.” Ballet brought her out of her shell. She took her first ballet lesson when she was four years old. From that moment, Betty Marie had her heart set on becoming a ballerina.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Talent Isn’t Enough</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Betty Marie soon became a local star, performing at rodeos and county fairs. Her natural talent made it easy for her to learn everything taught by her hometown dance instructor. But Betty Marie soon learned that having talent wasn't enough to make her a success. There was always more work to do.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;One instructor said that despite her talent, she hadn't properly learned the basics. “He insisted we go back to the beginning,” she explained. At first, Betty Marie was frustrated by this criticism. But she soon realized that no matter how well she danced, she could always do better.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Facing Prejudice</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Betty Marie's skills grew and grew. People in the world of dancing considered her special. But outside that World, Sometimes she encountered prejudice. When the Tallchief family moved from the reservation to California, Betty Marie was teased because she was a Native American.</p>
        <p>“At Beverly Vista School I was made to feel different,” she remembers. “Some of the students made fun of my last name. A few made war whoops whenever they saw me, and asked why I didn't wear feathers.” Though being singled out because of her race bothered Betty Marie, the teasing did not lessen her pride in being an Osage Indian. She would still announce<br>
her name to new classmates with pleasure-Tallchief.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>What's in a Name?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Later in her career as a ballerina, Tallchief did change her first name. She began using the name Maria instead of Betty Marie. She thought it sounded more sophisticated. Since most professional ballerinas at the time were white and European, she might have chosen to change her last name as well. A European last name would have seemed more traditional and might have helped her career. But Tallchief refused to deny her heritage. Nothing would ever make her change her last name.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Woman of Two Worlds</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Maria Tallchief went on to do great things as a dancer. She became prima ballerina of the New York City Ballet. She was the first American in a century to dance for the Paris Opera Ballet. In 1953, President Eisenhower honored Tallchief, naming her “Woman of the Year.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;That same year, the state of Oklahoma declared June 29 “Maria Tallchief Day.” She was given a special title by the Osage tribe. Grandmother Tall Chief chose the title, naming Betty Marie <em>Wa-Xth-Thonba</em>, which means “woman of two worlds.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Tallchief was touched by this recognition. She knew what her grandmother was saying when she chose that title. “While I was a ballerina with an important career on the stage, I was also her grandchild, an Osage woman and a daughter of the tribe.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In her long career, Tallchief's most famous performance was in The Firebird. Based on a Russian folktale, this ballet tells the story of a strange creature that is half woman and half bird. Those who watched her perform said that Tallchief had achieved the unbelievable-she had truly become a bird of fire. As she danced, Tallchief must have remembered her grandmother's voice recounting the Osage legends of fire spirits walking the earth. Performing <em>The Firebird</em>, Tallchief combined her heritage with the ballet, and truly became a woman of two worlds.</p>
