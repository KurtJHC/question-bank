Parramatta is a major commercial suburb and centre in Greater Western Sydney, located in the state of New South Wales, Australia. It is located approximately 24 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district on the banks of the Parramatta River. Parramatta is the administrative seat of the local government area of the City of Parramatta and is often regarded as the main commercial centre and the central business district for the broader Greater Western Sydney region. Parramatta also has a long history as a second administrative centre in the Sydney metropolitan region, playing host to a number of state government departments as well as a registry for federal courts.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}&nbsp;<br>
Radiocarbon dating suggests human activity occurred in Parramatta from around 30,000 years ago. The Darug people who lived in the area before European settlement regarded the area as rich in food from the river and forests. They called the area Baramada or Burramatta ('Parramatta') which means "head of waters", "the place where the eels lie down" or "eel waters". To this day many eels and other sea creatures are attracted to nutrients that are concentrated where the saltwater of Port Jackson meets the freshwater of the Parramatta River. The Parramatta Eels Rugby League club chose their symbol as a result of this phenomenon.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}&nbsp;<br>
Parramatta was founded in 1788, the same year as Sydney. As such, Parramatta is the second oldest city in Australia, being only 10 months younger than Sydney. The British Colonists, who had arrived in January 1788 on the First Fleet at Sydney Cove, had only enough food to support themselves for a short time and the soil around Sydney Cove proved too poor to grow the amount of food that 1,000 convicts, soldiers and administrators needed to survive. During 1788, Governor Arthur Phillip had reconnoitred several places before choosing Parramatta as the most likely place for a successful large farm. Parramatta was the furthest navigable point inland on the Parramatta River (i.e. furthest from the thin, sandy coastal soil) and also the point at which the river became freshwater and therefore useful for farming.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}&nbsp;<br>
In an attempt to deal with the food crisis, Phillip in 1789 granted a convict named James Ruse the land of Experiment Farm at Parramatta on the condition that he develop a viable agriculture. There, Ruse became the first person to successfully grow grain in Australia. The Parramatta area was also the site of the pioneering of the Australian wool industry by John Macarthur's Elizabeth Farm in the 1790s. Philip Gidley King's account of his visit to Parramatta on 9 April 1790 is one of the earliest descriptions of the area. Walking four miles with Governor Phillip to Prospect, he saw undulating grassland interspersed with magnificent trees and a great number of kangaroos and emus.<br>

        <p>
          <strong>Heidi</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Johanna Spyri&nbsp;</em><br><br>
From the old and pleasantly situated village of Mayenfeld, a footpath winds through green and shady meadows to the foot of the mountains, which on this side look down from their stern and lofty heights upon the valley below. The land grows gradually wilder as the path ascends, and the climber has not gone far before he begins to inhale the fragrance of the short grass and sturdy mountain-plants, for the way is steep and leads directly up to the summits above.</p>
        <p>On a clear sunny morning in June, two figures might be seen climbing the narrow mountain path; one, a tall strong-looking girl, the other a child whom she was leading by the hand, and whose little cheeks were so aglow with heat that the crimson colour could be seen even through the dark, sunburnt skin. And this was hardly to be wondered at, for in spite of the hot June sun, the child was clothed as if to keep off the bitterest frost. She did not look more than five years old, if as much, but what her natural figure was like, it would have been hard to say, for she had apparently two, if not three dresses, one above the other, and over these a thick red woollen shawl wound round about her, so that the little body presented a shapeless appearance, as, with its small feet shod in thick, nailed mountain-shoes, it slowly and laboriously plodded its way up in the heat. The two must have left the valley a good hour's walk behind them, when they came to the hamlet known as Dorfli, which is situated half-way up the mountain. Here the wayfarers met with greetings from all sides, some calling to them from windows, some from open doors, others from outside, for the elder girl was now in her old home. She did not, however, pause in her walk to respond to her friends' welcoming cries and questions, but passed on without stopping for a moment until she reached the last of the scattered houses of the hamlet. Here a voice called to her from the door: "Wait a moment, Dete; if you are going up higher, I will come with you."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The girl thus addressed stood still, and the child immediately let go her hand and seated herself on the ground.</p>
        <p>"Are you tired, Heidi?" asked her companion.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"No, I am hot," answered the child.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"We shall soon get to the top now. You must walk bravely on a little longer, and take good long steps, and in another hour, we shall be there," said Dete in an encouraging voice.</p>
        <p>They were now joined by a stout, good-natured-looking woman, who walked on ahead with her old acquaintance, the two breaking forth at once into lively conversation about everybody and everything in Dorfli and its surroundings, while the child wandered behind&nbsp;them.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"And where are you off to with the child?" asked the one who had just joined the party. "I suppose it is the child your sister left?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Yes," answered Dete. "I am taking her up to Uncle, where she must stay."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"The child stay up there with Alm-Uncle! You must be out of your senses, Dete! How can you think of such a thing! The old man, however, will soon send you and your proposal packing off home again!"</p>
        <p>"He cannot very well do that, seeing that he is her grandfather. He must do something for her. I have had the charge of the child till now, and I can tell you, Barbel, I am not going to give up the chance which has just fallen to me of getting a good place, for her sake. It is for the grandfather now to do his duty by her."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;…&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"I am glad I am not the child!" exclaimed Barbel, with a gesture of horrified pity. "Not a creature knows anything about the old man up there! He will have nothing to do with anybody, and never sets his foot inside a church from one year's end to another. When he does come down once in a while, everybody clears out of the way of him and his big stick. The mere sight of him, with his bushy grey eyebrows and his immense beard, is alarming enough. He looks like any old heathen or Indian, and few would care to meet him alone."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Well, and what of that?" said Dete, in a defiant voice, "he is the grandfather all the same, and must look after the child. He is not likely to do her any harm, and if he does, he will be answerable for it, not I."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"I should very much like to know," continued Barbel, in an inquiring tone of voice, "what the old man has on his conscience that he looks as he does, and lives up there on the mountain like a hermit, hardly ever allowing himself to be seen. All kinds of things are said about him. You, Dete, however, must certainly have learnt a good deal concerning him from your sister--am I not right?"</p>
        <p>"You are right, I did, but I am not going to repeat what I heard; if it should come to his ears I should get into trouble about it."</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Heidi</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Johanna Spyri&nbsp;</em><br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>From the old and pleasantly situated village of Mayenfeld, a footpath winds through green and shady meadows to the foot of the mountains, which on this side look down from their stern and lofty heights upon the valley below. The land grows gradually wilder as the path ascends, and the climber has not gone far before he begins to inhale the fragrance of the short grass and sturdy mountain-plants, for the way is steep and leads directly up to the summits above.</p>
        <p>On a clear sunny morning in June, two figures might be seen climbing the narrow mountain path; one, a tall strong-looking girl, the other a child whom she was leading by the hand, and whose little cheeks were so aglow with heat that the crimson colour could be seen even through the dark, sunburnt skin. And this was hardly to be wondered at, for in spite of the hot June sun, the child was clothed as if to keep off the bitterest frost. She did not look more than five years old, if as much, but what her natural figure was like, it would have been hard to say, for she had apparently two, if not three dresses, one above the other, and over these a thick red woollen shawl wound round about her, so that the little body presented a shapeless appearance, as, with its small feet shod in thick, nailed mountain-shoes, it slowly and laboriously plodded its way up in the heat. The two must have left the valley a good hour's walk behind them, when they came to the hamlet known as Dorfli, which is situated half-way up the mountain. Here the wayfarers met with greetings from all sides, some calling to them from windows, some from open doors, others from outside, for the elder girl was now in her old home. She did not, however, pause in her walk to respond to her friends' welcoming cries and questions, but passed on without stopping for a moment until she reached the last of the scattered houses of the hamlet. Here a voice called to her from the door: "Wait a moment, Dete; if you are going up higher, I will come with you."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The girl thus addressed stood still, and the child immediately let go her hand and seated herself on the ground.</p>
        <p>"Are you tired, Heidi?" asked her companion.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"No, I am hot," answered the child.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"We shall soon get to the top now. You must walk bravely on a little longer, and take good long steps, and in another hour, we shall be there," said Dete in an encouraging voice.</p>
        <p>They were now joined by a stout, good-natured-looking woman, who walked on ahead with her old acquaintance, the two breaking forth at once into lively conversation about everybody and everything in Dorfli and its surroundings, while the child wandered behind&nbsp;them.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"And where are you off to with the child?" asked the one who had just joined the party. "I suppose it is the child your sister left?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Yes," answered Dete. "I am taking her up to Uncle, where she must stay."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"The child stay up there with Alm-Uncle! You must be out of your senses, Dete! How can you think of such a thing! The old man, however, will soon send you and your proposal packing off home again!"</p>
        <p>"He cannot very well do that, seeing that he is her grandfather. He must do something for her. I have had the charge of the child till now, and I can tell you, Barbel, I am not going to give up the chance which has just fallen to me of getting a good place, for her sake. It is for the grandfather now to do his duty by her."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;…&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"I am glad I am not the child!" exclaimed Barbel, with a gesture of horrified pity. "Not a creature knows anything about the old man up there! He will have nothing to do with anybody, and never sets his foot inside a church from one year's end to another. When he does come down once in a while, everybody clears out of the way of him and his big stick. The mere sight of him, with his bushy grey eyebrows and his immense beard, is alarming enough. He looks like any old heathen or Indian, and few would care to meet him alone."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Well, and what of that?" said Dete, in a defiant voice, "he is the grandfather all the same, and must look after the child. He is not likely to do her any harm, and if he does, he will be answerable for it, not I."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"I should very much like to know," continued Barbel, in an inquiring tone of voice, "what the old man has on his conscience that he looks as he does, and lives up there on the mountain like a hermit, hardly ever allowing himself to be seen. All kinds of things are said about him. You, Dete, however, must certainly have learnt a good deal concerning him from your sister--am I not right?"</p>
        <p>"You are right, I did, but I am not going to repeat what I heard; if it should come to his ears I should get into trouble about it."</p>

          <strong>Heidi</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Johanna Spyri&nbsp;</em><br>

        <p>From the old and pleasantly situated village of Mayenfeld, a footpath winds through green and shady meadows to the foot of the mountains, which on this side look down from their stern and lofty heights upon the valley below. The land grows gradually wilder as the path ascends, and the climber has not gone far before he begins to inhale the fragrance of the short grass and sturdy mountain-plants, for the way is steep and leads directly up to the summits above.</p>
        <p>On a clear sunny morning in June, two figures might be seen climbing the narrow mountain path; one, a tall strong-looking girl, the other a child whom she was leading by the hand, and whose little cheeks were so aglow with heat that the crimson colour could be seen even through the dark, sunburnt skin. And this was hardly to be wondered at, for in spite of the hot June sun, the child was clothed as if to keep off the bitterest frost. She did not look more than five years old, if as much, but what her natural figure was like, it would have been hard to say, for she had apparently two, if not three dresses, one above the other, and over these a thick red woollen shawl wound round about her, so that the little body presented a shapeless appearance, as, with its small feet shod in thick, nailed mountain-shoes, it slowly and laboriously plodded its way up in the heat.

        <p>
          <strong>Heidi</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Johanna Spyri&nbsp;</em><br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>From the old and pleasantly situated village of Mayenfeld, a footpath winds through green and shady meadows to the foot of the mountains, which on this side look down from their stern and lofty heights upon the valley below. The land grows gradually wilder as the path ascends, and the climber has not gone far before he begins to inhale the fragrance of the short grass and sturdy mountain-plants, for the way is steep and leads directly up to the summits above.</p>
        <p>On a clear sunny morning in June, two figures might be seen climbing the narrow mountain path; one, a tall strong-looking girl, the other a child whom she was leading by the hand, and whose little cheeks were so aglow with heat that the crimson colour could be seen even through the dark, sunburnt skin. And this was hardly to be wondered at, for in spite of the hot June sun, the child was clothed as if to keep off the bitterest frost. She did not look more than five years old, if as much, but what her natural figure was like, it would have been hard to say, for she had apparently two, if not three dresses, one above the other, and over these a thick red woollen shawl wound round about her, so that the little body presented a shapeless appearance, as, with its small feet shod in thick, nailed mountain-shoes, it slowly and laboriously plodded its way up in the heat. The two must have left the valley a good hour's walk behind them, when they came to the hamlet known as Dorfli, which is situated half-way up the mountain. Here the wayfarers met with greetings from all sides, some calling to them from windows, some from open doors, others from outside, for the elder girl was now in her old home. She did not, however, pause in her walk to respond to her friends' welcoming cries and questions, but passed on without stopping for a moment until she reached the last of the scattered houses of the hamlet. Here a voice called to her from the door: "Wait a moment, Dete; if you are going up higher, I will come with you."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The girl thus addressed stood still, and the child immediately let go her hand and seated herself on the ground.</p>
        <p>"Are you tired, Heidi?" asked her companion.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"No, I am hot," answered the child.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"We shall soon get to the top now. You must walk bravely on a little longer, and take good long steps, and in another hour, we shall be there," said Dete in an encouraging voice.</p>
        <p>They were now joined by a stout, good-natured-looking woman, who walked on ahead with her old acquaintance, the two breaking forth at once into lively conversation about everybody and everything in Dorfli and its surroundings, while the child wandered behind&nbsp;them.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"And where are you off to with the child?" asked the one who had just joined the party. "I suppose it is the child your sister left?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Yes," answered Dete. "I am taking her up to Uncle, where she must stay."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"The child stay up there with Alm-Uncle! You must be out of your senses, Dete! How can you think of such a thing! The old man, however, will soon send you and your proposal packing off home again!"</p>
        <p>"He cannot very well do that, seeing that he is her grandfather. He must do something for her. I have had the charge of the child till now, and I can tell you, Barbel, I am not going to give up the chance which has just fallen to me of getting a good place, for her sake. It is for the grandfather now to do his duty by her."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;…&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"I am glad I am not the child!" exclaimed Barbel, with a gesture of horrified pity. "Not a creature knows anything about the old man up there! He will have nothing to do with anybody, and never sets his foot inside a church from one year's end to another. When he does come down once in a while, everybody clears out of the way of him and his big stick. The mere sight of him, with his bushy grey eyebrows and his immense beard, is alarming enough. He looks like any old heathen or Indian, and few would care to meet him alone."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Well, and what of that?" said Dete, in a defiant voice, "he is the grandfather all the same, and must look after the child. He is not likely to do her any harm, and if he does, he will be answerable for it, not I."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"I should very much like to know," continued Barbel, in an inquiring tone of voice, "what the old man has on his conscience that he looks as he does, and lives up there on the mountain like a hermit, hardly ever allowing himself to be seen. All kinds of things are said about him. You, Dete, however, must certainly have learnt a good deal concerning him from your sister--am I not right?"</p>
        <p>"You are right, I did, but I am not going to repeat what I heard; if it should come to his ears I should get into trouble about it."</p>

          <strong>Heidi</strong>

Smiling is infectious,&nbsp;<br>
You catch it like the flu,&nbsp;<br>
When someone smiled at me today,&nbsp;<br>
I started smiling too.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I passed around the corner&nbsp;<br>
And someone saw my grin.&nbsp;<br>
When he smiled I realised&nbsp;<br>
I’d passed it on to him.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I thought about that smile,&nbsp;<br>
Then I realised its worth.&nbsp;<br>
A single smile, just like mine&nbsp;<br>
Could travel around the Earth.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
So, if you feel a smile begin,&nbsp;<br>
Don’t leave it undetected.&nbsp;<br>
Let’s start an epidemic quick,&nbsp;<br>
And get the world infected!</p>

A single smile, just like mine&nbsp;<br>
Could travel around the Earth.&nbsp;<br>

Don’t leave it undetected.&nbsp;<br>
Let’s start an epidemic quick,&nbsp;<br>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Book Review – Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</strong>&nbsp;<br><br>
The Philosopher’s Stone is the first in J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series of seven novels that have made her the most successful literary author of all time, selling in excess of 400 million copies world-wide. <strong>12 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>Do the Harry Potter books live up to the hype? When I first began reading the Philosopher’s Stone, I was immediately struck by how good - and laugh-out-loud funny - the humour was. <strong>13 ………. </strong>but Rowling has managed to infuse this book with a lovely wit and charm that will both amuse and delight adults and children.</p>
        <p>Here is an example, with the ending being particularly good:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>"Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large, pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes and thick, blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head.</em>
          <strong>14 ………. </strong>
          <em>– Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig."&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>There are characters in this book that will remind us of all the people we have met. <strong>15 ……….</strong> or a bossy and interfering (yet kind-hearted) girl like Hermione. A large number of the younger readers will also be able to easily identify with Harry, especially with his initial feelings of isolation and not belonging, and then through to his excitement at finally leaving that life behind in favour of one where he belongs and will be happy.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When Harry begins his first term at Hogwarts (a wizarding school) he is not alone in being overawed:</p>
        <p>
          <em>“‘Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight of Hogwarts in a sec,’ Hagrid called over his shoulder, ‘jus’ round this bend here.’ There was a loud ‘Oooooh!’&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>The narrow path had opened suddenly on to the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.”</em>
        </p>
        <p>Hogwarts is a truly magical place, not only in the most obvious way but also in all the detail that the author has gone to describe it so vibrantly. It is the place that everybody wishes they could have gone to when they were eleven. <strong>16 ……….</strong> The story builds towards an exciting conclusion that has the ultimate feel-good factor.</p>
        <p>J.K. Rowling should be commended for getting so many people reading and excited by books. The biggest surprise must be the effect that this novel had on the adult population, both male and female - at the time the books were published many a commuting train was spotted with Harry Potter books providing world-weary workers with a wonderful sense of escapism. <strong>17 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>Is all the hype about the Harry Potter books justified? In a word, yes, the books are a joy to read and possibly the most rewarding young adult’s book since The Hobbit.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Book Review – Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</strong>&nbsp;<br><br>
The Philosopher’s Stone is the first in J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series of seven novels that have made her the most successful literary author of all time, selling in excess of 400 million copies world-wide. <strong>12 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>Do the Harry Potter books live up to the hype? When I first began reading the Philosopher’s Stone, I was immediately struck by how good - and laugh-out-loud funny - the humour was. <strong>13 ………. </strong>but Rowling has managed to infuse this book with a lovely wit and charm that will both amuse and delight adults and children.</p>
        <p>Here is an example, with the ending being particularly good:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>"Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large, pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes and thick, blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head.</em>
          <strong>14 ………. </strong>
          <em>– Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig."&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>There are characters in this book that will remind us of all the people we have met. <strong>15 ……….</strong> or a bossy and interfering (yet kind-hearted) girl like Hermione. A large number of the younger readers will also be able to easily identify with Harry, especially with his initial feelings of isolation and not belonging, and then through to his excitement at finally leaving that life behind in favour of one where he belongs and will be happy.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When Harry begins his first term at Hogwarts (a wizarding school) he is not alone in being overawed:</p>
        <p>
          <em>“‘Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight of Hogwarts in a sec,’ Hagrid called over his shoulder, ‘jus’ round this bend here.’ There was a loud ‘Oooooh!’&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>The narrow path had opened suddenly on to the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.”</em>
        </p>
        <p>Hogwarts is a truly magical place, not only in the most obvious way but also in all the detail that the author has gone to describe it so vibrantly. It is the place that everybody wishes they could have gone to when they were eleven. <strong>16 ……….</strong> The story builds towards an exciting conclusion that has the ultimate feel-good factor.</p>
        <p>J.K. Rowling should be commended for getting so many people reading and excited by books. The biggest surprise must be the effect that this novel had on the adult population, both male and female - at the time the books were published many a commuting train was spotted with Harry Potter books providing world-weary workers with a wonderful sense of escapism. <strong>17 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>Is all the hype about the Harry Potter books justified? In a word, yes, the books are a joy to read and possibly the most rewarding young adult’s book since The Hobbit.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Book Review – Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</strong>&nbsp;<br><br>
The Philosopher’s Stone is the first in J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series of seven novels that have made her the most successful literary author of all time, selling in excess of 400 million copies world-wide. <strong>12 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>Do the Harry Potter books live up to the hype? When I first began reading the Philosopher’s Stone, I was immediately struck by how good - and laugh-out-loud funny - the humour was. <strong>13 ………. </strong>but Rowling has managed to infuse this book with a lovely wit and charm that will both amuse and delight adults and children.</p>
        <p>Here is an example, with the ending being particularly good:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>"Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large, pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes and thick, blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head.</em>
          <strong>14 ………. </strong>
          <em>– Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig."&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>There are characters in this book that will remind us of all the people we have met. <strong>15 ……….</strong> or a bossy and interfering (yet kind-hearted) girl like Hermione. A large number of the younger readers will also be able to easily identify with Harry, especially with his initial feelings of isolation and not belonging, and then through to his excitement at finally leaving that life behind in favour of one where he belongs and will be happy.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When Harry begins his first term at Hogwarts (a wizarding school) he is not alone in being overawed:</p>
        <p>
          <em>“‘Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight of Hogwarts in a sec,’ Hagrid called over his shoulder, ‘jus’ round this bend here.’ There was a loud ‘Oooooh!’&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>The narrow path had opened suddenly on to the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.”</em>
        </p>
        <p>Hogwarts is a truly magical place, not only in the most obvious way but also in all the detail that the author has gone to describe it so vibrantly. It is the place that everybody wishes they could have gone to when they were eleven. <strong>16 ……….</strong> The story builds towards an exciting conclusion that has the ultimate feel-good factor.</p>
        <p>J.K. Rowling should be commended for getting so many people reading and excited by books. The biggest surprise must be the effect that this novel had on the adult population, both male and female - at the time the books were published many a commuting train was spotted with Harry Potter books providing world-weary workers with a wonderful sense of escapism. <strong>17 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>Is all the hype about the Harry Potter books justified? In a word, yes, the books are a joy to read and possibly the most rewarding young adult’s book since The Hobbit.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Book Review – Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</strong>&nbsp;<br><br>
The Philosopher’s Stone is the first in J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series of seven novels that have made her the most successful literary author of all time, selling in excess of 400 million copies world-wide. <strong>12 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>Do the Harry Potter books live up to the hype? When I first began reading the Philosopher’s Stone, I was immediately struck by how good - and laugh-out-loud funny - the humour was. <strong>13 ………. </strong>but Rowling has managed to infuse this book with a lovely wit and charm that will both amuse and delight adults and children.</p>
        <p>Here is an example, with the ending being particularly good:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>"Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large, pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes and thick, blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head.</em>
          <strong>14 ………. </strong>
          <em>– Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig."&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>There are characters in this book that will remind us of all the people we have met. <strong>15 ……….</strong> or a bossy and interfering (yet kind-hearted) girl like Hermione. A large number of the younger readers will also be able to easily identify with Harry, especially with his initial feelings of isolation and not belonging, and then through to his excitement at finally leaving that life behind in favour of one where he belongs and will be happy.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When Harry begins his first term at Hogwarts (a wizarding school) he is not alone in being overawed:</p>
        <p>
          <em>“‘Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight of Hogwarts in a sec,’ Hagrid called over his shoulder, ‘jus’ round this bend here.’ There was a loud ‘Oooooh!’&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>The narrow path had opened suddenly on to the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.”</em>
        </p>
        <p>Hogwarts is a truly magical place, not only in the most obvious way but also in all the detail that the author has gone to describe it so vibrantly. It is the place that everybody wishes they could have gone to when they were eleven. <strong>16 ……….</strong> The story builds towards an exciting conclusion that has the ultimate feel-good factor.</p>
        <p>J.K. Rowling should be commended for getting so many people reading and excited by books. The biggest surprise must be the effect that this novel had on the adult population, both male and female - at the time the books were published many a commuting train was spotted with Harry Potter books providing world-weary workers with a wonderful sense of escapism. <strong>17 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>Is all the hype about the Harry Potter books justified? In a word, yes, the books are a joy to read and possibly the most rewarding young adult’s book since The Hobbit.</p>

The undeniable tried and true classic of flooring is undoubtedly timber flooring. Imparting a warm look to any home, and available in a wide range of widths and shades, there's a reason it’s one of the most popular choices on the market. "Wood floors add warmth," says Anne Plumb, general manager at Royal Oak Floors. "They're hypoallergenic, too."<br>
<br>
Wood floors come in either solid or engineered timber. "Solid timber is more prone to contraction and expansion than engineered boards," says Anne. "Engineered timber minimises movement as the timber is cross-laminated, then the grain is laid in different directions, so it doesn't contract or expand."<br>
<br>
Solid timber is traditionally laid over timber joists, but both solid and engineered boards can be nailed and glued to the substrate. Laying these boards over ply gives a smooth finish. "Some engineered boards can be laid as a 'floating' floor over a concrete slab," she adds. "This is often required in apartment blocks for acoustic reasons." Grade describes the appearance of knots and general look of the grain. "A board with no visible markings is considered A-grade, and at the other end of the scale is D-grade. Sometimes an A grade timber can be so perfect it looks like laminate, so the grade you choose comes down to personal preference."<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B&nbsp;</strong>^}<br>
Carpet is an ideal choice for those who love the cushion-y feel of plush carpet under your feet, with the added bonus that they're also fantastic for improving your home's acoustic performance and reducing noise pollution. "Soft and warm, carpet creates a luxurious feel," says Anthony Carter, national product manager of Carpet Court. "Synthetic [usually nylon] carpets are great for families with young children or pets," says Anthony. "They've become increasingly popular due to advances in fade and stain resistance."<br>
<br>
Wool carpets are pricier but are "worth the investment as they're exceptionally hardwearing." High-quality brands, such as Cavalier Bremworth, "Possess thicker, softer yarns and create a sense of luxury," says Anthony.<br>
<br>
Pile style is important when choosing your carpet, too. "A cut-twist pile gives a textured appearance and is perfect for high-traffic areas, such as hallways," says Anthony. "A plush pile is luxurious with a velvety appearance and great in bedrooms and living areas. It requires maintenance though, so is not ideal for young families. Textured pile and loop-pile carpets are made from uncut yarn. Strong and wear-resistant, they give a modern look."<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}
<p>Concrete flooring is a popular choice for contemporary homes, especially if you have the opportunity to build from scratch. Cool to the touch, concrete is available in an array of shades of grey and can be mixed with an aggregate stone to create a striking terrazzo- like look. "Get a contemporary look by using a matt sealer, or a classic terrazzo finish with a glossy seal," says David Lakes, director at Lochbuild. "Concrete floors are cost effective and extremely functional – concrete is about as hard-wearing as you can get," says David. "Maintenance is easy, but as with any other floors, clean up red wine spills as soon as possible – it will stain!"<br>
<br>
Concrete can be cold underfoot in winter so consider installing underfloor heating. "Putting a solar hydronic system in the slab will solve this, although this can be expensive." As it's almost impossible to put concrete floors into an existing home, 'Concreate' is a flooring panel manufactured to retrofit. "Concreate panels are installed like a timber floor or tile," says David. You will need a builder to pour a concrete floor. "They should use a laser level to check it as they go," says David. "Make sure it's covered for the rest of the build."<br>

The newer kids on the block, laminate and vinyl flooring has come a long way from their previous counterparts. From an acoustic perspective, they can perform better than timber flooring, and some types of vinyls are even fully waterproof. "High-quality laminates and vinyl have really authentic wood designs with natural surface textures," says national product manager at Quick-Step, Kendall Waller. "Cheaper than timber, they're also extremely durable." "Laminate flooring uses a wood-based panel overlaid with printed images," says Kendall. "This is impregnated with melamine to give durability and colour fastness." Vinyl flooring is PVC-based and available in rolls as well as flexible or rigid planks. "It's soft to walk on, very hard-wearing and completely waterproof," he says.<br>
<br>
Some new laminate floors have a waterproof surface that prevents water penetrating the joints. "These guarantee against water damage for up to 10 years and allow steam mops to be used." "Laminate panels click together over any flat surface and can be installed in a day with low costs. Flexible vinyl planks require specialised preparation and installation before they're glued to the subfloor. The rigid planks are installed like laminate floors and need a lot less sub floor preparation. Special high-density underlays provide a quieter, more solid floor to walk on," says Kendall.<br>

"High-quality laminates and vinyl have really authentic wood designs with natural surface textures," says national product manager at Quick-Step, Kendall Waller. "Cheaper than timber, they're also extremely durable." "Laminate flooring uses a wood-based panel overlaid with printed images," says Kendall. "This is impregnated with melamine to give durability and colour fastness." Vinyl flooring is PVC-based and available in rolls as well as flexible or rigid planks. "It's soft to walk on, very hard-wearing and completely waterproof," he says.<br>
<br>
Some new laminate floors have a waterproof surface that prevents water penetrating the joints. "These guarantee against water damage for up to 10 years and allow steam mops to be used." "Laminate panels click together over any flat surface and can be installed in a day with low costs. Flexible vinyl planks require specialised preparation and installation before they're glued to the subfloor. The rigid planks are installed like laminate floors and need a lot less sub floor preparation. Special high-density underlays provide a quieter, more solid floor to walk on," says Kendall.<br>

The undeniable tried and true classic of flooring is undoubtedly timber flooring. Imparting a warm look to any home, and available in a wide range of widths and shades, there's a reason it’s one of the most popular choices on the market. "Wood floors add warmth," says Anne Plumb, general manager at Royal Oak Floors. "They're hypoallergenic, too."<br>
<br>
Wood floors come in either solid or engineered timber. "Solid timber is more prone to contraction and expansion than engineered boards," says Anne. "Engineered timber minimises movement as the timber is cross-laminated, then the grain is laid in different directions, so it doesn't contract or expand."<br>
<br>
Solid timber is traditionally laid over timber joists, but both solid and engineered boards can be nailed and glued to the substrate. Laying these boards over ply gives a smooth finish. "Some engineered boards can be laid as a 'floating' floor over a concrete slab," she adds. "This is often required in apartment blocks for acoustic reasons." Grade describes the appearance of knots and general look of the grain. "A board with no visible markings is considered A-grade, and at the other end of the scale is D-grade. Sometimes an A grade timber can be so perfect it looks like laminate, so the grade you choose comes down to personal preference."<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Carpet is an ideal choice for those who love the cushion-y feel of plush carpet under your feet, with the added bonus that they're also fantastic for improving your home's acoustic performance and reducing noise pollution. "Soft and warm, carpet creates a luxurious feel," says Anthony Carter, national product manager of Carpet Court. "Synthetic [usually nylon] carpets are great for families with young children or pets," says Anthony. "They've become increasingly popular due to advances in fade and stain resistance."<br>
<br>
Wool carpets are pricier but are "worth the investment as they're exceptionally hardwearing." High-quality brands, such as Cavalier Bremworth, "Possess thicker, softer yarns and create a sense of luxury," says Anthony.<br>
<br>
Pile style is important when choosing your carpet, too. "A cut-twist pile gives a textured appearance and is perfect for high-traffic areas, such as hallways," says Anthony. "A plush pile is luxurious with a velvety appearance and great in bedrooms and living areas. It requires maintenance though, so is not ideal for young families. Textured pile and loop-pile carpets are made from uncut yarn. Strong and wear-resistant, they give a modern look."<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}
<p>Concrete flooring is a popular choice for contemporary homes, especially if you have the opportunity to build from scratch. Cool to the touch, concrete is available in an array of shades of grey and can be mixed with an aggregate stone to create a striking terrazzo- like look. "Get a contemporary look by using a matt sealer, or a classic terrazzo finish with a glossy seal," says David Lakes, director at Lochbuild. "Concrete floors are cost effective and extremely functional – concrete is about as hard-wearing as you can get," says David. "Maintenance is easy, but as with any other floors, clean up red wine spills as soon as possible – it will stain!"<br>
<br>
Concrete can be cold underfoot in winter so consider installing underfloor heating. "Putting a solar hydronic system in the slab will solve this, although this can be expensive." As it's almost impossible to put concrete floors into an existing home, 'Concreate' is a flooring panel manufactured to retrofit. "Concreate panels are installed like a timber floor or tile," says David. You will need a builder to pour a concrete floor. "They should use a laser level to check it as they go," says David. "Make sure it's covered for the rest of the build."<br>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>A World Without Email </strong><em>by Cal Newport&nbsp;</em><br><br>
On a Tuesday morning, just a couple of months into his new role, Acharya received an email from his CTO explaining that they had to temporarily shut down their office’s network due to a computer virus. “We all expected that this would be fixed in a couple of days,” Acharya told me when I later interviewed him about the incident. But this prediction proved wildly optimistic. The following week, an undersecretary of commerce convened a meeting. She explained that they suspected the virus infecting their network had come from a foreign power, and that Homeland Security was recommending that the network stay down while they traced the attack. Just to be safe, they were also going to destroy all the computers, laptops, printers— anything with a chip— in the office.</p>
        <p>One of the biggest impacts of this network shutdown was that the office lost the ability to send or receive emails. For security purposes, it was difficult for them to use personal email addresses to perform their government work, and bureaucratic hurdles kept them from setting up temporary accounts using other agencies’ networks. Acharya and his team were effectively cut off from the frenetic <span class="txt-underline"><strong>ping-pong</strong></span> of digital chatter that defines most highlevel work within the federal government. The blackout lasted six weeks. With a touch of gallows humour, they took to calling the fateful day when it all began “Dark Tuesday.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the sudden and unexpected loss of email made certain parts of Acharya’s work “quite hellish”. Because the rest of the government continued to rely heavily on this tool, he often worried about missing important meetings or requests. “There was an existing information pipeline,” he explained, “and I was out of the loop”. Another hardship was logistics. Acharya’s job required him to set up many meetings, and this task was substantially more annoying without the ability to coordinate over email.</p>
        <p>Perhaps less expected, however, was that Acharya’s work didn’t grind to a halt during these six weeks. He instead began to notice that he was actually getting better at his job. Lacking the ability to simply send a quick email when he had a question, he took to leaving his office to meet with people in person. Because these appointments were a pain to arrange, he scheduled longer blocks of time, allowing him to really get to know the people he was meeting and understand the nuances of their issues. As Acharya explained, these&nbsp;extended sessions proved “very valuable” for a new political appointee trying to learn the subtle dynamics of the federal government.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As I talked to Acharya about Dark Tuesday and its aftermath, it occurred to me that many of the hardships that made the blackout “hellish” seemed solvable. Acharya admitted, for example, that his concern about being out of the loop was largely alleviated by the simple habit of calling the White House each day to learn if there were any meetings he needed to know about. Presumably, a dedicated assistant or junior team member could handle this call. The other issue was the annoyance of scheduling meetings, but this could also be handled by an assistant or some sort of automated scheduling system. It seemed, in other words, that it might be possible to preserve the profound benefits of the email blackout while avoiding many of the accompanying annoyances. “What would you think of this way of working?” I asked after explaining my proposed fixes. The phone line went silent for a moment. I had pitched an idea so preposterous— permanently working without email— that Acharya’s mind had temporarily frozen.</p>
