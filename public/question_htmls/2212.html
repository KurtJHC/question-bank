When I was a child, I could spend all day at Shining Time Station, the fictive train depot with its own eponymous TV show, where Thomas the Tank Engine and all his plate-faced locomotive friends worked and lived. To my undeveloped brain, each episode seemed like a beautiful daydream, in which an orderly, magical, trance-inducing universe ticked on under bluebird skies. For company, there was the Conductor, voiced first by Ringo Starr and later by George Carlin, and then the trains: gentle blue Edward, moody green Henry, big strong Gordon, little red James, and, of course, Thomas, with his pointed eyebrows and perpetual smile. The show, which included segments that had first aired on a British show called “Thomas &amp; Friends,” began airing on PBS in 1989, and each episode opened with a Joe Cocker-ish theme song: “Reach for the steam, reach for the whistle, go where the railway runs/ Reach for the words, reach for the story, follow the rainbow sun.” I would hum along. Though “Shining Time Station” ended in the nineties, Thomas the Tank Engine shows have aired almost continuously since. “Thomas &amp; Friends” has gone on in some form for twenty seasons, two of which featured Alec Baldwin as the narrator.<br>

The steam engine was one of the most important inventions of the Industrial Revolution. Steam engines were used in all sorts of applications including factories, mines, locomotives, and steamboats. Steam engines use hot steam from boiling water to drive a piston (or pistons) back and forth. The movement of the piston was then used to power a machine or turn a wheel. To create the steam, most steam engines heated the water by burning coal. The steam engine helped to power the Industrial Revolution. Before steam power, most factories and mills were powered by water, wind, horse, or man. Water was a good source of power, but factories had to be located near a river. Both water and wind power could be unreliable as sometimes rivers could dry up during a drought or freeze during the winter and wind didn't always blow.<br>

Brought to contemporary fame through Wes Anderson’s movie Darjeeling Limited, you might be surprised to read that the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway steam train is not just a figment of his dazzling imagination. Quite on the contrary - the precipice-topping train is actually UNESCO-listed and has been operating in some form since the late 19th century. Affectionately nicknamed “toy train” by locals, the legendary train zigzags through the breathtaking scenery of cloud-topped valleys, undulating foothills and lush tea plantations so characteristic of the Eastern Himalayas and is sure to provide you with a mesmerizing and once-in-a-lifetime experience.<br>

The steam engine kickstarted a new era in transportation. It allowed passengers to travel in comfort and speed, with many amenities travelers have never seen before. Freight was easily transported across land, as the steam locomotive was extremely powerful, as even early steam engines could pull up to thirty cars. Before the advent of the steam locomotive the only option for travel was by horseback or maritime. For many, railways were much more convenient as they were easily accessible, and in most cases, quicker than maritime travel. When steam locomotives were first introduced, people around that time were in awe of its power and size, as in the early nineteenth century, there were not many machines with similar power and size. People began to catch on to the idea of the steam engine, and many railways were built throughout the world. The United States, seeking western expansion, built towns and businesses along the railway to ship their goods and travel. The steam locomotive did not just change transportation, it changed the way people lived.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>The Great Plague 1665 – the Black Death</strong>
        <p><em>by Ben Johnson</em><br><br><strong>(A)</strong>&nbsp; ………&nbsp; In two successive years of the 17th century London suffered two terrible disasters. In the spring and summer of 1665 an outbreak of Bubonic Plague spread from parish to parish until thousands had died and the huge pits dug to receive the bodies were full. In 1666 the Great Fire of London destroyed much of the centre of London, but also helped to kill off some of the black rats and fleas that carried the plague bacillus.</p>
        <p><strong>(B)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;………&nbsp; Bubonic Plague was known as the Black Death and had been known in England for centuries. The plague started in the East, possibly China, and quickly spread through Europe. The plague lasted in London until the late autumn when the colder weather helped kill off the fleas. The King, Charles II and his Court left London and fled to Oxford. Those people who could sent their families away from London during these months, but the poor had no recourse but to stay. In his diary, Samuel Pepys gives a vivid account of the empty streets in London, as all who could had left in an attempt to flee the pestilence.</p>
        <p><strong>(C)&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>………&nbsp; Whole communities were wiped out and corpses littered the streets as there was no one left to bury them. It began in London in the poor, overcrowded parish of St. Giles-in-the-Field. It started slowly at first but by May of 1665, 43 had died. In June, 6137 people died, in July, 17036 people and at its peak in August, 31159 people died. In all, 15% of the population perished during that terrible summer. It was a ghastly disease. The victim’s skin turned black in patches and inflamed glands or ‘buboes’ in the groin, combined with compulsive vomiting, swollen tongue and splitting headaches made it a horrible, agonizing killer. Incubation took a mere four to six days and when the plague appeared in a household, the house was sealed, thus condemning the whole family to death! These houses were distinguished by a painted red cross on the door and the words, ‘Lord have mercy on us’. At night the corpses were brought out in answer to the cry, ’Bring out your dead’, put in a cart and taken away to the plague pits. One called the Great Pit was at Aldgate in London and another at Finsbury Fields.</p>
        <p><strong>(D)&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>………&nbsp; It was believed that holding a posy of flowers to the nose kept away the plague and to this day judges are still given a nose-gay to carry on ceremonial occasions as a protection against the plague! A song about the plague is still sung by children. ‘Ring-a-ring of roses‘ describes in great detail the symptoms of the plague and ends with ‘All fall down’. The last word, ‘dead’, is omitted today.</p>
        <p><strong>(E)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;………&nbsp; The plague spread to many parts of England. York was one city badly affected. The plague victims were buried outside the city walls and it is said that they have never been disturbed since then, as a precaution against a resurgence of the dreaded plague. The grassy embankments below the city walls are the sites of these plague pits. In some towns and villages in England there are still the old market crosses which have a depression at the foot of the stone cross. This was filled with vinegar during times of plague as it was believed that vinegar would kill any germs on the coins and so contain the disease.</p>
        <p><strong>(F)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;………&nbsp; Over the centuries Bubonic Plague has broken out in Europe and the Far East. In 1900 there were outbreaks of plague in places as far apart as Portugal and Australia. Influenza seems to be the modern form of plague. At the end of World War One an influenza outbreak circled the world during 1918 – 1919. Within a year 20 million people had died world-wide.</p>

When I was a child, I could spend all day at Shining Time Station, the fictive train depot with its own eponymous TV show, where Thomas the Tank Engine and all his plate-faced locomotive friends worked and lived. To my undeveloped brain, each episode seemed like a beautiful daydream, in which an orderly, magical, trance-inducing universe ticked on under bluebird skies. For company, there was the Conductor, voiced first by Ringo Starr and later by George Carlin, and then the trains: gentle blue Edward, moody green Henry, big strong Gordon, little red James, and, of course, Thomas, with his pointed eyebrows and perpetual smile. The show, which included segments that had first aired on a British show called “Thomas &amp; Friends,” began airing on PBS in 1989, and each episode opened with a Joe Cocker-ish theme song: “Reach for the steam, reach for the whistle, go where the railway runs/ Reach for the words, reach for the story, follow the rainbow sun.” I would hum along. Though “Shining Time Station” ended in the nineties, Thomas the Tank Engine shows have aired almost continuously since. “Thomas &amp; Friends” has gone on in some form for twenty seasons, two of which featured Alec Baldwin as the narrator.<br>

The steam engine was one of the most important inventions of the Industrial Revolution. Steam engines were used in all sorts of applications including factories, mines, locomotives, and steamboats. Steam engines use hot steam from boiling water to drive a piston (or pistons) back and forth. The movement of the piston was then used to power a machine or turn a wheel. To create the steam, most steam engines heated the water by burning coal. The steam engine helped to power the Industrial Revolution. Before steam power, most factories and mills were powered by water, wind, horse, or man. Water was a good source of power, but factories had to be located near a river. Both water and wind power could be unreliable as sometimes rivers could dry up during a drought or freeze during the winter and wind didn't always blow.<br>

Brought to contemporary fame through Wes Anderson’s movie Darjeeling Limited, you might be surprised to read that the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway steam train is not just a figment of his dazzling imagination. Quite on the contrary - the precipice-topping train is actually UNESCO-listed and has been operating in some form since the late 19th century. Affectionately nicknamed “toy train” by locals, the legendary train zigzags through the breathtaking scenery of cloud-topped valleys, undulating foothills and lush tea plantations so characteristic of the Eastern Himalayas and is sure to provide you with a mesmerizing and once-in-a-lifetime experience.<br>

The steam engine kickstarted a new era in transportation. It allowed passengers to travel in comfort and speed, with many amenities travelers have never seen before. Freight was easily transported across land, as the steam locomotive was extremely powerful, as even early steam engines could pull up to thirty cars. Before the advent of the steam locomotive the only option for travel was by horseback or maritime. For many, railways were much more convenient as they were easily accessible, and in most cases, quicker than maritime travel. When steam locomotives were first introduced, people around that time were in awe of its power and size, as in the early nineteenth century, there were not many machines with similar power and size. People began to catch on to the idea of the steam engine, and many railways were built throughout the world. The United States, seeking western expansion, built towns and businesses along the railway to ship their goods and travel. The steam locomotive did not just change transportation, it changed the way people lived.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

        <p><strong>Read the text below. Six Sentances have been removed from this text so that there are six gaps.</strong><br><br><strong>Blackbeard: History of the Dreaded Pirate</strong><br><br><strong>(A)</strong>&nbsp; ……… He and other pirates plagued shipping lanes off North America and throughout the Caribbean in the early-eighteenth century: an era commonly referred to as the "Golden Age of Piracy." Despite his legendary reputation, little is known about the early life of Blackbeard. Even his true name is uncertain, though it is usually given as some variation of Edward Thatch or Teach. It is believed that he served as a privateer during Queen Anne's War (1701 - 1714),</p>
        <p><strong>(B)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;……… The earliest primary source document that mentions Blackbeard by name dates to the summer of 1717. Other records indicate that by the fall of 1717 Blackbeard was operating off Delaware and Chesapeake bays in conjunction with two other pirate captains, Benjamin Hornigold and Stede Bonnet. Blackbeard served an apprenticeship under Hornigold before becoming a pirate captain in his own right.</p>
        <p><strong>(C)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;……… Late in the fall of 1717, the pirates made their way to the eastern Caribbean. It was here, off the island of Martinique, that Blackbeard and his fellow pirates captured the French slaveship La Concorde -- a vessel he would keep as his flagship and rename Queen Anne's Revenge. After crossing the Atlantic during its third journey, and only 100 miles from Martinique, the French ship encountered Blackbeard and his company. According to a primary account, the pirates were aboard two sloops, one with 120 men and twelve cannon, and the other with thirty men and eight cannon. With the French crew already reduced by sixteen fatalities and another thirty-six seriously ill from scurvy and dysentery, the French were powerless to resist. After the pirates fired two volleys at La Concorde, Captain Dosset surrendered the ship. The pirates took La Concorde to the island of Bequia in the Grenadines where the French crew and the enslaved Africans were put ashore. While the pirates searched La Concorde, the French cabin boy, Louis Arot, informed them of the gold dust that was aboard. The pirates searched the French officers and crew and seized the gold. The cabin boy and three of his fellow French crewmen voluntarily joined the pirates, and ten others were taken by force including a pilot, three surgeons, two carpenters, two sailors, and the cook. Blackbeard and his crew decided to keep La Concorde and left the French the smaller of the two pirate sloops. The French gave their new and much smaller vessel the appropriate name Mauvaise Rencontre (Bad Encounter) and, in two trips, succeeded in transporting the remaining Africans from Bequia to Martinique.</p>
        <p><strong>(D)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;……… 1717-1718. Leaving Bequia in late November, Blackbeard cruised the Caribbean in his new ship, now renamed Queen Anne's Revenge, taking prizes and adding to his fleet. From the Grenadines, Blackbeard sailed north along the Lesser Antilles plundering ships near St. Vincent, St. Lucia, Nevis, and Antigua, and by early December he had arrived off the eastern end of Puerto Rico. From there, a former captive reported that the pirates were headed to Samana Bay in Hispaniola (Dominican Republic). By April 1718, the pirates were off the Turneffe Islands in the Bay of Honduras. It was there that Blackbeard captured the sloop Adventure, forcing the sloop's captain, David Herriot, to join him. Sailing east once again, the pirates passed near the Cayman Islands and captured a Spanish sloop off Cuba that they also added to their flotilla. Blackbeard then turned to terrorizing Charleston in 1718. Turning north, they sailed through the Bahamas and proceeded up the North American coast. In May 1718, the pirates arrived off Charleston, South Carolina, with Queen Anne's Revenge and three smaller sloops. In perhaps the most brazen act of his piratical career, Blackbeard blockaded the port of Charleston for nearly a week. The pirates seized several ships attempting to enter or leave the port and detained the crew and passengers of one ship, the Crowley, as prisoners. As ransom for the hostages, Blackbeard demanded a chest of medicine. Once delivered, the captives were released, and the pirates continued their journey up the coast.</p>
        <p><strong>(E)&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>……… Soon after leaving Charleston, Blackbeard's fleet tried to enter Old Topsail Inlet in North Carolina, now known as Beaufort Inlet. During that attempt, Queen Anne's Revenge and the sloop Adventure grounded on a sandbar and were abandoned. Research has uncovered two eyewitness accounts that shed light on where the two pirate vessels were lost. But was the loss of QAR Blackbeard's gambit? According to a deposition given by David Herriot, the former captain of Adventure, Blackbeard intentionally grounded Queen Anne's Revenge and Adventure in order to break up the company, which by this time had grown to over 300 pirates. Intentional or not, that is what happened as Blackbeard marooned some pirates and left Beaufort with a hand picked crew and most of the valuable plunder.</p>
        <p><strong>(F)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;……… Blackbeard's piratical career ended six months later at Ocracoke Inlet on the North Carolina coast. There he encountered an armed contingent sent by Virginia Governor Alexander Spotswood and led by Royal Navy Lieutenant Robert Maynard. In a desperate battle aboard Maynard's sloop, Blackbeard and a number of his fellow pirates were killed. Maynard returned to Virginia with the surviving pirates and the grim trophy of Blackbeard's severed head hanging from the sloop's bowsprit.</p>

Rugby League, or Rugby League Football to give it its full title, is a hard-hitting, fast-flowing team sport requiring a number of attributes including speed, strength, determination, courage and a willingness to take a hit — and lots of them. As a contact sport, Rugby League is one of the most physical there is. But don’t think that Rugby League is all about sheer size and strength, as although it is an obvious advantage, skill and tactics play a significant part in the game too. Rugby League players have to be multi-skilled, being able to run, kick and handle the ball well, but players do have specialist roles within their team to utilise their specific skills and attributes. The laws of Rugby League have been changed over the years, many of the changes aimed at creating a faster, more spectator-friendly sport. The absence of mauls, rucks and line-outs (found in Rugby Union), mean there are generally fewer stoppages in play and fewer laws for the referee to interpret, making it easier for the spectator to follow. When taking into consideration the fact that there are only 13 players on the field of play (compared to 15 in Rugby Union), that’s a lot of ground for the players to cover, so they need to be very fit and mobile.<br>

Most parents understand the wide-ranging health and fitness benefits associated</strong> with encouraging their child to take up a team sport. These may include… making regular exercise a habit from a young age; developing bone and muscle strength; developing cardiovascular fitness; maintaining a healthy weight; learning the importance of eating right; and reducing their risk of illness and disease. But what is less commonly talked about is the immense mental, emotional and social benefits that playing a team sport can offer your child. There is now a growing body of research focusing on these benefits. This research highlights many advantages that your child will enjoy by becoming involved in team sports. It doesn’t even matter what sport your child decides to play, or their skill level. It’s the mental, emotional, social skills, and lessons that they will gain by playing any type of team sport that is important.&nbsp;<br>

Whilst in day-to-day life men and women live, work, and socialise together, sport has generally remained an activity that segregates its competitors by sex. The main reason for this is that men and women are physically built differently. Men are generally taller, heavier, stronger, and quicker than women which means that competing on an equal basis isn’t really possible in most sports. Generally, most sports segregate men’s and women’s competitions to ensure the sport is competitive and more enjoyable to both play and watch. However, not all sports completely segregate male and female competition. In some sports, men and women compete together and they do this in two different ways. Firstly, some sports have mixed events. This is where men and women form a team (usually, but not always, a duo) and compete against another mixed team. This way, men and women compete together and against each other in a fair way as both teams feature the same number of male and female players. Sports that operate in this way are as follows e.g badminton, tennis and ice-skating. In a small number of sports men and women compete against each other regardless of sex. The physical differences between men and women are deemed not to have any effect on the outcome of any competition. e.g. equestrian and sailing.<br>

<br>
Netball is an exciting, fast and skillful game of fair contest. It is a game in which two teams of seven players each strive to keep or gain possession of the ball. The team with the ball, through running, jumping, throwing and catching, attempts to move the ball into its goal circle from where a goal may be scored, while the opposing team uses defensive movements and strategies to prevent this and to gain possession. The team with the greater number of goals is the winner of the match. Players have specified areas in which they can move. Play restarts after each goal with teams having alternate possession. The Rules are based on the core values of equal opportunity, fair&nbsp; play and respect for an opponent’s skill&nbsp; and safety. While Netball developed first as a game predominantly played by women and girls, it is now played by boys and girls, women and men. If you are interested in finding out more about Netball you can access the Rules of Netball here on this site, or from any of the national netball associations that are affiliated to World Netball or from World Netball itself – info@worldnetball.sport.<br>

        <p><strong>Read the text below. Six sentences&nbsp;have been removed from this text so that there are six gaps.</strong><br><br><strong>The Namib Desert</strong><br><br><b>(A)</b>&nbsp;……….. Covering an area of 31,274 sq. mi (81,000 sq. km), the Namib is a coastal desert, situated along the south-western coast of the African continent. Stretching over 1200mi (2000km), the Namib crosses Angola, Namibia and South Africa. Characterised by red sand dunes that can reach impressive heights, the Namib is considered to be particularly old, even by geological standard.</p>
        <p><strong>(B)</strong> ……….. The word ‘Namib’ is of Nama origin, and means ‘open space’. Geologists believe that the Namib Desert is the world’s oldest desert. It is thought that an arid climate began to dominate in the region approximately 55 million years old, before changing to a semi-arid climate 14-18 million years ago. The Namib is home to the highest sand dunes in the world; some of which can reach over 1280ft (390m) high and can even be seen from space. Diamonds are the most important mineral asset found in the Namib Desert. Due to the lightweight nature of diamonds and the ease of theft, the entire region where the diamonds are situated has been declared a Prohibited Area, totally closed to public access.</p>
        <p><strong>(C)</strong> ……….. The Namib experiences less than 1cm of rain annually and is almost entirely barren. Strangely, whilst the region is virtually rainless, its air is typically at or near to saturation point, and fog is very common. The coastal regions have a steady temperature throughout the day and seasons of 9-20C.The wind blows inland pushing moisture ladened air from the sea inland forming thick fog and providing plants and wildlife with a rare reliable water source. Inland temperatures vary much more and they can be freezing overnight and reach 45C during daylight hours. Rainfall is rare along the coast and central regions of the desert but it increases as the desert rises towards the towering Great Escarpment at its rear. Many streams run from this rock formation back through the desert towards the sea. Few reach it as they evaporate or soak below the desert. These water reserves are tapped to support the desert’s few towns.</p>
        <p><strong>(D)</strong> ……….. Whilst there are other coastal deserts (such as the Atacama) bounded by cool ocean currents, the Namib is the only one in which endemic plants and animals have evolved in virtually barren dunes. In fact, the Namib is teeming with animals, including elephants, rhinos, Hartmann’s zebra, lions, gemsbok and the black-faced impala.</p>
        <p><strong>(E) </strong>……….. A number of rare and interesting plants are present in the Namib Desert, such as the Welwitschia Mirabilis, which consists only of 2 leaves and a stem, and is estimated to reach up to 2000 years old. It can grow up to 6-feet high, and 24-feet wide, and was referred to by Darwin as the ‘the platypus of the plant kingdom. Another bizarre plant is the Quiver Tree, which effectively cuts off its own branches in times of severe drought in order to save moisture loss through its leaves.</p>
        <p><strong>(F) </strong>……….. The Namib is well-protected by a range of national parks, such as the Namib-Naukluft National Park (19,215 sq. mi / 49,768 sq. km) which protects the central area of the region. In fact, most of the desert is covered by some level of protection as can be seen by the map below. In 2012 a stretch of the coastal desert was designated a World Heritage site.</p>

Cornrows are a type of braided hairstyle in which “the hair is braided very close to the scalp, using an underhand, upward motion to make a continuous, raised row.” Also known as canerows in the Caribbean, they can be styled in straight lines as well as in intricate geometric or curved patterns. They have been traced back to around 3,000 BCE where they were found in various cultures of West Africa and the Horn of Africa. The earliest documentation has been in Stone Age paintings in the Tassili Plateau of the Sahara. However, in more recent history, cornrows were used as a powerful tool of resistance against slavery and bondage. During the Middle Passage, millions of enslaved Africans were chained and transported across the Atlantic to the Americas. They were made to shave their heads for the purpose of “sanitation” and as a way to strip them of their culture and identity. But this wasn’t adhered to by everyone. Many of those enslaved grew out their hair and braided it into cornrows as an act of resistance, rebellion and reclamation of cultural identity.<br>

A good, timely haircut is something we women prefer not to save on. It’s better to save on a dress or a new shirt – nobody would notice if you are rocking a trendy cut. Although hair styling is important, it’s often secondary, because even the messiest hairstyles need a proper base – a quality cut that has its shape and texture. In this case your hairstyle will be read appealing and harmonious even if it’s the shaggiest “unkempt” ‘do. Somehow when we see bed head hair we always guess right whether it’s a true hairstyle or lack of styling, right? Click here to find out what is new there in the haircut world, select the ideas for your new cut and anticipate your style reboot! For short haircuts, the classic cropped ‘dos have got a serious style update during the last couple of seasons. Contrasting textures and lengths, undercut sections and customized colors make them unique and bring to light the femininity of the wearer. Here are ideas of classy modern crops for every hair type. For medium haircuts, the midi length hair is the golden mean that lets you enjoy free-flowing locks or sweep your hair up in a cute updo whenever the mood strikes you. If you want to rest from the maintenance of longer locks, consider a trendy shoulder-grazing cut and enjoy the benefits that come along. We are ready to suggest numerous varieties of bobs, lobs and midi shags. For long haircuts, summer is the right time to unleash your fantasy and discover the potential of lengthy locks. A subtly feathered cut will let your strands flow nicely over the shoulders and won’t give many undesired fly-aways in an updo or a braid. The fans of edgier looks may go for shags, heavier layers or undercut styles.<br>

<br>
Throughout history and across various cultures, hair and hairstyles have had significance far beyond aesthetic beauty and protection from weather.<br>
Hairstyles have symbolised one’s age, tribal affiliations, ethnicity, religion, social status, marital status and more, and have allowed ethnic and cultural groups to define and even reclaim their identities. Many of these styles have stood the test of time and remain prominent today within and without the unique cultures in which they originated. In the age of social media, however, many of these traditional hairstyles have been adopted—or appropriated rather—by celebrities, social media influencers and festival-goers as mere fashion statements without any thought given to their deep cultural significance or painful history. Thus, learning about the history and significance of hair is vital to fostering a more mindful and respectful attitude towards Black, Indigenous and People of Colour.<br>

Hair is a 1979 American musical anti-war comedy-drama film based on the 1968 Broadway musical Hair: The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical. Set against the backdrop of the long-haired hippie counterculture of the Vietnam era, the film focuses on a Vietnam War draftee who meets and befriends a "tribe" of hippies while en route to the army induction center. The hippies and their leader introduce him to illegal drug use and their environment of unorthodox relationships and draft evasion. The musical’s title song begins as character Claude slowly croons his reason for his long hair, as tribe-mate Berger joins in singing they "don't know." They lead the tribe, singing "Give me a head with hair," "as long as God can grow it," listing what they want in a head of hair and their uses for it. Later the song takes the tune of "The Star-Spangled Banner" with the tribe punning "Oh say can you see/ My eyes if you can/Then my hair’s too short!"<br>

        <p><strong>Read the text below. Six sentences&nbsp;have been removed from this text so that there are six gaps.</strong><br><br>
Spanish Bullfighting<br>
<br>
<strong>(A)</strong>&nbsp; ……….&nbsp; The Spanish people consider types of bullfighting as art forms which are intimately linked with their country’s history, art and culture.&nbsp; Pressure groups attempt to lobby against bullfighting yet the King of Spain himself has allegedly stated that the day the EU bans bullfighting is the day Spain leaves the EU.</p>
        <p><strong>(B)</strong>&nbsp; ……….&nbsp; They were popular spectacles in ancient Rome, but it was in the Iberian Peninsula that these contests were fully developed by the Moors from North Africa who overran Andalucia in AD 711. Bullfighting developed into a ritualistic occasion observed in connection with feast days, on which the conquering Moors, mounted on highly trained horses, confronted and killed the bulls. Whilst bullfighting maintains strong support in its heartlands of Madrid, Andalucia and Extremadura it has been banned in Catalonia.</p>
        <p><strong>(C)</strong>&nbsp; ……….&nbsp; All major Spanish cities have impressive bullrings but probably the most outstanding are those in Madrid, Seville, and Ronda. The Madrid’s Bullring is La Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas which was built in 1929 and was first used in 1931. It is the most important bullring in the world with a capacity of 25,000. Every seat is taken every evening during the world-renowned San Isidro Bullfighting festival in June. The Seville Bullring is very old Building of the Maestranza Bullring in Seville began in 1758 making it Spain’s oldest Plaza de Toros. The origin of modern-day bullfighting on foot (rather than horseback) can be traced back to here and Ronda. It is one of the most charming bullrings in the country and although its capacity is only 12,500, it attracts the top bullfighters.&nbsp; You can see bullfights in Seville from April (during Seville’s Feria de Abril) through to October. Check the bullfight calendar as they don’t take place every weekend.</p>
        <p><strong>(D)</strong>&nbsp; ……….&nbsp; It is one of the oldest and most beautiful in Spain. Previously it had been Philip II’s centre for horsemanship training (Real Maestranza de Caballeria). Bulls were used in this training and when one day an aristocrat fell from his horse one Francisco Romero came to his help by using his hat to distract it. The hat was replaced by a cape and modern day bullfighting was born. Romero’s grandson, Pedro Romero, developed all the passes and moves which to this day are seen at a bullfight. He retired in his eighties after killing more than 5,600 bulls without ever being hurt. Thus Ronda is considered the home of bullfighting. You can visit the bullring in Ronda which houses a small bullfighting museum. The bullfighting season in Ronda is from April to October though fights are quite infrequent. Check with the tourist office next to the bullring.</p>
        <p><strong>(E)&nbsp;</strong> ……….&nbsp; It depends on their position in the bullfighting arena. The ones in the shade (sombra) are more expensive than the ones in the sun (sol). Some seats are designated as sun and shade (sol y sombra) because they begin in the sun but move to shade as the afternoon progresses. Seats located closest to the bullfight are also more expensive than those near the back. So ones near the ringside barrier (barrera) which are also in the shade are the most expensive. Buying tickets at the actual arena can prove a major hassle as it is difficult to work out which ticket window (taquilla) you should go to and without a very good level of Spanish it is almost impossible to explain or find out which tickets you wish to buy. Just study the poster of the event in advance to decide where you want to sit then ask for those seats or simply copy the name of the seating area and show it to the ticket seller.</p>
        <p><strong>(F)&nbsp;</strong> ……….&nbsp; Bulls can suffer a severe and tortuous death. Many animal rights activists often protest bullfighting in Spain and other countries, citing the needless endangerment of the bull and bullfighter. Some cities around the world where bullfighting was once popular, including Coslada (Spain), Mouans-Sartoux (France), and Teocelo (Mexico), have even declared themselves to be anti-bullfighting cities. Other places, including some towns in Catalonia (Spain), have ceased killing the bull in the fight, but continue bullfighting.</p>
