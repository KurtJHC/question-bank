        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>Apollo 13: The moon-mission that dodged disaster&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Apollo 13 was NASA's third moon-landing mission, but the astronauts never made it to the lunar surface. An oxygen tank explosion almost 56 hours into the flight forced the crew to abandon all thoughts of reaching the moon. The spacecraft was damaged, but the crew were able to seek cramped shelter in the lunar module for the trip back to Earth, before returning to the command module for an uncomfortable splashdown. <strong>15 ………. </strong>It also illustrates NASA's innovative mind’s ability to work together to save lives on the fly. The Apollo 13 mission celebrates its 50th anniversary this year on April 11.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Apollo 13 astronauts were commander James Lovell, lunar module pilot Fred Haise and command module pilot John "Jack" Swigert. Apollo 13 launched on April 11, 1970. The Apollo spacecraft was made up of two independent spacecrafts joined by a tunnel: orbiter Odyssey and lander Aquarius. The crew lived in Odyssey on the journey to the moon. <strong>16 ………. </strong>Mission controller, Sy Liebergot then saw a low-pressure warning signal on a hydrogen tank in Odyssey. The signal could have shown a problem or could have indicated the hydrogen just needed to be resettled by heating and fanning the gas inside the tank. That procedure was called a "cryo stir," and was supposed to stop the supercold gas from settling into layers.</p>
        <p>Swigert flipped the switch for the routine procedure. A moment later, the entire spacecraft shook. Alarm lights lit up in Odyssey and in Mission Control as oxygen pressure fell and power disappeared. The crew notified Mission Control, with Swigert famously saying, "Houston, we've had a problem." (Note that the 1995 movie "Apollo 13" took some creative license with the phrase, changing it to "Houston, we have a problem," and having the words come out of Apollo 13 commander James Lovell's mouth.) Much later, a NASA accident investigation board determined wires were exposed in the oxygen tank because of a combination of manufacturing and testing errors before flight. <strong>17 ………. </strong>It ripped apart one oxygen tank and damaged another inside the spacecraft. Since oxygen fed Odyssey's fuel cells, power was reduced as well. The spacecraft's attitude control thrusters, sensing the venting oxygen, tried to stabilise the spacecraft through firing small jets. The system wasn't very successful given several of the jets were slammed shut by the explosion.</p>
        <p>Fortunately for Apollo 13, the damaged Odyssey had a healthy backup. It was Aquarius, which wasn't supposed to be turned on until the crew was close to landing on the moon. Haise and Lovell frantically worked to boot Aquarius up in less time than designed. <strong>18 ………. </strong>So, as Lovell and Haise got the lunar module up and running, Swigert remained in Odyssey to shut down its systems to conserve power for splashdown.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The crew had to balance the challenge of getting home with the challenge of preserving power on Aquarius. After they performed a crucial burn to point the spacecraft back towards Earth, the crew powered down every nonessential system in the spacecraft. Without a source of heat, cabin temperatures quickly dropped down close to freezing. Some food became inedible. The crew also rationed water to make sure Aquarius — operating for longer than it was designed — would have enough liquid to cool its hardware down. <strong>19 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>On Earth, flight director Gene Kranz pulled his shift of controllers off regular rotation to focus on managing consumables like water and power. Other mission control teams helped the crew with its daily activities. Spacecraft manufacturers worked around the clock to support NASA and the crew. It was a rough journey home. The entire spaceflight crew lost weight and Haise developed a kidney infection. But the small vessel protected and carried the crew long enough to reach Earth's atmosphere. In the hours before splashdown, the exhausted crew scrambled back over to the Odyssey and powered it up. <strong>20 ………. </strong>However, thanks to safeguards put in place after the Apollo 1 disaster, there were no issues. Lovell, Haise and Swigert splashed down safely in the Pacific Ocean near Samoa, on April 17.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Apollo 13: The moon-mission that dodged disaster&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Apollo 13 was NASA's third moon-landing mission, but the astronauts never made it to the lunar surface. An oxygen tank explosion almost 56 hours into the flight forced the crew to abandon all thoughts of reaching the moon. The spacecraft was damaged, but the crew were able to seek cramped shelter in the lunar module for the trip back to Earth, before returning to the command module for an uncomfortable splashdown. <strong>15 ………. </strong>It also illustrates NASA's innovative mind’s ability to work together to save lives on the fly. The Apollo 13 mission celebrates its 50th anniversary this year on April 11.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Apollo 13 astronauts were commander James Lovell, lunar module pilot Fred Haise and command module pilot John "Jack" Swigert. Apollo 13 launched on April 11, 1970. The Apollo spacecraft was made up of two independent spacecrafts joined by a tunnel: orbiter Odyssey and lander Aquarius. The crew lived in Odyssey on the journey to the moon. <strong>16 ………. </strong>Mission controller, Sy Liebergot then saw a low-pressure warning signal on a hydrogen tank in Odyssey. The signal could have shown a problem or could have indicated the hydrogen just needed to be resettled by heating and fanning the gas inside the tank. That procedure was called a "cryo stir," and was supposed to stop the supercold gas from settling into layers.</p>
        <p>Swigert flipped the switch for the routine procedure. A moment later, the entire spacecraft shook. Alarm lights lit up in Odyssey and in Mission Control as oxygen pressure fell and power disappeared. The crew notified Mission Control, with Swigert famously saying, "Houston, we've had a problem." (Note that the 1995 movie "Apollo 13" took some creative license with the phrase, changing it to "Houston, we have a problem," and having the words come out of Apollo 13 commander James Lovell's mouth.) Much later, a NASA accident investigation board determined wires were exposed in the oxygen tank because of a combination of manufacturing and testing errors before flight. <strong>17 ………. </strong>It ripped apart one oxygen tank and damaged another inside the spacecraft. Since oxygen fed Odyssey's fuel cells, power was reduced as well. The spacecraft's attitude control thrusters, sensing the venting oxygen, tried to stabilise the spacecraft through firing small jets. The system wasn't very successful given several of the jets were slammed shut by the explosion.</p>
        <p>Fortunately for Apollo 13, the damaged Odyssey had a healthy backup. It was Aquarius, which wasn't supposed to be turned on until the crew was close to landing on the moon. Haise and Lovell frantically worked to boot Aquarius up in less time than designed. <strong>18 ………. </strong>So, as Lovell and Haise got the lunar module up and running, Swigert remained in Odyssey to shut down its systems to conserve power for splashdown.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The crew had to balance the challenge of getting home with the challenge of preserving power on Aquarius. After they performed a crucial burn to point the spacecraft back towards Earth, the crew powered down every nonessential system in the spacecraft. Without a source of heat, cabin temperatures quickly dropped down close to freezing. Some food became inedible. The crew also rationed water to make sure Aquarius — operating for longer than it was designed — would have enough liquid to cool its hardware down. <strong>19 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>On Earth, flight director Gene Kranz pulled his shift of controllers off regular rotation to focus on managing consumables like water and power. Other mission control teams helped the crew with its daily activities. Spacecraft manufacturers worked around the clock to support NASA and the crew. It was a rough journey home. The entire spaceflight crew lost weight and Haise developed a kidney infection. But the small vessel protected and carried the crew long enough to reach Earth's atmosphere. In the hours before splashdown, the exhausted crew scrambled back over to the Odyssey and powered it up. <strong>20 ………. </strong>However, thanks to safeguards put in place after the Apollo 1 disaster, there were no issues. Lovell, Haise and Swigert splashed down safely in the Pacific Ocean near Samoa, on April 17.</p>

There’s no doubt about it - Australia is a big country. Hopping on a guided tour is certainly a stress-free way to see the highlights, but there are benefits to taking your itinerary into your own hands. Leave the crowds behind and seek out adventure by heading to some of the best ‘undiscovered’ parts of the country. These hidden gems will reward your efforts with awe inspiring landscapes, wildlife, star-filled skies and a chance to connect with nature in a way that few get to experience.<br>
<br>
The Grampians National Park is just three hours from Melbourne, yet feels worlds away. The area is famous for quality red wines, hiking trails and Aboriginal history. The craggy peaks and rocky gorges of South Australia’s Flinders Ranges require a five-hour road trip from Adelaide, but are well worth the journey. Explore the 100 kilometre crater that is Wilpena Pound, taste kangaroo and emu at an outback pub and glamp under the stars at Arkaba Station. Or you could head off road. There are just some places that a tour bus can’t go. The Great Beach Drive, a 200 kilometre wave-washed highway on the Sunshine Coast, is the perfect example of an incredible experience you can only have by hopping behind the wheel. You'll need a 4WD and a sense of adventure, but you’ll never forget the feeling of sand beneath your wheels as the waves crash just metres away.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Even after the sun goes down there’s plenty to see and do around Uluru in the NSW outback. The award-winning exhibition Field of Light is available to enjoy and experience. The outdoor installation, aptly named Tili Wiru Tjuta Nyakutjaku or ‘looking at lots of beautiful lights’ in local Pitjantjatjara, sees more than 50,000 solar-powered stems light up at sunset and glow throughout the night. In keeping with the desert’s vast scale, the brightly coloured light stems cover an area the size of four football fields. Explore it on your own or join a tour to see the sunset over the twinkling lights.<br>
<br>
A visit to the Red Centre wouldn’t be complete without experiencing this iconic Australian landmark. But there’s more than one way to see it. While many people choose to walk the 10 kilometres around the base of Uluru, there are countless other ways you can take it all in. Perhaps one of the most memorable is a scenic helicopter flight which will allow you to truly appreciate the full scale of Uluru and Kata Tjuta. If you’re more comfortable on the ground you can hop on a segway to cruise around the base, ride a camel at sunset or even take a motorcycle ride through the desert for a fun and exciting way to experience this sacred spot.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Have an Australian seafood adventure, from ocean to plate. Australia is home to some of the world’s most pristine waters – one major reason why Australian seafood has a global reputation for excellence. If you’re keen to sample some of Australia’s best seafood, start at Sydney Fish Market - an iconic local attraction in Sydney where visitors flock daily to see the bountiful supplies of fresh fish. Alternatively, head to nearby restaurants like multiaward-winning Saint Peter, which showcases Australia’s sustainable approach to sourcing and eating local delicacies like marron and Sydney rock oysters.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
On Tasmania’s beautiful eastern coast, at luxury lodge Saffire Freycinet or Freycinet Marine Farm, you can even pluck your own oysters and eat them directly from the sea. Or head to the Kimberley to experience the traditional hunt for mud crab with Indigenous custodian, Brian Lee.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
“Australians are very unfair in this way. They spend half of any conversation insisting that the country's dangers are vastly overrated and that there's nothing to worry about, and the other half telling you how six months ago their Uncle Bob was driving near Mudgee when a tiger snake slid out from under the dashboard and bit him on the groin, but that it's okay now because he's off the life support machine and they've discovered he can communicate with eye blinks.” … “As the saying goes, it takes all kinds to make the world go around, though perhaps some shouldn't go quite so far around it as others.” … “The people are immensely likable— cheerful, extrovert, quick-witted and unfailingly obliging. Their cities are safe and clean and nearly always built on water. They have a society that is prosperous, well ordered and instinctively egalitarian. The food is excellent. The sun nearly always shines. There is coffee on every corner. Life doesn't get much better than this.” - Bill Bryson, In a Sunburned Country<br>

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
There’s no doubt about it - Australia is a big country. Hopping on a guided tour is certainly a stress-free way to see the highlights, but there are benefits to taking your itinerary into your own hands. Leave the crowds behind and seek out adventure by heading to some of the best ‘undiscovered’ parts of the country. These hidden gems will reward your efforts with awe inspiring landscapes, wildlife, star-filled skies and a chance to connect with nature in a way that few get to experience.<br>
<br>
The Grampians National Park is just three hours from Melbourne, yet feels worlds away. The area is famous for quality red wines, hiking trails and Aboriginal history. The craggy peaks and rocky gorges of South Australia’s Flinders Ranges require a five-hour road trip from Adelaide, but are well worth the journey. Explore the 100 kilometre crater that is Wilpena Pound, taste kangaroo and emu at an outback pub and glamp under the stars at Arkaba Station. Or you could head off road. There are just some places that a tour bus can’t go. The Great Beach Drive, a 200 kilometre wave-washed highway on the Sunshine Coast, is the perfect example of an incredible experience you can only have by hopping behind the wheel. You'll need a 4WD and a sense of adventure, but you’ll never forget the feeling of sand beneath your wheels as the waves crash just metres away.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Even after the sun goes down there’s plenty to see and do around Uluru in the NSW outback. The award-winning exhibition Field of Light is available to enjoy and experience. The outdoor installation, aptly named Tili Wiru Tjuta Nyakutjaku or ‘looking at lots of beautiful lights’ in local Pitjantjatjara, sees more than 50,000 solar-powered stems light up at sunset and glow throughout the night. In keeping with the desert’s vast scale, the brightly coloured light stems cover an area the size of four football fields. Explore it on your own or join a tour to see the sunset over the twinkling lights.<br>
<br>
A visit to the Red Centre wouldn’t be complete without experiencing this iconic Australian landmark. But there’s more than one way to see it. While many people choose to walk the 10 kilometres around the base of Uluru, there are countless other ways you can take it all in. Perhaps one of the most memorable is a scenic helicopter flight which will allow you to truly appreciate the full scale of Uluru and Kata Tjuta. If you’re more comfortable on the ground you can hop on a segway to cruise around the base, ride a camel at sunset or even take a motorcycle ride through the desert for a fun and exciting way to experience this sacred spot.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Have an Australian seafood adventure, from ocean to plate. Australia is home to some of the world’s most pristine waters – one major reason why Australian seafood has a global reputation for excellence. If you’re keen to sample some of Australia’s best seafood, start at Sydney Fish Market - an iconic local attraction in Sydney where visitors flock daily to see the bountiful supplies of fresh fish. Alternatively, head to nearby restaurants like multiaward-winning Saint Peter, which showcases Australia’s sustainable approach to sourcing and eating local delicacies like marron and Sydney rock oysters.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
On Tasmania’s beautiful eastern coast, at luxury lodge Saffire Freycinet or Freycinet Marine Farm, you can even pluck your own oysters and eat them directly from the sea. Or head to the Kimberley to experience the traditional hunt for mud crab with Indigenous custodian, Brian Lee.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
“Australians are very unfair in this way. They spend half of any conversation insisting that the country's dangers are vastly overrated and that there's nothing to worry about, and the other half telling you how six months ago their Uncle Bob was driving near Mudgee when a tiger snake slid out from under the dashboard and bit him on the groin, but that it's okay now because he's off the life support machine and they've discovered he can communicate with eye blinks.” … “As the saying goes, it takes all kinds to make the world go around, though perhaps some shouldn't go quite so far around it as others.” … “The people are immensely likable— cheerful, extrovert, quick-witted and unfailingly obliging. Their cities are safe and clean and nearly always built on water. They have a society that is prosperous, well ordered and instinctively egalitarian. The food is excellent. The sun nearly always shines. There is coffee on every corner. Life doesn't get much better than this.” - Bill Bryson, In a Sunburned Country<br>

The Great Beach Drive, a 200 kilometre wave-washed highway on the Sunshine Coast, is the perfect example of an incredible experience you can only have by hopping behind the wheel. You'll need a 4WD and a sense of adventure, but you’ll never forget the feeling of sand beneath your wheels as the waves crash just metres away.&nbsp;<br>

Even after the sun goes down there’s plenty to see and do around Uluru in the NSW outback. The award-winning exhibition Field of Light is available to enjoy and experience. The outdoor installation, aptly named Tili Wiru Tjuta Nyakutjaku or ‘looking at lots of beautiful lights’ in local Pitjantjatjara, sees more than 50,000 solar-powered stems light up at sunset and glow throughout the night. In keeping with the desert’s vast scale, the brightly coloured light stems cover an area the size of four football fields. Explore it on your own or join a tour to see the sunset over the twinkling lights.<br>
<br>
A visit to the Red Centre wouldn’t be complete without experiencing this iconic Australian landmark. But there’s more than one way to see it. While many people choose to walk the 10 kilometres around the base of Uluru, there are countless other ways you can take it all in. Perhaps one of the most memorable is a scenic helicopter flight which will allow you to truly appreciate the full scale of Uluru and Kata Tjuta. If you’re more comfortable on the ground you can hop on a segway to cruise around the base, ride a camel at sunset or even take a motorcycle ride through the desert for a fun and exciting way to experience this sacred spot.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Have an Australian seafood adventure, from ocean to plate. Australia is home to some of the world’s most pristine waters – one major reason why Australian seafood has a global reputation for excellence. If you’re keen to sample some of Australia’s best seafood, start at Sydney Fish Market - an iconic local attraction in Sydney where visitors flock daily to see the bountiful supplies of fresh fish. Alternatively, head to nearby restaurants like multiaward-winning Saint Peter, which showcases Australia’s sustainable approach to sourcing and eating local delicacies like marron and Sydney rock oysters.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
On Tasmania’s beautiful eastern coast, at luxury lodge Saffire Freycinet or Freycinet Marine Farm, you can even pluck your own oysters and eat them directly from the sea. Or head to the Kimberley to experience the traditional hunt for mud crab with Indigenous custodian, Brian Lee.<br>

“Australians are very unfair in this way. They spend half of any conversation insisting that the country's dangers are vastly overrated and that there's nothing to worry about, and the other half telling you how six months ago their Uncle Bob was driving near Mudgee when a tiger snake slid out from under the dashboard and bit him on the groin, but that it's okay now because he's off the life support machine and they've discovered he can communicate with eye blinks.” … “As the saying goes, it takes all kinds to make the world go around, though perhaps some shouldn't go quite so far around it as others.” … “The people are immensely likable— cheerful, extrovert, quick-witted and unfailingly obliging. Their cities are safe and clean and nearly always built on water. They have a society that is prosperous, well ordered and instinctively egalitarian. The food is excellent. The sun nearly always shines. There is coffee on every corner. Life doesn't get much better than this.” - Bill Bryson, In a Sunburned Country<br>

There’s no doubt about it - Australia is a big country. Hopping on a guided tour is certainly a stress-free way to see the highlights, but there are benefits to taking your itinerary into your own hands. Leave the crowds behind and seek out adventure by heading to some of the best ‘undiscovered’ parts of the country. These hidden gems will reward your efforts with awe inspiring landscapes, wildlife, star-filled skies and a chance to connect with nature in a way that few get to experience.<br>

The Grampians National Park is just three hours from Melbourne, yet feels worlds away. The area is famous for quality red wines, hiking trails and Aboriginal history. The craggy peaks and rocky gorges of South Australia’s Flinders Ranges require a five-hour road trip from Adelaide, but are well worth the journey.

          <strong>BAMBI</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Felix Salten&nbsp;</em><br><br>
Bambi was often left alone now. But he did not have the same fear of it as he had the first time. His mother would disappear, and then, however much he called for her, she did not come. But then she would reappear unexpectedly. Another time, it happened in full daylight. Bambi had been walking for hours through the dense woods and finally began to call. Not so much because he was afraid, but because he did not want to remain so alone anymore, and he felt he would soon be in a terrible state. So, he began to call for his mother.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, there was one of their fathers standing in front of him, looking at him severely. Bambi had not heard him coming and he was startled. This elder stag looked more powerful than the others, he was taller and more proud. His coat was aflame with a deep dark red, but his face shone silver-grey; and a powerful, black pearled crown extended high above his playful ears.</p>
        <p>“What are you calling for?” the old stag asked severely. Bambi trembled in awe of the elder stag and did not dare to make any answer. “Your mother hasn’t got the time to spend on you now!” the elder continued. Bambi was completely cowed by this imperious voice, but at the same time he felt admiration for it. “Can’t you be by yourself for a while? You should be ashamed of yourself!” Bambi would have liked to say that he could be by himself perfectly well, that he had often been by himself, but he said nothing. He did as he was told and became terribly ashamed. The elder turned round and left him. Bambi did not know how the stag left, where he had gone, did not even know whether he had left quickly or slowly. He was simply gone, just as suddenly as he had arrived. Bambi strained his ears, but he heard no steps moving away from him, no leaf being disturbed. That made him suppose the elder must still be quite near to him, and he smelt the air on every side. He learned nothing from that. Bambi sighed in relief as he was once more alone, but at the same time he yearned to see the old stag again and to make sure he was not displeased with him.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then his mother arrived but Bambi said nothing about his meeting with the elder. Nor did he ever call for her, now, when she was out of sight. He thought about the old stag when he wandered about on his own; he felt a powerful wish to come across him. Then he would say to him, “See? I’m not calling for anyone.” And the elder would praise him. He did speak to Gobo and Faline though, the next time they were together on the meadow. They listened with excitement and they had no experience of their own that could compare with this. “Weren’t you scared?” asked Gobo excitedly. Yes! Bambi admitted, he had been scared. Just a little bit. “I’d have been terribly scared,” Gobo told him. Bambi answered that no, he had not been very scared, because the elder had been so majestic. Gobo told him, “That wouldn’t have been much help for me. I’d have been too scared even to look at him. When I get scared everything flickers in front of my eyes, so that I can’t see anything and&nbsp;my heart beats so hard that I can’t breathe.” What Bambi had told them made Faline very thoughtful and she said nothing.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The next time they met, though, Gobo and Faline rushed to him in great leaps and bounds. They were alone once more, as was Bambi. “We’ve been looking for you for ages,” declared Gobo. “Yes,” said Faline with an air of importance, “as now we know exactly who it was that you saw.” Bambi was so keen to know he jumped in the air. “Who ...!?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Faline took pleasure in saying, “It was the old prince.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“How do you know that?” Bambi wanted to know.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Our mother told us!” retorted Faline.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Bambi was astonished, and he showed it. “Did you tell her about it then?” The two of them nodded their heads. “But that was a secret!” objected Bambi.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Gobo reacted. He quickly tried to excuse himself. “It wasn’t me. It was Faline who did it.” But Faline cheerfully called, “Oh, so what? Secret!? I wanted to know who it was, and now we do know, and that’s much more interesting!” Bambi was burning to hear all about this, and his wish was satisfied. Faline told him everything. “He’s the most noble stag in the whole wood. He’s the prince. There is no second most noble, no one comes near to him. No one knows how old he is. No one knows where he lives. No one knows who his relatives are. Very few have ever even seen him. Now and then there’s a rumour that he’s dead because he hasn’t been seen for a long time. Then somebody catches a glimpse of him and then everyone knows he’s still alive. No one has ever dared to ask him where he’s been. He doesn’t speak to anyone, and no one dares to speak to him. He goes along the paths where no one else ever goes; he knows every part of the wood, even the most distant corner. And nothing is a danger to him. Other princes might tussle with each other, sometimes as a test or in fun but sometimes they fight in earnest. It’s many years since he fought with anyone. And there’s no one still alive who did fight with him a long time ago. He’s the great prince.”&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>BAMBI</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Felix Salten&nbsp;</em><br><br>
Bambi was often left alone now. But he did not have the same fear of it as he had the first time. His mother would disappear, and then, however much he called for her, she did not come. But then she would reappear unexpectedly. Another time, it happened in full daylight. Bambi had been walking for hours through the dense woods and finally began to call. Not so much because he was afraid, but because he did not want to remain so alone anymore, and he felt he would soon be in a terrible state. So, he began to call for his mother.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, there was one of their fathers standing in front of him, looking at him severely. Bambi had not heard him coming and he was startled. This elder stag looked more powerful than the others, he was taller and more proud. His coat was aflame with a deep dark red, but his face shone silver-grey; and a powerful, black pearled crown extended high above his playful ears.</p>
        <p>“What are you calling for?” the old stag asked severely. Bambi trembled in awe of the elder stag and did not dare to make any answer. “Your mother hasn’t got the time to spend on you now!” the elder continued. Bambi was completely cowed by this imperious voice, but at the same time he felt admiration for it. “Can’t you be by yourself for a while? You should be ashamed of yourself!” Bambi would have liked to say that he could be by himself perfectly well, that he had often been by himself, but he said nothing. He did as he was told and became terribly ashamed. The elder turned round and left him. Bambi did not know how the stag left, where he had gone, did not even know whether he had left quickly or slowly. He was simply gone, just as suddenly as he had arrived. Bambi strained his ears, but he heard no steps moving away from him, no leaf being disturbed. That made him suppose the elder must still be quite near to him, and he smelt the air on every side. He learned nothing from that. Bambi sighed in relief as he was once more alone, but at the same time he yearned to see the old stag again and to make sure he was not displeased with him.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then his mother arrived but Bambi said nothing about his meeting with the elder. Nor did he ever call for her, now, when she was out of sight. He thought about the old stag when he wandered about on his own; he felt a powerful wish to come across him. Then he would say to him, “See? I’m not calling for anyone.” And the elder would praise him. He did speak to Gobo and Faline though, the next time they were together on the meadow. They listened with excitement and they had no experience of their own that could compare with this. “Weren’t you scared?” asked Gobo excitedly. Yes! Bambi admitted, he had been scared. Just a little bit. “I’d have been terribly scared,” Gobo told him. Bambi answered that no, he had not been very scared, because the elder had been so majestic. Gobo told him, “That wouldn’t have been much help for me. I’d have been too scared even to look at him. When I get scared everything flickers in front of my eyes, so that I can’t see anything and&nbsp;my heart beats so hard that I can’t breathe.” What Bambi had told them made Faline very thoughtful and she said nothing.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The next time they met, though, Gobo and Faline rushed to him in great leaps and bounds. They were alone once more, as was Bambi. “We’ve been looking for you for ages,” declared Gobo. “Yes,” said Faline with an air of importance, “as now we know exactly who it was that you saw.” Bambi was so keen to know he jumped in the air. “Who ...!?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Faline took pleasure in saying, “It was the old prince.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“How do you know that?” Bambi wanted to know.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Our mother told us!” retorted Faline.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Bambi was astonished, and he showed it. “Did you tell her about it then?” The two of them nodded their heads. “But that was a secret!” objected Bambi.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Gobo reacted. He quickly tried to excuse himself. “It wasn’t me. It was Faline who did it.” But Faline cheerfully called, “Oh, so what? Secret!? I wanted to know who it was, and now we do know, and that’s much more interesting!” Bambi was burning to hear all about this, and his wish was satisfied. Faline told him everything. “He’s the most noble stag in the whole wood. He’s the prince. There is no second most noble, no one comes near to him. No one knows how old he is. No one knows where he lives. No one knows who his relatives are. Very few have ever even seen him. Now and then there’s a rumour that he’s dead because he hasn’t been seen for a long time. Then somebody catches a glimpse of him and then everyone knows he’s still alive. No one has ever dared to ask him where he’s been. He doesn’t speak to anyone, and no one dares to speak to him. He goes along the paths where no one else ever goes; he knows every part of the wood, even the most distant corner. And nothing is a danger to him. Other princes might tussle with each other, sometimes as a test or in fun but sometimes they fight in earnest. It’s many years since he fought with anyone. And there’s no one still alive who did fight with him a long time ago. He’s the great prince.”&nbsp;</p>

Not so much because he was afraid, but because he did not want to remain so alone anymore, and he felt he would soon be in a terrible state. So, he began to call for his mother.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, there was one of their fathers standing in front of him, looking at him severely. Bambi had not heard him coming and he was startled. This elder stag looked more powerful than the others, he was taller and more proud. His coat was aflame with a deep dark red, but his face shone silver-grey; and a powerful, black pearled crown extended high above his playful ears.</p>
        <p>“What are you calling for?” the old stag asked severely. Bambi trembled in awe of the elder stag and did not dare to make any answer. “Your mother hasn’t got the time to spend on you now!” the elder continued. Bambi was completely cowed by this imperious voice, but at the same time he felt admiration for it. “Can’t you be by yourself for a while? You should be ashamed of yourself!” Bambi would have liked to say that he could be by himself perfectly well, that he had often been by himself, but he said nothing. He did as he was told and became terribly ashamed. The elder turned round and left him. Bambi did not know how the stag left, where he had gone, did not even know whether he had left quickly or slowly. He was simply gone, just as suddenly as he had arrived. Bambi strained his ears, but he heard no steps moving away from him, no leaf being disturbed. That made him suppose the elder must still be quite near to him, and he smelt the air on every side. He learned nothing from that. Bambi sighed in relief as he was once more alone, but at the same time he yearned to see the old stag again and to make sure he was not displeased with him.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then his mother arrived but Bambi said nothing about his meeting with the elder. Nor did he ever call for her, now, when she was out of sight. He thought about the old stag when he wandered about on his own; he felt a powerful wish to come across him. Then he would say to him, “See? I’m not calling for anyone.” And the elder would praise him. He did speak to Gobo and Faline though, the next time they were together on the meadow. They listened with excitement and they had no experience of their own that could compare with this. “Weren’t you scared?” asked Gobo excitedly. Yes! Bambi admitted, he had been scared. Just a little bit. “I’d have been terribly scared,” Gobo told him. Bambi answered that no, he had not been very scared, because the elder had been so majestic. Gobo told him, “That wouldn’t have been much help for me. I’d have been too scared even to look at him. When I get scared everything flickers in front of my eyes, so that I can’t see anything and&nbsp;my heart beats so hard that I can’t breathe.” What Bambi had told them made Faline very thoughtful and she said nothing.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The next time they met, though, Gobo and Faline rushed to him in great leaps and bounds. They were alone once more, as was Bambi. “We’ve been looking for you for ages,” declared Gobo. “Yes,” said Faline with an air of importance, “as now we know exactly who it was that you saw.” Bambi was so keen to know he jumped in the air. “Who ...!?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Faline took pleasure in saying, “It was the old prince.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“How do you know that?” Bambi wanted to know.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Our mother told us!” retorted Faline.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Bambi was astonished, and he showed it. “Did you tell her about it then?” The two of them nodded their heads. “But that was a secret!” objected Bambi.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Gobo reacted. He quickly tried to excuse himself. “It wasn’t me. It was Faline who did it.” But Faline cheerfully called, “Oh, so what? Secret!? I wanted to know who it was, and now we do know, and that’s much more interesting!” Bambi was burning to hear all about this, and his wish was satisfied. Faline told him everything. “He’s the most noble stag in the whole wood. He’s the prince. There is no second most noble, no one comes near to him. No one knows how old he is. No one knows where he lives. No one knows who his relatives are. Very few have ever even seen him. Now and then there’s a rumour that he’s dead because he hasn’t been seen for a long time. Then somebody catches a glimpse of him and then everyone knows he’s still alive. No one has ever dared to ask him where he’s been. He doesn’t speak to anyone, and no one dares to speak to him. He goes along the paths where no one else ever goes; he knows every part of the wood, even the most distant corner. And nothing is a danger to him. Other princes might tussle with each other, sometimes as a test or in fun but sometimes they fight in earnest. It’s many years since he fought with anyone. And there’s no one still alive who did fight with him a long time ago. He’s the great prince.”&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>BAMBI</strong>

His coat was aflame with a deep dark red, but his face shone silver-grey; and a powerful, black pearled crown extended high above his playful ears.</p>

Bambi strained his ears, but he heard no steps moving away from him, no leaf being disturbed. That made him suppose the elder must still be quite near to him, and he smelt the air on every side. He learned nothing from that. Bambi sighed in relief as he was once more alone, but at the same time he yearned to see the old stag again and to make sure he was not displeased with him.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then his mother arrived but Bambi said nothing about his meeting with the elder. Nor did he ever call for her, now, when she was out of sight. He thought about the old stag when he wandered about on his own; he felt a powerful wish to come across him. Then he would say to him, “See? I’m not calling for anyone.” And the elder would praise him. He did speak to Gobo and Faline though, the next time they were together on the meadow. They listened with excitement and they had no experience of their own that could compare with this. “Weren’t you scared?” asked Gobo excitedly. Yes! Bambi admitted, he had been scared. Just a little bit. “I’d have been terribly scared,” Gobo told him. Bambi answered that no, he had not been very scared, because the elder had been so majestic. Gobo told him, “That wouldn’t have been much help for me. I’d have been too scared even to look at him. When I get scared everything flickers in front of my eyes, so that I can’t see anything and&nbsp;my heart beats so hard that I can’t breathe.” What Bambi had told them made Faline very thoughtful and she said nothing.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The next time they met, though, Gobo and Faline rushed to him in great leaps and bounds. They were alone once more, as was Bambi. “We’ve been looking for you for ages,” declared Gobo. “Yes,” said Faline with an air of importance, “as now we know exactly who it was that you saw.” Bambi was so keen to know he jumped in the air. “Who ...!?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Faline took pleasure in saying, “It was the old prince.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“How do you know that?” Bambi wanted to know.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Our mother told us!” retorted Faline.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Bambi was astonished, and he showed it. “Did you tell her about it then?” The two of them nodded their heads. “But that was a secret!” objected Bambi.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Gobo reacted. He quickly tried to excuse himself. “It wasn’t me. It was Faline who did it.” But Faline cheerfully called, “Oh, so what? Secret!? I wanted to know who it was, and now we do know, and that’s much more interesting!” Bambi was burning to hear all about this, and his wish was satisfied. Faline told him everything. “He’s the most noble stag in the whole wood. He’s the prince. There is no second most noble, no one comes near to him. No one knows how old he is. No one knows where he lives. No one knows who his relatives are. Very few have ever even seen him. Now and then there’s a rumour that he’s dead because he hasn’t been seen for a long time. Then somebody catches a glimpse of him and then everyone knows he’s still alive. No one has ever dared to ask him where he’s been. He doesn’t speak to anyone, and no one dares to speak to him. He goes along the paths where no one else ever goes; he knows every part of the wood, even the most distant corner. And nothing is a danger to him. Other princes might tussle with each other, sometimes as a test or in fun but sometimes they fight in earnest. It’s many years since he fought with anyone. And there’s no one still alive who did fight with him a long time ago. He’s the great prince.”&nbsp;</p>

          <br>
          <strong>BAMBI</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Felix Salten&nbsp;</em><br><br>
Bambi was often left alone now. But he did not have the same fear of it as he had the first time. His mother would disappear, and then, however much he called for her, she did not come. But then she would reappear unexpectedly. Another time, it happened in full daylight. Bambi had been walking for hours through the dense woods and finally began to call. Not so much because he was afraid, but because he did not want to remain so alone anymore, and he felt he would soon be in a terrible state. So, he began to call for his mother.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, there was one of their fathers standing in front of him, looking at him severely. Bambi had not heard him coming and he was startled. This elder stag looked more powerful than the others, he was taller and more proud. His coat was aflame with a deep dark red, but his face shone silver-grey; and a powerful, black pearled crown extended high above his playful ears.</p>
        <p>“What are you calling for?” the old stag asked severely. Bambi trembled in awe of the elder stag and did not dare to make any answer. “Your mother hasn’t got the time to spend on you now!” the elder continued. Bambi was completely cowed by this imperious voice, but at the same time he felt admiration for it. “Can’t you be by yourself for a while? You should be ashamed of yourself!” Bambi would have liked to say that he could be by himself perfectly well, that he had often been by himself, but he said nothing. He did as he was told and became terribly ashamed. The elder turned round and left him. Bambi did not know how the stag left, where he had gone, did not even know whether he had left quickly or slowly. He was simply gone, just as suddenly as he had arrived. Bambi strained his ears, but he heard no steps moving away from him, no leaf being disturbed. That made him suppose the elder must still be quite near to him, and he smelt the air on every side. He learned nothing from that. Bambi sighed in relief as he was once more alone, but at the same time he yearned to see the old stag again and to make sure he was not displeased with him.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then his mother arrived but Bambi said nothing about his meeting with the elder. Nor did he ever call for her, now, when she was out of sight. He thought about the old stag when he wandered about on his own; he felt a powerful wish to come across him. Then he would say to him, “See? I’m not calling for anyone.” And the elder would praise him. He did speak to Gobo and Faline though, the next time they were together on the meadow. They listened with excitement and they had no experience of their own that could compare with this. “Weren’t you scared?” asked Gobo excitedly. Yes! Bambi admitted, he had been scared. Just a little bit. “I’d have been terribly scared,” Gobo told him. Bambi answered that no, he had not been very scared, because the elder had been so majestic. Gobo told him, “That wouldn’t have been much help for me. I’d have been too scared even to look at him. When I get scared everything flickers in front of my eyes, so that I can’t see anything and&nbsp;my heart beats so hard that I can’t breathe.” What Bambi had told them made Faline very thoughtful and she said nothing.&nbsp;</p>

But all of us has got the woods.&nbsp;<br>

It don't belong to me;&nbsp;<br>
The boss he owns the timber - still,&nbsp;<br>
It's there fer me to see.&nbsp;<br>
An', 'twixt the ownin' of the same&nbsp;<br>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Apollo 13: The moon-mission that dodged disaster&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Apollo 13 was NASA's third moon-landing mission, but the astronauts never made it to the lunar surface. An oxygen tank explosion almost 56 hours into the flight forced the crew to abandon all thoughts of reaching the moon. The spacecraft was damaged, but the crew were able to seek cramped shelter in the lunar module for the trip back to Earth, before returning to the command module for an uncomfortable splashdown. <strong>15 ………. </strong>It also illustrates NASA's innovative mind’s ability to work together to save lives on the fly. The Apollo 13 mission celebrates its 50th anniversary this year on April 11.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Apollo 13 astronauts were commander James Lovell, lunar module pilot Fred Haise and command module pilot John "Jack" Swigert. Apollo 13 launched on April 11, 1970. The Apollo spacecraft was made up of two independent spacecrafts joined by a tunnel: orbiter Odyssey and lander Aquarius. The crew lived in Odyssey on the journey to the moon. <strong>16 ………. </strong>Mission controller, Sy Liebergot then saw a low-pressure warning signal on a hydrogen tank in Odyssey. The signal could have shown a problem or could have indicated the hydrogen just needed to be resettled by heating and fanning the gas inside the tank. That procedure was called a "cryo stir," and was supposed to stop the supercold gas from settling into layers.</p>
        <p>Swigert flipped the switch for the routine procedure. A moment later, the entire spacecraft shook. Alarm lights lit up in Odyssey and in Mission Control as oxygen pressure fell and power disappeared. The crew notified Mission Control, with Swigert famously saying, "Houston, we've had a problem." (Note that the 1995 movie "Apollo 13" took some creative license with the phrase, changing it to "Houston, we have a problem," and having the words come out of Apollo 13 commander James Lovell's mouth.) Much later, a NASA accident investigation board determined wires were exposed in the oxygen tank because of a combination of manufacturing and testing errors before flight. <strong>17 ………. </strong>It ripped apart one oxygen tank and damaged another inside the spacecraft. Since oxygen fed Odyssey's fuel cells, power was reduced as well. The spacecraft's attitude control thrusters, sensing the venting oxygen, tried to stabilise the spacecraft through firing small jets. The system wasn't very successful given several of the jets were slammed shut by the explosion.</p>
        <p>Fortunately for Apollo 13, the damaged Odyssey had a healthy backup. It was Aquarius, which wasn't supposed to be turned on until the crew was close to landing on the moon. Haise and Lovell frantically worked to boot Aquarius up in less time than designed. <strong>18 ………. </strong>So, as Lovell and Haise got the lunar module up and running, Swigert remained in Odyssey to shut down its systems to conserve power for splashdown.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The crew had to balance the challenge of getting home with the challenge of preserving power on Aquarius. After they performed a crucial burn to point the spacecraft back towards Earth, the crew powered down every nonessential system in the spacecraft. Without a source of heat, cabin temperatures quickly dropped down close to freezing. Some food became inedible. The crew also rationed water to make sure Aquarius — operating for longer than it was designed — would have enough liquid to cool its hardware down. <strong>19 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>On Earth, flight director Gene Kranz pulled his shift of controllers off regular rotation to focus on managing consumables like water and power. Other mission control teams helped the crew with its daily activities. Spacecraft manufacturers worked around the clock to support NASA and the crew. It was a rough journey home. The entire spaceflight crew lost weight and Haise developed a kidney infection. But the small vessel protected and carried the crew long enough to reach Earth's atmosphere. In the hours before splashdown, the exhausted crew scrambled back over to the Odyssey and powered it up. <strong>20 ………. </strong>However, thanks to safeguards put in place after the Apollo 1 disaster, there were no issues. Lovell, Haise and Swigert splashed down safely in the Pacific Ocean near Samoa, on April 17.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Apollo 13: The moon-mission that dodged disaster&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Apollo 13 was NASA's third moon-landing mission, but the astronauts never made it to the lunar surface. An oxygen tank explosion almost 56 hours into the flight forced the crew to abandon all thoughts of reaching the moon. The spacecraft was damaged, but the crew were able to seek cramped shelter in the lunar module for the trip back to Earth, before returning to the command module for an uncomfortable splashdown. <strong>15 ………. </strong>It also illustrates NASA's innovative mind’s ability to work together to save lives on the fly. The Apollo 13 mission celebrates its 50th anniversary this year on April 11.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Apollo 13 astronauts were commander James Lovell, lunar module pilot Fred Haise and command module pilot John "Jack" Swigert. Apollo 13 launched on April 11, 1970. The Apollo spacecraft was made up of two independent spacecrafts joined by a tunnel: orbiter Odyssey and lander Aquarius. The crew lived in Odyssey on the journey to the moon. <strong>16 ………. </strong>Mission controller, Sy Liebergot then saw a low-pressure warning signal on a hydrogen tank in Odyssey. The signal could have shown a problem or could have indicated the hydrogen just needed to be resettled by heating and fanning the gas inside the tank. That procedure was called a "cryo stir," and was supposed to stop the supercold gas from settling into layers.</p>
        <p>Swigert flipped the switch for the routine procedure. A moment later, the entire spacecraft shook. Alarm lights lit up in Odyssey and in Mission Control as oxygen pressure fell and power disappeared. The crew notified Mission Control, with Swigert famously saying, "Houston, we've had a problem." (Note that the 1995 movie "Apollo 13" took some creative license with the phrase, changing it to "Houston, we have a problem," and having the words come out of Apollo 13 commander James Lovell's mouth.) Much later, a NASA accident investigation board determined wires were exposed in the oxygen tank because of a combination of manufacturing and testing errors before flight. <strong>17 ………. </strong>It ripped apart one oxygen tank and damaged another inside the spacecraft. Since oxygen fed Odyssey's fuel cells, power was reduced as well. The spacecraft's attitude control thrusters, sensing the venting oxygen, tried to stabilise the spacecraft through firing small jets. The system wasn't very successful given several of the jets were slammed shut by the explosion.</p>
        <p>Fortunately for Apollo 13, the damaged Odyssey had a healthy backup. It was Aquarius, which wasn't supposed to be turned on until the crew was close to landing on the moon. Haise and Lovell frantically worked to boot Aquarius up in less time than designed. <strong>18 ………. </strong>So, as Lovell and Haise got the lunar module up and running, Swigert remained in Odyssey to shut down its systems to conserve power for splashdown.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The crew had to balance the challenge of getting home with the challenge of preserving power on Aquarius. After they performed a crucial burn to point the spacecraft back towards Earth, the crew powered down every nonessential system in the spacecraft. Without a source of heat, cabin temperatures quickly dropped down close to freezing. Some food became inedible. The crew also rationed water to make sure Aquarius — operating for longer than it was designed — would have enough liquid to cool its hardware down. <strong>19 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>On Earth, flight director Gene Kranz pulled his shift of controllers off regular rotation to focus on managing consumables like water and power. Other mission control teams helped the crew with its daily activities. Spacecraft manufacturers worked around the clock to support NASA and the crew. It was a rough journey home. The entire spaceflight crew lost weight and Haise developed a kidney infection. But the small vessel protected and carried the crew long enough to reach Earth's atmosphere. In the hours before splashdown, the exhausted crew scrambled back over to the Odyssey and powered it up. <strong>20 ………. </strong>However, thanks to safeguards put in place after the Apollo 1 disaster, there were no issues. Lovell, Haise and Swigert splashed down safely in the Pacific Ocean near Samoa, on April 17.</p>
