          <strong>Chinese Cinderella <em>by Adeline Yen Mah</em></strong>
          <em>&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>[This text is taken from the autobiography.]&nbsp;<br>
<br>
As soon as I got home from school, Aunt Baba noticed the silver medal dangling from the left breast pocket of my uniform. She was combing her hair in front of the mirror in our room when I rushed in and plopped my schoolbag down onto my bed.</p>
        <p>"What's that hanging on your dress?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"It's something special that Mother Agnes gave me in front of the whole class this afternoon. She called it an award."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My aunt looked thrilled. "So soon? You only started kindergarten a week ago. What is it for?"</p>
        <p>"It's for leading my class this week. When Mother Agnes pinned it on my dress, she said I could wear it for seven days. Here, this certificate goes with it." I opened my schoolbag and handed her an envelope as I climbed onto her lap.</p>
        <p>She opened the envelope and took out the certificate. "Why, it's all written in French or English or some other foreign language. How do you expect me to read this, my precious little treasure?" I knew she was pleased because she was smiling as she hugged me. "One day soon," she continued, "you'll be able to translate all this into Chinese for me. Until then, we'll just write today's date on the envelope and put it away somewhere safe. Go close the door properly and put on the latch so no one will come in."</p>
        <p>I watched her open her closet door and take out her safe-deposit box. She took the key from a gold chain around her neck and placed my certificate underneath her jade bracelet, pearl necklace and diamond watch, as if my award were also some precious jewel impossible to replace.</p>
        <p>As she closed the lid, an old photograph fell out. I picked up the faded picture and saw a solemn young man and woman, both dressed in old-fashioned Chinese robes. The man looked rather familiar.</p>
        <p>"Is this a picture of my father and dead mama?" I asked.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"No. This is the wedding picture of your grandparents. Your Ye Ye was twenty-six and your Nai Nai was only fifteen." She quickly took the photo from me and locked it into her box.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Do you have a picture of my dead mama?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She avoided my eyes. "No. But I have wedding pictures of your father and your stepmother, Niang. You were only one year old when they married. Do you want to see them?"</p>
        <p>"No. I've seen those before. I just want to see one of my own mama. Do I look like her?" Aunt Baba did not reply, but busied herself with putting the safe-deposit box back into her closet. After a while I said, "When did my mama die?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Your mother came down with a high fever three days after you were born. She died when you were two weeks old…" She hesitated for a moment, then exclaimed suddenly, "How dirty your hands are! Have you been playing in that sandbox at school again? Go wash them at once! Then come back and do your homework!"</p>
        <p>I did as I was told. Though I was only four years old, I understood I should not ask Aunt Baba too many questions about my dead mama. Big Sister once told me, "Aunt Baba and Mama used to be best friends. A long time ago, they worked together in a bank in Shanghai owned by our grandaunt, the youngest sister of Grandfather Ye Ye. But then Mama died giving birth to you. If you had not been born, Mama would still be alive. She died because of you. You are bad luck."<br>
<br>
A Tianjin Family&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At the time of my birth, Big Sister was six and a half years old. My three brothers were five, four and three. They blamed me for causing Mama's death and never forgave me.</p>
        <p>A year later, Father remarried. Our stepmother, whom we called Niang, was a seventeenyear-old Eurasian beauty fourteen years his junior. Father always introduced her to his friends as his French wife, though she was actually half French and half Chinese. Besides Chinese, she also spoke French and English. She was almost as tall as Father, stood very straight and dressed only in French clothes, many of which came from Paris. Her thick, wavy black hair never had a curl out of place. Her large, dark brown eyes were fringed with long, thick lashes. She wore heavy makeup, expensive French perfume and many diamonds and pearls. Grandmother Nai Nai told us to call her Niang, Chinese term for mother.</p>
        <p>One year after their wedding, they had a son (Fourth Brother), followed by a daughter (Little Sister). There were now seven of us, five children from Father's first wife and two from our stepmother Niang.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Besides Father and Niang, we lived with our Grandfather Ye Ye, Grandmother Nai Nai and Aunt Baba in a big house in the French concession of Tianjin, a port city on the northeast coast of China. Aunt Baba was the older sister of our father. Because she was meek, shy and unmarried and had no money of her own, they ordered her to take care of me. From an early age, I slept in a crib in her room. This suited me well because I grew to know her better and better. Besides a room, we came to share a life apart from the rest of our family. Under the circumstances, perhaps it was inevitable that, in time, we came to care for each other very deeply.</p>

Always with a smile or a broad grin.&nbsp;<br>
And during a trot, a giggle would begin.&nbsp;<br>
Yet never losing her grip<br>
The stirrups and reins held taut&nbsp;<br>
Round and round they rode&nbsp;<br>
Bareback or saddle&nbsp;<br>
Arena or trail&nbsp;<br>
They were as one... whether rain or shine.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
When the horse did tire&nbsp;<br>
the little girl would dismount&nbsp;<br>
Then with care, washed Cheyenne's hair,&nbsp;<br>
Brushed her from the tip to tail.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Oh yes, Cheyenne loved this little girl,&nbsp;<br>
Especially when she braided her mane and tail.&nbsp;<br>
When finished, she led her to her stall&nbsp;<br>
Cheyenne was fed the best of all&nbsp;<br>
and treats were always there.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="txt-underline"><strong>The little girl's heart was as big as this beautiful mare.</strong></span><br>
Yes, I had this dream... I saw it first-hand.&nbsp;<br>
The little girl was my daughter.&nbsp;<br>
And, her horse's name was Cheyenne!</p>

        <p><em>Read the poem below by William M Roemer then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>I Had This Dream&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
A little girl was riding&nbsp;<br>
the most beautiful painted scene I ever saw.&nbsp;<br>
The painted scene was called Cheyenne;&nbsp;<br>
A beautiful brown and white mare.&nbsp;<br>
The little girl rode her like the wind,&nbsp;<br>
as if she was floating on a cloud.&nbsp;<br>
Always with a smile or a broad grin.&nbsp;<br>
And during a trot, a giggle would begin.&nbsp;<br>
Yet never losing her grip<br>
The stirrups and reins held taut&nbsp;<br>
Round and round they rode&nbsp;<br>
Bareback or saddle&nbsp;<br>
Arena or trail&nbsp;<br>
They were as one... whether rain or shine.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
When the horse did tire&nbsp;<br>
the little girl would dismount&nbsp;<br>
Then with care, washed Cheyenne's hair,&nbsp;<br>
Brushed her from the tip to tail.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Oh yes, Cheyenne loved this little girl,&nbsp;<br>
Especially when she braided her mane and tail.&nbsp;<br>
When finished, she led her to her stall&nbsp;<br>
Cheyenne was fed the best of all&nbsp;<br>
and treats were always there.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="txt-underline"><strong>The little girl's heart was as big as this beautiful mare.</strong></span><br>
Yes, I had this dream... I saw it first-hand.&nbsp;<br>
The little girl was my daughter.&nbsp;<br>
And, her horse's name was Cheyenne!</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Amelia Earhart&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Amelia Earhart was born on July 24, 1897 in Atchison, Kansas. <strong>12 ……….</strong> She spent a lot of her childhood playing with her younger sister Muriel. Growing up Amelia and her sister had all sorts of adventures.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amelia's first "flight" was when she was just seven years old. With the help of Muriel and her uncle she made a homemade roller coaster. After crashing dramatically she told her sister that it "was just like flying". <strong>13 ……….</strong> She had no interest in flying and didn't think much of the plane at the time.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After graduating from high school, Amelia wasn't sure what she wanted to do. She first went to the Ogontz School in Pennsylvania, but dropped out to become a nurse's aide tending wounded soldiers from World War I. Then she studied to become a mechanic, but soon was back in school studying for a career in medicine. Eventually she decided to go into medical research. That is, until she took her first plane flight.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On December 28, 1920 Amelia and her father visited an air show in California. Amelia went on her first plane flight that day. She later said that "I knew I had to fly" as soon as the plane was just a few hundred feet off the ground. Amelia worked hard and, together with some money from her mother, she was able to pay for flying lessons. Eventually she purchased her own plane. A bright yellow airplane she nicknamed the "Canary". <strong>14 ………</strong></p>
        <p>In 1928 Amelia was invited to take part in a historic flight across the Atlantic. Together with pilot Bill Stultz and co-pilot Slim Gordon, Amelia flew across the Atlantic Ocean in the airplane Friendship. Amelia was the navigator on the flight. On June 18, 1928 after twenty one hours of flying, the plane landed in Wales. She was the first woman to make the flight across the Atlantic. Earhart was received back in the United States as a hero.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>15 ……….</strong> She wanted to make the same trip across the Atlantic, but this time she wanted to pilot the plane and make the flight by herself. On May 20, 1932 she took off from Harbour Grace, Newfoundland aboard a bright red single engine Lockheed Vega airplane. She intended to make the same flight that Charles Lindbergh had made five years before and fly to Paris, France. The flight was very dangerous. There was bad weather, thick clouds, and often her windshield and wings were covered with ice. Fourteen hours later she had crossed the Atlantic Ocean, but had to cut the flight short, landing in a cow pasture in Londonderry, Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p>Amelia became only the second person after Charles Lindbergh to successfully fly across the Atlantic Ocean solo. She received many awards including becoming the first woman to receive the Distinguished Flying Cross from Congress.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amelia continued to fly over the next several years. She broke many records including being the first person to fly solo from Hawaii to California. Amelia wrote and gave speeches about flying and women's rights. <strong>16 ……….</strong> On June 1, 1937 Amelia and Fred Noonan, her navigator, took off from Miami, Florida. They flew a number of flights, eventually getting all the way across Africa and Asia to New Guinea in the South Pacific. On July 2nd they took off from New Guinea to fly to Howland Island in the Pacific Ocean. <strong>17 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>The United States government searched for Amelia and her plane for several weeks, but they could not find them. There have been a lot of theories about what happened to the flight, but no one really knows and her plane has never been found.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Amelia Earhart&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Amelia Earhart was born on July 24, 1897 in Atchison, Kansas. <strong>12 ……….</strong> She spent a lot of her childhood playing with her younger sister Muriel. Growing up Amelia and her sister had all sorts of adventures.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amelia's first "flight" was when she was just seven years old. With the help of Muriel and her uncle she made a homemade roller coaster. After crashing dramatically she told her sister that it "was just like flying". <strong>13 ……….</strong> She had no interest in flying and didn't think much of the plane at the time.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After graduating from high school, Amelia wasn't sure what she wanted to do. She first went to the Ogontz School in Pennsylvania, but dropped out to become a nurse's aide tending wounded soldiers from World War I. Then she studied to become a mechanic, but soon was back in school studying for a career in medicine. Eventually she decided to go into medical research. That is, until she took her first plane flight.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On December 28, 1920 Amelia and her father visited an air show in California. Amelia went on her first plane flight that day. She later said that "I knew I had to fly" as soon as the plane was just a few hundred feet off the ground. Amelia worked hard and, together with some money from her mother, she was able to pay for flying lessons. Eventually she purchased her own plane. A bright yellow airplane she nicknamed the "Canary". <strong>14 ………</strong></p>
        <p>In 1928 Amelia was invited to take part in a historic flight across the Atlantic. Together with pilot Bill Stultz and co-pilot Slim Gordon, Amelia flew across the Atlantic Ocean in the airplane Friendship. Amelia was the navigator on the flight. On June 18, 1928 after twenty one hours of flying, the plane landed in Wales. She was the first woman to make the flight across the Atlantic. Earhart was received back in the United States as a hero.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>15 ……….</strong> She wanted to make the same trip across the Atlantic, but this time she wanted to pilot the plane and make the flight by herself. On May 20, 1932 she took off from Harbour Grace, Newfoundland aboard a bright red single engine Lockheed Vega airplane. She intended to make the same flight that Charles Lindbergh had made five years before and fly to Paris, France. The flight was very dangerous. There was bad weather, thick clouds, and often her windshield and wings were covered with ice. Fourteen hours later she had crossed the Atlantic Ocean, but had to cut the flight short, landing in a cow pasture in Londonderry, Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p>Amelia became only the second person after Charles Lindbergh to successfully fly across the Atlantic Ocean solo. She received many awards including becoming the first woman to receive the Distinguished Flying Cross from Congress.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amelia continued to fly over the next several years. She broke many records including being the first person to fly solo from Hawaii to California. Amelia wrote and gave speeches about flying and women's rights. <strong>16 ……….</strong> On June 1, 1937 Amelia and Fred Noonan, her navigator, took off from Miami, Florida. They flew a number of flights, eventually getting all the way across Africa and Asia to New Guinea in the South Pacific. On July 2nd they took off from New Guinea to fly to Howland Island in the Pacific Ocean. <strong>17 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>The United States government searched for Amelia and her plane for several weeks, but they could not find them. There have been a lot of theories about what happened to the flight, but no one really knows and her plane has never been found.</p>

She intended to make the same flight that Charles Lindbergh had made five years before and fly to Paris, France. The flight was very dangerous. There was bad weather, thick clouds, and often her windshield and wings were covered with ice. Fourteen hours later she had crossed the Atlantic Ocean, but had to cut the flight short, landing in a cow pasture in Londonderry, Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p>Amelia became only the second person after Charles Lindbergh to successfully fly across the Atlantic Ocean solo. She received many awards including becoming the first woman to receive the Distinguished Flying Cross from Congress.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amelia continued to fly over the next several years. She broke many records including being the first person to fly solo from Hawaii to California. Amelia wrote and gave speeches about flying and women's rights. <strong>16 ……….</strong> On June 1, 1937 Amelia and Fred Noonan, her navigator, took off from Miami, Florida. They flew a number of flights, eventually getting all the way across Africa and Asia to New Guinea in the South Pacific. On July 2nd they took off from New Guinea to fly to Howland Island in the Pacific Ocean. <strong>17 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>The United States government searched for Amelia and her plane for several weeks, but they could not find them. There have been a lot of theories about what happened to the flight, but no one really knows and her plane has never been found.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Amelia Earhart&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Amelia Earhart was born on July 24, 1897 in Atchison, Kansas. <strong>12 ……….</strong> She spent a lot of her childhood playing with her younger sister Muriel. Growing up Amelia and her sister had all sorts of adventures.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amelia's first "flight" was when she was just seven years old. With the help of Muriel and her uncle she made a homemade roller coaster. After crashing dramatically she told her sister that it "was just like flying". <strong>13 ……….</strong> She had no interest in flying and didn't think much of the plane at the time.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After graduating from high school, Amelia wasn't sure what she wanted to do. She first went to the Ogontz School in Pennsylvania, but dropped out to become a nurse's aide tending wounded soldiers from World War I. Then she studied to become a mechanic, but soon was back in school studying for a career in medicine. Eventually she decided to go into medical research. That is, until she took her first plane flight.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On December 28, 1920 Amelia and her father visited an air show in California. Amelia went on her first plane flight that day. She later said that "I knew I had to fly" as soon as the plane was just a few hundred feet off the ground. Amelia worked hard and, together with some money from her mother, she was able to pay for flying lessons. Eventually she purchased her own plane. A bright yellow airplane she nicknamed the "Canary". <strong>14 ………</strong></p>
        <p>In 1928 Amelia was invited to take part in a historic flight across the Atlantic. Together with pilot Bill Stultz and co-pilot Slim Gordon, Amelia flew across the Atlantic Ocean in the airplane Friendship. Amelia was the navigator on the flight. On June 18, 1928 after twenty one hours of flying, the plane landed in Wales. She was the first woman to make the flight across the Atlantic. Earhart was received back in the United States as a hero.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>15 ……….</strong> She wanted to make the same trip across the Atlantic, but this time she wanted to pilot the plane and make the flight by herself. On May 20, 1932 she took off from Harbour Grace, Newfoundland aboard a bright red single engine Lockheed Vega airplane. She intended to make the same flight that Charles Lindbergh had made five years before and fly to Paris, France. The flight was very dangerous. There was bad weather, thick clouds, and often her windshield and wings were covered with ice. Fourteen hours later she had crossed the Atlantic Ocean, but had to cut the flight short, landing in a cow pasture in Londonderry, Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p>Amelia became only the second person after Charles Lindbergh to successfully fly across the Atlantic Ocean solo. She received many awards including becoming the first woman to receive the Distinguished Flying Cross from Congress.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amelia continued to fly over the next several years. She broke many records including being the first person to fly solo from Hawaii to California. Amelia wrote and gave speeches about flying and women's rights. <strong>16 ……….</strong> On June 1, 1937 Amelia and Fred Noonan, her navigator, took off from Miami, Florida. They flew a number of flights, eventually getting all the way across Africa and Asia to New Guinea in the South Pacific. On July 2nd they took off from New Guinea to fly to Howland Island in the Pacific Ocean. <strong>17 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>The United States government searched for Amelia and her plane for several weeks, but they could not find them. There have been a lot of theories about what happened to the flight, but no one really knows and her plane has never been found.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Amelia Earhart&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Amelia Earhart was born on July 24, 1897 in Atchison, Kansas. <strong>12 ……….</strong> She spent a lot of her childhood playing with her younger sister Muriel. Growing up Amelia and her sister had all sorts of adventures.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amelia's first "flight" was when she was just seven years old. With the help of Muriel and her uncle she made a homemade roller coaster. After crashing dramatically she told her sister that it "was just like flying". <strong>13 ……….</strong> She had no interest in flying and didn't think much of the plane at the time.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>After graduating from high school, Amelia wasn't sure what she wanted to do. She first went to the Ogontz School in Pennsylvania, but dropped out to become a nurse's aide tending wounded soldiers from World War I. Then she studied to become a mechanic, but soon was back in school studying for a career in medicine. Eventually she decided to go into medical research. That is, until she took her first plane flight.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On December 28, 1920 Amelia and her father visited an air show in California. Amelia went on her first plane flight that day. She later said that "I knew I had to fly" as soon as the plane was just a few hundred feet off the ground. Amelia worked hard and, together with some money from her mother, she was able to pay for flying lessons. Eventually she purchased her own plane. A bright yellow airplane she nicknamed the "Canary". <strong>14 ………</strong></p>
        <p>In 1928 Amelia was invited to take part in a historic flight across the Atlantic. Together with pilot Bill Stultz and co-pilot Slim Gordon, Amelia flew across the Atlantic Ocean in the airplane Friendship. Amelia was the navigator on the flight. On June 18, 1928 after twenty one hours of flying, the plane landed in Wales. She was the first woman to make the flight across the Atlantic. Earhart was received back in the United States as a hero.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>15 ……….</strong> She wanted to make the same trip across the Atlantic, but this time she wanted to pilot the plane and make the flight by herself. On May 20, 1932 she took off from Harbour Grace, Newfoundland aboard a bright red single engine Lockheed Vega airplane. She intended to make the same flight that Charles Lindbergh had made five years before and fly to Paris, France. The flight was very dangerous. There was bad weather, thick clouds, and often her windshield and wings were covered with ice. Fourteen hours later she had crossed the Atlantic Ocean, but had to cut the flight short, landing in a cow pasture in Londonderry, Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p>Amelia became only the second person after Charles Lindbergh to successfully fly across the Atlantic Ocean solo. She received many awards including becoming the first woman to receive the Distinguished Flying Cross from Congress.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Amelia continued to fly over the next several years. She broke many records including being the first person to fly solo from Hawaii to California. Amelia wrote and gave speeches about flying and women's rights. <strong>16 ……….</strong> On June 1, 1937 Amelia and Fred Noonan, her navigator, took off from Miami, Florida. They flew a number of flights, eventually getting all the way across Africa and Asia to New Guinea in the South Pacific. On July 2nd they took off from New Guinea to fly to Howland Island in the Pacific Ocean. <strong>17 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>The United States government searched for Amelia and her plane for several weeks, but they could not find them. There have been a lot of theories about what happened to the flight, but no one really knows and her plane has never been found.</p>

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
The story of the sad elephants is a true story that still has no explanation. It just happened and we still have no idea why.<br>
<br>
A man named Anthony Lawrence was given a herd of elephants that nobody wanted because they were so wild. Nana, the matriarch of the herd continually tried to tear down the fence around the reserve. According to the story of the sad elephants, Lawrence would stand in front of them and explain the dangers they would face if they left the reserve. At first, Nana became curious but later that curiosity gave way to love. As a result, they stopped being a herd of rebellious elephants and became great friends with their caretaker, Anthony.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
In 2012, Anthony Lawrence died from a heart attack. Thus began a most amazing event. Two days after his death, the wild elephants began to arrive at his home. They were all there within a day. A total of 31 elephants walked more than 20 kilometres to get there. They surrounded the house, and stayed there for two days, without eating or drinking during that time. Maybe this was their way of saying goodbye to their great friend. On the third day, they left with the same solemnity with which they had arrived.<br>
<br>
Nobody can explain how they found out about Anthony’s death.<br>
<br>

Modoc: The True Story of the Greatest Elephant That Ever Lived.<br>
A captivating true story of loyalty, friendship, and high adventure that spans several decades and three continents, Modoc is one of the most remarkable true stories ever told, perfect for fans of The Zookeeper's Wife or Water for Elephants.<br>
<br>
Raised together in a small German circus town, a boy and an elephant formed a bond that would last their entire lives, and would be tested time and again: through a near-fatal shipwreck in the Indian Ocean, an apprenticeship with the legendary Mahout elephant trainers in the Indian teak forests, and their eventual rise to circus stardom in 1940s New York City.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
"Once I started this incomparable story, I couldn't put it down, and I cannot get it out of my mind--nor will I ever. The message of what can be accomplished by training through affection and joy will thrill all animal lovers." -- Betty White.<br>
<br>
As the African Sun-Times put it, Modoc is "heartwarming... probably the greatest love story ever told."<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
The more I read about the massive elephant brain, the more convinced I've become, as Graeme Shannon of Sussex University says, "there seems to be something going on there". He was talking about elephants in Kenya being able to distinguish between different languages – English, safe, the language of tourists clicking cameras; Maa – potentially dangerous, the language of the Maasai warriors who occasionally kill elephants; and Swahili, generally safe. The elephants seemed anxious when someone spoke Maa; the moment she switched to Swahili, they became calm.<br>
<br>
Animal psychologist Karen McComb, also at Sussex, played back elephant sounds – to discover how many individual voices one animal could recognise. The answer? More than 100. Research in Japan suggests they can count, too.<br>
<br>
But it is the empathy of elephants that stands out, that makes them seem so alike to humans. "What elephants share with humans is that they live in an elaborate and complex network in which support, empathy, and help for others are critical for survival." Prof. Byrne.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
If you want to survive an elephant attack, firstly, look at its ears. If the elephant's ears are pinned back flat, it's about to charge you for real. If an elephant's ears are relaxed, it is probably making a mock charge. Ears that are fanned out are likewise indicative of a mock charge.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Most charges made by elephants are mock charges. That is, the elephant is pretending to charge but is actually testing you out to see if you're aggressive or a non-threat. Look at the elephant's trunk to see if it's curled inward in attack position. During a genuine charge, an elephant will curl its trunk up and inward. If its trunk is hanging loosely down, on the other hand, the elephant is probably only making a mock charge.<br>
<br>
Being able to recognise the difference between an elephant who is making a mock charge and an elephant who is about to trample you may save your life. Start running in a zig-zag pattern if you've noticed the signs of a real charge. A charging elephant can run much faster than you, but if you zig-zag, you might be able to evade it.<br>

The story of the sad elephants is a true story that still has no explanation. It just happened and we still have no idea why.<br>
<br>
A man named Anthony Lawrence was given a herd of elephants that nobody wanted because they were so wild. Nana, the matriarch of the herd continually tried to tear down the fence around the reserve. According to the story of the sad elephants, Lawrence would stand in front of them and explain the dangers they would face if they left the reserve. At first, Nana became curious but later that curiosity gave way to love. As a result, they stopped being a herd of rebellious elephants and became great friends with their caretaker, Anthony.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
In 2012, Anthony Lawrence died from a heart attack. Thus began a most amazing event. Two days after his death, the wild elephants began to arrive at his home. They were all there within a day. A total of 31 elephants walked more than 20 kilometres to get there. They surrounded the house, and stayed there for two days, without eating or drinking during that time. Maybe this was their way of saying goodbye to their great friend. On the third day, they left with the same solemnity with which they had arrived.<br>
<br>
Nobody can explain how they found out about Anthony’s death.<br>

Modoc: The True Story of the Greatest Elephant That Ever Lived.<br>
A captivating true story of loyalty, friendship, and high adventure that spans several decades and three continents, Modoc is one of the most remarkable true stories ever told, perfect for fans of The Zookeeper's Wife or Water for Elephants.<br>
<br>
Raised together in a small German circus town, a boy and an elephant formed a bond that would last their entire lives, and would be tested time and again: through a near-fatal shipwreck in the Indian Ocean, an apprenticeship with the legendary Mahout elephant trainers in the Indian teak forests, and their eventual rise to circus stardom in 1940s New York City.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
"Once I started this incomparable story, I couldn't put it down, and I cannot get it out of my mind--nor will I ever. The message of what can be accomplished by training through affection and joy will thrill all animal lovers." -- Betty White.<br>
<br>
As the African Sun-Times put it, Modoc is "heartwarming... probably the greatest love story ever told."<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
The more I read about the massive elephant brain, the more convinced I've become, as Graeme Shannon of Sussex University says, "there seems to be something going on there". He was talking about elephants in Kenya being able to distinguish between different languages – English, safe, the language of tourists clicking cameras; Maa – potentially dangerous, the language of the Maasai warriors who occasionally kill elephants; and Swahili, generally safe. The elephants seemed anxious when someone spoke Maa; the moment she switched to Swahili, they became calm.<br>
<br>
Animal psychologist Karen McComb, also at Sussex, played back elephant sounds – to discover how many individual voices one animal could recognise. The answer? More than 100. Research in Japan suggests they can count, too.<br>
<br>
But it is the empathy of elephants that stands out, that makes them seem so alike to humans. "What elephants share with humans is that they live in an elaborate and complex network in which support, empathy, and help for others are critical for survival." Prof. Byrne.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
If you want to survive an elephant attack, firstly, look at its ears. If the elephant's ears are pinned back flat, it's about to charge you for real. If an elephant's ears are relaxed, it is probably making a mock charge. Ears that are fanned out are likewise indicative of a mock charge.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Most charges made by elephants are mock charges. That is, the elephant is pretending to charge but is actually testing you out to see if you're aggressive or a non-threat. Look at the elephant's trunk to see if it's curled inward in attack position. During a genuine charge, an elephant will curl its trunk up and inward. If its trunk is hanging loosely down, on the other hand, the elephant is probably only making a mock charge.<br>
<br>
Being able to recognise the difference between an elephant who is making a mock charge and an elephant who is about to trample you may save your life. Start running in a zig-zag pattern if you've noticed the signs of a real charge. A charging elephant can run much faster than you, but if you zig-zag, you might be able to evade it.<br>

He was talking about elephants in Kenya being able to distinguish between different languages – English, safe, the language of tourists clicking cameras; Maa – potentially dangerous, the language of the Maasai warriors who occasionally kill elephants; and Swahili, generally safe. The elephants seemed anxious when someone spoke Maa; the moment she switched to Swahili, they became calm.<br>
<br>
Animal psychologist Karen McComb, also at Sussex, played back elephant sounds – to discover how many individual voices one animal could recognise. The answer? More than 100. Research in Japan suggests they can count, too.<br>
<br>
But it is the empathy of elephants that stands out, that makes them seem so alike to humans. "What elephants share with humans is that they live in an elaborate and complex network in which support, empathy, and help for others are critical for survival." Prof. Byrne.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
If you want to survive an elephant attack, firstly, look at its ears. If the elephant's ears are pinned back flat, it's about to charge you for real. If an elephant's ears are relaxed, it is probably making a mock charge. Ears that are fanned out are likewise indicative of a mock charge.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Most charges made by elephants are mock charges. That is, the elephant is pretending to charge but is actually testing you out to see if you're aggressive or a non-threat. Look at the elephant's trunk to see if it's curled inward in attack position. During a genuine charge, an elephant will curl its trunk up and inward. If its trunk is hanging loosely down, on the other hand, the elephant is probably only making a mock charge.<br>
<br>
Being able to recognise the difference between an elephant who is making a mock charge and an elephant who is about to trample you may save your life. Start running in a zig-zag pattern if you've noticed the signs of a real charge. A charging elephant can run much faster than you, but if you zig-zag, you might be able to evade it.<br>
