<p>The climatology method of weather prediction offers a simple technique for generating a weather forecast. Meteorologists use this method after reviewing weather statistics gathered over multiple years and calculating the averages. They predict the weather for a specific day and location based on the weather conditions for that same day for several years in the past.<br>
<br>
A forecaster could examine the averages for Labour Day in Virginia, for example, to predict the weather for the upcoming Labour Day. The climatology method works when weather patterns remain in place, but in situations where outside factors change the weather frequently, as in climate changes due to global warming, the climatology method is not the best choice for predicting the weather, as it will more than likely not be accurate.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
The analog method of weather prediction is a difficult method to use when predicting the weather because it requires finding a day in the past with weather similar to the current forecast, which is difficult to do. For example, suppose the current forecast indicates a warm day with a cold front imminent in the region of the forecast.<br>
<br>
The weather person might remember a similar day in the past month, a warm day with a cold front arriving, which led to the development of thunderstorms later in the day. The forecaster could predict the same type of weather based on the analog comparison, but even small differences between the past and the present can change the outcome, which is why the analog method may not be the right choice to compile a weather forecast.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
The persistence and trends method of weather prediction requires little to no skill to predict the weather because it relies on past trends. In an ideal world, the atmosphere changes slowly, which equates to a forecast tomorrow that stays the same as today, with a hat tip to the climate's norm for the specific time of year. This method requires only that you stay abreast of current temperatures and conditions and know the region's climate averages.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Numerical weather prediction method relies on computers to predict the weather. Massive supercomputers, complete with software forecasting models, help meteorologists make weather predictions based on multiple conditions in the atmosphere such as temperatures, wind speed, high- and low-pressure systems, rainfall, snowfall and other conditions.<br>
<br>
The weather person reviews the data to determine the weather forecast for the day. The forecast is only as good as the algorithms used by the computer's software to predict the weather. If some of the equations lack precision, they lead to errors. All in all, numerical weather prediction provides the best means to forecast the upcoming meteorological conditions when compared with the other methods.<br>
