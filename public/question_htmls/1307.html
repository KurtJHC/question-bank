        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Book Review – Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</strong>&nbsp;<br><br>
The Philosopher’s Stone is the first in J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series of seven novels that have made her the most successful literary author of all time, selling in excess of 400 million copies world-wide. <strong>12 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>Do the Harry Potter books live up to the hype? When I first began reading the Philosopher’s Stone, I was immediately struck by how good - and laugh-out-loud funny - the humour was. <strong>13 ………. </strong>but Rowling has managed to infuse this book with a lovely wit and charm that will both amuse and delight adults and children.</p>
        <p>Here is an example, with the ending being particularly good:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>"Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large, pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes and thick, blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head.</em>
          <strong>14 ………. </strong>
          <em>– Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig."&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>There are characters in this book that will remind us of all the people we have met. <strong>15 ……….</strong> or a bossy and interfering (yet kind-hearted) girl like Hermione. A large number of the younger readers will also be able to easily identify with Harry, especially with his initial feelings of isolation and not belonging, and then through to his excitement at finally leaving that life behind in favour of one where he belongs and will be happy.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When Harry begins his first term at Hogwarts (a wizarding school) he is not alone in being overawed:</p>
        <p>
          <em>“‘Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight of Hogwarts in a sec,’ Hagrid called over his shoulder, ‘jus’ round this bend here.’ There was a loud ‘Oooooh!’&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>The narrow path had opened suddenly on to the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.”</em>
        </p>
        <p>Hogwarts is a truly magical place, not only in the most obvious way but also in all the detail that the author has gone to describe it so vibrantly. It is the place that everybody wishes they could have gone to when they were eleven. <strong>16 ……….</strong> The story builds towards an exciting conclusion that has the ultimate feel-good factor.</p>
        <p>J.K. Rowling should be commended for getting so many people reading and excited by books. The biggest surprise must be the effect that this novel had on the adult population, both male and female - at the time the books were published many a commuting train was spotted with Harry Potter books providing world-weary workers with a wonderful sense of escapism. <strong>17 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>Is all the hype about the Harry Potter books justified? In a word, yes, the books are a joy to read and possibly the most rewarding young adult’s book since The Hobbit.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Book Review – Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</strong>&nbsp;<br><br>
The Philosopher’s Stone is the first in J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series of seven novels that have made her the most successful literary author of all time, selling in excess of 400 million copies world-wide. <strong>12 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>Do the Harry Potter books live up to the hype? When I first began reading the Philosopher’s Stone, I was immediately struck by how good - and laugh-out-loud funny - the humour was. <strong>13 ………. </strong>but Rowling has managed to infuse this book with a lovely wit and charm that will both amuse and delight adults and children.</p>
        <p>Here is an example, with the ending being particularly good:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>"Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large, pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes and thick, blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head.</em>
          <strong>14 ………. </strong>
          <em>– Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig."&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>There are characters in this book that will remind us of all the people we have met. <strong>15 ……….</strong> or a bossy and interfering (yet kind-hearted) girl like Hermione. A large number of the younger readers will also be able to easily identify with Harry, especially with his initial feelings of isolation and not belonging, and then through to his excitement at finally leaving that life behind in favour of one where he belongs and will be happy.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When Harry begins his first term at Hogwarts (a wizarding school) he is not alone in being overawed:</p>
        <p>
          <em>“‘Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight of Hogwarts in a sec,’ Hagrid called over his shoulder, ‘jus’ round this bend here.’ There was a loud ‘Oooooh!’&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>The narrow path had opened suddenly on to the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.”</em>
        </p>
        <p>Hogwarts is a truly magical place, not only in the most obvious way but also in all the detail that the author has gone to describe it so vibrantly. It is the place that everybody wishes they could have gone to when they were eleven. <strong>16 ……….</strong> The story builds towards an exciting conclusion that has the ultimate feel-good factor.</p>
        <p>J.K. Rowling should be commended for getting so many people reading and excited by books. The biggest surprise must be the effect that this novel had on the adult population, both male and female - at the time the books were published many a commuting train was spotted with Harry Potter books providing world-weary workers with a wonderful sense of escapism. <strong>17 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>Is all the hype about the Harry Potter books justified? In a word, yes, the books are a joy to read and possibly the most rewarding young adult’s book since The Hobbit.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Book Review – Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</strong>&nbsp;<br><br>
The Philosopher’s Stone is the first in J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series of seven novels that have made her the most successful literary author of all time, selling in excess of 400 million copies world-wide. <strong>12 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>Do the Harry Potter books live up to the hype? When I first began reading the Philosopher’s Stone, I was immediately struck by how good - and laugh-out-loud funny - the humour was. <strong>13 ………. </strong>but Rowling has managed to infuse this book with a lovely wit and charm that will both amuse and delight adults and children.</p>
        <p>Here is an example, with the ending being particularly good:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>"Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large, pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes and thick, blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head.</em>
          <strong>14 ………. </strong>
          <em>– Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig."&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>There are characters in this book that will remind us of all the people we have met. <strong>15 ……….</strong> or a bossy and interfering (yet kind-hearted) girl like Hermione. A large number of the younger readers will also be able to easily identify with Harry, especially with his initial feelings of isolation and not belonging, and then through to his excitement at finally leaving that life behind in favour of one where he belongs and will be happy.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When Harry begins his first term at Hogwarts (a wizarding school) he is not alone in being overawed:</p>
        <p>
          <em>“‘Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight of Hogwarts in a sec,’ Hagrid called over his shoulder, ‘jus’ round this bend here.’ There was a loud ‘Oooooh!’&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>The narrow path had opened suddenly on to the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.”</em>
        </p>
        <p>Hogwarts is a truly magical place, not only in the most obvious way but also in all the detail that the author has gone to describe it so vibrantly. It is the place that everybody wishes they could have gone to when they were eleven. <strong>16 ……….</strong> The story builds towards an exciting conclusion that has the ultimate feel-good factor.</p>
        <p>J.K. Rowling should be commended for getting so many people reading and excited by books. The biggest surprise must be the effect that this novel had on the adult population, both male and female - at the time the books were published many a commuting train was spotted with Harry Potter books providing world-weary workers with a wonderful sense of escapism. <strong>17 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>Is all the hype about the Harry Potter books justified? In a word, yes, the books are a joy to read and possibly the most rewarding young adult’s book since The Hobbit.</p>

The undeniable tried and true classic of flooring is undoubtedly timber flooring. Imparting a warm look to any home, and available in a wide range of widths and shades, there's a reason it’s one of the most popular choices on the market. "Wood floors add warmth," says Anne Plumb, general manager at Royal Oak Floors. "They're hypoallergenic, too."<br>

Wood floors come in either solid or engineered timber. "Solid timber is more prone to contraction and expansion than engineered boards," says Anne. "Engineered timber minimises movement as the timber is cross-laminated, then the grain is laid in different directions, so it doesn't contract or expand."<br>
<br>
Solid timber is traditionally laid over timber joists, but both solid and engineered boards can be nailed and glued to the substrate. Laying these boards over ply gives a smooth finish. "Some engineered boards can be laid as a 'floating' floor over a concrete slab," she adds. "This is often required in apartment blocks for acoustic reasons." Grade describes the appearance of knots and general look of the grain. "A board with no visible markings is considered A-grade, and at the other end of the scale is D-grade. Sometimes an A grade timber can be so perfect it looks like laminate, so the grade you choose comes down to personal preference."<br>

Carpet is an ideal choice for those who love the cushion-y feel of plush carpet under your feet, with the added bonus that they're also fantastic for improving your home's acoustic performance and reducing noise pollution. "Soft and warm, carpet creates a luxurious feel," says Anthony Carter, national product manager of Carpet Court. "Synthetic [usually nylon] carpets are great for families with young children or pets," says Anthony. "They've become increasingly popular due to advances in fade and stain resistance."<br>
<br>
Wool carpets are pricier but are "worth the investment as they're exceptionally hardwearing." High-quality brands, such as Cavalier Bremworth, "Possess thicker, softer yarns and create a sense of luxury," says Anthony.<br>
<br>
Pile style is important when choosing your carpet, too. "A cut-twist pile gives a textured appearance and is perfect for high-traffic areas, such as hallways," says Anthony. "A plush pile is luxurious with a velvety appearance and great in bedrooms and living areas. It requires maintenance though, so is not ideal for young families. Textured pile and loop-pile carpets are made from uncut yarn. Strong and wear-resistant, they give a modern look."<br>

<p>Concrete flooring is a popular choice for contemporary homes, especially if you have the opportunity to build from scratch. Cool to the touch, concrete is available in an array of shades of grey and can be mixed with an aggregate stone to create a striking terrazzo- like look. "Get a contemporary look by using a matt sealer, or a classic terrazzo finish with a glossy seal," says David Lakes, director at Lochbuild. "Concrete floors are cost effective and extremely functional – concrete is about as hard-wearing as you can get," says David. "Maintenance is easy, but as with any other floors, clean up red wine spills as soon as possible – it will stain!"<br>
<br>
Concrete can be cold underfoot in winter so consider installing underfloor heating. "Putting a solar hydronic system in the slab will solve this, although this can be expensive." As it's almost impossible to put concrete floors into an existing home, 'Concreate' is a flooring panel manufactured to retrofit. "Concreate panels are installed like a timber floor or tile," says David. You will need a builder to pour a concrete floor. "They should use a laser level to check it as they go," says David. "Make sure it's covered for the rest of the build."<br>

The newer kids on the block, laminate and vinyl flooring has come a long way from their previous counterparts. From an acoustic perspective, they can perform better than timber flooring, and some types of vinyls are even fully waterproof. "High-quality laminates and vinyl have really authentic wood designs with natural surface textures," says national product manager at Quick-Step, Kendall Waller. "Cheaper than timber, they're also extremely durable." "Laminate flooring uses a wood-based panel overlaid with printed images," says Kendall. "This is impregnated with melamine to give durability and colour fastness." Vinyl flooring is PVC-based and available in rolls as well as flexible or rigid planks. "It's soft to walk on, very hard-wearing and completely waterproof," he says.<br>
<br>
Some new laminate floors have a waterproof surface that prevents water penetrating the joints. "These guarantee against water damage for up to 10 years and allow steam mops to be used." "Laminate panels click together over any flat surface and can be installed in a day with low costs. Flexible vinyl planks require specialised preparation and installation before they're glued to the subfloor. The rigid planks are installed like laminate floors and need a lot less sub floor preparation. Special high-density underlays provide a quieter, more solid floor to walk on," says Kendall.<br>

"Concrete floors are cost effective and extremely functional – concrete is about as hard-wearing as you can get," says David. "Maintenance is easy, but as with any other floors, clean up red wine spills as soon as possible – it will stain!"<br>
<br>
Concrete can be cold underfoot in winter so consider installing underfloor heating. "Putting a solar hydronic system in the slab will solve this, although this can be expensive." As it's almost impossible to put concrete floors into an existing home, 'Concreate' is a flooring panel manufactured to retrofit. "Concreate panels are installed like a timber floor or tile," says David. You will need a builder to pour a concrete floor. "They should use a laser level to check it as they go," says David. "Make sure it's covered for the rest of the build."<br>

The newer kids on the block, laminate and vinyl flooring has come a long way from their previous counterparts. From an acoustic perspective, they can perform better than timber flooring, and some types of vinyls are even fully waterproof. "High-quality laminates and vinyl have really authentic wood designs with natural surface textures," says national product manager at Quick-Step, Kendall Waller. "Cheaper than timber, they're also extremely durable." "Laminate flooring uses a wood-based panel overlaid with printed images," says Kendall. "This is impregnated with melamine to give durability and colour fastness." Vinyl flooring is PVC-based and available in rolls as well as flexible or rigid planks. "It's soft to walk on, very hard-wearing and completely waterproof," he says.<br>
<br>
Some new laminate floors have a waterproof surface that prevents water penetrating the joints. "These guarantee against water damage for up to 10 years and allow steam mops to be used." "Laminate panels click together over any flat surface and can be installed in a day with low costs. Flexible vinyl planks require specialised preparation and installation before they're glued to the subfloor. The rigid planks are installed like laminate floors and need a lot less sub floor preparation. Special high-density underlays provide a quieter, more solid floor to walk on," says Kendall.<br>

The undeniable tried and true classic of flooring is undoubtedly timber flooring. Imparting a warm look to any home, and available in a wide range of widths and shades, there's a reason it’s one of the most popular choices on the market. "Wood floors add warmth," says Anne Plumb, general manager at Royal Oak Floors. "They're hypoallergenic, too."<br>
<br>
Wood floors come in either solid or engineered timber. "Solid timber is more prone to contraction and expansion than engineered boards," says Anne. "Engineered timber minimises movement as the timber is cross-laminated, then the grain is laid in different directions, so it doesn't contract or expand."<br>
<br>
Solid timber is traditionally laid over timber joists, but both solid and engineered boards can be nailed and glued to the substrate. Laying these boards over ply gives a smooth finish. "Some engineered boards can be laid as a 'floating' floor over a concrete slab," she adds. "This is often required in apartment blocks for acoustic reasons." Grade describes the appearance of knots and general look of the grain. "A board with no visible markings is considered A-grade, and at the other end of the scale is D-grade. Sometimes an A grade timber can be so perfect it looks like laminate, so the grade you choose comes down to personal preference."<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Carpet is an ideal choice for those who love the cushion-y feel of plush carpet under your feet, with the added bonus that they're also fantastic for improving your home's acoustic performance and reducing noise pollution. "Soft and warm, carpet creates a luxurious feel," says Anthony Carter, national product manager of Carpet Court. "Synthetic [usually nylon] carpets are great for families with young children or pets," says Anthony. "They've become increasingly popular due to advances in fade and stain resistance."<br>
<br>
Wool carpets are pricier but are "worth the investment as they're exceptionally hardwearing." High-quality brands, such as Cavalier Bremworth, "Possess thicker, softer yarns and create a sense of luxury," says Anthony.<br>
<br>
Pile style is important when choosing your carpet, too. "A cut-twist pile gives a textured appearance and is perfect for high-traffic areas, such as hallways," says Anthony. "A plush pile is luxurious with a velvety appearance and great in bedrooms and living areas. It requires maintenance though, so is not ideal for young families. Textured pile and loop-pile carpets are made from uncut yarn. Strong and wear-resistant, they give a modern look."<br>
