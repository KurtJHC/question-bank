        <p><strong>The Champion</strong><br><br><sup><em>1</em></sup>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sandra s tood nervously near t he i ce, watching Angela Martin from the corner of her eye. It was Angela’s first time competing in t he c ity championships, but i f she w as nervous, i t wasn’t showing. She sat n ext to her coach, calmly checking her skates. Sandra remembered her o wn first city championship. She had been so nervous she had wondered whether s he would even b e able to stand. S he was still in high school, but suddenly she felt old. Most of the other skaters were two or three years younger than she was. T his would be her l ast competition. Skating took hours of practice, and Sandra needed to concentrate more on her schoolwork. She was determined to get into a good college.</p>
        <p><sup><em>2</em></sup>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Now skating: Angela Martin,” t he announcer’s voice boomed, filling the arena. Sandra watched a s Angela skated coolly out to the center of the ice. The music started, and Angela began her program. She looked graceful a nd fearless as she landed jump after jump perfectly. “How can she be so confident i n her first c hampionship?” Sandra wondered. When Angela finally spun to a stop back at the center of the ice, the crowd erupted in cheers.</p>
        <p><sup><em>3</em></sup>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sandra was next. The announcer called her name, and she skated onto the ice just as Angela was skating off. For a moment t heir eyes met. Angela seemed almost arrogant. Her expression seemed to say, “ Try to top that.” Sandra half-smiled back. She had to admit that Angela would be hard to beat.</p>
        <p><sup><em>4</em></sup>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sandra was still thinking about Angela when the lights lowered and the music began. She had to skate perfectly. She had noticed only one small slip on Angela’s double axel. The slip had been so minor that Sandra doubted whether the judges even noticed it. Besides, o n a double axel t hey would probably not deduct many points even i f they h ad noticed. Sandra floated through her spins and jumps easily. She d idn’t make any major mistakes, b ut she w as distracted by her thoughts of Angela’s performance. When Sandra finished, she knew s he had made s ome s mall errors. As she skated off the ice, she knew she had lost her title. She f ought back tears a s she stood waiting for the scores.</p>
        <p><sup><em>5</em></sup>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally the scoreboard flashed the final results. Sandra had finished second. Angela Martin was the new city figure-skating champion. Angela’s friends and coach let out&nbsp;a loud cheer and began hugging and congratulating her. Sandra s lowly approached. “Congratulations. You skated very well,” she said, shaking Angela’s hand. Seeing Angela’s tears of j oy, Sandra couldn’t help feeling a little j ealous. Better than anyone, she knew what Angela was feeling.</p>

1&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Angela checked her skates and peered out at the ice. Its smooth, mirror-like surface reflected the flood of lights inside the auditorium. “Soon it’ll all be over,” she thought. The judges would tabulate the scores, and the skater with the most points would be the city figure-skating champion. She glanced at Sandra Collins standing confidently next to the ice. Sandra had been champion for the last two years. “It’ll probably be three after today,” Angela thought glumly.<br>
<br>
2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Don’t worry about Sandra,” Coach Lewis said, noticing Angela’s concerned expression. “Show the judges what you can do.”<br>
<br>
3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Angela nodded as the announcer called her name. She skated out on shaky legs, going through her routine one last time in her mind. One part in particular worried her: the double axel, a jump in which she spun two and a half times and landed backwards. It had taken her months to learn, and she still sometimes missed it.<br>
<br>
4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“I probably can’t even do a single jump right now,” she thought as the lights dimmed and the crowd grew silent. Angela’s eyes met Sandra’s icy blue stare, and a chill crept up Angela’s spine. She realized that Sandra wasn’t nervous at all. “She’s probably never missed a jump in her life,” Angela thought.<br>
<br>
5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;For one horrible moment as her music began, Angela felt frozen, locked in the cold grip of fear. Then she pushed her arms back, slid one skate forward, and began racing over the ice. Suddenly her mind went blank; what was she supposed to do first? Then, as if by magic, she glided gracefully into a spin. Her body had remembered what her mind had forgotten.<br>
<br>
6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Angela made it through several small spins and jumps, but as the double axel approached, she felt more and more anxious. Her heart raced as she prepared to jump. What if she missed? She took a deep breath and leapt into the air, feeling an incredible sense of freedom as the crowd rushed past her eyes in a dizzying swirl. Then, arms out, she landed and—slipped. Her skate slid sideways ever so slightly and her balance wavered momentarily. It had been the tiniest of errors. Had the judges seen it? How much would they deduct from her score?<br>
<br>
7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Angela didn’t even notice the crowd’s loud ovation when she finished. She skated off the ice right past Sandra. As defending champion, Sandra would compete last. As they&nbsp;passed, Angela saw a flicker of a smile cross Sandra’s lips, as if to say, “Too bad.”<br>
<br>
8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Angela watched c arefully a s Sandra skated. She w as extremely confident and very good, but not perfect. Angela noticed a couple of small mistakes. “Will the judges notice?” Angela wondered. Were they as bad as her own mistakes?<br>
<br>
9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Well, second is pretty good,” Angela thought as Sandra skated off to the roar of the crowd.<br>
<br>
10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At last t he scores c ame up. Angela stared i n disbelief. She had done it! She was the city champion! Her eyes filled with tears as people hugged and congratulated her. Sandra came over and shook Angela’s hand. Angela noticed tears in Sandra’s eyes, too. “ Congratulations,” Sandra said. “ You skated very well.”<br>
<br>
11&nbsp; &nbsp; “Thank you,” Angela said. “So did you.” Watching Sandra walk away, Angela couldn’t help but w onder h ow she felt.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>The Champion</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>

11&nbsp; &nbsp; “Thank you,” Angela said. “So did you.” Watching Sandra walk away, Angela couldn’t help but w onder h ow she felt.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>The Champion</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sandra s tood nervously near t he i ce, watching Angela Martin from the corner of her eye. It was Angela’s first time competing in t he c ity championships, but i f she w as nervous, i t wasn’t showing. She sat n ext to her coach, calmly checking her skates. Sandra remembered her o wn first city championship. She had been so nervous she had wondered whether s he would even b e able to stand. S he was still in high school, but suddenly she felt old. Most of the other skaters were two or three years younger than she was. T his would be her l ast competition. Skating took hours of practice, and Sandra needed to concentrate more on her schoolwork. She was determined to get into a good college.<br>
<br>
2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Now skating: Angela Martin,” t he announcer’s voice boomed, filling the arena. Sandra watched a s Angela skated coolly out to the center of the ice. The music started, and Angela began her program. She looked graceful a nd fearless as she landed jump after jump perfectly. “How can she be so confident i n her first c hampionship?” Sandra wondered. When Angela finally spun to a stop back at the center of the ice, the crowd erupted in cheers.<br>
<br>
3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sandra was next. The announcer called her name, and she skated onto the ice just as Angela was skating off. For a moment t heir eyes met. Angela seemed almost arrogant. Her expression seemed to say, “ Try to top that.” Sandra half-smiled back. She had to admit that Angela would be hard to beat.<br>
<br>
4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sandra was still thinking about Angela when the lights lowered and the music began. She had to skate perfectly. She had noticed only one small slip on Angela’s double axel. The slip had been so minor that Sandra doubted whether the judges even noticed it. Besides, o n a double axel t hey would probably not deduct many points even i f they h ad noticed. Sandra floated through her spins and jumps easily. She d idn’t make any major mistakes, b ut she w as distracted by her thoughts of Angela’s performance. When Sandra finished, she knew s he had made s ome s mall errors. As she skated off the ice, she knew she had lost her title. She f ought back tears a s she stood waiting for the scores.<br>
<br>
5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally the scoreboard flashed the final results. Sandra had finished second. Angela Martin was the new city figure-skating champion. Angela’s friends and coach let out&nbsp;a loud cheer and began hugging and congratulating her. Sandra s lowly approached. “Congratulations. You skated very well,” she said, shaking Angela’s hand. Seeing Angela’s tears of j oy, Sandra couldn’t help feeling a little j ealous. Better than anyone, she knew what Angela was feeling.</p>

1&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Angela checked her skates and peered out at the ice. Its smooth, mirror-like surface reflected the flood of lights inside the auditorium. “Soon it’ll all be over,” she thought. The judges would tabulate the scores, and the skater with the most points would be the city figure-skating champion. She glanced at Sandra Collins standing confidently next to the ice. Sandra had been champion for the last two years. “It’ll probably be three after today,” Angela thought glumly.<br>
<br>
2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Don’t worry about Sandra,” Coach Lewis said, noticing Angela’s concerned expression. “Show the judges what you can do.”<br>
<br>
3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Angela nodded as the announcer called her name. She skated out on shaky legs, going through her routine one last time in her mind. One part in particular worried her: the double axel, a jump in which she spun two and a half times and landed backwards. It had taken her months to learn, and she still sometimes missed it.<br>
<br>
4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“I probably can’t even do a single jump right now,” she thought as the lights dimmed and the crowd grew silent. Angela’s eyes met Sandra’s icy blue stare, and a chill crept up Angela’s spine. She realized that Sandra wasn’t nervous at all. “She’s probably never missed a jump in her life,” Angela thought.<br>
<br>
5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;For one horrible moment as her music began, Angela felt frozen, locked in the cold grip of fear. Then she pushed her arms back, slid one skate forward, and began racing over the ice. Suddenly her mind went blank; what was she supposed to do first? Then, as if by magic, she glided gracefully into a spin. Her body had remembered what her mind had forgotten.<br>
<br>
6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Angela made it through several small spins and jumps, but as the double axel approached, she felt more and more anxious. Her heart raced as she prepared to jump. What if she missed? She took a deep breath and leapt into the air, feeling an incredible sense of freedom as the crowd rushed past her eyes in a dizzying swirl. Then, arms out, she landed and—slipped. Her skate slid sideways ever so slightly and her balance wavered momentarily. It had been the tiniest of errors. Had the judges seen it? How much would they deduct from her score?<br>
<br>
7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Angela didn’t even notice the crowd’s loud ovation when she finished. She skated off the ice right past Sandra. As defending champion, Sandra would compete last. As they&nbsp;passed, Angela saw a flicker of a smile cross Sandra’s lips, as if to say, “Too bad.”<br>
<br>
8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Angela watched c arefully a s Sandra skated. She w as extremely confident and very good, but not perfect. Angela noticed a couple of small mistakes. “Will the judges notice?” Angela wondered. Were they as bad as her own mistakes?<br>
<br>
9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Well, second is pretty good,” Angela thought as Sandra skated off to the roar of the crowd.<br>
<br>
10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At last t he scores c ame up. Angela stared i n disbelief. She had done it! She was the city champion! Her eyes filled with tears as people hugged and congratulated her. Sandra came over and shook Angela’s hand. Angela noticed tears in Sandra’s eyes, too. “ Congratulations,” Sandra said. “ You skated very well.”<br>

It was Angela’s first time competing in t he c ity championships, but i f she w as nervous, i t wasn’t showing. She sat n ext to her coach, calmly checking her skates. Sandra remembered her o wn first city championship. She had been so nervous she had wondered whether s he would even b e able to stand. S he was still in high school, but suddenly she felt old. Most of the other skaters were two or three years younger than she was. T his would be her l ast competition. Skating took hours of practice, and Sandra needed to concentrate more on her schoolwork. She was determined to get into a good college.<br>
<br>
2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Now skating: Angela Martin,” t he announcer’s voice boomed, filling the arena. Sandra watched a s Angela skated coolly out to the center of the ice. The music started, and Angela began her program. She looked graceful a nd fearless as she landed jump after jump perfectly. “How can she be so confident i n her first c hampionship?” Sandra wondered. When Angela finally spun to a stop back at the center of the ice, the crowd erupted in cheers.<br>
<br>
3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sandra was next. The announcer called her name, and she skated onto the ice just as Angela was skating off. For a moment t heir eyes met. Angela seemed almost arrogant. Her expression seemed to say, “ Try to top that.” Sandra half-smiled back. She had to admit that Angela would be hard to beat.<br>
<br>
4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sandra was still thinking about Angela when the lights lowered and the music began. She had to skate perfectly. She had noticed only one small slip on Angela’s double axel. The slip had been so minor that Sandra doubted whether the judges even noticed it. Besides, o n a double axel t hey would probably not deduct many points even i f they h ad noticed. Sandra floated through her spins and jumps easily. She d idn’t make any major mistakes, b ut she w as distracted by her thoughts of Angela’s performance. When Sandra finished, she knew s he had made s ome s mall errors. As she skated off the ice, she knew she had lost her title. She f ought back tears a s she stood waiting for the scores.<br>
<br>
5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally the scoreboard flashed the final results. Sandra had finished second. Angela Martin was the new city figure-skating champion. Angela’s friends and coach let out&nbsp;a loud cheer and began hugging and congratulating her. Sandra s lowly approached. “Congratulations. You skated very well,” she said, shaking Angela’s hand. Seeing Angela’s tears of j oy, Sandra couldn’t help feeling a little j ealous. Better than anyone, she knew what Angela was feeling.</p>

America’s “Secret Weapon”</strong><br><br>
Phoenix, Arizona—It was one of the most closely guarded secrets during World War II. U.S. military leaders considered it so valuable, they ordered the men who created it to keep it secret long after the war had ended. And keep it they did—even from their own families. Today the Navajo “code talkers” are no longer a secret. Some 400 Navajos who helped change the course of the war will be honored today when artist Doug Hyde’s sculpture Tribute to Navajo Code Talkers is dedicated. Recruited from the small<br>
towns and reservations of the Southwest, these Navajos outwitted Japan’s top cryptographers. The Navajo code was the only code the Japanese were never able to understand.<br>
<br>
In 1942 there were no wireless phones or satellites for communication. Scientists had not yet learned how to scramble voice messages. U.S. commanders had no choice but to send many orders by radio. Unfortunately radio signals were not secure. Anyone with the proper radio equipment could listen to them. This was a big problem at the start of World War II. Many Japanese soldiers had been educated in the United States and spoke English well. Their ability to understand U.S. radio communications gave them an advantage. In some cases they even pretended to be Americans and gave bogus orders to trick U.S. soldiers.<br>
<br>
The only way to keep information secret was to send it in code. However, the&nbsp;Japanese were able to break U.S. codes almost as fast as the codes were created. The Japanese seemed to know in advance every move the United States made. An unbreakable code was desperately needed.<br>
<br>
Around this time Philip Johnston, an engineer from Los Angeles, read in the newspaper that the military was testing Native American languages as a way to protect radio communications. He immediately contacted the U.S.<br>
government and suggested using the Navajo language. The son of a missionary, Johnston had grown up around the Navajo. He thought their language would be perfect for this<br>
purpose. The unwritten language had no alphabet, and its unique structure was very complex. To anyone who hadn’t spent years learning it, the language was impossible to understand. In fact, Johnston was one of the few non-Navajos who could speak it.<br>
<br>
After a series of successful tests under mock battlefield conditions, the project&nbsp;was approved. Several weeks later a<br>
group of 29 Navajo men began&nbsp;creating the Navajo code. The code was not a simple translation of messages into Navajo. The government did not think that a translation would be safe enough. Instead, the Navajos created a special code from their language. Specific Navajo words were assigned to&nbsp;represent letters in the English alphabet. These letters corresponded to the first letter of the world's English&nbsp;translation. For example, the Navajo word for ant, Wol-la-chee, stood for the letter A. The word base translated into Navajo code was shush (B), wol-la-chee (A), dibeh (S), dzeh (E).<br>
<br>
Not every word in the code had to be spelled out letter by letter. Many common military words were given special Navajo names. For example, the Navajo word for “hummingbird” meant "fighter plane." As a further safeugard, nothing could ever be kept in written form. Each code talker had to memorize the entire code.<br>
<br>
The project was an instant success. The first group of code talkers was soon expanded. Eventually, more than 400 Navajo code talkers would assist in the war in the Pacific. They were&nbsp;considered so important that each was assigned a personal bodyguard. In addition, care was taken to make sure they were never captured. Some experts believe the Navajo code was the key to the U.S. victory. In fact, even after the war the government felt the code was too valuable to declassify. The Navajo code and the Navajo code talkers<br>
remained a strictly guarded secret for more than 20 years.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
It wasn’t until 1968 that information about the heroic role of the Navajos became public. At that time U.S. soldiers were fighting again - this time in Vietnam. It was a conflict many Americans thought was wrong. During this period some people thought it wasn’t right to honor war heroes. This may be one reason it took another 20 years for the Tribute to Navajo Code Talkers to be built. However, this tribute, a large statue of a Navajo man, does more than recognize the contributions of the code talkers on the battlefield. It also honors the important&nbsp;part these heroes played in restoring peace. The figure in the sculpture holds a flute, an intrument traditionally&nbsp;used by many Native American groups to signal the end of war and the coming of peace. It is one message that the Navajo people hope will someday be understood by everyone.<br>

America’s “Secret Weapon”</strong><br><br>
Phoenix, Arizona—It was one of the most closely guarded secrets during World War II. U.S. military leaders considered it so valuable, they ordered the men who created it to keep it secret long after the war had ended. And keep it they did—even from their own families. Today the Navajo “code talkers” are no longer a secret. Some 400 Navajos who helped change the course of the war will be honored today when artist Doug Hyde’s sculpture Tribute to Navajo Code Talkers is dedicated. Recruited from the small<br>
towns and reservations of the Southwest, these Navajos outwitted Japan’s top cryptographers. The Navajo code was the only code the Japanese were never able to understand.<br>
<br>
In 1942 there were no wireless phones or satellites for communication. Scientists had not yet learned how to scramble voice messages. U.S. commanders had no choice but to send many orders by radio. Unfortunately radio signals were not secure. Anyone with the proper radio equipment could listen to them. This was a big problem at the start of World War II. Many Japanese soldiers had been educated in the United States and spoke English well. Their ability to understand U.S. radio communications gave them an advantage. In some cases they even pretended to be Americans and gave <span class="txt-underline">bogus</span> orders to trick U.S. soldiers.<br>
<br>
The only way to keep information secret was to send it in code. However, the&nbsp;Japanese were able to break U.S. codes almost as fast as the codes were created. The Japanese seemed to know in advance every move the United States made. An unbreakable code was desperately needed.<br>
<br>
Around this time Philip Johnston, an engineer from Los Angeles, read in the newspaper that the military was testing Native American languages as a way to protect radio communications. He immediately contacted the U.S.<br>
government and suggested using the Navajo language. The son of a missionary, Johnston had grown up around the Navajo. He thought their language would be perfect for this<br>
purpose. The unwritten language had no alphabet, and its unique structure was very complex. To anyone who hadn’t spent years learning it, the language was impossible to understand. In fact, Johnston was one of the few non-Navajos who could speak it.<br>
<br>
After a series of successful tests under mock battlefield conditions, the project&nbsp;was approved. Several weeks later a<br>
group of 29 Navajo men began&nbsp;creating the Navajo code. The code was not a simple translation of messages into Navajo. The government did not think that a translation would be safe enough. Instead, the Navajos created a special code from their language. Specific Navajo words were assigned to&nbsp;represent letters in the English alphabet. These letters corresponded to the first letter of the world's English&nbsp;translation. For example, the Navajo word for ant, Wol-la-chee, stood for the letter A. The word base translated into Navajo code was shush (B), wol-la-chee (A), dibeh (S), dzeh (E).<br>
<br>
Not every word in the code had to be spelled out letter by letter. Many common military words were given special Navajo names. For example, the Navajo word for “hummingbird” meant "fighter plane." As a further safeugard, nothing could ever be kept in written form. Each code talker had to memorize the entire code.<br>
<br>
The project was an instant success. The first group of code talkers was soon expanded. Eventually, more than 400 Navajo code talkers would assist in the war in the Pacific. They were&nbsp;considered so important that each was assigned a personal bodyguard. In addition, care was taken to make sure they were never captured. Some experts believe the Navajo code was the key to the U.S. victory. In fact, even after the war the government felt the code was too valuable to <span class="txt-underline">declassify</span>. The Navajo code and the Navajo code talkers<br>
remained a strictly guarded secret for more than 20 years.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
It wasn’t until 1968 that information about the heroic role of the Navajos became public. At that time U.S. soldiers were fighting again - this time in Vietnam. It was a conflict many Americans thought was wrong. During this period some people thought it wasn’t right to honor war heroes. This may be one reason it took another 20 years for the Tribute to Navajo Code Talkers to be built. However, this tribute, a large statue of a Navajo man, does more than recognize the contributions of the code talkers on the battlefield. It also honors the important&nbsp;part these heroes played in restoring peace. The figure in the sculpture holds a flute, an intrument traditionally&nbsp;used by many Native American groups to signal the end of war and the coming of peace. It is one message that the Navajo people hope will someday be understood by everyone.<br>

America’s “Secret Weapon”</strong><br><br>
Phoenix, Arizona—It was one of the most closely guarded secrets during World War II. U.S. military leaders considered it so valuable, they ordered the men who created it to keep it secret long after the war had ended. And keep it they did—even from their own families. Today the Navajo “code talkers” are no longer a secret. Some 400 Navajos who helped change the course of the war will be honored today when artist Doug Hyde’s sculpture Tribute to Navajo Code Talkers is dedicated. Recruited from the small<br>
towns and reservations of the Southwest, these Navajos outwitted Japan’s top cryptographers. The Navajo code was the only code the Japanese were never able to understand.<br>
<br>
In 1942 there were no wireless phones or satellites for communication. Scientists had not yet learned how to scramble voice messages. U.S. commanders had no choice but to send many orders by radio. Unfortunately radio signals were not secure. Anyone with the proper radio equipment could listen to them. This was a big problem at the start of World War II. Many Japanese soldiers had been educated in the United States and spoke English well. Their ability to understand U.S. radio communications gave them an advantage. In some cases they even pretended to be Americans and gave <span class="txt-underline">bogus</span> orders to trick U.S. soldiers.<br>
<br>
The only way to keep information secret was to send it in code. However, the&nbsp;Japanese were able to break U.S. codes almost as fast as the codes were created. The Japanese seemed to know in advance every move the United States made. An unbreakable code was desperately needed.<br>
<br>
Around this time Philip Johnston, an engineer from Los Angeles, read in the newspaper that the military was testing Native American languages as a way to protect radio communications. He immediately contacted the U.S.<br>
government and suggested using the Navajo language. The son of a missionary, Johnston had grown up around the Navajo. He thought their language would be perfect for this<br>
purpose. The unwritten language had no alphabet, and its unique structure was very complex. To anyone who hadn’t spent years learning it, the language was impossible to understand. In fact, Johnston was one of the few non-Navajos who could speak it.<br>
<br>
After a series of successful tests under mock battlefield conditions, the project&nbsp;was approved. Several weeks later a<br>
group of 29 Navajo men began&nbsp;creating the Navajo code. The code was not a simple translation of messages into Navajo. The government did not think that a translation would be safe enough. Instead, the Navajos created a special code from their language. Specific Navajo words were assigned to&nbsp;represent letters in the English alphabet. These letters corresponded to the first letter of the world's English&nbsp;translation. For example, the Navajo word for ant, Wol-la-chee, stood for the letter A. The word base translated into Navajo code was shush (B), wol-la-chee (A), dibeh (S), dzeh (E).<br>
<br>
Not every word in the code had to be spelled out letter by letter. Many common military words were given special Navajo names. For example, the Navajo word for “hummingbird” meant "fighter plane." As a further safeugard, nothing could ever be kept in written form. Each code talker had to memorize the entire code.<br>
<br>
The project was an instant success. The first group of code talkers was soon expanded. Eventually, more than 400 Navajo code talkers would assist in the war in the Pacific. They were&nbsp;considered so important that each was assigned a personal bodyguard. In addition, care was taken to make sure they were never captured. Some experts believe the Navajo code was the key to the U.S. victory. In fact, even after the war the government felt the code was too valuable to <span class="txt-underline">declassify</span>. The Navajo code and the Navajo code talkers<br>
remained a strictly guarded secret for more than 20 years.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
It wasn’t until 1968 that information about the heroic role of the Navajos became public. At that time U.S. soldiers were fighting again - this time in Vietnam. It was a conflict many Americans thought was wrong. During this period some people thought it wasn’t right to honor war heroes. This may be one reason it took another 20 years for the Tribute to Navajo Code Talkers to be built. However, this tribute, a large statue of a Navajo man, does more than recognize the contributions of the code talkers on the battlefield. It also honors the important&nbsp;part these heroes played in restoring peace. The figure in the sculpture holds a flute, an intrument traditionally&nbsp;used by many Native American groups to signal the end of war and the coming of peace. It is one message that the Navajo people hope will someday be understood by everyone.<br>

America’s “Secret Weapon”</strong><br><br>
Phoenix, Arizona—It was one of the most closely guarded secrets during World War II. U.S. military leaders considered it so valuable, they ordered the men who created it to keep it secret long after the war had ended. And keep it they did—even from their own families. Today the Navajo “code talkers” are no longer a secret. Some 400 Navajos who helped change the course of the war will be honored today when artist Doug Hyde’s sculpture Tribute to Navajo Code Talkers is dedicated. Recruited from the small<br>
towns and reservations of the Southwest, these Navajos outwitted Japan’s top cryptographers. The Navajo code was the only code the Japanese were never able to understand.<br>
<br>
In 1942 there were no wireless phones or satellites for communication. Scientists had not yet learned how to scramble voice messages. U.S. commanders had no choice but to send many orders by radio. Unfortunately radio signals were not secure. Anyone with the proper radio equipment could listen to them. This was a big problem at the start of World War II. Many Japanese soldiers had been educated in the United States and spoke English well. Their ability to understand U.S. radio communications gave them an advantage. In some cases they even pretended to be Americans and gave <span class="txt-underline">bogus</span> orders to trick U.S. soldiers.<br>
<br>
The only way to keep information secret was to send it in code. However, the&nbsp;Japanese were able to break U.S. codes almost as fast as the codes were created. The Japanese seemed to know in advance every move the United States made. An unbreakable code was desperately needed.<br>
<br>
Around this time Philip Johnston, an engineer from Los Angeles, read in the newspaper that the military was testing Native American languages as a way to protect radio communications. He immediately contacted the U.S.<br>
government and suggested using the Navajo language. The son of a missionary, Johnston had grown up around the Navajo. He thought their language would be perfect for this<br>
purpose. The unwritten language had no alphabet, and its unique structure was very complex. To anyone who hadn’t spent years learning it, the language was impossible to understand. In fact, Johnston was one of the few non-Navajos who could speak it.<br>
<br>
After a series of successful tests under mock battlefield conditions, the project&nbsp;was approved. Several weeks later a<br>
group of 29 Navajo men began&nbsp;creating the Navajo code. The code was not a simple translation of messages into Navajo. The government did not think that a translation would be safe enough. Instead, the Navajos created a special code from their language. Specific Navajo words were assigned to&nbsp;represent letters in the English alphabet. These letters corresponded to the first letter of the world's English&nbsp;translation. For example, the Navajo word for ant, Wol-la-chee, stood for the letter A. The word base translated into Navajo code was shush (B), wol-la-chee (A), dibeh (S), dzeh (E).<br>
<br>
Not every word in the code had to be spelled out letter by letter. Many common military words were given special Navajo names. For example, the Navajo word for “hummingbird” meant "fighter plane." As a further safeugard, nothing could ever be kept in written form. Each code talker had to memorize the entire code.<br>
<br>
The project was an instant success. The first group of code talkers was soon expanded. Eventually, more than 400 Navajo code talkers would assist in the war in the Pacific. They were&nbsp;considered so important that each was assigned a personal bodyguard. In addition, care was taken to make sure they were never captured. Some experts believe the Navajo code was the key to the U.S. victory. In fact, even after the war the government felt the code was too valuable to <span class="txt-underline">declassify</span>. The Navajo code and the Navajo code talkers<br>
remained a strictly guarded secret for more than 20 years.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
It wasn’t until 1968 that information about the heroic role of the Navajos became public. At that time U.S. soldiers were fighting again - this time in Vietnam. It was a conflict many Americans thought was wrong. During this period some people thought it wasn’t right to honor war heroes. This may be one reason it took another 20 years for the Tribute to Navajo Code Talkers to be built. However, this tribute, a large statue of a Navajo man, does more than recognize the contributions of the code talkers on the battlefield. It also honors the important&nbsp;part these heroes played in restoring peace. The figure in the sculpture holds a flute, an intrument traditionally&nbsp;used by many Native American groups to signal the end of war and the coming of peace. It is one message that the Navajo people hope will someday be understood by everyone.<br>

Many Japanese soldiers had been educated in the United States and spoke English well. Their ability to understand U.S. radio communications gave them an advantage. In some cases they even pretended to be Americans and gave bogus orders to trick U.S. soldiers.<br>
<br>
The only way to keep information secret was to send it in code. However, the&nbsp;Japanese were able to break U.S. codes almost as fast as the codes were created. The Japanese seemed to know in advance every move the United States made. An unbreakable code was desperately needed.<br>
<br>
Around this time Philip Johnston, an engineer from Los Angeles, read in the newspaper that the military was testing Native American languages as a way to protect radio communications. He immediately contacted the U.S.<br>
government and suggested using the Navajo language. The son of a missionary, Johnston had grown up around the Navajo. He thought their language would be perfect for this<br>
purpose. The unwritten language had no alphabet, and its unique structure was very complex. To anyone who hadn’t spent years learning it, the language was impossible to understand. In fact, Johnston was one of the few non-Navajos who could speak it.<br>
<br>
After a series of successful tests under mock battlefield conditions, the project&nbsp;was approved. Several weeks later a<br>
group of 29 Navajo men began&nbsp;creating the Navajo code. The code was not a simple translation of messages into Navajo. The government did not think that a translation would be safe enough. Instead, the Navajos created a special code from their language. Specific Navajo words were assigned to&nbsp;represent letters in the English alphabet. These letters corresponded to the first letter of the world's English&nbsp;translation. For example, the Navajo word for ant, Wol-la-chee, stood for the letter A. The word base translated into Navajo code was shush (B), wol-la-chee (A), dibeh (S), dzeh (E).<br>
<br>
Not every word in the code had to be spelled out letter by letter. Many common military words were given special Navajo names. For example, the Navajo word for “hummingbird” meant "fighter plane." As a further safeugard, nothing could ever be kept in written form. Each code talker had to memorize the entire code.<br>
<br>
The project was an instant success. The first group of code talkers was soon expanded. Eventually, more than 400 Navajo code talkers would assist in the war in the Pacific. They were&nbsp;considered so important that each was assigned a personal bodyguard. In addition, care was taken to make sure they were never captured. Some experts believe the Navajo code was the key to the U.S. victory. In fact, even after the war the government felt the code was too valuable to declassify. The Navajo code and the Navajo code talkers<br>
remained a strictly guarded secret for more than 20 years.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
It wasn’t until 1968 that information about the heroic role of the Navajos became public. At that time U.S. soldiers were fighting again - this time in Vietnam. It was a conflict many Americans thought was wrong. During this period some people thought it wasn’t right to honor war heroes. This may be one reason it took another 20 years for the Tribute to Navajo Code Talkers to be built. However, this tribute, a large statue of a Navajo man, does more than recognize the contributions of the code talkers on the battlefield. It also honors the important&nbsp;part these heroes played in restoring peace. The figure in the sculpture holds a flute, an intrument traditionally&nbsp;used by many Native American groups to signal the end of war and the coming of peace. It is one message that the Navajo people hope will someday be understood by everyone.<br>

America’s “Secret Weapon”</strong><br><br>
Phoenix, Arizona—It was one of the most closely guarded secrets during World War II. U.S. military leaders considered it so valuable, they ordered the men who created it to keep it secret long after the war had ended. And keep it they did—even from their own families. Today the Navajo “code talkers” are no longer a secret. Some 400 Navajos who helped change the course of the war will be honored today when artist Doug Hyde’s sculpture Tribute to Navajo Code Talkers is dedicated. Recruited from the small<br>
towns and reservations of the Southwest, these Navajos outwitted Japan’s top cryptographers. The Navajo code was the only code the Japanese were never able to understand.<br>
<br>
In 1942 there were no wireless phones or satellites for communication. Scientists had not yet learned how to scramble voice messages. U.S. commanders had no choice but to send many orders by radio.

In 1933 Myron Scott, a reporter for the Dayton Daily News, saw three boys racing homemade, engineless cars down a hill on a local street. This sight inspired Scott to organize the Soap Box Derby, a coasting race for homemade race cars. Over the next several years, the All-American Soap Box Derby grew into a national event that continues to attract thousands of competitors from across the country.<br>
<br>
<strong>The All-American Soap Box Derby</strong><br>
<br>
<em>1</em> Cliff Hardesty felt his excitement building as he drank in his surroundings. He was actually here in Akron, Ohio, the home of the All-American Soap Box Derby. His eyes followed the long, smooth ribbon of the Derby Downs raceway. The 1,600-foot, cement-covered track was divided into three wide lanes. In just a few days, Cliff and his homemade car would be in one of those lanes, racing for the grand prize. Although there were more than 100 competitors in this year’s derby, only three boys could race at one time. The winner of each heat—as the three-person races were called—would go on to race the winners of other heats, until at last there was only one winner. Cliff didn’t dare dream that he would be that winner.<br>
<br>
<em>2</em> “This race sure has come a long way in the past six years,” a man sitting in the nearby bleachers remarked. “I was in the crowd at the very first soap box derby back in 1933. About 350 boys participated in that race. You should have seen the cars back then. Most of them were made from old crates or heavy sheets of tin. Some of them looked as if they were going to rattle apart.” He chuckled.<br>
<br>
<em>3</em> “In which lane did the winner race?” Cliff asked.<br>
<br>
<em>4</em> “Oh, this fancy track wasn’t used then. In fact, there was no track at all,” the man said. “The boys raced down a big hill. This track here was built just three years ago for the 1936 race.”<br>
<br>
<em>5</em> After chatting with t he man a little bit more, Cliff walked up the hill to the area called Topside, where all the homemade race cars were stored and inspected. He wanted to check on his car. His family had shipped it from his home in White Plains, New York, a few days earlier. Derby guidelines stated that cars had to arrive in time for race officials to look them over and make sure they were safe.<br>
<br>
<em>6</em> Cliff found his car and stood back for a moment, running his eyes over it. It was a beauty. Whether he won the race or not, he knew he had done a good job.<br>
<br>
<em>7</em> Just then a thin man in dark glasses with a clipboard under h is arm walked over to him. “Are you the boy w ho built this car?” The man looked down at his clipboard. “Cliff Hardesty?”<br>
<br>
<em>8</em> “Yes, sir,” Cliff answered with a smile.<br>
<br>
<em>9 </em>The man did not smile back. “Cliff, my name is Mr. Smith. I’ll be very candid with you. The truth is that your car concerns me. The regulations for this event state very clearly that every car entered in the All-American Soap Box Derby must have been built by the boy who will drive it. There can be no help from anyone else.”<br>
<br>
<em>10 </em>“Yes, sir,” Cliff said, still not certain what Mr. Smith was talking about.<br>
<br>
<em>11 </em>Mr. Smith sighed. “Cliff, your car is one of the best we’ve ever seen. Can you honestly expect us to believe that you built it all by yourself ? No one helped you?”<br>
<br>
<em>12 </em>Cliff’s face grew hot as he realized what Mr. Smith was implying. “No, sir. No one helped me. I did everything according to the rules.” He looked Mr. Smith straight in the eye, but his throat felt tight with fear. Was Mr. Smith saying he might not be allowed to race? Would he be <span class="txt-underline">disqualified</span> for building a good car? “Mr. Smith,” Cliff said firmly, “I built this car myself.”<br>
<br>
<em>13 </em>“I’m afraid you’re going to need to prove that,” Mr. Smith said. “We’ve set up a 12-member committee. We’ll ask you questions about how you built your car. We have to make sure that you’ve done everything the way you’re supposed to. If you can satisfy us that your car is legitimate, you can participate in the race.”<br>
<br>
<em>14 </em>Called in front of the committee, Cliff answered question after question about his work on the car. Somewhere in the room a clock ticked very slowly. Cliff watched the faces of the men who would decide his fate. Some of them were easy to read. Others might as well have been carved of stone. The questioning dragged on so long that Cliff began to feel dizzy. At last the committee told Cliff to get some sleep and report back in the morning.<br>
<br>
<em>15 </em>The next morning Cliff was taken to a garage. One of the committee members asked Cliff to reproduce part of his car while they watched. Feeling almost happy, Cliff picked up the tools that had been laid out for him. Finally he would be able to prove that he had built his car. He would demonstrate to the committee members that he had complied with the race requirements and had built his car without any help. He could feel the eyes of the committee members drilling holes in him as he thought about how to begin. Then he decided to pretend he was at home in his own workshop, and he began to work. Soon he was so involved in working on the car, he forgot all about the committee.<br>
<br>
<em>16 </em>After only half an hour, Mr. Smith called o ut, “O.K., Cliff. You can stop.”<br>
<br>
<em>17 </em>Cliff looked up in alarm, but then he relaxed when he saw the smile o n Mr. Smith’s face. “ You’re a very resourceful young man,” Mr. Smith said. “ We can all s ee that you’re building an even better car than the one you’ve entered in tomorrow’s race. Please accept my apologies for doubting you.”<br>
<br>
<em>18 </em>Cliff’s laugh burst from him like air escaping from a<br>
popped balloon. “That’s all right, sir,” he said. “But if you<br>
gentlemen will excuse me now, I need to take my car for a<br>
test run. I plan to win tomorrow’s race, and I want to be<br>
ready.”<br>
<br>
<em>19 </em>Relieved, Cliff eagerly prepared for his test run down the 1,600-foot-long track. He was finally free to do what he had come to Akron for—race his car. As he sped down the track, the car hurtled out of control. His car was wrecked, and Cliff had to be taken to the hospital. Race officials worked all afternoon and through the night to fix Cliff’s car in the hope that he would still be able to race. They didn’t want Cliff’s hard work to have been for nothing.<br>
<br>
<em>20 </em>The next day Cliff was released from the hospital. He was banged up but ready to participate in the race and grateful that his car had been repaired. The victory he achieved that day by winning the sixth annual All - American Soap Box Derby was proof of his talent and of the superiority of his car’s design.<br>

In 1933 Myron Scott, a reporter for the Dayton Daily News, saw three boys racing homemade, engineless cars down a hill on a local street. This sight inspired Scott to organize the Soap Box Derby, a coasting race for homemade race cars. Over the next several years, the All-American Soap Box Derby grew into a national event that continues to attract thousands of competitors from across the country.<br>
<br>
<strong>The All-American Soap Box Derby</strong><br>
<br>
<em>1</em> Cliff Hardesty felt his excitement building as he drank in his surroundings. He was actually here in Akron, Ohio, the home of the All-American Soap Box Derby. His eyes followed the long, smooth ribbon of the Derby Downs raceway. The 1,600-foot, cement-covered track was divided into three wide lanes. In just a few days, Cliff and his homemade car would be in one of those lanes, racing for the grand prize. Although there were more than 100 competitors in this year’s derby, only three boys could race at one time. The winner of each heat—as the three-person races were called—would go on to race the winners of other heats, until at last there was only one winner. Cliff didn’t dare dream that he would be that winner.<br>
<br>
<em>2</em> “This race sure has come a long way in the past six years,” a man sitting in the nearby bleachers remarked. “I was in the crowd at the very first soap box derby back in 1933. About 350 boys participated in that race. You should have seen the cars back then. Most of them were made from old crates or heavy sheets of tin. Some of them looked as if they were going to rattle apart.” He chuckled.<br>
<br>
<em>3</em> “In which lane did the winner race?” Cliff asked.<br>
<br>
<em>4</em> “Oh, this fancy track wasn’t used then. In fact, there was no track at all,” the man said. “The boys raced down a big hill. This track here was built just three years ago for the 1936 race.”<br>
<br>
<em>5</em> After chatting with t he man a little bit more, Cliff walked up the hill to the area called Topside, where all the homemade race cars were stored and inspected. He wanted to check on his car. His family had shipped it from his home in White Plains, New York, a few days earlier. Derby guidelines stated that cars had to arrive in time for race officials to look them over and make sure they were safe.<br>
<br>
<em>6</em> Cliff found his car and stood back for a moment, running his eyes over it. It was a beauty. Whether he won the race or not, he knew he had done a good job.<br>
<br>
<em>7</em> Just then a thin man in dark glasses with a clipboard under h is arm walked over to him. “Are you the boy w ho built this car?” The man looked down at his clipboard. “Cliff Hardesty?”<br>
<br>
<em>8</em> “Yes, sir,” Cliff answered with a smile.<br>
<br>
<em>9 </em>The man did not smile back. “Cliff, my name is Mr. Smith. I’ll be very candid with you. The truth is that your car concerns me. The regulations for this event state very clearly that every car entered in the All-American Soap Box Derby must have been built by the boy who will drive it. There can be no help from anyone else.”<br>
<br>
<em>10 </em>“Yes, sir,” Cliff said, still not certain what Mr. Smith was talking about.<br>
<br>
<em>11 </em>Mr. Smith sighed. “Cliff, your car is one of the best we’ve ever seen. Can you honestly expect us to believe that you built it all by yourself ? No one helped you?”<br>
<br>
<em>12 </em>Cliff’s face grew hot as he realized what Mr. Smith was implying. “No, sir. No one helped me. I did everything according to the rules.” He looked Mr. Smith straight in the eye, but his throat felt tight with fear. Was Mr. Smith saying he might not be allowed to race? Would he be <span class="txt-underline">disqualified</span> for building a good car? “Mr. Smith,” Cliff said firmly, “I built this car myself.”<br>
<br>
<em>13 </em>“I’m afraid you’re going to need to prove that,” Mr. Smith said. “We’ve set up a 12-member committee. We’ll ask you questions about how you built your car. We have to make sure that you’ve done everything the way you’re supposed to. If you can satisfy us that your car is legitimate, you can participate in the race.”<br>
<br>
<em>14 </em>Called in front of the committee, Cliff answered question after question about his work on the car. Somewhere in the room a clock ticked very slowly. Cliff watched the faces of the men who would decide his fate. Some of them were easy to read. Others might as well have been carved of stone. The questioning dragged on so long that Cliff began to feel dizzy. At last the committee told Cliff to get some sleep and report back in the morning.<br>
<br>
<em>15 </em>The next morning Cliff was taken to a garage. One of the committee members asked Cliff to reproduce part of his car while they watched. Feeling almost happy, Cliff picked up the tools that had been laid out for him. Finally he would be able to prove that he had built his car. He would demonstrate to the committee members that he had complied with the race requirements and had built his car without any help. He could feel the eyes of the committee members drilling holes in him as he thought about how to begin. Then he decided to pretend he was at home in his own workshop, and he began to work. Soon he was so involved in working on the car, he forgot all about the committee.<br>
<br>
<em>16 </em>After only half an hour, Mr. Smith called o ut, “O.K., Cliff. You can stop.”<br>
<br>
<em>17 </em>Cliff looked up in alarm, but then he relaxed when he saw the smile o n Mr. Smith’s face. “ You’re a very resourceful young man,” Mr. Smith said. “ We can all s ee that you’re building an even better car than the one you’ve entered in tomorrow’s race. Please accept my apologies for doubting you.”<br>
<br>
<em>18 </em>Cliff’s laugh burst from him like air escaping from a<br>
popped balloon. “That’s all right, sir,” he said. “But if you<br>
gentlemen will excuse me now, I need to take my car for a<br>
test run. I plan to win tomorrow’s race, and I want to be<br>
ready.”<br>
<br>
<em>19 </em>Relieved, Cliff eagerly prepared for his test run down the 1,600-foot-long track. He was finally free to do what he had come to Akron for—race his car. As he sped down the track, the car hurtled out of control. His car was wrecked, and Cliff had to be taken to the hospital. Race officials worked all afternoon and through the night to fix Cliff’s car in the hope that he would still be able to race. They didn’t want Cliff’s hard work to have been for nothing.<br>
<br>
<em>20 </em>The next day Cliff was released from the hospital. He was banged up but ready to participate in the race and grateful that his car had been repaired. The victory he achieved that day by winning the sixth annual All - American Soap Box Derby was proof of his talent and of the superiority of his car’s design.<br>

<em>9 </em>The man did not smile back. “Cliff, my name is Mr. Smith. I’ll be very candid with you. The truth is that your car concerns me. The regulations for this event state very clearly that every car entered in the All-American Soap Box Derby must have been built by the boy who will drive it. There can be no help from anyone else.”<br>
<br>
<em>10 </em>“Yes, sir,” Cliff said, still not certain what Mr. Smith was talking about.<br>
<br>
<em>11 </em>Mr. Smith sighed. “Cliff, your car is one of the best we’ve ever seen. Can you honestly expect us to believe that you built it all by yourself ? No one helped you?”<br>
<br>
<em>12 </em>Cliff’s face grew hot as he realized what Mr. Smith was implying. “No, sir. No one helped me. I did everything according to the rules.” He looked Mr. Smith straight in the eye, but his throat felt tight with fear. Was Mr. Smith saying he might not be allowed to race? Would he be <span class="txt-underline">disqualified</span> for building a good car? “Mr. Smith,” Cliff said firmly, “I built this car myself.”<br>
<br>
<em>13 </em>“I’m afraid you’re going to need to prove that,” Mr. Smith said. “We’ve set up a 12-member committee. We’ll ask you questions about how you built your car. We have to make sure that you’ve done everything the way you’re supposed to. If you can satisfy us that your car is legitimate, you can participate in the race.”<br>
<br>
<em>14 </em>Called in front of the committee, Cliff answered question after question about his work on the car. Somewhere in the room a clock ticked very slowly. Cliff watched the faces of the men who would decide his fate. Some of them were easy to read. Others might as well have been carved of stone. The questioning dragged on so long that Cliff began to feel dizzy. At last the committee told Cliff to get some sleep and report back in the morning.<br>
<br>
<em>15 </em>The next morning Cliff was taken to a garage. One of the committee members asked Cliff to reproduce part of his car while they watched. Feeling almost happy, Cliff picked up the tools that had been laid out for him. Finally he would be able to prove that he had built his car. He would demonstrate to the committee members that he had complied with the race requirements and had built his car without any help. He could feel the eyes of the committee members drilling holes in him as he thought about how to begin. Then he decided to pretend he was at home in his own workshop, and he began to work. Soon he was so involved in working on the car, he forgot all about the committee.<br>
<br>
<em>16 </em>After only half an hour, Mr. Smith called o ut, “O.K., Cliff. You can stop.”<br>
<br>
<em>17 </em>Cliff looked up in alarm, but then he relaxed when he saw the smile o n Mr. Smith’s face. “ You’re a very resourceful young man,” Mr. Smith said. “ We can all s ee that you’re building an even better car than the one you’ve entered in tomorrow’s race. Please accept my apologies for doubting you.”<br>
<br>
<em>18 </em>Cliff’s laugh burst from him like air escaping from a<br>
popped balloon. “That’s all right, sir,” he said. “But if you<br>
gentlemen will excuse me now, I need to take my car for a<br>
test run. I plan to win tomorrow’s race, and I want to be<br>
ready.”<br>
<br>
<em>19 </em>Relieved, Cliff eagerly prepared for his test run down the 1,600-foot-long track. He was finally free to do what he had come to Akron for—race his car. As he sped down the track, the car hurtled out of control. His car was wrecked, and Cliff had to be taken to the hospital. Race officials worked all afternoon and through the night to fix Cliff’s car in the hope that he would still be able to race. They didn’t want Cliff’s hard work to have been for nothing.<br>
<br>
<em>20 </em>The next day Cliff was released from the hospital. He was banged up but ready to participate in the race and grateful that his car had been repaired. The victory he achieved that day by winning the sixth annual All - American Soap Box Derby was proof of his talent and of the superiority of his car’s design.<br>

In 1933 Myron Scott, a reporter for the Dayton Daily News, saw three boys racing homemade, engineless cars down a hill on a local street. This sight inspired Scott to organize the Soap Box Derby, a coasting race for homemade race cars. Over the next several years, the All-American Soap Box Derby grew into a national event that continues to attract thousands of competitors from across the country.<br>
<br>
<strong>The All-American Soap Box Derby</strong><br>
<br>
<em>1</em>&nbsp;Cliff Hardesty felt his excitement building as he drank in his surroundings. He was actually here in Akron, Ohio, the home of the All-American Soap Box Derby. His eyes followed the long, smooth ribbon of the Derby Downs raceway. The 1,600-foot, cement-covered track was divided into three wide lanes. In just a few days, Cliff and his homemade car would be in one of those lanes, racing for the grand prize. Although there were more than 100 competitors in this year’s derby, only three boys could race at one time. The winner of each heat—as the three-person races were called—would go on to race the winners of other heats, until at last there was only one winner. Cliff didn’t dare dream that he would be that winner.<br>
<br>
<em>2</em>&nbsp;“This race sure has come a long way in the past six years,” a man sitting in the nearby bleachers remarked. “I was in the crowd at the very first soap box derby back in 1933. About 350 boys participated in that race. You should have seen the cars back then. Most of them were made from old crates or heavy sheets of tin. Some of them looked as if they were going to rattle apart.” He chuckled.<br>
<br>
<em>3</em>&nbsp;“In which lane did the winner race?” Cliff asked.<br>
<br>
<em>4</em>&nbsp;“Oh, this fancy track wasn’t used then. In fact, there was no track at all,” the man said. “The boys raced down a big hill. This track here was built just three years ago for the 1936 race.”<br>
<br>
<em>5&nbsp;</em>After chatting with t he man a little bit more, Cliff walked up the hill to the area called Topside, where all the homemade race cars were stored and inspected. He wanted to check on his car. His family had shipped it from his home in White Plains, New York, a few days earlier. Derby guidelines stated that cars had to arrive in time for race officials to look them over and make sure they were safe.<br>
<br>
<em>6&nbsp;</em>Cliff found his car and stood back for a moment, running his eyes over it. It was a beauty. Whether he won the race or not, he knew he had done a good job.<br>
<br>
<em>7&nbsp;</em>Just then a thin man in dark glasses with a clipboard under h is arm walked over to him. “Are you the boy w ho built this car?” The man looked down at his clipboard. “Cliff Hardesty?”<br>
<br>
<em>8&nbsp;</em>“Yes, sir,” Cliff answered with a smile.<br>
<br>
<em>9&nbsp;</em>The man did not smile back. “Cliff, my name is Mr. Smith. I’ll be very candid with you. The truth is that your car concerns me. The regulations for this event state very clearly that every car entered in the All-American Soap Box Derby must have been built by the boy who will drive it. There can be no help from anyone else.”<br>
<br>
<em>10&nbsp;</em>“Yes, sir,” Cliff said, still not certain what Mr. Smith was talking about.<br>
<br>
<em>11&nbsp;</em>Mr. Smith sighed. “Cliff, your car is one of the best we’ve ever seen. Can you honestly expect us to believe that you built it all by yourself ? No one helped you?”<br>
<br>
<em>12&nbsp;</em>Cliff’s face grew hot as he realized what Mr. Smith was implying. “No, sir. No one helped me. I did everything according to the rules.” He looked Mr. Smith straight in the eye, but his throat felt tight with fear. Was Mr. Smith saying he might not be allowed to race? Would he be <span class="txt-underline">disqualified</span> for building a good car? “Mr. Smith,” Cliff said firmly, “I built this car myself.”<br>

<em>15&nbsp;</em>The next morning Cliff was taken to a garage. One of the committee members asked Cliff to reproduce part of his car while they watched.

<br>
<em>17&nbsp;</em>Cliff looked up in alarm, but then he relaxed when he saw the smile o n Mr. Smith’s face. “ You’re a very resourceful young man,” Mr. Smith said. “ We can all s ee that you’re building an even better car than the one you’ve entered in tomorrow’s race. Please accept my apologies for doubting you.”<br>
<br>
<em>18&nbsp;</em>Cliff’s laugh burst from him like air escaping from a<br>
popped balloon. “That’s all right, sir,” he said. “But if you<br>

<em>3</em>&nbsp;“In which lane did the winner race?” Cliff asked.<br>
<br>
<em>4</em>&nbsp;“Oh, this fancy track wasn’t used then. In fact, there was no track at all,” the man said. “The boys raced down a big hill. This track here was built just three years ago for the 1936 race.”<br>
<br>
<em>5&nbsp;</em>After chatting with t he man a little bit more, Cliff walked up the hill to the area called Topside, where all the homemade race cars were stored and inspected. He wanted to check on his car. His family had shipped it from his home in White Plains, New York, a few days earlier. Derby guidelines stated that cars had to arrive in time for race officials to look them over and make sure they were safe.<br>
<br>
<em>6&nbsp;</em>Cliff found his car and stood back for a moment, running his eyes over it. It was a beauty. Whether he won the race or not, he knew he had done a good job.<br>
<br>
<em>7&nbsp;</em>Just then a thin man in dark glasses with a clipboard under h is arm walked over to him. “Are you the boy w ho built this car?” The man looked down at his clipboard. “Cliff Hardesty?”<br>
<br>
<em>8&nbsp;</em>“Yes, sir,” Cliff answered with a smile.<br>
<br>
<em>9&nbsp;</em>The man did not smile back. “Cliff, my name is Mr. Smith. I’ll be very candid with you. The truth is that your car concerns me. The regulations for this event state very clearly that every car entered in the All-American Soap Box Derby must have been built by the boy who will drive it. There can be no help from anyone else.”<br>
<br>
<em>10&nbsp;</em>“Yes, sir,” Cliff said, still not certain what Mr. Smith was talking about.<br>
<br>
<em>11&nbsp;</em>Mr. Smith sighed. “Cliff, your car is one of the best we’ve ever seen. Can you honestly expect us to believe that you built it all by yourself ? No one helped you?”<br>
<br>
<em>12&nbsp;</em>Cliff’s face grew hot as he realized what Mr. Smith was implying. “No, sir. No one helped me. I did everything according to the rules.” He looked Mr. Smith straight in the eye, but his throat felt tight with fear. Was Mr. Smith saying he might not be allowed to race? Would he be <span class="txt-underline">disqualified</span> for building a good car? “Mr. Smith,” Cliff said firmly, “I built this car myself.”<br>
<br>
<em>13&nbsp;</em>“I’m afraid you’re going to need to prove that,” Mr. Smith said. “We’ve set up a 12-member committee. We’ll ask you questions about how you built your car. We have to make sure that you’ve done everything the way you’re supposed to. If you can satisfy us that your car is legitimate, you can participate in the race.”<br>
<br>
<em>14&nbsp;</em>Called in front of the committee, Cliff answered question after question about his work on the car. Somewhere in the room a clock ticked very slowly. Cliff watched the faces of the men who would decide his fate. Some of them were easy to read. Others might as well have been carved of stone. The questioning dragged on so long that Cliff began to feel dizzy. At last the committee told Cliff to get some sleep and report back in the morning.<br>
<br>
<em>15&nbsp;</em>The next morning Cliff was taken to a garage. One of the committee members asked Cliff to reproduce part of his car while they watched. Feeling almost happy, Cliff picked up the tools that had been laid out for him. Finally he would be able to prove that he had built his car. He would demonstrate to the committee members that he had complied with the race requirements and had built his car without any help. He could feel the eyes of the committee members drilling holes in him as he thought about how to begin. Then he decided to pretend he was at home in his own workshop, and he began to work. Soon he was so involved in working on the car, he forgot all about the committee.<br>
<br>
<em>16&nbsp;</em>After only half an hour, Mr. Smith called o ut, “O.K., Cliff. You can stop.”<br>
<br>
<em>17&nbsp;</em>Cliff looked up in alarm, but then he relaxed when he saw the smile o n Mr. Smith’s face. “ You’re a very resourceful young man,” Mr. Smith said. “ We can all s ee that you’re building an even better car than the one you’ve entered in tomorrow’s race. Please accept my apologies for doubting you.”<br>
<br>
<em>18&nbsp;</em>Cliff’s laugh burst from him like air escaping from a<br>
popped balloon. “That’s all right, sir,” he said. “But if you<br>
gentlemen will excuse me now, I need to take my car for a<br>
test run. I plan to win tomorrow’s race, and I want to be<br>
ready.”<br>
<br>
<em>19&nbsp;</em>Relieved, Cliff eagerly prepared for his test run down the 1,600-foot-long track. He was finally free to do what he had come to Akron for—race his car. As he sped down the track, the car hurtled out of control. His car was wrecked, and Cliff had to be taken to the hospital. Race officials worked all afternoon and through the night to fix Cliff’s car in the hope that he would still be able to race. They didn’t want Cliff’s hard work to have been for nothing.<br>
<br>
<em>20&nbsp;</em>The next day Cliff was released from the hospital. He was banged up but ready to participate in the race and grateful that his car had been repaired. The victory he achieved that day by winning the sixth annual All - American Soap Box Derby was proof of his talent and of the superiority of his car’s design.<br>

In 1933 Myron Scott, a reporter for the Dayton Daily News, saw three boys racing homemade, engineless cars down a hill on a local street. This sight inspired Scott to organize the Soap Box Derby, a coasting race for homemade race cars. Over the next several years, the All-American Soap Box Derby grew into a national event that continues to attract thousands of competitors from across the country.<br>
<br>
<strong>The All-American Soap Box Derby</strong><br>
<br>
<em>1</em>&nbsp;Cliff Hardesty felt his excitement building as he drank in his surroundings. He was actually here in Akron, Ohio, the home of the All-American Soap Box Derby. His eyes followed the long, smooth ribbon of the Derby Downs raceway. The 1,600-foot, cement-covered track was divided into three wide lanes. In just a few days, Cliff and his homemade car would be in one of those lanes, racing for the grand prize. Although there were more than 100 competitors in this year’s derby, only three boys could race at one time. The winner of each heat—as the three-person races were called—would go on to race the winners of other heats, until at last there was only one winner. Cliff didn’t dare dream that he would be that winner.<br>
<br>
<em>2</em>&nbsp;“This race sure has come a long way in the past six years,” a man sitting in the nearby bleachers remarked. “I was in the crowd at the very first soap box derby back in 1933. About 350 boys participated in that race. You should have seen the cars back then. Most of them were made from old crates or heavy sheets of tin. Some of them looked as if they were going to rattle apart.” He chuckled.<br>
<br>
<em>3</em>&nbsp;“In which lane did the winner race?” Cliff asked.<br>
<br>
<em>4</em>&nbsp;“Oh, this fancy track wasn’t used then. In fact, there was no track at all,” the man said. “The boys raced down a big hill. This track here was built just three years ago for the 1936 race.”<br>
<br>
<em>5&nbsp;</em>After chatting with t he man a little bit more, Cliff walked up the hill to the area called Topside, where all the homemade race cars were stored and inspected. He wanted to check on his car. His family had shipped it from his home in White Plains, New York, a few days earlier. Derby guidelines stated that cars had to arrive in time for race officials to look them over and make sure they were safe.<br>
<br>
<em>6&nbsp;</em>Cliff found his car and stood back for a moment, running his eyes over it. It was a beauty. Whether he won the race or not, he knew he had done a good job.<br>
<br>
<em>7&nbsp;</em>Just then a thin man in dark glasses with a clipboard under h is arm walked over to him. “Are you the boy w ho built this car?” The man looked down at his clipboard. “Cliff Hardesty?”<br>
<br>
<em>8&nbsp;</em>“Yes, sir,” Cliff answered with a smile.<br>
<br>
<em>9&nbsp;</em>The man did not smile back. “Cliff, my name is Mr. Smith. I’ll be very candid with you. The truth is that your car concerns me. The regulations for this event state very clearly that every car entered in the All-American Soap Box Derby must have been built by the boy who will drive it. There can be no help from anyone else.”<br>
<br>
<em>10&nbsp;</em>“Yes, sir,” Cliff said, still not certain what Mr. Smith was talking about.<br>
<br>
<em>11&nbsp;</em>Mr. Smith sighed. “Cliff, your car is one of the best we’ve ever seen. Can you honestly expect us to believe that you built it all by yourself ? No one helped you?”<br>
<br>
<em>12&nbsp;</em>Cliff’s face grew hot as he realized what Mr. Smith was implying. “No, sir. No one helped me. I did everything according to the rules.” He looked Mr. Smith straight in the eye, but his throat felt tight with fear. Was Mr. Smith saying he might not be allowed to race? Would he be <span class="txt-underline">disqualified</span> for building a good car? “Mr. Smith,” Cliff said firmly, “I built this car myself.”<br>
<br>
<em>13&nbsp;</em>“I’m afraid you’re going to need to prove that,” Mr. Smith said. “We’ve set up a 12-member committee. We’ll ask you questions about how you built your car. We have to make sure that you’ve done everything the way you’re supposed to. If you can satisfy us that your car is legitimate, you can participate in the race.”<br>

Cliff watched the faces of the men who would decide his fate. Some of them were easy to read. Others might as well have been carved of stone. The questioning dragged on so long that Cliff began to feel dizzy. At last the committee told Cliff to get some sleep and report back in the morning.<br>
<br>
<em>15&nbsp;</em>The next morning Cliff was taken to a garage. One of the committee members asked Cliff to reproduce part of his car while they watched. Feeling almost happy, Cliff picked up the tools that had been laid out for him. Finally he would be able to prove that he had built his car. He would demonstrate to the committee members that he had complied with the race requirements and had built his car without any help. He could feel the eyes of the committee members drilling holes in him as he thought about how to begin. Then he decided to pretend he was at home in his own workshop, and he began to work. Soon he was so involved in working on the car, he forgot all about the committee.<br>
<br>
<em>16&nbsp;</em>After only half an hour, Mr. Smith called o ut, “O.K., Cliff. You can stop.”<br>
<br>
<em>17&nbsp;</em>Cliff looked up in alarm, but then he relaxed when he saw the smile o n Mr. Smith’s face. “ You’re a very resourceful young man,” Mr. Smith said. “ We can all s ee that you’re building an even better car than the one you’ve entered in tomorrow’s race. Please accept my apologies for doubting you.”<br>
<br>
<em>18&nbsp;</em>Cliff’s laugh burst from him like air escaping from a<br>
popped balloon. “That’s all right, sir,” he said. “But if you<br>

<strong>The All-American Soap Box Derby</strong><br>
<br>
<em>1</em>&nbsp;Cliff Hardesty felt his excitement building as he drank in his surroundings. He was actually here in Akron, Ohio, the home of the All-American Soap Box Derby. His eyes followed the long, smooth ribbon of the Derby Downs raceway. The 1,600-foot, cement-covered track was divided into three wide lanes. In just a few days, Cliff and his homemade car would be in one of those lanes, racing for the grand prize. Although there were more than 100 competitors in this year’s derby, only three boys could race at one time. The winner of each heat—as the three-person races were called—would go on to race the winners of other heats, until at last there was only one winner. Cliff didn’t dare dream that he would be that winner.<br>
<br>
<em>2</em>&nbsp;“This race sure has come a long way in the past six years,” a man sitting in the nearby bleachers remarked. “I was in the crowd at the very first soap box derby back in 1933. About 350 boys participated in that race. You should have seen the cars back then. Most of them were made from old crates or heavy sheets of tin. Some of them looked as if they were going to rattle apart.” He chuckled.<br>
<br>
<em>3</em>&nbsp;“In which lane did the winner race?” Cliff asked.<br>
<br>
<em>4</em>&nbsp;“Oh, this fancy track wasn’t used then. In fact, there was no track at all,” the man said. “The boys raced down a big hill. This track here was built just three years ago for the 1936 race.”<br>
<br>
<em>5&nbsp;</em>After chatting with t he man a little bit more, Cliff walked up the hill to the area called Topside, where all the homemade race cars were stored and inspected. He wanted to check on his car. His family had shipped it from his home in White Plains, New York, a few days earlier. Derby guidelines stated that cars had to arrive in time for race officials to look them over and make sure they were safe.<br>
<br>
<em>6&nbsp;</em>Cliff found his car and stood back for a moment, running his eyes over it. It was a beauty. Whether he won the race or not, he knew he had done a good job.<br>
<br>
<em>7&nbsp;</em>Just then a thin man in dark glasses with a clipboard under h is arm walked over to him. “Are you the boy w ho built this car?” The man looked down at his clipboard. “Cliff Hardesty?”<br>
<br>
<em>8&nbsp;</em>“Yes, sir,” Cliff answered with a smile.<br>
<br>
<em>9&nbsp;</em>The man did not smile back. “Cliff, my name is Mr. Smith. I’ll be very candid with you. The truth is that your car concerns me. The regulations for this event state very clearly that every car entered in the All-American Soap Box Derby must have been built by the boy who will drive it. There can be no help from anyone else.”<br>
<br>
<em>10&nbsp;</em>“Yes, sir,” Cliff said, still not certain what Mr. Smith was talking about.<br>
<br>
<em>11&nbsp;</em>Mr. Smith sighed. “Cliff, your car is one of the best we’ve ever seen. Can you honestly expect us to believe that you built it all by yourself ? No one helped you?”<br>
<br>
<em>12&nbsp;</em>Cliff’s face grew hot as he realized what Mr. Smith was implying. “No, sir. No one helped me. I did everything according to the rules.” He looked Mr. Smith straight in the eye, but his throat felt tight with fear. Was Mr. Smith saying he might not be allowed to race? Would he be <span class="txt-underline">disqualified</span> for building a good car? “Mr. Smith,” Cliff said firmly, “I built this car myself.”<br>
<br>
<em>13&nbsp;</em>“I’m afraid you’re going to need to prove that,” Mr. Smith said. “We’ve set up a 12-member committee. We’ll ask you questions about how you built your car. We have to make sure that you’ve done everything the way you’re supposed to. If you can satisfy us that your car is legitimate, you can participate in the race.”<br>
<br>
<em>14&nbsp;</em>Called in front of the committee, Cliff answered question after question about his work on the car. Somewhere in the room a clock ticked very slowly. Cliff watched the faces of the men who would decide his fate. Some of them were easy to read. Others might as well have been carved of stone. The questioning dragged on so long that Cliff began to feel dizzy. At last the committee told Cliff to get some sleep and report back in the morning.<br>
<br>
<em>15&nbsp;</em>The next morning Cliff was taken to a garage. One of the committee members asked Cliff to reproduce part of his car while they watched. Feeling almost happy, Cliff picked up the tools that had been laid out for him. Finally he would be able to prove that he had built his car. He would demonstrate to the committee members that he had complied with the race requirements and had built his car without any help. He could feel the eyes of the committee members drilling holes in him as he thought about how to begin. Then he decided to pretend he was at home in his own workshop, and he began to work. Soon he was so involved in working on the car, he forgot all about the committee.<br>
<br>
<em>16&nbsp;</em>After only half an hour, Mr. Smith called o ut, “O.K., Cliff. You can stop.”<br>
<br>
<em>17&nbsp;</em>Cliff looked up in alarm, but then he relaxed when he saw the smile o n Mr. Smith’s face. “ You’re a very resourceful young man,” Mr. Smith said. “ We can all s ee that you’re building an even better car than the one you’ve entered in tomorrow’s race. Please accept my apologies for doubting you.”<br>
<br>
<em>18&nbsp;</em>Cliff’s laugh burst from him like air escaping from a<br>
popped balloon. “That’s all right, sir,” he said. “But if you<br>
gentlemen will excuse me now, I need to take my car for a<br>
test run. I plan to win tomorrow’s race, and I want to be<br>
ready.”<br>
<br>
<em>19&nbsp;</em>Relieved, Cliff eagerly prepared for his test run down the 1,600-foot-long track. He was finally free to do what he had come to Akron for—race his car. As he sped down the track, the car hurtled out of control. His car was wrecked, and Cliff had to be taken to the hospital. Race officials worked all afternoon and through the night to fix Cliff’s car in the hope that he would still be able to race. They didn’t want Cliff’s hard work to have been for nothing.<br>
<br>
<em>20&nbsp;</em>The next day Cliff was released from the hospital. He was banged up but ready to participate in the race and grateful that his car had been repaired. The victory he achieved that day by winning the sixth annual All - American Soap Box Derby was proof of his talent and of the superiority of his car’s design.<br>

In 1933 Myron Scott, a reporter for the Dayton Daily News, saw three boys racing homemade, engineless cars down a hill on a local street. This sight inspired Scott to organize the Soap Box Derby, a coasting race for homemade race cars. Over the next several years, the All-American Soap Box Derby grew into a national event that continues to attract thousands of competitors from across the country.<br>

<strong>The All-American Soap Box Derby</strong><br>

In 1933 Myron Scott, a reporter for the Dayton Daily News, saw three boys racing homemade, engineless cars down a hill on a local street. This sight inspired Scott to organize the Soap Box Derby, a coasting race for homemade race cars. Over the next several years, the All-American Soap Box Derby grew into a national event that continues to attract thousands of competitors from across the country.<br>
<br>
<strong>The All-American Soap Box Derby</strong><br>
<br>
<em>1</em>&nbsp;Cliff Hardesty felt his excitement building as he drank in his surroundings. He was actually here in Akron, Ohio, the home of the All-American Soap Box Derby. His eyes followed the long, smooth ribbon of the Derby Downs raceway. The 1,600-foot, cement-covered track was divided into three wide lanes. In just a few days, Cliff and his homemade car would be in one of those lanes, racing for the grand prize. Although there were more than 100 competitors in this year’s derby, only three boys could race at one time. The winner of each heat—as the three-person races were called—would go on to race the winners of other heats, until at last there was only one winner. Cliff didn’t dare dream that he would be that winner.<br>
<br>
<em>2</em>&nbsp;“This race sure has come a long way in the past six years,” a man sitting in the nearby bleachers remarked. “I was in the crowd at the very first soap box derby back in 1933. About 350 boys participated in that race. You should have seen the cars back then. Most of them were made from old crates or heavy sheets of tin. Some of them looked as if they were going to rattle apart.” He chuckled.<br>
<br>
<em>3</em>&nbsp;“In which lane did the winner race?” Cliff asked.<br>
<br>
<em>4</em>&nbsp;“Oh, this fancy track wasn’t used then. In fact, there was no track at all,” the man said. “The boys raced down a big hill. This track here was built just three years ago for the 1936 race.”<br>
<br>
<em>5&nbsp;</em>After chatting with t he man a little bit more, Cliff walked up the hill to the area called Topside, where all the homemade race cars were stored and inspected. He wanted to check on his car. His family had shipped it from his home in White Plains, New York, a few days earlier. Derby guidelines stated that cars had to arrive in time for race officials to look them over and make sure they were safe.<br>
<br>
<em>6&nbsp;</em>Cliff found his car and stood back for a moment, running his eyes over it. It was a beauty. Whether he won the race or not, he knew he had done a good job.<br>
<br>
<em>7&nbsp;</em>Just then a thin man in dark glasses with a clipboard under h is arm walked over to him. “Are you the boy w ho built this car?” The man looked down at his clipboard. “Cliff Hardesty?”<br>
<br>
<em>8&nbsp;</em>“Yes, sir,” Cliff answered with a smile.<br>
<br>
<em>9&nbsp;</em>The man did not smile back. “Cliff, my name is Mr. Smith. I’ll be very candid with you. The truth is that your car concerns me. The regulations for this event state very clearly that every car entered in the All-American Soap Box Derby must have been built by the boy who will drive it. There can be no help from anyone else.”<br>
<br>
<em>10&nbsp;</em>“Yes, sir,” Cliff said, still not certain what Mr. Smith was talking about.<br>
<br>
<em>11&nbsp;</em>Mr. Smith sighed. “Cliff, your car is one of the best we’ve ever seen. Can you honestly expect us to believe that you built it all by yourself ? No one helped you?”<br>
<br>
<em>12&nbsp;</em>Cliff’s face grew hot as he realized what Mr. Smith was implying. “No, sir. No one helped me. I did everything according to the rules.” He looked Mr. Smith straight in the eye, but his throat felt tight with fear. Was Mr. Smith saying he might not be allowed to race? Would he be <span class="txt-underline">disqualified</span> for building a good car? “Mr. Smith,” Cliff said firmly, “I built this car myself.”<br>
<br>
<em>13&nbsp;</em>“I’m afraid you’re going to need to prove that,” Mr. Smith said. “We’ve set up a 12-member committee. We’ll ask you questions about how you built your car. We have to make sure that you’ve done everything the way you’re supposed to. If you can satisfy us that your car is legitimate, you can participate in the race.”<br>
<br>
<em>14&nbsp;</em>Called in front of the committee, Cliff answered question after question about his work on the car. Somewhere in the room a clock ticked very slowly. Cliff watched the faces of the men who would decide his fate. Some of them were easy to read. Others might as well have been carved of stone. The questioning dragged on so long that Cliff began to feel dizzy. At last the committee told Cliff to get some sleep and report back in the morning.<br>
<br>
<em>15&nbsp;</em>The next morning Cliff was taken to a garage. One of the committee members asked Cliff to reproduce part of his car while they watched. Feeling almost happy, Cliff picked up the tools that had been laid out for him. Finally he would be able to prove that he had built his car. He would demonstrate to the committee members that he had complied with the race requirements and had built his car without any help. He could feel the eyes of the committee members drilling holes in him as he thought about how to begin. Then he decided to pretend he was at home in his own workshop, and he began to work. Soon he was so involved in working on the car, he forgot all about the committee.<br>
<br>
<em>16&nbsp;</em>After only half an hour, Mr. Smith called o ut, “O.K., Cliff. You can stop.”<br>
<br>
<em>17&nbsp;</em>Cliff looked up in alarm, but then he relaxed when he saw the smile o n Mr. Smith’s face. “ You’re a very resourceful young man,” Mr. Smith said. “ We can all s ee that you’re building an even better car than the one you’ve entered in tomorrow’s race. Please accept my apologies for doubting you.”<br>
<br>
<em>18&nbsp;</em>Cliff’s laugh burst from him like air escaping from a<br>
popped balloon. “That’s all right, sir,” he said. “But if you<br>
gentlemen will excuse me now, I need to take my car for a<br>
test run. I plan to win tomorrow’s race, and I want to be<br>
ready.”<br>
<br>
<em>19&nbsp;</em>Relieved, Cliff eagerly prepared for his test run down the 1,600-foot-long track. He was finally free to do what he had come to Akron for—race his car. As he sped down the track, the car hurtled out of control. His car was wrecked, and Cliff had to be taken to the hospital. Race officials worked all afternoon and through the night to fix Cliff’s car in the hope that he would still be able to race. They didn’t want Cliff’s hard work to have been for nothing.<br>
<br>
<em>20&nbsp;</em>The next day Cliff was released from the hospital. He was banged up but ready to participate in the race and grateful that his car had been repaired. The victory he achieved that day by winning the sixth annual All - American Soap Box Derby was proof of his talent and of the superiority of his car’s design.<br>

In 1933 Myron Scott, a reporter for the Dayton Daily News, saw three boys racing homemade, engineless cars down a hill on a local street. This sight inspired Scott to organize the Soap Box Derby, a coasting race for homemade race cars. Over the next several years, the All-American Soap Box Derby grew into a national event that continues to attract thousands of competitors from across the country.<br>
<br>
<strong>The All-American Soap Box Derby</strong><br>
<br>
<em>1</em>&nbsp;Cliff Hardesty felt his excitement building as he drank in his surroundings. He was actually here in Akron, Ohio, the home of the All-American Soap Box Derby. His eyes followed the long, smooth ribbon of the Derby Downs raceway. The 1,600-foot, cement-covered track was divided into three wide lanes. In just a few days, Cliff and his homemade car would be in one of those lanes, racing for the grand prize. Although there were more than 100 competitors in this year’s derby, only three boys could race at one time. The winner of each heat—as the three-person races were called—would go on to race the winners of other heats, until at last there was only one winner. Cliff didn’t dare dream that he would be that winner.<br>
<br>
<em>2</em>&nbsp;“This race sure has come a long way in the past six years,” a man sitting in the nearby bleachers remarked. “I was in the crowd at the very first soap box derby back in 1933. About 350 boys participated in that race. You should have seen the cars back then. Most of them were made from old crates or heavy sheets of tin. Some of them looked as if they were going to rattle apart.” He chuckled.<br>
<br>
<em>3</em>&nbsp;“In which lane did the winner race?” Cliff asked.<br>
<br>
<em>4</em>&nbsp;“Oh, this fancy track wasn’t used then. In fact, there was no track at all,” the man said. “The boys raced down a big hill. This track here was built just three years ago for the 1936 race.”<br>
<br>
<em>5&nbsp;</em>After chatting with t he man a little bit more, Cliff walked up the hill to the area called Topside, where all the homemade race cars were stored and inspected. He wanted to check on his car. His family had shipped it from his home in White Plains, New York, a few days earlier. Derby guidelines stated that cars had to arrive in time for race officials to look them over and make sure they were safe.<br>
<br>
<em>6&nbsp;</em>Cliff found his car and stood back for a moment, running his eyes over it. It was a beauty. Whether he won the race or not, he knew he had done a good job.<br>
<br>
<em>7&nbsp;</em>Just then a thin man in dark glasses with a clipboard under h is arm walked over to him. “Are you the boy w ho built this car?” The man looked down at his clipboard. “Cliff Hardesty?”<br>
<br>
<em>8&nbsp;</em>“Yes, sir,” Cliff answered with a smile.<br>
<br>
<em>9&nbsp;</em>The man did not smile back. “Cliff, my name is Mr. Smith. I’ll be very candid with you. The truth is that your car concerns me. The regulations for this event state very clearly that every car entered in the All-American Soap Box Derby must have been built by the boy who will drive it. There can be no help from anyone else.”<br>
<br>
<em>10&nbsp;</em>“Yes, sir,” Cliff said, still not certain what Mr. Smith was talking about.<br>
<br>
<em>11&nbsp;</em>Mr. Smith sighed. “Cliff, your car is one of the best we’ve ever seen. Can you honestly expect us to believe that you built it all by yourself ? No one helped you?”<br>
<br>
<em>12&nbsp;</em>Cliff’s face grew hot as he realized what Mr. Smith was implying. “No, sir. No one helped me. I did everything according to the rules.” He looked Mr. Smith straight in the eye, but his throat felt tight with fear. Was Mr. Smith saying he might not be allowed to race? Would he be <span class="txt-underline">disqualified</span> for building a good car? “Mr. Smith,” Cliff said firmly, “I built this car myself.”<br>
<br>
<em>13&nbsp;</em>“I’m afraid you’re going to need to prove that,” Mr. Smith said. “We’ve set up a 12-member committee. We’ll ask you questions about how you built your car. We have to make sure that you’ve done everything the way you’re supposed to. If you can satisfy us that your car is legitimate, you can participate in the race.”<br>
<br>
<em>14&nbsp;</em>Called in front of the committee, Cliff answered question after question about his work on the car. Somewhere in the room a clock ticked very slowly. Cliff watched the faces of the men who would decide his fate. Some of them were easy to read. Others might as well have been carved of stone. The questioning dragged on so long that Cliff began to feel dizzy. At last the committee told Cliff to get some sleep and report back in the morning.<br>
<br>
<em>15&nbsp;</em>The next morning Cliff was taken to a garage. One of the committee members asked Cliff to reproduce part of his car while they watched. Feeling almost happy, Cliff picked up the tools that had been laid out for him. Finally he would be able to prove that he had built his car. He would demonstrate to the committee members that he had complied with the race requirements and had built his car without any help. He could feel the eyes of the committee members drilling holes in him as he thought about how to begin. Then he decided to pretend he was at home in his own workshop, and he began to work. Soon he was so involved in working on the car, he forgot all about the committee.<br>
<br>
<em>16&nbsp;</em>After only half an hour, Mr. Smith called o ut, “O.K., Cliff. You can stop.”<br>
<br>
<em>17&nbsp;</em>Cliff looked up in alarm, but then he relaxed when he saw the smile o n Mr. Smith’s face. “ You’re a very resourceful young man,” Mr. Smith said. “ We can all s ee that you’re building an even better car than the one you’ve entered in tomorrow’s race. Please accept my apologies for doubting you.”<br>
<br>
<em>18&nbsp;</em>Cliff’s laugh burst from him like air escaping from a<br>
popped balloon. “That’s all right, sir,” he said. “But if you<br>
gentlemen will excuse me now, I need to take my car for a<br>
test run. I plan to win tomorrow’s race, and I want to be<br>
ready.”<br>
<br>
<em>19&nbsp;</em>Relieved, Cliff eagerly prepared for his test run down the 1,600-foot-long track. He was finally free to do what he had come to Akron for—race his car. As he sped down the track, the car hurtled out of control. His car was wrecked, and Cliff had to be taken to the hospital. Race officials worked all afternoon and through the night to fix Cliff’s car in the hope that he would still be able to race. They didn’t want Cliff’s hard work to have been for nothing.<br>
<br>
<em>20&nbsp;</em>The next day Cliff was released from the hospital. He was banged up but ready to participate in the race and grateful that his car had been repaired. The victory he achieved that day by winning the sixth annual All - American Soap Box Derby was proof of his talent and of the superiority of his car’s design.<br>

In 1933 Myron Scott, a reporter for the Dayton Daily News, saw three boys racing homemade, engineless cars down a hill on a local street. This sight inspired Scott to organize the Soap Box Derby, a coasting race for homemade race cars. Over the next several years, the All-American Soap Box Derby grew into a national event that continues to attract thousands of competitors from across the country.<br>
<br>
<strong>The All-American Soap Box Derby</strong><br>
<br>
<em>1</em>&nbsp;Cliff Hardesty felt his excitement building as he drank in his surroundings. He was actually here in Akron, Ohio, the home of the All-American Soap Box Derby. His eyes followed the long, smooth ribbon of the Derby Downs raceway. The 1,600-foot, cement-covered track was divided into three wide lanes. In just a few days, Cliff and his homemade car would be in one of those lanes, racing for the grand prize. Although there were more than 100 competitors in this year’s derby, only three boys could race at one time. The winner of each heat—as the three-person races were called—would go on to race the winners of other heats, until at last there was only one winner. Cliff didn’t dare dream that he would be that winner.<br>
<br>
<em>2</em>&nbsp;“This race sure has come a long way in the past six years,” a man sitting in the nearby bleachers remarked. “I was in the crowd at the very first soap box derby back in 1933. About 350 boys participated in that race. You should have seen the cars back then. Most of them were made from old crates or heavy sheets of tin. Some of them looked as if they were going to rattle apart.” He chuckled.<br>
<br>
<em>3</em>&nbsp;“In which lane did the winner race?” Cliff asked.<br>
<br>
<em>4</em>&nbsp;“Oh, this fancy track wasn’t used then. In fact, there was no track at all,” the man said. “The boys raced down a big hill. This track here was built just three years ago for the 1936 race.”<br>
<br>
<em>5&nbsp;</em>After chatting with t he man a little bit more, Cliff walked up the hill to the area called Topside, where all the homemade race cars were stored and inspected. He wanted to check on his car. His family had shipped it from his home in White Plains, New York, a few days earlier. Derby guidelines stated that cars had to arrive in time for race officials to look them over and make sure they were safe.<br>
<br>
<em>6&nbsp;</em>Cliff found his car and stood back for a moment, running his eyes over it. It was a beauty. Whether he won the race or not, he knew he had done a good job.<br>
<br>
<em>7&nbsp;</em>Just then a thin man in dark glasses with a clipboard under h is arm walked over to him. “Are you the boy w ho built this car?” The man looked down at his clipboard. “Cliff Hardesty?”<br>
<br>
<em>8&nbsp;</em>“Yes, sir,” Cliff answered with a smile.<br>
<br>
<em>9&nbsp;</em>The man did not smile back. “Cliff, my name is Mr. Smith. I’ll be very candid with you. The truth is that your car concerns me. The regulations for this event state very clearly that every car entered in the All-American Soap Box Derby must have been built by the boy who will drive it. There can be no help from anyone else.”<br>
<br>
<em>10&nbsp;</em>“Yes, sir,” Cliff said, still not certain what Mr. Smith was talking about.<br>
<br>
<em>11&nbsp;</em>Mr. Smith sighed. “Cliff, your car is one of the best we’ve ever seen. Can you honestly expect us to believe that you built it all by yourself ? No one helped you?”<br>
<br>
<em>12&nbsp;</em>Cliff’s face grew hot as he realized what Mr. Smith was implying. “No, sir. No one helped me. I did everything according to the rules.” He looked Mr. Smith straight in the eye, but his throat felt tight with fear. Was Mr. Smith saying he might not be allowed to race? Would he be <span class="txt-underline">disqualified</span> for building a good car? “Mr. Smith,” Cliff said firmly, “I built this car myself.”<br>
<br>
<em>13&nbsp;</em>“I’m afraid you’re going to need to prove that,” Mr. Smith said. “We’ve set up a 12-member committee. We’ll ask you questions about how you built your car. We have to make sure that you’ve done everything the way you’re supposed to. If you can satisfy us that your car is legitimate, you can participate in the race.”<br>
<br>
<em>14&nbsp;</em>Called in front of the committee, Cliff answered question after question about his work on the car. Somewhere in the room a clock ticked very slowly. Cliff watched the faces of the men who would decide his fate. Some of them were easy to read. Others might as well have been carved of stone. The questioning dragged on so long that Cliff began to feel dizzy. At last the committee told Cliff to get some sleep and report back in the morning.<br>
<br>
<em>15&nbsp;</em>The next morning Cliff was taken to a garage. One of the committee members asked Cliff to reproduce part of his car while they watched. Feeling almost happy, Cliff picked up the tools that had been laid out for him. Finally he would be able to prove that he had built his car. He would demonstrate to the committee members that he had complied with the race requirements and had built his car without any help. He could feel the eyes of the committee members drilling holes in him as he thought about how to begin. Then he decided to pretend he was at home in his own workshop, and he began to work. Soon he was so involved in working on the car, he forgot all about the committee.<br>
<br>
<em>16&nbsp;</em>After only half an hour, Mr. Smith called o ut, “O.K., Cliff. You can stop.”<br>
<br>
<em>17&nbsp;</em>Cliff looked up in alarm, but then he relaxed when he saw the smile o n Mr. Smith’s face. “ You’re a very resourceful young man,” Mr. Smith said. “ We can all s ee that you’re building an even better car than the one you’ve entered in tomorrow’s race. Please accept my apologies for doubting you.”<br>
<br>
<em>18&nbsp;</em>Cliff’s laugh burst from him like air escaping from a<br>
popped balloon. “That’s all right, sir,” he said. “But if you<br>
gentlemen will excuse me now, I need to take my car for a<br>
test run. I plan to win tomorrow’s race, and I want to be<br>
ready.”<br>
<br>
<em>19&nbsp;</em>Relieved, Cliff eagerly prepared for his test run down the 1,600-foot-long track. He was finally free to do what he had come to Akron for—race his car. As he sped down the track, the car hurtled out of control. His car was wrecked, and Cliff had to be taken to the hospital. Race officials worked all afternoon and through the night to fix Cliff’s car in the hope that he would still be able to race. They didn’t want Cliff’s hard work to have been for nothing.<br>
<br>
<em>20&nbsp;</em>The next day Cliff was released from the hospital. He was banged up but ready to participate in the race and grateful that his car had been repaired. The victory he achieved that day by winning the sixth annual All - American Soap Box Derby was proof of his talent and of the superiority of his car’s design.<br>

      <div class="col-6"><strong>Read this selection. Then answer the questions that follow it.</strong><br><br><strong>The Charro</strong><br><br><em>1</em> “I have bad news,” announced Mrs. Carrillo, the<br>
Spanish club’s sponsor. “ We’re nearly $ 1,000 short of the amount we need to take our trip to Mexico City next month.”<br>
<br>
<em>2</em> The club members groaned. Since the idea of going to Mexico had been brought up back in September, it had been an incentive to raise as much money as possible. They had hoped that their last fund-raiser, a dinner featuring enchiladas and other t raditional Mexican dishes, would provide the rest of the funds they needed. However, it had not brought in as much money as they had expected.<br>
<br>
<em>3</em> “How depressing,” Adrian said gloomily. “All year we’ve practiced our Spanish, and now there’s no way we’ll get to Mexico City.”<br>
<br>
<em>4</em> Marisol refused to give up so easily. “Look at us! We’re already thinking it’s hopeless. Don’t be so pessimistic! There has to b e a way to raise the money!” she said. “Everybody go home and think. Ask your parents, friends, and neighbors. Let’s meet again in two days to see whether anyone has a suggestion.”<br>
<br>
<em>5</em> After school Marisol decided to visit Grandpa Delgado at his ranch. Talking with him always made her problems seem smaller. Just being at the ranch made her feel better, so she went whenever she was <span class="txt-underline">agitated</span> about something. She knew she could rely on the land’s unchanging beauty.<br>
<br>
<em>6</em> Marisol found her grandfather in his old barn. “I guess we’ll need to pull this shabby old barn down pretty soon,” he said when he saw her. “It’s falling apart. It seems as if it <span class="txt-underline">deteriorated</span> overnight. Now that we’ve built a new barn, it’s just taking up space around here—like me, I suppose.” He sighed and looked around. “I built it right after I came to this country. It looks as though we’ve both just about outlived our usefulness.”<br>
<br>
<em>7</em> As Marisol watched him l ooking around the barn, s he got an idea. “ Grandpa, w asn’t there a theater group near here that used to perform in a barn?”<br>
<br>
<em>8</em> “Why, yes,” Grandpa Delgado said. “The Red Barn<br>
Players. They’re n ot around anymore. It was a good idea, performing in a barn. We don’t have fancy theaters around here like those you would find in a big city.”<br>
<br>
<em>9</em> “How many folding chairs do you think could fit in this barn?” Marisol asked.<br>
<br>
10 He wrinkled his brow and thought a moment. “Probably a hundred or so. Why?”<br>
<br>
<em>11</em> Marisol’s words came out in a rush. “I have an idea for how to earn money for my Spanish club. We could put on a play right here in your barn! If we gave two performances and if a hundred people came to each one and if tickets cost five dollars each . . .” She tapped her feet as she did the math in her head. “That’s $1,000!” she said triumphantly.<br>
<br>
<em>12</em> At their next meeting, Marisol’s f ellow club members liked the idea. Mrs. Carrillo said, “Marisol, why don’t you and Carlota find a play for us to perform. We need to decide on the play right away so we’ll have time to rehearse, build sets, make costumes, a nd advertise. In the meantime we can work on turning the barn into a temporary theater.”<br>
<br>
<em>13</em> Marisol and Carlota spent hours at the library looking for a play, but nothing seemed right. “ Here’s one about a zookeeper who discovers his gorilla can talk,” Carlota said.<br>
<br>
<em>14</em> Marisol shook her head. “None of these will work.<br>
They’re too short, and none of them has more than three roles,” she said.<br>
<br>
<em>15</em> “Besides,” added Carlota, “we should do a play that has something to do with Mexican culture.”<br>
<br>
<em>16</em> Marisol paused for a moment as an idea came to her. “I wrote a play for English class a few months ago about my grandpa when h e was a young charro, a Mexican cowboy. Would you like to see it?”<br>
<br>
<em>17</em> Carlota went home with Marisol and read the play.<br>
When Carlota finished reading, she turned to Marisol and said, “It’s perfect!”<br>
<br>
<em>18</em> The other club members liked it, too. P arts w ere<br>
assigned, and rehearsals began. Marisol didn’t have a part, but she helped with sets and costumes. Her whole family got involved to make sure the play was a success because they were proud of her. Marisol’s father put up posters on every telephone pole for miles around. Her older brother Ray, who attended college in a nearby town, promised t o bring a group of friends on opening night.<br>
<br>
<em>19</em> Before the play Mrs. Carrillo explained the purpose of the event and thanked the audience f or attending. Then the performance began. Marisol watched nervously from backstage. At one point Adrian, who was playing Marisol’s grandfather, had to sing an old Mexican folk song. He had a good voice, but he must have forgotten the words. Marisol listened in horror as his voice faded away, and the barn went silent.<br>
<br>
<em>20</em> Then another voice, deep and rich, took u p the song. Marisol peeked out at the audience and saw Grandpa Delgado. He had risen to his feet and was singing the song as she had heard him sing it many times. He turned to the rest of the crowd. “Sing along,” he invited them. “You know the words.” To Marisol’s amazement many of the older men and women joined in. Their voices swelled, reaching into every corner of the dark, dusty barn and transforming it into a place of wonder.<br>
<br>
<em>21</em> After t he p lay was over, Marisol helped count the profits. They had made more than $500. She felt sure that they would be able to reach their goal after the next day’s performance.<br>
<br>
<em>22</em> Grandpa Delgado came over to congratulate her. “I guess this old thing still has some life i n it after a ll,” he said with a wink.<br>
<br>
<em>23</em> “I always knew that it did, Grandpa,” Marisol said,<br>
winking back. The trip to Mexico City would be great, but nothing could ever replace Marisol’s happiness w hen she heard her grandfather’s strong voice ringing throughout the barn.<br>
