        <p>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn’t know which was more humiliating— watching all of the potential customers walk right past my table or seeing them line up at Julie’s table. I sat back and pretended I couldn’t care less, but the truth was I was hurt.</p>

        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With cold water thrown on my first two ideas, I finally came up with a plan we both thought would work. I would create and sell decorative ceramic ornaments.

          <strong>Painted Into a Corner</strong>

        <p class="txt-ctr">by Amy Bearce</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn’t know which was more humiliating— watching all of the potential customers walk right past my table or seeing them line up at Julie’s table. I sat back and pretended I couldn’t care less, but the truth was I was hurt.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two weeks ago my teacher began class by announcing a new project. We had to create a product to sell to the community at the Business Day Fair in the gym. All the students in the class had to design and create something to sell. We also had to keep track of the costs of the product as well as the profit we made. Whoever made the most profit would win the Young Business Leader award.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately my mind began soaring. Perhaps I could make beautiful jewelry that everyone would pay a fortune for. Or maybe I could sew pajamas and sell those. Of course, I’d have to learn how to sew first. I imagined myself with hundreds of customers lined up at my table, my Young Business Leader trophy sitting next to me, shining in the beautiful sunlight. . . .</p>
        <p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night I shared my ideas with my mom. Smiling, she broke the news to me that using silver wire and beads as the raw material for my proposed jewelry project would be expensive. Moreover, the idea for pajamas was flawed because I already had a reputation as someone who couldn’t even sew a button on a shirt.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With cold water thrown on my first two ideas, I finally came up with a plan we both thought would work. I would create and sell decorative ceramic ornaments. I had been in a ceramics class all summer, so I knew that I could get plain ceramic ornaments and paint them. All I would have left to do would be to install a hook and—presto!</p>
        <p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next morning at school I ran up to Julie, my best friend, and said, “Hey, have you come up with an idea for Business Day?”</p>
        <p>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Yes,” she said, “but I’m not telling anyone what it is before the sale.”</p>
        <p>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I blinked and felt a pang in my stomach. Julie and I usually shared everything. Why was she being so cautious?</p>
        <p>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stiffly I replied, “Oh, well, I have an idea too,” and quickly walked away. I couldn’t believe that my best friend was keeping secrets from me.</p>

          <strong>Painted Into a Corner</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">by Amy Bearce</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn’t know which was more humiliating— watching all of the potential customers walk right past my table or seeing them line up at Julie’s table. I sat back and pretended I couldn’t care less, but the truth was I was hurt.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two weeks ago my teacher began class by announcing a new project. We had to create a product to sell to the community at the Business Day Fair in the gym. All the students in the class had to design and create something to sell. We also had to keep track of the costs of the product as well as the profit we made. Whoever made the most profit would win the Young Business Leader award.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately my mind began soaring. Perhaps I could make beautiful jewelry that everyone would pay a fortune for. Or maybe I could sew pajamas and sell those. Of course, I’d have to learn how to sew first. I imagined myself with hundreds of customers lined up at my table, my Young Business Leader trophy sitting next to me, shining in the beautiful sunlight. . . .</p>
        <p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night I shared my ideas with my mom. Smiling, she broke the news to me that using silver wire and beads as the raw material for my proposed jewelry project would be expensive. Moreover, the idea for pajamas was flawed because I already had a reputation as someone who couldn’t even sew a button on a shirt.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With cold water thrown on my first two ideas, I finally came up with a plan we both thought would work. I would create and sell decorative ceramic ornaments. I had been in a ceramics class all summer, so I knew that I could get plain ceramic ornaments and paint them. All I would have left to do would be to install a hook and—presto!</p>
        <p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next morning at school I ran up to Julie, my best friend, and said, “Hey, have you come up with an idea for Business Day?”</p>
        <p>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Yes,” she said, “but I’m not telling anyone what it is before the sale.”</p>
        <p>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I blinked and felt a pang in my stomach. Julie and I usually shared everything. Why was she being so cautious?</p>
        <p>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stiffly I replied, “Oh, well, I have an idea too,” and quickly walked away. I couldn’t believe that my best friend was keeping secrets from me.</p>

          <strong>QUESTIONS 8 – 12</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <strong>Marco Polo and the “Million Lies”</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">by Nancy Beaulieu</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Young Adventurer</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Marco Polo was born in Venice, Italy, in 1254. He was 17 when he set out for China with his father and uncle, a journey which lasted more than three years. The three travelers passed through vast deserts and across rugged mountain ranges. Marco met people from different lands and saw wondrous new places. He saw camels, which he called oxen with humps, and mountain goats, which he described as sheep with long curled horns. He heard the music of the sand dunes shifting in the wind. He climbed mountains so high that the thin air made him dizzy. Marco was fascinated by everything he saw.</p>
        <p>Marco Polo and his family reached China in 1275. At that time, Kublai Khan was the emperor. He was impressed with Marco and put the young man to work. Marco spent more than 16 years in Khan’s service. He went on missions to faraway lands and entertained Khan with stories of his travels. Then, in 1292, Marco asked for permission to return to Venice. Khan did not want to see Marco go, but he finally agreed. Marco and his family returned to Venice.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <strong>“Marco Milione”</strong>
        <p><em>The Travels of Marco Polo</em> was a popular book, but it did not earn Marco much respect. It was often referred to as “Il Milione.” By this the Italians meant “the million lies.” Some people even called him “Marco Milione.” Many of Marco’s stories were hard to believe. Besides the unusual animals he described, Marco told of other things difficult for most Europeans to imagine. For example, Marco described how the Chinese people read books printed on paper and used paper money. At that time, paper was rare in Europe. To people reading about Marco’s adventures, paper money and books printed on paper sounded like something from a fable.</p>
        <p>Marco also described a system that Khan’s empire used to rapidly deliver messages to faraway places. Marco’s countrymen thought this sounded impossible too. Who could blame them? It would be hundreds of years before a mail system was used in Europe. Even details about daily life in China seemed made up. Marco told about delicate china serving bowls that ordinary people used. At a time when most Europeans did not have silverware, this seemed unbelievable. Everyday clothes made from silk sounded like a fairy tale to Europeans, since most of them had just one change of woolen clothes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Misread and Misunderstood</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Much of what Marco described in his stories was later proven true. However, there are some parts where Marco’s memory may have been foggy, or Rustichello may have <span class="txt-underline">embellished</span> the truth. Certainly no one else has ever seen any large birds that drop elephants from great heights and then eat the remains! It is also strange that Marco did not describe something as amazing as the Great Wall of China, which he must have seen.</p>
        <p>Whatever the complete truth about his book, one thing is certain: Marco Polo was a great explorer and adventurer.</p>

        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <strong>Marco Polo and the “Million Lies”</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">by Nancy Beaulieu</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Young Adventurer</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Marco Polo was born in Venice, Italy, in 1254. He was 17 when he set out for China with his father and uncle, a journey which lasted more than three years. The three travelers passed through vast deserts and across rugged mountain ranges. Marco met people from different lands and saw wondrous new places. He saw camels, which he called oxen with humps, and mountain goats, which he described as sheep with long curled horns. He heard the music of the sand dunes shifting in the wind. He climbed mountains so high that the thin air made him dizzy. Marco was fascinated by everything he saw.</p>
        <p>Marco Polo and his family reached China in 1275. At that time, Kublai Khan was the emperor. He was impressed with Marco and put the young man to work. Marco spent more than 16 years in Khan’s service. He went on missions to faraway lands and entertained Khan with stories of his travels. Then, in 1292, Marco asked for permission to return to Venice. Khan did not want to see Marco go, but he finally agreed. Marco and his family returned to Venice.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <strong>“Marco Milione”</strong>
        <p><em>The Travels of Marco Polo</em> was a popular book, but it did not earn Marco much respect. It was often referred to as “Il Milione.” By this the Italians meant “the million lies.” Some people even called him “Marco Milione.” Many of Marco’s stories were hard to believe. Besides the unusual animals he described, Marco told of other things difficult for most Europeans to imagine. For example, Marco described how the Chinese people read books printed on paper and used paper money. At that time, paper was rare in Europe. To people reading about Marco’s adventures, paper money and books printed on paper sounded like something from a fable.</p>
        <p>Marco also described a system that Khan’s empire used to rapidly deliver messages to faraway places. Marco’s countrymen thought this sounded impossible too. Who could blame them? It would be hundreds of years before a mail system was used in Europe. Even details about daily life in China seemed made up. Marco told about delicate china serving bowls that ordinary people used. At a time when most Europeans did not have silverware, this seemed unbelievable. Everyday clothes made from silk sounded like a fairy tale to Europeans, since most of them had just one change of woolen clothes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Misread and Misunderstood</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Much of what Marco described in his stories was later proven true. However, there are some parts where Marco’s memory may have been foggy, or Rustichello may have <span class="txt-underline">embellished</span> the truth. Certainly no one else has ever seen any large birds that drop elephants from great heights and then eat the remains! It is also strange that Marco did not describe something as amazing as the Great Wall of China, which he must have seen.</p>
        <p>Whatever the complete truth about his book, one thing is certain: Marco Polo was a great explorer and adventurer.</p>

Marco spent more than 16 years in Khan’s service. He went on missions to faraway lands and entertained Khan with stories of his travels. Then, in 1292, Marco asked for permission to return to Venice. Khan did not want to see Marco go, but he finally agreed. Marco and his family returned to Venice.</p>

        <strong>“Marco Milione”</strong>
        <p><em>The Travels of Marco Polo</em> was a popular book, but it did not earn Marco much respect. It was often referred to as “Il Milione.” By this the Italians meant “the million lies.” Some people even called him “Marco Milione.” Many of Marco’s stories were hard to believe. Besides the unusual animals he described, Marco told of other things difficult for most Europeans to imagine. For example, Marco described how the Chinese people read books printed on paper and used paper money. At that time, paper was rare in Europe. To people reading about Marco’s adventures, paper money and books printed on paper sounded like something from a fable.</p>
        <p>Marco also described a system that Khan’s empire used to rapidly deliver messages to faraway places. Marco’s countrymen thought this sounded impossible too. Who could blame them? It would be hundreds of years before a mail system was used in Europe. Even details about daily life in China seemed made up. Marco told about delicate china serving bowls that ordinary people used. At a time when most Europeans did not have silverware, this seemed unbelievable. Everyday clothes made from silk sounded like a fairy tale to Europeans, since most of them had just one change of woolen clothes.</p>

          <strong>Misread and Misunderstood</strong>

        <p>Much of what Marco described in his stories was later proven true.

Certainly no one else has ever seen any large birds that drop elephants from great heights and then eat the remains! It is also strange that Marco did not describe something as amazing as the Great Wall of China, which he must have seen.</p>
        <p>Whatever the complete truth about his book, one thing is certain: Marco Polo was a great explorer and adventurer.</p>

          <strong>Marco Polo and the “Million Lies”</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">by Nancy Beaulieu</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Young Adventurer</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Marco Polo was born in Venice, Italy, in 1254. He was 17 when he set out for China with his father and uncle, a journey which lasted more than three years. The three travelers passed through vast deserts and across rugged mountain ranges. Marco met people from different lands and saw wondrous new places. He saw camels, which he called oxen with humps, and mountain goats, which he described as sheep with long curled horns. He heard the music of the sand dunes shifting in the wind. He climbed mountains so high that the thin air made him dizzy. Marco was fascinated by everything he saw.</p>
        <p>Marco Polo and his family reached China in 1275. At that time, Kublai Khan was the emperor. He was impressed with Marco and put the young man to work. Marco spent more than 16 years in Khan’s service. He went on missions to faraway lands and entertained Khan with stories of his travels. Then, in 1292, Marco asked for permission to return to Venice. Khan did not want to see Marco go, but he finally agreed. Marco and his family returned to Venice.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <strong>“Marco Milione”</strong>
        <p><em>The Travels of Marco Polo</em> was a popular book, but it did not earn Marco much respect. It was often referred to as “Il Milione.” By this the Italians meant “the million lies.” Some people even called him “Marco Milione.” Many of Marco’s stories were hard to believe. Besides the unusual animals he described, Marco told of other things difficult for most Europeans to imagine. For example, Marco described how the Chinese people read books printed on paper and used paper money. At that time, paper was rare in Europe. To people reading about Marco’s adventures, paper money and books printed on paper sounded like something from a fable.</p>
        <p>Marco also described a system that Khan’s empire used to rapidly deliver messages to faraway places. Marco’s countrymen thought this sounded impossible too. Who could blame them? It would be hundreds of years before a mail system was used in Europe. Even details about daily life in China seemed made up. Marco told about delicate china serving bowls that ordinary people used. At a time when most Europeans did not have silverware, this seemed unbelievable. Everyday clothes made from silk sounded like a fairy tale to Europeans, since most of them had just one change of woolen clothes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Misread and Misunderstood</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Much of what Marco described in his stories was later proven true. However, there are some parts where Marco’s memory may have been foggy, or Rustichello may have <span class="txt-underline">embellished</span> the truth. Certainly no one else has ever seen any large birds that drop elephants from great heights and then eat the remains! It is also strange that Marco did not describe something as amazing as the Great Wall of China, which he must have seen.</p>
        <p>Whatever the complete truth about his book, one thing is certain: Marco Polo was a great explorer and adventurer.</p>

          <strong>Sweet Magnolia</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">by Virginia Kroll</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Let’s go see the bayou,” said Grandma, and we got into her boat. Soon we came to a different sounding place. We got out of the boat, and I hushed so I could hear it all—tiny tickings, gentle jigglings, ripplings, and rustlings—little life sounds all around.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Talk about trees!” I gasped, looking up. They were hunched over like bent giants. Moss was hanging in shaggy clumps from their branches like ragged curtains. “The bayou,” I whispered.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly I heard a tiny cheeping. There was some pain and fear in it. “Over there,” said Grandma, pointing.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ran, then stopped short, so I wouldn’t step on the struggling bird. Grandma carefully scooped it up. She shook her head.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Can you fix it, Grandma?”</p>
        <p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grandma warned me, “Sometimes nature doesn’t see things our way.” But she looked in my eyes, and we took the bird on home.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “What happened to it, Grandma?” I asked.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grandma examined the panting bird. “Hmm. Broken leg. I reckon she was too impatient, Denise. Burst right out of her nest ahead of schedule. Couldn’t wait to get on with the springtime.”</p>
        <p>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “What kind is she?” I asked.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp;&nbsp; “A painted bunting,” Grandma said.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp;&nbsp; She fed the bird with a tiny tube, then set the broken leg and taped it. I studied the soft feathers and fluffy markings.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grandma kept up the feedings day and night. I helped. The painted bunting grew bigger and more colorful and got its flight feathers. Pretty soon she was pecking seeds right out of my hand.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Don’t feed her from your hand all the time,” Grandma said, “or she won’t learn how to find seeds and insects on her own.”</p>
        <p>14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day she unwrapped the bunting’s leg, Grandma asked, “You gonna give this one a name? She’s yours. You found her, after all.”</p>
        <p>15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart skipped like a stone across a stream. Mine! Did Grandma mean it? Wait till Iona and Geneva saw the treasure I was bringing home!</p>
        <p>16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked at my bird. I thought about how she tried to fly too soon and how Grandma said she was impatient, just like the sweet magnolia flowers.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Sweet Magnolia!” I said. “That’s her name.”</p>
        <p>18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“My, my,” Grandma sighed. “You sure do have a way with words.” I felt proud.</p>
        <p>19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One morning after breakfast, Grandma said, “This is the big day. Come on.”</p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;I followed, wondering what was so special. She went to Sweet Magnolia’s cage and opened the door. Then she stopped. “You ought to do it, Denise. You found her, after all.”</p>
        <p>21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do what, Grandma?” I asked.</p>
        <p>22&nbsp; &nbsp;“Set her flying to the winds,” she answered.</p>
        <p>23&nbsp; &nbsp;“But Grandma, she’s MINE!” I shouted. “You even said so. She’s the treasure I’m taking home.”</p>
        <p>24&nbsp; &nbsp;Grandma half-smiled, half-frowned. “I’m sorry, Denise. Maybe you &nbsp;&nbsp;misunderstood. She’s yours to help . . . yours to heal . . . yours to set free.”</p>
        <p>25&nbsp; &nbsp; I put my hands on my hips and stamped my foot. “No.”</p>
        <p>26&nbsp; &nbsp;“You love her, don’t you?” Grandma said.</p>
        <p>27&nbsp; &nbsp;I thought for a moment. I gulped. I blinked hard. I opened the cage and slowly put my hand in.</p>

          <strong>Sweet Magnolia</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">by Virginia Kroll</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Let’s go see the bayou,” said Grandma, and we got into her boat. Soon we came to a different sounding place. We got out of the boat, and I hushed so I could hear it all—tiny tickings, gentle jigglings, ripplings, and rustlings—little life sounds all around.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Talk about trees!” I gasped, looking up. They were hunched over like bent giants. Moss was hanging in shaggy clumps from their branches like ragged curtains. “The bayou,” I whispered.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly I heard a tiny cheeping. There was some pain and fear in it. “Over there,” said Grandma, pointing.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ran, then stopped short, so I wouldn’t step on the struggling bird. Grandma carefully scooped it up. She shook her head.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Can you fix it, Grandma?”</p>
        <p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grandma warned me, “Sometimes nature doesn’t see things our way.” But she looked in my eyes, and we took the bird on home.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “What happened to it, Grandma?” I asked.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grandma examined the panting bird. “Hmm. Broken leg. I reckon she was too impatient, Denise. Burst right out of her nest ahead of schedule. Couldn’t wait to get on with the springtime.”</p>
        <p>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “What kind is she?” I asked.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp;&nbsp; “A painted bunting,” Grandma said.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp;&nbsp; She fed the bird with a tiny tube, then set the broken leg and taped it. I studied the soft feathers and fluffy markings.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grandma kept up the feedings day and night. I helped. The painted bunting grew bigger and more colorful and got its flight feathers. Pretty soon she was pecking seeds right out of my hand.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Don’t feed her from your hand all the time,” Grandma said, “or she won’t learn how to find seeds and insects on her own.”</p>
        <p>14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day she unwrapped the bunting’s leg, Grandma asked, “You gonna give this one a name? She’s yours. You found her, after all.”</p>
        <p>15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart skipped like a stone across a stream. Mine! Did Grandma mean it? Wait till Iona and Geneva saw the treasure I was bringing home!</p>
        <p>16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked at my bird. I thought about how she tried to fly too soon and how Grandma said she was impatient, just like the sweet magnolia flowers.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Sweet Magnolia!” I said. “That’s her name.”</p>
        <p>18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“My, my,” Grandma sighed. “You sure do have a way with words.” I felt proud.</p>
        <p>19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One morning after breakfast, Grandma said, “This is the big day. Come on.”</p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;I followed, wondering what was so special. She went to Sweet Magnolia’s cage and opened the door. Then she stopped. “You ought to do it, Denise. You found her, after all.”</p>
        <p>21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do what, Grandma?” I asked.</p>
        <p>22&nbsp; &nbsp;“Set her flying to the winds,” she answered.</p>
        <p>23&nbsp; &nbsp;“But Grandma, she’s MINE!” I shouted. “You even said so. She’s the treasure I’m taking home.”</p>
        <p>24&nbsp; &nbsp;Grandma half-smiled, half-frowned. “I’m sorry, Denise. Maybe you &nbsp;&nbsp;misunderstood. She’s yours to help . . . yours to heal . . . yours to set free.”</p>
        <p>25&nbsp; &nbsp; I put my hands on my hips and stamped my foot. “No.”</p>
        <p>26&nbsp; &nbsp;“You love her, don’t you?” Grandma said.</p>
        <p>27&nbsp; &nbsp;I thought for a moment. I gulped. I blinked hard. I opened the cage and slowly put my hand in.</p>

          <strong>Sweet Magnolia</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">by Virginia Kroll</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Let’s go see the bayou,” said Grandma, and we got into her boat. Soon we came to a different sounding place. We got out of the boat, and I hushed so I could hear it all—tiny tickings, gentle jigglings, ripplings, and rustlings—little life sounds all around.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Talk about trees!” I gasped, looking up. They were hunched over like bent giants. Moss was hanging in shaggy clumps from their branches like ragged curtains. “The bayou,” I whispered.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly I heard a tiny cheeping. There was some pain and fear in it. “Over there,” said Grandma, pointing.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ran, then stopped short, so I wouldn’t step on the struggling bird. Grandma carefully scooped it up. She shook her head.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Can you fix it, Grandma?”</p>
        <p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grandma warned me, “Sometimes nature doesn’t see things our way.” But she looked in my eyes, and we took the bird on home.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “What happened to it, Grandma?” I asked.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grandma examined the panting bird. “Hmm. Broken leg. I reckon she was too impatient, Denise. Burst right out of her nest ahead of schedule. Couldn’t wait to get on with the springtime.”</p>
        <p>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “What kind is she?” I asked.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp;&nbsp; “A painted bunting,” Grandma said.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp;&nbsp; She fed the bird with a tiny tube, then set the broken leg and taped it. I studied the soft feathers and fluffy markings.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grandma kept up the feedings day and night. I helped. The painted bunting grew bigger and more colorful and got its flight feathers. Pretty soon she was pecking seeds right out of my hand.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Don’t feed her from your hand all the time,” Grandma said, “or she won’t learn how to find seeds and insects on her own.”</p>
        <p>14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day she unwrapped the bunting’s leg, Grandma asked, “You gonna give this one a name? She’s yours. You found her, after all.”</p>
        <p>15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart skipped like a stone across a stream. Mine! Did Grandma mean it? Wait till Iona and Geneva saw the treasure I was bringing home!</p>
        <p>16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked at my bird. I thought about how she tried to fly too soon and how Grandma said she was impatient, just like the sweet magnolia flowers.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Sweet Magnolia!” I said. “That’s her name.”</p>
        <p>18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“My, my,” Grandma sighed. “You sure do have a way with words.” I felt proud.</p>
        <p>19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One morning after breakfast, Grandma said, “This is the big day. Come on.”</p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;I followed, wondering what was so special. She went to Sweet Magnolia’s cage and opened the door. Then she stopped. “You ought to do it, Denise. You found her, after all.”</p>
        <p>21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do what, Grandma?” I asked.</p>
        <p>22&nbsp; &nbsp;“Set her flying to the winds,” she answered.</p>
        <p>23&nbsp; &nbsp;“But Grandma, she’s MINE!” I shouted. “You even said so. She’s the treasure I’m taking home.”</p>
        <p>24&nbsp; &nbsp;Grandma half-smiled, half-frowned. “I’m sorry, Denise. Maybe you &nbsp;&nbsp;misunderstood. She’s yours to help . . . yours to heal . . . yours to set free.”</p>
        <p>25&nbsp; &nbsp; I put my hands on my hips and stamped my foot. “No.”</p>
        <p>26&nbsp; &nbsp;“You love her, don’t you?” Grandma said.</p>
        <p>27&nbsp; &nbsp;I thought for a moment. I gulped. I blinked hard. I opened the cage and slowly put my hand in.</p>

          <strong>Sweet Magnolia</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">by Virginia Kroll</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Let’s go see the bayou,” said Grandma, and we got into her boat. Soon we came to a different sounding place. We got out of the boat, and I hushed so I could hear it all—tiny tickings, gentle jigglings, ripplings, and rustlings—little life sounds all around.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Talk about trees!” I gasped, looking up. They were hunched over like bent giants. Moss was hanging in shaggy clumps from their branches like ragged curtains. “The bayou,” I whispered.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly I heard a tiny cheeping. There was some pain and fear in it. “Over there,” said Grandma, pointing.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ran, then stopped short, so I wouldn’t step on the struggling bird. Grandma carefully scooped it up. She shook her head.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Can you fix it, Grandma?”</p>
        <p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grandma warned me, “Sometimes nature doesn’t see things our way.” But she looked in my eyes, and we took the bird on home.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “What happened to it, Grandma?” I asked.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grandma examined the panting bird. “Hmm. Broken leg. I reckon she was too impatient, Denise. Burst right out of her nest ahead of schedule. Couldn’t wait to get on with the springtime.”</p>
        <p>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “What kind is she?” I asked.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp;&nbsp; “A painted bunting,” Grandma said.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp;&nbsp; She fed the bird with a tiny tube, then set the broken leg and taped it. I studied the soft feathers and fluffy markings.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grandma kept up the feedings day and night. I helped. The painted bunting grew bigger and more colorful and got its flight feathers. Pretty soon she was pecking seeds right out of my hand.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Don’t feed her from your hand all the time,” Grandma said, “or she won’t learn how to find seeds and insects on her own.”</p>
        <p>14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day she unwrapped the bunting’s leg, Grandma asked, “You gonna give this one a name? She’s yours. You found her, after all.”</p>
        <p>15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart skipped like a stone across a stream. Mine! Did Grandma mean it? Wait till Iona and Geneva saw the treasure I was bringing home!</p>
        <p>16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked at my bird. I thought about how she tried to fly too soon and how Grandma said she was impatient, just like the sweet magnolia flowers.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Sweet Magnolia!” I said. “That’s her name.”</p>
        <p>18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“My, my,” Grandma sighed. “You sure do have a way with words.” I felt proud.</p>
        <p>19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One morning after breakfast, Grandma said, “This is the big day. Come on.”</p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;I followed, wondering what was so special. She went to Sweet Magnolia’s cage and opened the door. Then she stopped. “You ought to do it, Denise. You found her, after all.”</p>
        <p>21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do what, Grandma?” I asked.</p>
        <p>22&nbsp; &nbsp;“Set her flying to the winds,” she answered.</p>
        <p>23&nbsp; &nbsp;“But Grandma, she’s MINE!” I shouted. “You even said so. She’s the treasure I’m taking home.”</p>
        <p>24&nbsp; &nbsp;Grandma half-smiled, half-frowned. “I’m sorry, Denise. Maybe you &nbsp;&nbsp;misunderstood. She’s yours to help . . . yours to heal . . . yours to set free.”</p>
        <p>25&nbsp; &nbsp; I put my hands on my hips and stamped my foot. “No.”</p>
        <p>26&nbsp; &nbsp;“You love her, don’t you?” Grandma said.</p>
        <p>27&nbsp; &nbsp;I thought for a moment. I gulped. I blinked hard. I opened the cage and slowly put my hand in.</p>

          <strong>The School Boy</strong>
        </p>
        <p><br>
I love to rise in a summer morn,<br>
When the birds sing on every tree;<br>
The distant huntsman winds his horn,<br>
And the sky-lark sings with me.<br>
O! what sweet company.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5</p>
        <p><br>
But to go to school in a summer morn,<br>
O! it drives all joy away;<br>
Under a cruel eye outworn.<br>
The little ones spend the day,<br>
In sighing and dismay.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;10</p>
        <p><br>
Ah! then at times I drooping sit,<br>
And spend many an anxious hour,<br>
Nor in my book can I take delight,<br>
Nor sit in learnings bower,<br>
Worn thro' with the dreary shower.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;15</p>
        <p><br>
How can the bird that is born for joy,<br>
Sit in a cage and sing.<br>
How can a child when fears annoy,<br>
But droop his tender wing,<br>
And forget his youthful spring.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 20</p>
        <p><br>
O! father &amp; mother. if buds are nip'd,<br>
And blossoms blown away,<br>
And if the tender plants are strip'd<br>
Of their joy in the springing day,<br>
By sorrow and care's dismay.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;25</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>How shall the summer arise in joy.<br>
Or the summer fruits appear.<br>
Or how shall we gather what griefs destroy<br>
Or bless the mellowing year.&nbsp;<br>
When the blasts of winter appear.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;30</p>

          <strong>The School Boy</strong>
        </p>
        <p><br>
I love to rise in a summer morn,<br>
When the birds sing on every tree;<br>
The distant huntsman winds his horn,<br>
And the sky-lark sings with me.<br>
O! what sweet company.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5</p>
        <p><br>
But to go to school in a summer morn,<br>
O! it drives all joy away;<br>
Under a cruel eye outworn.<br>
The little ones spend the day,<br>
In sighing and dismay.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;10</p>
        <p><br>
Ah! then at times I drooping sit,<br>
And spend many an anxious hour,<br>
Nor in my book can I take delight,<br>
Nor sit in learnings bower,<br>
Worn thro' with the dreary shower.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;15</p>
        <p><br>
How can the bird that is born for joy,<br>
Sit in a cage and sing.<br>
How can a child when fears annoy,<br>
But droop his tender wing,<br>
And forget his youthful spring.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 20</p>
        <p><br>
O! father &amp; mother. if buds are nip'd,<br>
And blossoms blown away,<br>
And if the tender plants are strip'd<br>
Of their joy in the springing day,<br>
By sorrow and care's dismay.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;25</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>How shall the summer arise in joy.<br>
Or the summer fruits appear.<br>
Or how shall we gather what griefs destroy<br>
Or bless the mellowing year.&nbsp;<br>

          <strong>The School Boy</strong>
        </p>
        <p><br>
I love to rise in a summer morn,<br>
When the birds sing on every tree;<br>
The distant huntsman winds his horn,<br>
And the sky-lark sings with me.<br>
O! what sweet company.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5</p>
        <p><br>
But to go to school in a summer morn,<br>
O! it drives all joy away;<br>
Under a cruel eye outworn.<br>
The little ones spend the day,<br>
In sighing and dismay.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;10</p>
        <p><br>
Ah! then at times I drooping sit,<br>
And spend many an anxious hour,<br>
Nor in my book can I take delight,<br>
Nor sit in learnings bower,<br>
Worn thro' with the dreary shower.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;15</p>
        <p><br>
How can the bird that is born for joy,<br>
Sit in a cage and sing.<br>
How can a child when fears annoy,<br>
But droop his tender wing,<br>
And forget his youthful spring.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 20</p>
        <p><br>
O! father &amp; mother. if buds are nip'd,<br>
And blossoms blown away,<br>
And if the tender plants are strip'd<br>
Of their joy in the springing day,<br>
By sorrow and care's dismay.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;25</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>How shall the summer arise in joy.<br>
Or the summer fruits appear.<br>
Or how shall we gather what griefs destroy<br>
Or bless the mellowing year.&nbsp;<br>
When the blasts of winter appear.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;30</p>
