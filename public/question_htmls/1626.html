The only real limitation of power is the natural consequences of the principles themselves. We are free to choose our own actions, based on our knowledge of correct principles, but we are not free to choose the consequences of those actions.&nbsp; Remember, “If you pick up one end of the stick, you pick up the other.”<br>

Principles always have natural consequences attached to them. There are positive consequences when we live in harmony with the principles. There are negative consequences when we ignore them. The more we know of correct principles, the greater our personal freedom to act wisely is.<br>

Habits are powerful factors in our lives. Because they are consistent, often unconscious patterns, they constantly, daily, express our character and produce our effectiveness... or ineffectiveness. As Horace Mann, the great educator, once said, “Habits are like a cable. We weave a strand of it every day and soon it cannot be broken.” I personally do not agree with the last part of his expression. I know they can be broken. Habits can be learned and unlearned. But I also know it isn’t a quick fix. It involves a process and tremendous commitment.<br>

On the maturity continuum, dependence is the paradigm of you – you take care of me, you come through for me, you didn’t come through. I blame you for the results. Independence is the paradigm of I. I can do it. I am responsible. I can choose. Interdependence is the paradigm of we. We can do it. We can combine our talents.<br>
<br>
Dependent people need others to get what they want. Independent people can get what they want through their own effort. Interdependent people combine their own efforts with the efforts of others to achieve their greatest success.<br>

We are not our feelings. We are not our moods. We are not even our thoughts. The very fact that we can think about these things separates us from them and from the animal world. Self-awareness enables us to stand apart and examine even the way we “see” ourselves – our self-paradigm, the most fundamental paradigm of effectiveness. It affects not only our attitudes and behaviours, but also how we see other people. It becomes our map of the basic nature of mankind.</div>
