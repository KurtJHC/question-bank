          <strong><em>Text Three: </em>Monster Waves</strong>
        </p>
        <p><br>
1&nbsp; &nbsp; The word ‘tsunami’, Japanese for ‘harbour wave’, is used to describe a series of ocean surges that send waves of water, reaching on average between 10m to 30m in height, onto land. These awesome waves are typically caused by large, underwater earthquakes, which move the water above it and launch them into rolling waves that race towards land. At top speed, tsunamis can travel up to 805 km/hr – as fast as a jet airplane!</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Tsunamis do not usually take the form of one large wave, as commonly shown in paintings. A tsunami is usually composed of a series of waves, called a<strong> wave train</strong>, which increases the tsunami’s destructive force as one wave after another reaches the shore. They also rarely appear as massive waves, but as an increasing tide that <strong>inundates </strong>areas by the shore, rapidly moving inland and washing away anything in its path, including buildings. Most tsunamis, about 80%, happen within the Pacific Ocean’s ‘Ring of Fire’, a geographical area where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions – another cause of tsunamis – are common.</p>

        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There is a subcategory of tsunamis that are so large and destructive that they were given the name ‘mega-tsunamis’. These extreme waves tower over standard tsunamis, often reaching well over 100m in height. The biggest of these was recorded in Lituya Bay, Alaska, at 22:15 hours on July 9, 1958. A large earthquake, reading 7.9 out of 10 on the Richter Scale, had struck south eastern Alaska, immediately triggering a major subaerial landslide of 30 million cubic metres of rock and ice in Gilbert Inlet at the head of the bay. This power and disruption to the water generated a huge wave that peaked at 1720 ft, or 524 m – 143 m higher than the roof of the Empire State Building in New York, the world’s tallest building at the time.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Not surprisingly, the wave caused major damage to the surrounding landscape. Infrastructure such as bridges, docks and oil lines all sustained damage, a water tower collapsed, and a cabin was damaged beyond repair. Trees that were impacted by the wave were also uprooted, creating a continuous empty area near the shoreline. The area, was, however, largely unpopulated; at the time, there were three fishing boats anchored near the entrance of Lituya Bay, one of which sunk, resulting in the death of the two crewmen on board, and the other two riding the wave, leaving a number of eyewitnesses who later provided accounts of their shocking observations.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;What would happen if you tried to blow a soap bubble in below-freezing weather? Would it freeze solid and fall to the ground? Would you have to hit it with a hammer to break it? These questions occurred to me one cold winter day. It was too cold to play in the snow, but it was a perfect time to experiment with blowing frozen bubbles.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;To blow frozen bubbles, I had to wait until the air outside was very cold. (For this activity, that meant 10 degrees below 0 Fahrenheit or colder.) I didn’t have the bubble stuff that comes in a jar, so I used dishwashing soap. Adding a drop of glycerin made the soap work even better. (I found glycerin at a pharmacy.) I chose a place out of the wind, and blew bubbles the same way I always do. I watched to see what would happen. Here’s what I learned.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;If the temperature is low enough, the skin of the bubble frosts over, becoming cloudy instead of clear. And what about those rainbow swirls you see in soap bubbles? The rainbow colors stay even when the bubbles frost, but they don’t swirl anymore. The bubbles still float in the air. They don’t fall to the ground any faster than they would on a warm summer day.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;When these frozen bubbles break, they don’t turn into droplets as summer bubbles do. They turn into sparkling rainbow confetti and flutter to the ground. Sometimes a frozen bubble will roll across the snow without breaking. If it<br>
breaks, it may leave a leathery bubble skin on the ground. If nothing disturbs the bubble, it may stay there for a long time.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Sometimes I could catch a bubble and hold it until the heat of my hand made it pop.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I learned one other thing about blowing frozen bubbles. It’s so much fun, I want to try it again next year!</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;What would happen if you tried to blow a soap bubble in below-freezing weather? Would it freeze solid and fall to the ground? Would you have to hit it with a hammer to break it? These questions occurred to me one cold winter day. It was too cold to play in the snow, but it was a perfect time to experiment with blowing frozen bubbles.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;To blow frozen bubbles, I had to wait until the air outside was very cold. (For this activity, that meant 10 degrees below 0 Fahrenheit or colder.) I didn’t have the bubble stuff that comes in a jar, so I used dishwashing soap. Adding a drop of glycerin made the soap work even better. (I found glycerin at a pharmacy.) I chose a place out of the wind, and blew bubbles the same way I always do. I watched to see what would happen. Here’s what I learned.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;If the temperature is low enough, the skin of the bubble frosts over, becoming cloudy instead of clear. And what about those rainbow swirls you see in soap bubbles? The rainbow colors stay even when the bubbles frost, but they don’t swirl anymore. The bubbles still float in the air. They don’t fall to the ground any faster than they would on a warm summer day.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;When these frozen bubbles break, they don’t turn into droplets as summer bubbles do. They turn into sparkling rainbow confetti and flutter to the ground. Sometimes a frozen bubble will roll across the snow without breaking. If it<br>
breaks, it may leave a leathery bubble skin on the ground. If nothing disturbs the bubble, it may stay there for a long time.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Sometimes I could catch a bubble and hold it until the heat of my hand made it pop.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I learned one other thing about blowing frozen bubbles. It’s so much fun, I want to try it again next year!</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;What would happen if you tried to blow a soap bubble in below-freezing weather? Would it freeze solid and fall to the ground? Would you have to hit it with a hammer to break it? These questions occurred to me one cold winter day. It was too cold to play in the snow, but it was a perfect time to experiment with blowing frozen bubbles.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;To blow frozen bubbles, I had to wait until the air outside was very cold. (For this activity, that meant 10 degrees below 0 Fahrenheit or colder.) I didn’t have the bubble stuff that comes in a jar, so I used dishwashing soap. Adding a drop of glycerin made the soap work even better. (I found glycerin at a pharmacy.) I chose a place out of the wind, and blew bubbles the same way I always do. I watched to see what would happen. Here’s what I learned.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;If the temperature is low enough, the skin of the bubble frosts over, becoming cloudy instead of clear. And what about those rainbow swirls you see in soap bubbles? The rainbow colors stay even when the bubbles frost, but they don’t swirl anymore. The bubbles still float in the air. They don’t fall to the ground any faster than they would on a warm summer day.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;When these frozen bubbles break, they don’t turn into droplets as summer bubbles do. They turn into sparkling rainbow confetti and flutter to the ground. Sometimes a frozen bubble will roll across the snow without breaking. If it<br>
breaks, it may leave a leathery bubble skin on the ground. If nothing disturbs the bubble, it may stay there for a long time.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Sometimes I could catch a bubble and hold it until the heat of my hand made it pop.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I learned one other thing about blowing frozen bubbles. It’s so much fun, I want to try it again next year!</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In Aesop’s fable about the crow and the jar, a thirsty crow longed for a drink of water. He spotted a jar with a little water in it, but the water was too low for him to reach it with his beak. The crow looked around, saw some stones, and was inspired. He took one stone and dropped it into the jar, then another and another. The water in the jar rose gradually, until it was high enough for him to drink.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aesop intended this story to remind humans to use their heads to solve problems. But he is also telling us about crows.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From ancient times, crows have been famous for their intelligence. They use tools, figure out how to solve problems, and even enjoy playing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scientists have observed carefully how crows go about these activities. To make tools, crows cut off leaves or twigs with their beaks, shape them, and use them to probe for bugs in wood or plants. Just as a carpenter carries his tools with him, a crow will carry its tool around. When the leaf or twig isn’t needed for the moment, the bird stores the tool at its feet or secures it on a perch.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To test wild crows’ problem-solving abilities, scientists placed food outdoors in closed containers. They watched in fascination as the birds figured out how to open plastic bowls with lids—and even boxes with hinged lids—to get at the treats.</p>
        <p>Most of the crow’s reputation for cleverness, however, comes not from scientific studies, but from people who study nature.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, naturalists<sup>1</sup> have observed the birds take advantage of traffic. The crows drop a walnut on the road and wait for a car to run over it to crush the shell.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Iceland, fishermen cut holes in the ice, drop a baited string into the hole, and wait for a fish to take the bait. Crows walk over the ice and pull up the string to steal the bait or, better yet, the fish.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crows seem to enjoy playing. Young crows will carry a stick or nut into the air, drop it, and swoop to catch the object as it falls. They hang upside down from a branch,<br>
or lie on their backs and use their feet to play with sticks.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet crows are playful, too. A pet crow will follow its owner around, ride on his shoulder, sit beside him, and sometimes pull keys from his pocket.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So just how smart are crows? Perhaps a crow will never do tricks as a dog will. But scientists and naturalists agree with Aesop: There’s a lot going on in the brain of the clever crow.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In Aesop’s fable about the crow and the jar, a thirsty crow longed for a drink of water. He spotted a jar with a little water in it, but the water was too low for him to reach it with his beak. The crow looked around, saw some stones, and was inspired. He took one stone and dropped it into the jar, then another and another. The water in the jar rose gradually, until it was high enough for him to drink.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aesop intended this story to remind humans to use their heads to solve problems. But he is also telling us about crows.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From ancient times, crows have been famous for their intelligence. They use tools, figure out how to solve problems, and even enjoy playing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scientists have observed carefully how crows go about these activities. To make tools, crows cut off leaves or twigs with their beaks, shape them, and use them to probe for bugs in wood or plants. Just as a carpenter carries his tools with him, a crow will carry its tool around. When the leaf or twig isn’t needed for the moment, the bird stores the tool at its feet or secures it on a perch.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To test wild crows’ problem-solving abilities, scientists placed food outdoors in closed containers. They watched in fascination as the birds figured out how to open plastic bowls with lids—and even boxes with hinged lids—to get at the treats.</p>
        <p>Most of the crow’s reputation for cleverness, however, comes not from scientific studies, but from people who study nature.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, naturalists<sup>1</sup> have observed the birds take advantage of traffic. The crows drop a walnut on the road and wait for a car to run over it to crush the shell.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Iceland, fishermen cut holes in the ice, drop a baited string into the hole, and wait for a fish to take the bait. Crows walk over the ice and pull up the string to steal the bait or, better yet, the fish.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crows seem to enjoy playing. Young crows will carry a stick or nut into the air, drop it, and swoop to catch the object as it falls. They hang upside down from a branch,<br>
or lie on their backs and use their feet to play with sticks.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet crows are playful, too. A pet crow will follow its owner around, ride on his shoulder, sit beside him, and sometimes pull keys from his pocket.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So just how smart are crows? Perhaps a crow will never do tricks as a dog will. But scientists and naturalists agree with Aesop: There’s a lot going on in the brain of the clever crow.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In Aesop’s fable about the crow and the jar, a thirsty crow longed for a drink of water. He spotted a jar with a little water in it, but the water was too low for him to reach it with his beak. The crow looked around, saw some stones, and was inspired. He took one stone and dropped it into the jar, then another and another. The water in the jar rose gradually, until it was high enough for him to drink.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aesop intended this story to remind humans to use their heads to solve problems. But he is also telling us about crows.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From ancient times, crows have been famous for their intelligence. They use tools, figure out how to solve problems, and even enjoy playing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scientists have observed carefully how crows go about these activities. To make tools, crows cut off leaves or twigs with their beaks, shape them, and use them to probe for bugs in wood or plants. Just as a carpenter carries his tools with him, a crow will carry its tool around. When the leaf or twig isn’t needed for the moment, the bird stores the tool at its feet or secures it on a perch.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To test wild crows’ problem-solving abilities, scientists placed food outdoors in closed containers. They watched in fascination as the birds figured out how to open plastic bowls with lids—and even boxes with hinged lids—to get at the treats.</p>
        <p>Most of the crow’s reputation for cleverness, however, comes not from scientific studies, but from people who study nature.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, naturalists<sup>1</sup> have observed the birds take advantage of traffic. The crows drop a walnut on the road and wait for a car to run over it to crush the shell.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Iceland, fishermen cut holes in the ice, drop a baited string into the hole, and wait for a fish to take the bait. Crows walk over the ice and pull up the string to steal the bait or, better yet, the fish.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crows seem to enjoy playing. Young crows will carry a stick or nut into the air, drop it, and swoop to catch the object as it falls. They hang upside down from a branch,<br>
or lie on their backs and use their feet to play with sticks.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet crows are playful, too. A pet crow will follow its owner around, ride on his shoulder, sit beside him, and sometimes pull keys from his pocket.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So just how smart are crows? Perhaps a crow will never do tricks as a dog will. But scientists and naturalists agree with Aesop: There’s a lot going on in the brain of the clever crow.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In Aesop’s fable about the crow and the jar, a thirsty crow longed for a drink of water. He spotted a jar with a little water in it, but the water was too low for him to reach it with his beak. The crow looked around, saw some stones, and was inspired. He took one stone and dropped it into the jar, then another and another. The water in the jar rose gradually, until it was high enough for him to drink.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aesop intended this story to remind humans to use their heads to solve problems. But he is also telling us about crows.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From ancient times, crows have been famous for their intelligence. They use tools, figure out how to solve problems, and even enjoy playing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scientists have observed carefully how crows go about these activities. To make tools, crows cut off leaves or twigs with their beaks, shape them, and use them to probe for bugs in wood or plants. Just as a carpenter carries his tools with him, a crow will carry its tool around. When the leaf or twig isn’t needed for the moment, the bird stores the tool at its feet or secures it on a perch.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To test wild crows’ problem-solving abilities, scientists placed food outdoors in closed containers. They watched in fascination as the birds figured out how to open plastic bowls with lids—and even boxes with hinged lids—to get at the treats.</p>
        <p>Most of the crow’s reputation for cleverness, however, comes not from scientific studies, but from people who study nature.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, naturalists<sup>1</sup> have observed the birds take advantage of traffic. The crows drop a walnut on the road and wait for a car to run over it to crush the shell.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Iceland, fishermen cut holes in the ice, drop a baited string into the hole, and wait for a fish to take the bait. Crows walk over the ice and pull up the string to steal the bait or, better yet, the fish.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crows seem to enjoy playing. Young crows will carry a stick or nut into the air, drop it, and swoop to catch the object as it falls. They hang upside down from a branch,<br>
or lie on their backs and use their feet to play with sticks.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pet crows are playful, too. A pet crow will follow its owner around, ride on his shoulder, sit beside him, and sometimes pull keys from his pocket.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So just how smart are crows? Perhaps a crow will never do tricks as a dog will. But scientists and naturalists agree with Aesop: There’s a lot going on in the brain of the clever crow.</p>

        </p>
        <p>What’s it like to be a popular teen author? We asked Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, author of <em>In the Forests of the Night and Demon in My View</em> to find out. At only thirteen, she wrote her first novel, <em>In the Forests of the Night</em>, but never dreamed it would be published. On her fourteenth birthday, she found out that her first novel was accepted for publication. What a birthday present! Here’s what she has to say about writing:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Where do you get your inspiration?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Everywhere. Things friends will say, things I see, characters that intrigue me.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>How do you come up with your ideas?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>I start with a minor character, then expand on that character. In the first book I ever wrote, I just threw together everyone I knew, scanty<sup>1</sup> plot line, flat characters. I just wrote to pass the time. That book will never <em>ever </em>be<br>
published (she says, laughing). Eventually, I wanted to know more about the characters I’d created. The first things I wrote weren’t very good, but they did get me started writing, which was important.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Have you had anything else published before your first novel?</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>In the Forests of the Night</em> was the first thing I had published. My sister’s English teacher, Tom Hart, happened to be a literary agent as well. A friend bragged about me to him and he asked to see my books. He submitted my manuscript to a few houses,<sup>2</sup> and Doubleday took it.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>How has your writing evolved?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Every book I write, I get more into it. History is one of my passions right now. Sometimes I’ll take inspiration from characters in Ancient Egypt, Rome, or Mesoamerica. My first characters were flat, but now they’re more&nbsp;complex. Some of my characters now I feel I know really well. I know them like best friends, sometimes better.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>How did it feel the first time you were published?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>It came as a shock. The first time I saw my book in print I could barely believe it. I had to tell myself this is real, I’m not dreaming.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>What does your writing space look like?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>I mostly write on the computer in my room (which is, of course, trashed). I can write anywhere as long as it’s quiet. I also do writing and character sketches in notebooks.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>How do you make time for your writing?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Writing is one of those things that you will make time for if you want to do it. When I have something to write, I’ll need to write it, whether it’s staying up till 3 a.m. or jotting it down in the middle of Physics. If you love writing, you will make time for it.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Do you think reading helps writing?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Definitely. I can’t understand when people say they like to write, but not read. When you read, you get used to visualizing things in print. I’m not a big television/movie fan, so I always have spent a lot of time reading. You learn to see things in words. You figure out how to express yourself in words. It becomes like another sense. Reading teaches you the mechanics and logistics,<sup>3</sup> like vocab and structure,<br>
that are important to writing. You learn the basics, then get the ideas for your writing. It’s like people who listen to music a lot, they’ll eventually want to sing.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>What’s your advice for aspiring kid writers?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Go out and do it. Find other people who write. When I found other people who wrote, I felt more comfortable about myself. Keep at it! You can always edit. Every author is his or her own worst critic. If you love to write, just do it.</p>

        <p>What’s it like to be a popular teen author? We asked Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, author of <em>In the Forests of the Night and Demon in My View</em> to find out. At only thirteen, she wrote her first novel, <em>In the Forests of the Night</em>, but never dreamed it would be published. On her fourteenth birthday, she found out that her first novel was accepted for publication. What a birthday present! Here’s what she has to say about writing:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Where do you get your inspiration?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Everywhere. Things friends will say, things I see, characters that intrigue me.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>How do you come up with your ideas?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>I start with a minor character, then expand on that character. In the first book I ever wrote, I just threw together everyone I knew, scanty<sup>1</sup> plot line, flat characters. I just wrote to pass the time. That book will never <em>ever </em>be<br>
published (she says, laughing). Eventually, I wanted to know more about the characters I’d created. The first things I wrote weren’t very good, but they did get me started writing, which was important.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Have you had anything else published before your first novel?</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>In the Forests of the Night</em> was the first thing I had published. My sister’s English teacher, Tom Hart, happened to be a literary agent as well. A friend bragged about me to him and he asked to see my books. He submitted my manuscript to a few houses,<sup>2</sup> and Doubleday took it.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>How has your writing evolved?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Every book I write, I get more into it. History is one of my passions right now. Sometimes I’ll take inspiration from characters in Ancient Egypt, Rome, or Mesoamerica. My first characters were flat, but now they’re more&nbsp;complex. Some of my characters now I feel I know really well. I know them like best friends, sometimes better.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>How did it feel the first time you were published?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>It came as a shock. The first time I saw my book in print I could barely believe it. I had to tell myself this is real, I’m not dreaming.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>What does your writing space look like?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>I mostly write on the computer in my room (which is, of course, trashed). I can write anywhere as long as it’s quiet. I also do writing and character sketches in notebooks.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>How do you make time for your writing?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Writing is one of those things that you will make time for if you want to do it. When I have something to write, I’ll need to write it, whether it’s staying up till 3 a.m. or jotting it down in the middle of Physics. If you love writing, you will make time for it.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Do you think reading helps writing?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Definitely. I can’t understand when people say they like to write, but not read. When you read, you get used to visualizing things in print. I’m not a big television/movie fan, so I always have spent a lot of time reading. You learn to see things in words. You figure out how to express yourself in words. It becomes like another sense. Reading teaches you the mechanics and logistics,<sup>3</sup> like vocab and structure,<br>
that are important to writing. You learn the basics, then get the ideas for your writing. It’s like people who listen to music a lot, they’ll eventually want to sing.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>What’s your advice for aspiring kid writers?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Go out and do it. Find other people who write. When I found other people who wrote, I felt more comfortable about myself. Keep at it! You can always edit. Every author is his or her own worst critic. If you love to write, just do it.</p>

        <p>What’s it like to be a popular teen author? We asked Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, author of <em>In the Forests of the Night and Demon in My View</em> to find out. At only thirteen, she wrote her first novel, <em>In the Forests of the Night</em>, but never dreamed it would be published. On her fourteenth birthday, she found out that her first novel was accepted for publication. What a birthday present! Here’s what she has to say about writing:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Where do you get your inspiration?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Everywhere. Things friends will say, things I see, characters that intrigue me.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>How do you come up with your ideas?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>I start with a minor character, then expand on that character. In the first book I ever wrote, I just threw together everyone I knew, scanty<sup>1</sup> plot line, flat characters. I just wrote to pass the time. That book will never <em>ever </em>be<br>
published (she says, laughing). Eventually, I wanted to know more about the characters I’d created. The first things I wrote weren’t very good, but they did get me started writing, which was important.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Have you had anything else published before your first novel?</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>In the Forests of the Night</em> was the first thing I had published. My sister’s English teacher, Tom Hart, happened to be a literary agent as well. A friend bragged about me to him and he asked to see my books. He submitted my manuscript to a few houses,<sup>2</sup> and Doubleday took it.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>How has your writing evolved?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Every book I write, I get more into it. History is one of my passions right now. Sometimes I’ll take inspiration from characters in Ancient Egypt, Rome, or Mesoamerica. My first characters were flat, but now they’re more&nbsp;complex. Some of my characters now I feel I know really well. I know them like best friends, sometimes better.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>How did it feel the first time you were published?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>It came as a shock. The first time I saw my book in print I could barely believe it. I had to tell myself this is real, I’m not dreaming.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>What does your writing space look like?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>I mostly write on the computer in my room (which is, of course, trashed). I can write anywhere as long as it’s quiet. I also do writing and character sketches in notebooks.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>How do you make time for your writing?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Writing is one of those things that you will make time for if you want to do it. When I have something to write, I’ll need to write it, whether it’s staying up till 3 a.m. or jotting it down in the middle of Physics. If you love writing, you will make time for it.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Do you think reading helps writing?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Definitely. I can’t understand when people say they like to write, but not read. When you read, you get used to visualizing things in print. I’m not a big television/movie fan, so I always have spent a lot of time reading. You learn to see things in words. You figure out how to express yourself in words. It becomes like another sense. Reading teaches you the mechanics and logistics,<sup>3</sup> like vocab and structure,<br>
that are important to writing. You learn the basics, then get the ideas for your writing. It’s like people who listen to music a lot, they’ll eventually want to sing.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>What’s your advice for aspiring kid writers?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Go out and do it. Find other people who write. When I found other people who wrote, I felt more comfortable about myself. Keep at it! You can always edit. Every author is his or her own worst critic. If you love to write, just do it.</p>

          <strong>Why We Play</strong>
        </p>
        <p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why play games? Because they are fun, of course, and a lot more besides. Following the rules . . . planning your next move . . . acting as a team member . . . these are all “game” ideas that you will run into throughout your life.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Think about some of the games you played as a young child, such as hopscotch and hide-and-go-seek. These games are more than a hundred years old, and children all over the world play some variation of them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The games of children’s cultures are entertaining and fun. But perhaps more importantly, they translate life into exciting dramas that teach children some of the basic rules they will be expected to follow the rest of their lives, such as taking turns and cooperating.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Many children’s games have a practical side. Children around the world play games that prepare them for work they will do as grown-ups.

          <strong>Why We Play</strong>
        </p>
        <p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why play games? Because they are fun, of course, and a lot more besides. Following the rules . . . planning your next move . . . acting as a team member . . . these are all “game” ideas that you will run into throughout your life.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Think about some of the games you played as a young child, such as hopscotch and hide-and-go-seek. These games are more than a hundred years old, and children all over the world play some variation of them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The games of children’s cultures are entertaining and fun. But perhaps more importantly, they translate life into exciting dramas that teach children some of the basic rules they will be expected to follow the rest of their lives, such as taking turns and cooperating.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Many children’s games have a practical side. Children around the world play games that prepare them for work they will do as grown-ups. For instance, some Saudi Arabian children live in the desert interior. They play a game called bones, which sharpens the hand-eye coordination needed in hunting.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Many sports encourage national or local pride. The most famous games of all, the Olympic Games, bring athletes from around the world together to engage in friendly competition. Spectators wave flags, knowing that a gold medal is a win for an entire country, not just the athlete who earned it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One of the most poignant images of the games is watching a gold medal-winning athlete stand on the podium as his or her national anthem is played. For countries experiencing turmoil either in the form of natural disasters or war, an Olympic win can mean so much.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sports are also a unifying event. Soccer is the most popular sport in the world. People on all continents play the game—some for fun and some for a living. Nicolette Iribarne, a soccer player from California, has discovered a way to spread hope through soccer. Iribarne created Fútbol 4 Refugees after participating in an international soccer tournament. The mission of the group is to provide children living in refugee camps with soccer balls. Other groups such as Playing for Peace and Right to Play provide opportunities for children who otherwise might never play soccer or throw a Frisbee.</p>

          <strong>Why We Play</strong>
        </p>
        <p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why play games? Because they are fun, of course, and a lot more besides. Following the rules . . . planning your next move . . . acting as a team member . . . these are all “game” ideas that you will run into throughout your life.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Think about some of the games you played as a young child, such as hopscotch and hide-and-go-seek. These games are more than a hundred years old, and children all over the world play some variation of them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The games of children’s cultures are entertaining and fun. But perhaps more importantly, they translate life into exciting dramas that teach children some of the basic rules they will be expected to follow the rest of their lives, such as taking turns and cooperating.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Many children’s games have a practical side. Children around the world play games that prepare them for work they will do as grown-ups. For instance, some Saudi Arabian children live in the desert interior. They play a game called bones, which sharpens the hand-eye coordination needed in hunting.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Many sports encourage national or local pride. The most famous games of all, the Olympic Games, bring athletes from around the world together to engage in friendly competition. Spectators wave flags, knowing that a gold medal is a win for an entire country, not just the athlete who earned it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One of the most poignant images of the games is watching a gold medal-winning athlete stand on the podium as his or her national anthem is played. For countries experiencing turmoil either in the form of natural disasters or war, an Olympic win can mean so much.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sports are also a unifying event. Soccer is the most popular sport in the world. People on all continents play the game—some for fun and some for a living. Nicolette Iribarne, a soccer player from California, has discovered a way to spread hope through soccer. Iribarne created Fútbol 4 Refugees after participating in an international soccer tournament. The mission of the group is to provide children living in refugee camps with soccer balls. Other groups such as Playing for Peace and Right to Play provide opportunities for children who otherwise might never play soccer or throw a Frisbee.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The next time you play your favorite game or sport, think about why you enjoy it. What skills are needed to excel in your favorite game or sport? Do you think these skills will help you in other aspects of your life? But most importantly, the next time you play, have fun!</p>

          <strong>Mother Has a Job</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Livia Bitton-Jackson</em>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">________________________________________________</p>
        <p>The book <em>Hello, America</em> chronicles the experiences of a young woman and her mother who have emigrated from Hungary to America in the early 1950s. In this passage, the two reveal the fun they have working together to adapt to their new life in America.</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">________________________________________________</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the morning Mother and I travel together to work. Rising at the crack of dawn, I love the adventure of tiptoeing around in the dark living room where we sleep, whispering to each other so as not to wake Aunt Celia and Uncle Martin in the bedroom, then leaving the house soundlessly and making our way to the subway station in semidarkness. By the time we reach Kings Highway, the rising day splatters an eerie light on the deserted avenue ordinarily swarming with human traffic, and on the shuttered storefronts and fruit stands now cozily wrapped in layers of canvas. There is a sense of mystery—a sense of power—in being here before the rest of the world awakens . . . as if witnessing the beginning of time.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We love traveling together on the subway, Mother and I. It’s fun to observe our fellow subway riders, exchange jokes and asides<sup>1</sup> in Hungarian, play guessing games as to their identities, their ages, and their jobs and make bets as to where they’d be getting off.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In a couple of weeks Mother becomes familiar with the train route, and she no longer allows me to accompany her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“But I’ll miss the fun of traveling together in the morning,” I protest.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“So will I. But it comes at a sacrifice. In order to accompany me, you must rise an hour earlier, losing an hour’s sleep. You need that extra hour of sleep.” Mother is firm, and I have no choice but to comply and regretfully give up on our morning fun.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I hope you’ll have time to teach me English. Now that I have a job and travel alone on the subway, I’ll need to improve my vocabulary. I don’t want to depend on you every time I need to make a phone call in English, or want to take public transport.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Okay, madam,” I agree in a happy, jocular tone. “How about today? Let’s have our first lesson this evening!”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Every evening I grill Mother in vocabulary and grammar, and indeed in a couple of weeks she learns enough English to do marketing on her own and travel freely by subway.</p>

          <strong>Mother Has a Job</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Livia Bitton-Jackson</em>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">________________________________________________</p>
        <p>The book <em>Hello, America</em> chronicles the experiences of a young woman and her mother who have emigrated from Hungary to America in the early 1950s. In this passage, the two reveal the fun they have working together to adapt to their new life in America.</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">________________________________________________</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the morning Mother and I travel together to work. Rising at the crack of dawn, I love the adventure of tiptoeing around in the dark living room where we sleep, whispering to each other so as not to wake Aunt Celia and Uncle Martin in the bedroom, then leaving the house soundlessly and making our way to the subway station in semidarkness. By the time we reach Kings Highway, the rising day splatters an eerie light on the deserted avenue ordinarily swarming with human traffic, and on the shuttered storefronts and fruit stands now cozily wrapped in layers of canvas. There is a sense of mystery—a sense of power—in being here before the rest of the world awakens . . . as if witnessing the beginning of time.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We love traveling together on the subway, Mother and I. It’s fun to observe our fellow subway riders, exchange jokes and asides<sup>1</sup> in Hungarian, play guessing games as to their identities, their ages, and their jobs and make bets as to where they’d be getting off.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In a couple of weeks Mother becomes familiar with the train route, and she no longer allows me to accompany her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“But I’ll miss the fun of traveling together in the morning,” I protest.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“So will I. But it comes at a sacrifice. In order to accompany me, you must rise an hour earlier, losing an hour’s sleep. You need that extra hour of sleep.” Mother is firm, and I have no choice but to comply and regretfully give up on our morning fun.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I hope you’ll have time to teach me English. Now that I have a job and travel alone on the subway, I’ll need to improve my vocabulary. I don’t want to depend on you every time I need to make a phone call in English, or want to take public transport.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Okay, madam,” I agree in a happy, jocular tone. “How about today? Let’s have our first lesson this evening!”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Every evening I grill Mother in vocabulary and grammar, and indeed in a couple of weeks she learns enough English to do marketing on her own and travel freely by subway.</p>

          <strong>Mother Has a Job</strong>

          <em>by Livia Bitton-Jackson</em>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">________________________________________________</p>
        <p>The book <em>Hello, America</em> chronicles the experiences of a young woman and her mother who have emigrated from Hungary to America in the early 1950s. In this passage, the two reveal the fun they have working together to adapt to their new life in America.</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">________________________________________________</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the morning Mother and I travel together to work. Rising at the crack of dawn, I love the adventure of tiptoeing around in the dark living room where we sleep, whispering to each other so as not to wake Aunt Celia and Uncle Martin in the bedroom, then leaving the house soundlessly and making our way to the subway station in semidarkness. By the time we reach Kings Highway, the rising day splatters an eerie light on the deserted avenue ordinarily swarming with human traffic, and on the shuttered storefronts and fruit stands now cozily wrapped in layers of canvas. There is a sense of mystery—a sense of power—in being here before the rest of the world awakens . . . as if witnessing the beginning of time.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We love traveling together on the subway, Mother and I. It’s fun to observe our fellow subway riders, exchange jokes and asides<sup>1</sup> in Hungarian, play guessing games as to their identities, their ages, and their jobs and make bets as to where they’d be getting off.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In a couple of weeks Mother becomes familiar with the train route, and she no longer allows me to accompany her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“But I’ll miss the fun of traveling together in the morning,” I protest.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“So will I. But it comes at a sacrifice. In order to accompany me, you must rise an hour earlier, losing an hour’s sleep. You need that extra hour of sleep.” Mother is firm, and I have no choice but to comply and regretfully give up on our morning fun.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I hope you’ll have time to teach me English. Now that I have a job and travel alone on the subway, I’ll need to improve my vocabulary. I don’t want to depend on you every time I need to make a phone call in English, or want to take public transport.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Okay, madam,” I agree in a happy, jocular tone. “How about today? Let’s have our first lesson this evening!”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Every evening I grill Mother in vocabulary and grammar, and indeed in a couple of weeks she learns enough English to do marketing on her own and travel freely by subway.</p>
