          <strong>Blackbeard: History of the Dreaded Pirate</strong>
        </p>
        <p><strong>15</strong> &nbsp;……… He and other pirates plagued shipping lanes off North America and throughout the Caribbean in the early-eighteenth century: an era commonly referred to as the "Golden Age of Piracy." Despite his legendary reputation, little is known about the early life of Blackbeard. Even his true name is uncertain, though it is usually given as some variation of Edward Thatch or Teach. It is believed that he served as a privateer during Queen Anne's War (1701 - 1714),</p>
        <p><strong>16</strong> &nbsp;……… The earliest primary source document that mentions Blackbeard by name dates to the summer of 1717. Other records indicate that by the fall of 1717 Blackbeard was operating off Delaware and Chesapeake bays in conjunction with two other pirate captains, Benjamin Hornigold and Stede Bonnet. Blackbeard served an apprenticeship under Hornigold before becoming a pirate captain in his own right.</p>
        <p><strong>17</strong> &nbsp;……… Late in the fall of 1717, the pirates made their way to the eastern Caribbean. It was here, off the island of Martinique, that Blackbeard and his fellow pirates captured the French slaveship La Concorde -- a vessel he would keep as his flagship and rename Queen Anne's Revenge. After crossing the Atlantic during its third journey, and only 100 miles from Martinique, the French ship encountered Blackbeard and his company. According to a primary account, the pirates were aboard two sloops, one with 120 men and twelve cannon, and the other with thirty men and eight cannon. With the French crew already reduced by sixteen fatalities and another thirty-six seriously ill from scurvy and dysentery, the French were powerless to resist. After the pirates fired two volleys at La Concorde, Captain Dosset surrendered the ship. The pirates took La Concorde to the island of Bequia in the Grenadines where the French crew and the enslaved Africans were put ashore. While the pirates searched La Concorde, the French cabin boy, Louis Arot, informed them of the gold dust that was aboard. The pirates searched the French officers and crew and seized the gold. The cabin boy and three of his fellow French crewmen voluntarily joined the pirates, and ten others were taken by force including a pilot, three surgeons, two carpenters, two sailors, and the cook. Blackbeard and his crew decided to keep La Concorde and left the French the smaller of the two pirate sloops. The French gave their new and much smaller vessel the appropriate name Mauvaise Rencontre (Bad Encounter) and, in two trips, succeeded in transporting the remaining Africans from Bequia to Martinique.</p>
        <p><strong>18</strong> &nbsp;……… 1717-1718. Leaving Bequia in late November, Blackbeard cruised the Caribbean in his new ship, now renamed Queen Anne's Revenge, taking prizes and adding to his fleet. From the Grenadines, Blackbeard sailed north along the Lesser Antilles plundering ships near St. Vincent, St. Lucia, Nevis, and Antigua, and by early December he had arrived off the eastern end of Puerto Rico. From there, a former captive reported that the pirates were headed to Samana Bay in Hispaniola (Dominican Republic). By April 1718, the pirates were off the Turneffe Islands in the Bay of Honduras. It was there that Blackbeard captured the sloop Adventure, forcing the sloop's captain, David Herriot, to join him. Sailing east once again, the pirates passed near the Cayman Islands and captured a Spanish sloop off Cuba that they also added to their flotilla. Blackbeard then turned to terrorizing Charleston in 1718. Turning north, they sailed through the Bahamas and proceeded up the North American coast. In May 1718, the pirates arrived off Charleston, South Carolina, with Queen Anne's Revenge and three smaller sloops. In perhaps the most brazen act of his piratical career, Blackbeard blockaded the port of Charleston for nearly a week. The pirates seized several ships attempting to enter or leave the port and detained the crew and passengers of one ship, the Crowley, as prisoners. As ransom for the hostages, Blackbeard demanded a chest of medicine. Once delivered, the captives were released, and the pirates continued their journey up the coast.</p>
        <p><strong>19 </strong>&nbsp;……… Soon after leaving Charleston, Blackbeard's fleet tried to enter Old Topsail Inlet in North Carolina, now known as Beaufort Inlet. During that attempt, Queen Anne's Revenge and the sloop Adventure grounded on a sandbar and were abandoned. Research has uncovered two eyewitness accounts that shed light on where the two pirate vessels were lost. But was the loss of QAR Blackbeard's gambit? According to a deposition given by David Herriot, the former captain of Adventure, Blackbeard intentionally grounded Queen Anne's Revenge and Adventure in order to break up the company, which by this time had grown to over 300 pirates. Intentional or not, that is what happened as Blackbeard marooned some pirates and left Beaufort with a hand picked crew and most of the valuable plunder.</p>
        <p><strong>20</strong> &nbsp;……… Blackbeard's piratical career ended six months later at Ocracoke Inlet on the North Carolina coast. There he encountered an armed contingent sent by Virginia Governor Alexander Spotswood and led by Royal Navy Lieutenant Robert Maynard. In a desperate battle aboard Maynard's sloop, Blackbeard and a number of his fellow pirates were killed. Maynard returned to Virginia with the surviving pirates and the grim trophy of Blackbeard's severed head hanging from the sloop's bowsprit.</p>

          <strong>Blackbeard: History of the Dreaded Pirate</strong>
        </p>
        <p><strong>15</strong> &nbsp;……… He and other pirates plagued shipping lanes off North America and throughout the Caribbean in the early-eighteenth century: an era commonly referred to as the "Golden Age of Piracy." Despite his legendary reputation, little is known about the early life of Blackbeard. Even his true name is uncertain, though it is usually given as some variation of Edward Thatch or Teach. It is believed that he served as a privateer during Queen Anne's War (1701 - 1714),</p>
        <p><strong>16</strong> &nbsp;……… The earliest primary source document that mentions Blackbeard by name dates to the summer of 1717. Other records indicate that by the fall of 1717 Blackbeard was operating off Delaware and Chesapeake bays in conjunction with two other pirate captains, Benjamin Hornigold and Stede Bonnet. Blackbeard served an apprenticeship under Hornigold before becoming a pirate captain in his own right.</p>
        <p><strong>17</strong> &nbsp;……… Late in the fall of 1717, the pirates made their way to the eastern Caribbean. It was here, off the island of Martinique, that Blackbeard and his fellow pirates captured the French slaveship La Concorde -- a vessel he would keep as his flagship and rename Queen Anne's Revenge. After crossing the Atlantic during its third journey, and only 100 miles from Martinique, the French ship encountered Blackbeard and his company. According to a primary account, the pirates were aboard two sloops, one with 120 men and twelve cannon, and the other with thirty men and eight cannon. With the French crew already reduced by sixteen fatalities and another thirty-six seriously ill from scurvy and dysentery, the French were powerless to resist. After the pirates fired two volleys at La Concorde, Captain Dosset surrendered the ship. The pirates took La Concorde to the island of Bequia in the Grenadines where the French crew and the enslaved Africans were put ashore. While the pirates searched La Concorde, the French cabin boy, Louis Arot, informed them of the gold dust that was aboard. The pirates searched the French officers and crew and seized the gold. The cabin boy and three of his fellow French crewmen voluntarily joined the pirates, and ten others were taken by force including a pilot, three surgeons, two carpenters, two sailors, and the cook. Blackbeard and his crew decided to keep La Concorde and left the French the smaller of the two pirate sloops. The French gave their new and much smaller vessel the appropriate name Mauvaise Rencontre (Bad Encounter) and, in two trips, succeeded in transporting the remaining Africans from Bequia to Martinique.</p>
        <p><strong>18</strong> &nbsp;……… 1717-1718. Leaving Bequia in late November, Blackbeard cruised the Caribbean in his new ship, now renamed Queen Anne's Revenge, taking prizes and adding to his fleet. From the Grenadines, Blackbeard sailed north along the Lesser Antilles plundering ships near St. Vincent, St. Lucia, Nevis, and Antigua, and by early December he had arrived off the eastern end of Puerto Rico. From there, a former captive reported that the pirates were headed to Samana Bay in Hispaniola (Dominican Republic). By April 1718, the pirates were off the Turneffe Islands in the Bay of Honduras. It was there that Blackbeard captured the sloop Adventure, forcing the sloop's captain, David Herriot, to join him. Sailing east once again, the pirates passed near the Cayman Islands and captured a Spanish sloop off Cuba that they also added to their flotilla. Blackbeard then turned to terrorizing Charleston in 1718. Turning north, they sailed through the Bahamas and proceeded up the North American coast. In May 1718, the pirates arrived off Charleston, South Carolina, with Queen Anne's Revenge and three smaller sloops. In perhaps the most brazen act of his piratical career, Blackbeard blockaded the port of Charleston for nearly a week. The pirates seized several ships attempting to enter or leave the port and detained the crew and passengers of one ship, the Crowley, as prisoners. As ransom for the hostages, Blackbeard demanded a chest of medicine. Once delivered, the captives were released, and the pirates continued their journey up the coast.</p>
        <p><strong>19 </strong>&nbsp;……… Soon after leaving Charleston, Blackbeard's fleet tried to enter Old Topsail Inlet in North Carolina, now known as Beaufort Inlet. During that attempt, Queen Anne's Revenge and the sloop Adventure grounded on a sandbar and were abandoned. Research has uncovered two eyewitness accounts that shed light on where the two pirate vessels were lost. But was the loss of QAR Blackbeard's gambit? According to a deposition given by David Herriot, the former captain of Adventure, Blackbeard intentionally grounded Queen Anne's Revenge and Adventure in order to break up the company, which by this time had grown to over 300 pirates. Intentional or not, that is what happened as Blackbeard marooned some pirates and left Beaufort with a hand picked crew and most of the valuable plunder.</p>
        <p><strong>20</strong> &nbsp;……… Blackbeard's piratical career ended six months later at Ocracoke Inlet on the North Carolina coast. There he encountered an armed contingent sent by Virginia Governor Alexander Spotswood and led by Royal Navy Lieutenant Robert Maynard. In a desperate battle aboard Maynard's sloop, Blackbeard and a number of his fellow pirates were killed. Maynard returned to Virginia with the surviving pirates and the grim trophy of Blackbeard's severed head hanging from the sloop's bowsprit.</p>

Rugby League, or Rugby League Football to give it its full title, is a hard-hitting, fast-flowing team sport requiring a number of attributes including speed, strength, determination, courage and a willingness to take a hit — and lots of them. As a contact sport, Rugby League is one of the most physical there is. But don’t think that Rugby League is all about sheer size and strength, as although it is an obvious advantage, skill and tactics play a significant part in the game too. Rugby League players have to be multi-skilled, being able to run, kick and handle the ball well, but players do have specialist roles within their team to utilise their specific skills and attributes. The laws of Rugby League have been changed over the years, many of the changes aimed at creating a faster, more spectator-friendly sport. The absence of mauls, rucks and line-outs (found in Rugby Union), mean there are generally fewer stoppages in play and fewer laws for the referee to interpret, making it easier for the spectator to follow. When taking into consideration the fact that there are only 13 players on the field of play (compared to 15 in Rugby Union), that’s a lot of ground for the players to cover, so they need to be very fit and mobile.<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Most parents understand the wide-ranging health and fitness benefits associated with encouraging their child to take up a team sport. These may include… making regular exercise a habit from a young age; developing bone and muscle strength; developing cardiovascular fitness; maintaining a healthy weight; learning the importance of eating right; and reducing their risk of illness and disease. But what is less commonly talked about is the immense mental, emotional and social benefits that playing a team sport can offer your child. There is now a growing body of research focusing on these benefits. This research highlights many advantages that your child will enjoy by becoming involved in team sports. It doesn’t even matter what sport your child decides to play, or their skill level. It’s the mental, emotional, social skills, and lessons that they will gain by playing any type of team sport that is important.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Whilst in day-to-day life men and women live, work, and socialise together, sport has generally remained an activity that segregates its competitors by sex. The main reason for this is that men and women are physically built differently. Men are generally taller, heavier, stronger, and quicker than women which means that competing on an equal basis isn’t really possible in most sports. Generally, most sports segregate men’s and women’s competitions to ensure the sport is competitive and more enjoyable to both play and watch. However, not all sports completely segregate male and female competition. In some sports, men and women compete together and they do this in two different ways. Firstly, some sports have mixed events. This is where men and women form a team (usually, but not always, a duo) and compete against another mixed team. This way, men and women compete together and against each other in a fair way as both teams feature the same number of male and female players. Sports that operate in this way are as follows e.g badminton, tennis and ice-skating. In a small number of sports men and women compete against each other regardless of sex. The physical differences between men and women are deemed not to have any effect on the outcome of any competition. e.g. equestrian and sailing.<br>

Netball is an exciting, fast and skillful game of fair contest. It is a game in which two teams of seven players each strive to keep or gain possession of the ball. The team with the ball, through running, jumping, throwing and catching, attempts to move the ball into its goal circle from where a goal may be scored, while the opposing team uses defensive movements and strategies to prevent this and to gain possession. The team with the greater number of goals is the winner of the match. Players have specified areas in which they can move. Play restarts after each goal with teams having alternate possession. The Rules are based on the core values of equal opportunity, fair&nbsp; play and respect for an opponent’s skill&nbsp; and safety. While Netball developed first as a game predominantly played by women and girls, it is now played by boys and girls, women and men. If you are interested in finding out more about Netball you can access the Rules of Netball here on this site, or from any of the national netball associations that are affiliated to World Netball or from World Netball itself – info@worldnetball.sport.</p>

But what is less commonly talked about is the immense mental, emotional and social benefits that playing a team sport can offer your child. There is now a growing body of research focusing on these benefits. This research highlights many advantages that your child will enjoy by becoming involved in team sports. It doesn’t even matter what sport your child decides to play, or their skill level. It’s the mental, emotional, social skills, and lessons that they will gain by playing any type of team sport that is important.<br>

Whilst in day-to-day life men and women live, work, and socialise together, sport has generally remained an activity that segregates its competitors by sex. The main reason for this is that men and women are physically built differently. Men are generally taller, heavier, stronger, and quicker than women which means that competing on an equal basis isn’t really possible in most sports. Generally, most sports segregate men’s and women’s competitions to ensure the sport is competitive and more enjoyable to both play and watch. However, not all sports completely segregate male and female competition. In some sports, men and women compete together and they do this in two different ways. Firstly, some sports have mixed events. This is where men and women form a team (usually, but not always, a duo) and compete against another mixed team. This way, men and women compete together and against each other in a fair way as both teams feature the same number of male and female players. Sports that operate in this way are as follows e.g badminton, tennis and ice-skating. In a small number of sports men and women compete against each other regardless of sex. The physical differences between men and women are deemed not to have any effect on the outcome of any competition. e.g. equestrian and sailing.<br>

Netball is an exciting, fast and skillful game of fair contest. It is a game in which two teams of seven players each strive to keep or gain possession of the ball. The team with the ball, through running, jumping, throwing and catching, attempts to move the ball into its goal circle from where a goal may be scored, while the opposing team uses defensive movements and strategies to prevent this and to gain possession. The team with the greater number of goals is the winner of the match. Players have specified areas in which they can move. Play restarts after each goal with teams having alternate possession. The Rules are based on the core values of equal opportunity, fair&nbsp; play and respect for an opponent’s skill&nbsp; and safety. While Netball developed first as a game predominantly played by women and girls, it is now played by boys and girls, women and men. If you are interested in finding out more about Netball you can access the Rules of Netball here on this site, or from any of the national netball associations that are affiliated to World Netball or from World Netball itself – info@worldnetball.sport.</p>

Rugby League, or Rugby League Football to give it its full title, is a hard-hitting, fast-flowing team sport requiring a number of attributes including speed, strength, determination, courage and a willingness to take a hit — and lots of them. As a contact sport, Rugby League is one of the most physical there is. But don’t think that Rugby League is all about sheer size and strength, as although it is an obvious advantage, skill and tactics play a significant part in the game too. Rugby League players have to be multi-skilled, being able to run, kick and handle the ball well, but players do have specialist roles within their team to utilise their specific skills and attributes. The laws of Rugby League have been changed over the years, many of the changes aimed at creating a faster, more spectator-friendly sport. The absence of mauls, rucks and line-outs (found in Rugby Union), mean there are generally fewer stoppages in play and fewer laws for the referee to interpret, making it easier for the spectator to follow. When taking into consideration the fact that there are only 13 players on the field of play (compared to 15 in Rugby Union), that’s a lot of ground for the players to cover, so they need to be very fit and mobile.<br>

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Rugby League, or Rugby League Football to give it its full title, is a hard-hitting, fast-flowing team sport requiring a number of attributes including speed, strength, determination, courage and a willingness to take a hit — and lots of them. As a contact sport, Rugby League is one of the most physical there is. But don’t think that Rugby League is all about sheer size and strength, as although it is an obvious advantage, skill and tactics play a significant part in the game too. Rugby League players have to be multi-skilled, being able to run, kick and handle the ball well, but players do have specialist roles within their team to utilise their specific skills and attributes. The laws of Rugby League have been changed over the years, many of the changes aimed at creating a faster, more spectator-friendly sport. The absence of mauls, rucks and line-outs (found in Rugby Union), mean there are generally fewer stoppages in play and fewer laws for the referee to interpret, making it easier for the spectator to follow. When taking into consideration the fact that there are only 13 players on the field of play (compared to 15 in Rugby Union), that’s a lot of ground for the players to cover, so they need to be very fit and mobile.<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Most parents understand the wide-ranging health and fitness benefits associated with encouraging their child to take up a team sport. These may include… making regular exercise a habit from a young age; developing bone and muscle strength; developing cardiovascular fitness; maintaining a healthy weight; learning the importance of eating right; and reducing their risk of illness and disease. But what is less commonly talked about is the immense mental, emotional and social benefits that playing a team sport can offer your child. There is now a growing body of research focusing on these benefits. This research highlights many advantages that your child will enjoy by becoming involved in team sports. It doesn’t even matter what sport your child decides to play, or their skill level. It’s the mental, emotional, social skills, and lessons that they will gain by playing any type of team sport that is important.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Whilst in day-to-day life men and women live, work, and socialise together, sport has generally remained an activity that segregates its competitors by sex. The main reason for this is that men and women are physically built differently. Men are generally taller, heavier, stronger, and quicker than women which means that competing on an equal basis isn’t really possible in most sports. Generally, most sports segregate men’s and women’s competitions to ensure the sport is competitive and more enjoyable to both play and watch. However, not all sports completely segregate male and female competition. In some sports, men and women compete together and they do this in two different ways. Firstly, some sports have mixed events. This is where men and women form a team (usually, but not always, a duo) and compete against another mixed team. This way, men and women compete together and against each other in a fair way as both teams feature the same number of male and female players. Sports that operate in this way are as follows e.g badminton, tennis and ice-skating. In a small number of sports men and women compete against each other regardless of sex. The physical differences between men and women are deemed not to have any effect on the outcome of any competition. e.g. equestrian and sailing.<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Netball is an exciting, fast and skillful game of fair contest. It is a game in which two teams of seven players each strive to keep or gain possession of the ball. The team with the ball, through running, jumping, throwing and catching, attempts to move the ball into its goal circle from where a goal may be scored, while the opposing team uses defensive movements and strategies to prevent this and to gain possession. The team with the greater number of goals is the winner of the match. Players have specified areas in which they can move. Play restarts after each goal with teams having alternate possession. The Rules are based on the core values of equal opportunity, fair&nbsp; play and respect for an opponent’s skill&nbsp; and safety. While Netball developed first as a game predominantly played by women and girls, it is now played by boys and girls, women and men. If you are interested in finding out more about Netball you can access the Rules of Netball here on this site, or from any of the national netball associations that are affiliated to World Netball or from World Netball itself – info@worldnetball.sport.</p>
