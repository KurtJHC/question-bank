        </p>
        <p><strong>The Hobbit</strong><br><em>by J. R. R. Tolkien</em><br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;By some curious chance one morning long ago in the quiet of the world, when there was less noise and more green, and the hobbits were still numerous and prosperous, and Bilbo Baggins was standing at his door after breakfast smoking an enormous long wooden pipe that reached nearly down to his woolly toes (neatly brushed) - Gandalf came by. Gandalf! If you had heard only a quarter of what I have heard about him, and I have only heard very little of all there is to hear, you would be prepared for any sort of remarkable tale.</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>&nbsp;All that the unsuspecting Bilbo saw that morning was an old man with a staff. He had a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, a silver scarf over which his long white beard hung down below his waist, and immense black boots.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"Good Morning!" said Bilbo, and he meant it. The sun was shining, and the grass was very green. But Gandalf looked at him from under long bushy eyebrows that stuck out further than the brim of his shady hat.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"What do you mean?" he said. "Do you wish me a good morning, or mean that it is a good morning whether I want it or not; or that you feel good this morning; or that it is a morning to be good on?"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"All of them at once," said Bilbo. "And a very fine morning for a pipe of tobacco out of doors, into the bargain. If you have a pipe about you, sit down and have a fill of mine! There's no hurry, we have all the day before us!" Then Bilbo sat down on a seat by his door, crossed his legs, and blew out a beautiful grey ring of smoke that sailed up into the air without breaking and floated away over The Hill.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"Very pretty!" said Gandalf. "But I have no time to blow smoke-rings this morning. I am looking for someone to share in an adventure and it's very difficult to find anyone."<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"I should think so-in these parts! We are plain quiet folk and have no use for adventures. Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner! I can't think what anybody sees in them," said our Mr. Baggins, and stuck one thumb behind his braces, and blew out another even bigger smoke ring. Then he took out his morning letters, and began to read, pretending to take no more notice of the old man. He had decided that he wanted him to go away. But the old man did not move. He stood leaning on his stick and gazing at the hobbit without saying anything, till Bilbo got quite uncomfortable and even a little cross.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"Good morning!" he said at last. "We don't want any adventures here, thank you! You might try over The Hill or across The Water." By this he meant that the conversation was at an end.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"What a lot of things you do use Good morning for!" said Gandalf. "Now you mean that you want to get rid of me, and that it won't be good till I move off."<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"Not at all, not at all, my dear sir! Let me see, I don't think I know your name?"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"Yes, yes, my dear sir - and I do know your name, Mr. Bilbo Baggins. And you do know my name, though you don't remember that I belong to it. I am Gandalf, and Gandalf means me! To think that I should have lived to be good-morninged by Belladonna Took's son, as if I was selling buttons at the door!"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"Gandalf, Gandalf! Good gracious me! Not the wandering wizard that gave Old Took a pair of magic diamond studs that fastened themselves and never came undone till ordered? Not the fellow who used to tell such wonderful tales at parties, about dragons and goblins and giants and the rescue of princesses and the unexpected luck of widows' sons? Not the man that used to make such particularly excellent fireworks! I remember those! Old Took used to have them on Midsummer's Eve. Splendid! They used to go up like great lilies and snapdragons and laburnums of fire and hang in the twilight all evening!" You will notice already that Mr. Baggins was not quite so prosy as he liked to believe, also that he was very fond of flowers. "Dear me!" he went on. "Not the Gandalf who was responsible for so many quiet lads and lasses going off into the Blue for mad adventures? Anything from climbing trees to visiting elves-or sailing in ships, sailing to other shores! Bless me, life used to be quite inter- I mean, you used to upset things badly in these parts once upon a time. I beg your pardon, but I had no idea you were still in business."<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"Where else should I be?" said the wizard. "But I am pleased to find you remember something about me. You seem to remember my fireworks kindly, at any rate, and that is not without hope. For grandfather Took's sake, and for the sake of poor Belladonna, I will give you what you asked for. In fact, I will go so far as to send you on this adventure.”</p>

        <p><strong>The Hobbit</strong><br><em>by J. R. R. Tolkien</em><br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;By some curious chance one morning long ago in the quiet of the world, when there was less noise and more green, and the hobbits were still numerous and prosperous, and Bilbo Baggins was standing at his door after breakfast smoking an enormous long wooden pipe that reached nearly down to his woolly toes (neatly brushed) - Gandalf came by. Gandalf! If you had heard only a quarter of what I have heard about him, and I have only heard very little of all there is to hear, you would be prepared for any sort of remarkable tale.</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>&nbsp;All that the unsuspecting Bilbo saw that morning was an old man with a staff. He had a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, a silver scarf over which his long white beard hung down below his waist, and immense black boots.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"Good Morning!" said Bilbo, and he meant it. The sun was shining, and the grass was very green. But Gandalf looked at him from under long bushy eyebrows that stuck out further than the brim of his shady hat.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"What do you mean?" he said. "Do you wish me a good morning, or mean that it is a good morning whether I want it or not; or that you feel good this morning; or that it is a morning to be good on?"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"All of them at once," said Bilbo. "And a very fine morning for a pipe of tobacco out of doors, into the bargain. If you have a pipe about you, sit down and have a fill of mine! There's no hurry, we have all the day before us!" Then Bilbo sat down on a seat by his door, crossed his legs, and blew out a beautiful grey ring of smoke that sailed up into the air without breaking and floated away over The Hill.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"Very pretty!" said Gandalf. "But I have no time to blow smoke-rings this morning. I am looking for someone to share in an adventure and it's very difficult to find anyone."<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"I should think so-in these parts! We are plain quiet folk and have no use for adventures. Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner! I can't think what anybody sees in them," said our Mr. Baggins, and stuck one thumb behind his braces, and blew out another even bigger smoke ring. Then he took out his morning letters, and began to read, pretending to take no more notice of the old man. He had decided that he wanted him to go away. But the old man did not move. He stood leaning on his stick and gazing at the hobbit without saying anything, till Bilbo got quite uncomfortable and even a little cross.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"Good morning!" he said at last. "We don't want any adventures here, thank you! You might try over The Hill or across The Water." By this he meant that the conversation was at an end.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"What a lot of things you do use Good morning for!" said Gandalf. "Now you mean that you want to get rid of me, and that it won't be good till I move off."<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"Not at all, not at all, my dear sir! Let me see, I don't think I know your name?"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"Yes, yes, my dear sir - and I do know your name, Mr. Bilbo Baggins. And you do know my name, though you don't remember that I belong to it. I am Gandalf, and Gandalf means me! To think that I should have lived to be good-morninged by Belladonna Took's son, as if I was selling buttons at the door!"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"Gandalf, Gandalf! Good gracious me! Not the wandering wizard that gave Old Took a pair of magic diamond studs that fastened themselves and never came undone till ordered? Not the fellow who used to tell such wonderful tales at parties, about dragons and goblins and giants and the rescue of princesses and the unexpected luck of widows' sons? Not the man that used to make such particularly excellent fireworks! I remember those! Old Took used to have them on Midsummer's Eve. Splendid! They used to go up like great lilies and snapdragons and laburnums of fire and hang in the twilight all evening!" You will notice already that Mr. Baggins was not quite so prosy as he liked to believe, also that he was very fond of flowers. "Dear me!" he went on. "Not the Gandalf who was responsible for so many quiet lads and lasses going off into the Blue for mad adventures? Anything from climbing trees to visiting elves-or sailing in ships, sailing to other shores! Bless me, life used to be quite inter- I mean, you used to upset things badly in these parts once upon a time. I beg your pardon, but I had no idea you were still in business."<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"Where else should I be?" said the wizard. "But I am pleased to find you remember something about me. You seem to remember my fireworks kindly, at any rate, and that is not without hope. For grandfather Took's sake, and for the sake of poor Belladonna, I will give you what you asked for. In fact, I will go so far as to send you on this adventure.”</p>

        <p><strong>The Hobbit</strong><br><em>by J. R. R. Tolkien</em><br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;By some curious chance one morning long ago in the quiet of the world, when there was less noise and more green, and the hobbits were still numerous and prosperous, and Bilbo Baggins was standing at his door after breakfast smoking an enormous long wooden pipe that reached nearly down to his woolly toes (neatly brushed) - Gandalf came by. Gandalf! If you had heard only a quarter of what I have heard about him, and I have only heard very little of all there is to hear, you would be prepared for any sort of remarkable tale.</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>&nbsp;All that the unsuspecting Bilbo saw that morning was an old man with a staff. He had a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, a silver scarf over which his long white beard hung down below his waist, and immense black boots.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"Good Morning!" said Bilbo, and he meant it. The sun was shining, and the grass was very green. But Gandalf looked at him from under long bushy eyebrows that stuck out further than the brim of his shady hat.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"What do you mean?" he said. "Do you wish me a good morning, or mean that it is a good morning whether I want it or not; or that you feel good this morning; or that it is a morning to be good on?"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"All of them at once," said Bilbo. "And a very fine morning for a pipe of tobacco out of doors, into the bargain. If you have a pipe about you, sit down and have a fill of mine! There's no hurry, we have all the day before us!" Then Bilbo sat down on a seat by his door, crossed his legs, and blew out a beautiful grey ring of smoke that sailed up into the air without breaking and floated away over The Hill.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"Very pretty!" said Gandalf. "But I have no time to blow smoke-rings this morning. I am looking for someone to share in an adventure and it's very difficult to find anyone."<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"I should think so-in these parts! We are plain quiet folk and have no use for adventures. Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner! I can't think what anybody sees in them," said our Mr. Baggins, and stuck one thumb behind his braces, and blew out another even bigger smoke ring. Then he took out his morning letters, and began to read, pretending to take no more notice of the old man. He had decided that he wanted him to go away. But the old man did not move. He stood leaning on his stick and gazing at the hobbit without saying anything, till Bilbo got quite uncomfortable and even a little cross.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"Good morning!" he said at last. "We don't want any adventures here, thank you! You might try over The Hill or across The Water." By this he meant that the conversation was at an end.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"What a lot of things you do use Good morning for!" said Gandalf. "Now you mean that you want to get rid of me, and that it won't be good till I move off."<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"Not at all, not at all, my dear sir! Let me see, I don't think I know your name?"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"Yes, yes, my dear sir - and I do know your name, Mr. Bilbo Baggins. And you do know my name, though you don't remember that I belong to it. I am Gandalf, and Gandalf means me! To think that I should have lived to be good-morninged by Belladonna Took's son, as if I was selling buttons at the door!"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"Gandalf, Gandalf! Good gracious me! Not the wandering wizard that gave Old Took a pair of magic diamond studs that fastened themselves and never came undone till ordered? Not the fellow who used to tell such wonderful tales at parties, about dragons and goblins and giants and the rescue of princesses and the unexpected luck of widows' sons? Not the man that used to make such particularly excellent fireworks! I remember those! Old Took used to have them on Midsummer's Eve. Splendid! They used to go up like great lilies and snapdragons and laburnums of fire and hang in the twilight all evening!" You will notice already that Mr. Baggins was not quite so prosy as he liked to believe, also that he was very fond of flowers. "Dear me!" he went on. "Not the Gandalf who was responsible for so many quiet lads and lasses going off into the Blue for mad adventures? Anything from climbing trees to visiting elves-or sailing in ships, sailing to other shores! Bless me, life used to be quite inter- I mean, you used to upset things badly in these parts once upon a time. I beg your pardon, but I had no idea you were still in business."<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"Where else should I be?" said the wizard. "But I am pleased to find you remember something about me. You seem to remember my fireworks kindly, at any rate, and that is not without hope. For grandfather Took's sake, and for the sake of poor Belladonna, I will give you what you asked for. In fact, I will go so far as to send you on this adventure.”</p>

        <p><strong>The Hobbit</strong><br><em>by J. R. R. Tolkien</em><br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;By some curious chance one morning long ago in the quiet of the world, when there was less noise and more green, and the hobbits were still numerous and prosperous, and Bilbo Baggins was standing at his door after breakfast smoking an enormous long wooden pipe that reached nearly down to his woolly toes (neatly brushed) - Gandalf came by. Gandalf! If you had heard only a quarter of what I have heard about him, and I have only heard very little of all there is to hear, you would be prepared for any sort of remarkable tale.</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>&nbsp;All that the unsuspecting Bilbo saw that morning was an old man with a staff. He had a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, a silver scarf over which his long white beard hung down below his waist, and immense black boots.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"Good Morning!" said Bilbo, and he meant it. The sun was shining, and the grass was very green. But Gandalf looked at him from under long bushy eyebrows that stuck out further than the brim of his shady hat.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"What do you mean?" he said. "Do you wish me a good morning, or mean that it is a good morning whether I want it or not; or that you feel good this morning; or that it is a morning to be good on?"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"All of them at once," said Bilbo. "And a very fine morning for a pipe of tobacco out of doors, into the bargain. If you have a pipe about you, sit down and have a fill of mine! There's no hurry, we have all the day before us!" Then Bilbo sat down on a seat by his door, crossed his legs, and blew out a beautiful grey ring of smoke that sailed up into the air without breaking and floated away over The Hill.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"Very pretty!" said Gandalf. "But I have no time to blow smoke-rings this morning. I am looking for someone to share in an adventure and it's very difficult to find anyone."<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"I should think so-in these parts! We are plain quiet folk and have no use for adventures. Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner! I can't think what anybody sees in them," said our Mr. Baggins, and stuck one thumb behind his braces, and blew out another even bigger smoke ring. Then he took out his morning letters, and began to read, pretending to take no more notice of the old man. He had decided that he wanted him to go away. But the old man did not move. He stood leaning on his stick and gazing at the hobbit without saying anything, till Bilbo got quite uncomfortable and even a little cross.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"Good morning!" he said at last. "We don't want any adventures here, thank you! You might try over The Hill or across The Water." By this he meant that the conversation was at an end.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"What a lot of things you do use Good morning for!" said Gandalf. "Now you mean that you want to get rid of me, and that it won't be good till I move off."<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"Not at all, not at all, my dear sir! Let me see, I don't think I know your name?"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"Yes, yes, my dear sir - and I do know your name, Mr. Bilbo Baggins. And you do know my name, though you don't remember that I belong to it. I am Gandalf, and Gandalf means me! To think that I should have lived to be good-morninged by Belladonna Took's son, as if I was selling buttons at the door!"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"Gandalf, Gandalf! Good gracious me! Not the wandering wizard that gave Old Took a pair of magic diamond studs that fastened themselves and never came undone till ordered? Not the fellow who used to tell such wonderful tales at parties, about dragons and goblins and giants and the rescue of princesses and the unexpected luck of widows' sons? Not the man that used to make such particularly excellent fireworks! I remember those! Old Took used to have them on Midsummer's Eve. Splendid! They used to go up like great lilies and snapdragons and laburnums of fire and hang in the twilight all evening!" You will notice already that Mr. Baggins was not quite so prosy as he liked to believe, also that he was very fond of flowers. "Dear me!" he went on. "Not the Gandalf who was responsible for so many quiet lads and lasses going off into the Blue for mad adventures? Anything from climbing trees to visiting elves-or sailing in ships, sailing to other shores! Bless me, life used to be quite inter- I mean, you used to upset things badly in these parts once upon a time. I beg your pardon, but I had no idea you were still in business."<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"Where else should I be?" said the wizard. "But I am pleased to find you remember something about me. You seem to remember my fireworks kindly, at any rate, and that is not without hope. For grandfather Took's sake, and for the sake of poor Belladonna, I will give you what you asked for. In fact, I will go so far as to send you on this adventure.”</p>

Then he took out his morning letters, and began to read, pretending to take no more notice of the old man. He had decided that he wanted him to go away. But the old man did not move. He stood leaning on his stick and gazing at the hobbit without saying anything, till Bilbo got quite uncomfortable and even a little cross.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"Good morning!" he said at last. "We don't want any adventures here, thank you! You might try over The Hill or across The Water." By this he meant that the conversation was at an end.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"What a lot of things you do use Good morning for!" said Gandalf. "Now you mean that you want to get rid of me, and that it won't be good till I move off."<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"Not at all, not at all, my dear sir! Let me see, I don't think I know your name?"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"Yes, yes, my dear sir - and I do know your name, Mr. Bilbo Baggins. And you do know my name, though you don't remember that I belong to it. I am Gandalf, and Gandalf means me! To think that I should have lived to be good-morninged by Belladonna Took's son, as if I was selling buttons at the door!"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"Gandalf, Gandalf! Good gracious me! Not the wandering wizard that gave Old Took a pair of magic diamond studs that fastened themselves and never came undone till ordered? Not the fellow who used to tell such wonderful tales at parties, about dragons and goblins and giants and the rescue of princesses and the unexpected luck of widows' sons? Not the man that used to make such particularly excellent fireworks! I remember those! Old Took used to have them on Midsummer's Eve. Splendid! They used to go up like great lilies and snapdragons and laburnums of fire and hang in the twilight all evening!" You will notice already that Mr. Baggins was not quite so prosy as he liked to believe, also that he was very fond of flowers. "Dear me!" he went on. "Not the Gandalf who was responsible for so many quiet lads and lasses going off into the Blue for mad adventures? Anything from climbing trees to visiting elves-or sailing in ships, sailing to other shores! Bless me, life used to be quite inter- I mean, you used to upset things badly in these parts once upon a time. I beg your pardon, but I had no idea you were still in business."<br>
<br>
&nbsp;"Where else should I be?" said the wizard. "But I am pleased to find you remember something about me. You seem to remember my fireworks kindly, at any rate, and that is not without hope. For grandfather Took's sake, and for the sake of poor Belladonna, I will give you what you asked for. In fact, I will go so far as to send you on this adventure.”</p>

        <p><em>Read the poem below by Henry Kendall then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>Bell-Birds</strong><br><br><br>
By channels of coolness the echoes are calling,<br>
And down the dim gorges I hear the creek falling;<br>
It lives in the mountain, where moss and the sedges<br>
Touch with their beauty the banks and the ledges;<br>
Through brakes of the cedar and sycamore bowers<br>
Struggles the light that is love to the flowers.<br>
And, softer than slumber, and sweeter than singing,<br>
The notes of the bell-birds are running and ringing.<br>
<br>
<br>
The silver-voiced bell-birds, the darlings of day-time,<br>
They sing in September their songs of the May-time.<br>
When shadows wax strong and the thunder-bolts hurtle,<br>
They hide with their fear in the leaves of the myrtle;<br>
When rain and the sunbeams shine mingled together<br>
They start up like fairies that follow fair weather,<br>
And straightway the hues of their feathers unfolden<br>
Are the green and the purple, the blue and the golden.<br>
...<br>
<br>
Often I sit, looking back to a childhood<br>
Mixed with the sights and the sounds of the wildwood,<br>
Longing for power and the sweetness to fashion<br>
Lyrics with beats like the heart-beats of passion --<br>
Songs interwoven of lights and of laughters<br>
Borrowed from bell-birds in far forest rafters;<br>
So I might keep in the city and alleys<br>
The beauty and strength of the deep mountain valleys,<br>
Charming to slumber the pain of my losses<br>
With glimpses of creeks and a vision of mosses.<br>

        <p><em>Read the poem below by Henry Kendall then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>Bell-Birds</strong><br><br><br>
By channels of coolness the echoes are calling,<br>
And down the dim gorges I hear the creek falling;<br>
It lives in the mountain, where moss and the sedges<br>
Touch with their beauty the banks and the ledges;<br>
Through brakes of the cedar and sycamore bowers<br>
Struggles the light that is love to the flowers.<br>
And, softer than slumber, and sweeter than singing,<br>
The notes of the bell-birds are running and ringing.<br>
<br>
<br>
The silver-voiced bell-birds, the darlings of day-time,<br>
They sing in September their songs of the May-time.<br>
When shadows wax strong and the thunder-bolts hurtle,<br>
They hide with their fear in the leaves of the myrtle;<br>
When rain and the sunbeams shine mingled together<br>
They start up like fairies that follow fair weather,<br>
And straightway the hues of their feathers unfolden<br>
Are the green and the purple, the blue and the golden.<br>
...<br>
<br>
Often I sit, looking back to a childhood<br>
Mixed with the sights and the sounds of the wildwood,<br>
Longing for power and the sweetness to fashion<br>
Lyrics with beats like the heart-beats of passion --<br>
Songs interwoven of lights and of laughters<br>
Borrowed from bell-birds in far forest rafters;<br>
So I might keep in the city and alleys<br>
The beauty and strength of the deep mountain valleys,<br>
Charming to slumber the pain of my losses<br>
With glimpses of creeks and a vision of mosses.<br>

        <p><em>Read the poem below by Henry Kendall then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>Bell-Birds</strong><br><br><br>
By channels of coolness the echoes are calling,<br>
And down the dim gorges I hear the creek falling;<br>
It lives in the mountain, where moss and the sedges<br>
Touch with their beauty the banks and the ledges;<br>
Through brakes of the cedar and sycamore bowers<br>
Struggles the light that is love to the flowers.<br>
And, softer than slumber, and sweeter than singing,<br>
The notes of the bell-birds are running and ringing.<br>
<br>
<br>
The silver-voiced bell-birds, the darlings of day-time,<br>
They sing in September their songs of the May-time.<br>
When shadows wax strong and the thunder-bolts hurtle,<br>
They hide with their fear in the leaves of the myrtle;<br>
When rain and the sunbeams shine mingled together<br>
They start up like fairies that follow fair weather,<br>
And straightway the hues of their feathers unfolden<br>
Are the green and the purple, the blue and the golden.<br>
...<br>
<br>
Often I sit, looking back to a childhood<br>
Mixed with the sights and the sounds of the wildwood,<br>
Longing for power and the sweetness to fashion<br>
Lyrics with beats like the heart-beats of passion --<br>
Songs interwoven of lights and of laughters<br>
Borrowed from bell-birds in far forest rafters;<br>
So I might keep in the city and alleys<br>
The beauty and strength of the deep mountain valleys,<br>
Charming to slumber the pain of my losses<br>
With glimpses of creeks and a vision of mosses.<br>

<strong>Marie Curie</strong><br>
<br>
On April 20, 1902, Marie and Pierre Curie successfully isolated radioactive radium salts from the mineral pitchblende in their laboratory in Paris. In 1898, the Curies had discovered the existence of the elements, radium and polonium in their research of pitchblende. One year after isolating radium, they would share the 1903 Nobel Prize in physics with French scientist, A. Henri Becquerel for their ground-breaking investigations of radioactivity. <strong>15 ..........</strong> Both were for her ground-breaking work in radioactivity.<br>
<br>
Curie was born Maria Sklodowska in Warsaw, Poland, to school-teacher parents of modest means who encouraged their children’s educational aspirations. <strong>16 ..........</strong> She agreed to fund Bronya’s medical degree in France by working as a governess. Bronya later helped Marie move to Paris and enrol at the prestigious Sorbonne, where she studied<br>
chemistry, maths and physics. Curie met her future husband, Pierre, while doing postgraduate research at the lab he supervised. The pair immediately bonded over their mutual interest in magnetism and fondness for cycling. A year later they were married in Sceaux, France. They used the money they had received as a wedding present to purchase bicycles for the many long rides they took together.<br>
<br>
<strong>17 .......... </strong>As a result, she began studying uranium rays; Pierre soon joined her in her research. Two years later, the Curies discovered polonium—named after Marie’s homeland—and radium. In 1903, they shared the Nobel Prize in physics with Becquerel for their ground-breaking work on radioactivity.<br>
<br>
After Pierre’s tragic death in a 1906 accident, Marie was appointed to his seat at the Sorbonne, becoming the university’s first female professor. Just three years earlier, she had been the first woman in France to earn a doctorate. Today, France’s leading scientific and medical complex bears the name of both Curies. <strong>18 ..........</strong> In 1911, she received the prestigious award again — in chemistry this time — for her isolation of radium and other accomplishments.<br>
<br>
During World War I, Curie used her radiography expertise to set up dozens of mobile and permanent X-ray stations, which helped doctors diagnose and treat battlefield injuries. They became known as “petites Curies” for their famous creator. <strong>19 ..........</strong> The effects of doing this were poorly understood at the time. By the 1920s, she had developed muscle aches, anaemia, cataracts and a host of other symptoms. She died on July 4, 1934, of leukemia caused by exposure to radiation.<br>
<br>
Curie’s daughter, Irène followed in her mother’s footsteps, earning a doctorate in physics and conducting important research on synthesised radioactive elements. In 1935, she and&nbsp;her husband, Frédéric Joliot, shared the Noble Prize in chemistry for their discovery of artificial radioactivity. In 1995, the remains of Curie and her husband were enshrined in Paris’ Pantheon. <strong>20 ..........</strong> She became the second woman to receive this honour and the first to earn it through her own achievements. Among her writing, Curie left behind this thought: "Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less."</p>

<strong>Marie Curie</strong><br>
<br>
On April 20, 1902, Marie and Pierre Curie successfully isolated radioactive radium salts from the mineral pitchblende in their laboratory in Paris. In 1898, the Curies had discovered the existence of the elements, radium and polonium in their research of pitchblende. One year after isolating radium, they would share the 1903 Nobel Prize in physics with French scientist, A. Henri Becquerel for their ground-breaking investigations of radioactivity. <strong>15 ..........</strong> Both were for her ground-breaking work in radioactivity.<br>
<br>
Curie was born Maria Sklodowska in Warsaw, Poland, to school-teacher parents of modest means who encouraged their children’s educational aspirations. <strong>16 ..........</strong> She agreed to fund Bronya’s medical degree in France by working as a governess. Bronya later helped Marie move to Paris and enrol at the prestigious Sorbonne, where she studied<br>
chemistry, maths and physics. Curie met her future husband, Pierre, while doing postgraduate research at the lab he supervised. The pair immediately bonded over their mutual interest in magnetism and fondness for cycling. A year later they were married in Sceaux, France. They used the money they had received as a wedding present to purchase bicycles for the many long rides they took together.<br>
<br>
<strong>17 .......... </strong>As a result, she began studying uranium rays; Pierre soon joined her in her research. Two years later, the Curies discovered polonium—named after Marie’s homeland—and radium. In 1903, they shared the Nobel Prize in physics with Becquerel for their ground-breaking work on radioactivity.<br>
<br>
After Pierre’s tragic death in a 1906 accident, Marie was appointed to his seat at the Sorbonne, becoming the university’s first female professor. Just three years earlier, she had been the first woman in France to earn a doctorate. Today, France’s leading scientific and medical complex bears the name of both Curies. <strong>18 ..........</strong> In 1911, she received the prestigious award again — in chemistry this time — for her isolation of radium and other accomplishments.<br>
<br>
During World War I, Curie used her radiography expertise to set up dozens of mobile and permanent X-ray stations, which helped doctors diagnose and treat battlefield injuries. They became known as “petites Curies” for their famous creator. <strong>19 ..........</strong> The effects of doing this were poorly understood at the time. By the 1920s, she had developed muscle aches, anaemia, cataracts and a host of other symptoms. She died on July 4, 1934, of leukemia caused by exposure to radiation.<br>
<br>
Curie’s daughter, Irène followed in her mother’s footsteps, earning a doctorate in physics and conducting important research on synthesised radioactive elements. In 1935, she and&nbsp;her husband, Frédéric Joliot, shared the Noble Prize in chemistry for their discovery of artificial radioactivity. In 1995, the remains of Curie and her husband were enshrined in Paris’ Pantheon. <strong>20 ..........</strong> She became the second woman to receive this honour and the first to earn it through her own achievements. Among her writing, Curie left behind this thought: "Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less."</p>

<strong>Marie Curie</strong><br>
<br>
On April 20, 1902, Marie and Pierre Curie successfully isolated radioactive radium salts from the mineral pitchblende in their laboratory in Paris. In 1898, the Curies had discovered the existence of the elements, radium and polonium in their research of pitchblende. One year after isolating radium, they would share the 1903 Nobel Prize in physics with French scientist, A. Henri Becquerel for their ground-breaking investigations of radioactivity. <strong>15 ..........</strong> Both were for her ground-breaking work in radioactivity.<br>
<br>
Curie was born Maria Sklodowska in Warsaw, Poland, to school-teacher parents of modest means who encouraged their children’s educational aspirations. <strong>16 ..........</strong> She agreed to fund Bronya’s medical degree in France by working as a governess. Bronya later helped Marie move to Paris and enrol at the prestigious Sorbonne, where she studied<br>
chemistry, maths and physics. Curie met her future husband, Pierre, while doing postgraduate research at the lab he supervised. The pair immediately bonded over their mutual interest in magnetism and fondness for cycling. A year later they were married in Sceaux, France. They used the money they had received as a wedding present to purchase bicycles for the many long rides they took together.<br>
<br>
<strong>17 .......... </strong>As a result, she began studying uranium rays; Pierre soon joined her in her research. Two years later, the Curies discovered polonium—named after Marie’s homeland—and radium. In 1903, they shared the Nobel Prize in physics with Becquerel for their ground-breaking work on radioactivity.<br>
<br>
After Pierre’s tragic death in a 1906 accident, Marie was appointed to his seat at the Sorbonne, becoming the university’s first female professor. Just three years earlier, she had been the first woman in France to earn a doctorate. Today, France’s leading scientific and medical complex bears the name of both Curies. <strong>18 ..........</strong> In 1911, she received the prestigious award again — in chemistry this time — for her isolation of radium and other accomplishments.<br>
<br>
During World War I, Curie used her radiography expertise to set up dozens of mobile and permanent X-ray stations, which helped doctors diagnose and treat battlefield injuries. They became known as “petites Curies” for their famous creator. <strong>19 ..........</strong> The effects of doing this were poorly understood at the time. By the 1920s, she had developed muscle aches, anaemia, cataracts and a host of other symptoms. She died on July 4, 1934, of leukemia caused by exposure to radiation.<br>
<br>
Curie’s daughter, Irène followed in her mother’s footsteps, earning a doctorate in physics and conducting important research on synthesised radioactive elements. In 1935, she and&nbsp;her husband, Frédéric Joliot, shared the Noble Prize in chemistry for their discovery of artificial radioactivity. In 1995, the remains of Curie and her husband were enshrined in Paris’ Pantheon. <strong>20 ..........</strong> She became the second woman to receive this honour and the first to earn it through her own achievements. Among her writing, Curie left behind this thought: "Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less."</p>

<strong>Marie Curie</strong><br>
<br>
On April 20, 1902, Marie and Pierre Curie successfully isolated radioactive radium salts from the mineral pitchblende in their laboratory in Paris. In 1898, the Curies had discovered the existence of the elements, radium and polonium in their research of pitchblende. One year after isolating radium, they would share the 1903 Nobel Prize in physics with French scientist, A. Henri Becquerel for their ground-breaking investigations of radioactivity. <strong>15 ..........</strong> Both were for her ground-breaking work in radioactivity.<br>
<br>
Curie was born Maria Sklodowska in Warsaw, Poland, to school-teacher parents of modest means who encouraged their children’s educational aspirations. <strong>16 ..........</strong> She agreed to fund Bronya’s medical degree in France by working as a governess. Bronya later helped Marie move to Paris and enrol at the prestigious Sorbonne, where she studied<br>
chemistry, maths and physics. Curie met her future husband, Pierre, while doing postgraduate research at the lab he supervised. The pair immediately bonded over their mutual interest in magnetism and fondness for cycling. A year later they were married in Sceaux, France. They used the money they had received as a wedding present to purchase bicycles for the many long rides they took together.<br>
<br>
<strong>17 .......... </strong>As a result, she began studying uranium rays; Pierre soon joined her in her research. Two years later, the Curies discovered polonium—named after Marie’s homeland—and radium. In 1903, they shared the Nobel Prize in physics with Becquerel for their ground-breaking work on radioactivity.<br>
<br>
After Pierre’s tragic death in a 1906 accident, Marie was appointed to his seat at the Sorbonne, becoming the university’s first female professor. Just three years earlier, she had been the first woman in France to earn a doctorate. Today, France’s leading scientific and medical complex bears the name of both Curies. <strong>18 ..........</strong> In 1911, she received the prestigious award again — in chemistry this time — for her isolation of radium and other accomplishments.<br>
<br>
During World War I, Curie used her radiography expertise to set up dozens of mobile and permanent X-ray stations, which helped doctors diagnose and treat battlefield injuries. They became known as “petites Curies” for their famous creator. <strong>19 ..........</strong> The effects of doing this were poorly understood at the time. By the 1920s, she had developed muscle aches, anaemia, cataracts and a host of other symptoms. She died on July 4, 1934, of leukemia caused by exposure to radiation.<br>
<br>
Curie’s daughter, Irène followed in her mother’s footsteps, earning a doctorate in physics and conducting important research on synthesised radioactive elements. In 1935, she and&nbsp;her husband, Frédéric Joliot, shared the Noble Prize in chemistry for their discovery of artificial radioactivity. In 1995, the remains of Curie and her husband were enshrined in Paris’ Pantheon. <strong>20 ..........</strong> She became the second woman to receive this honour and the first to earn it through her own achievements. Among her writing, Curie left behind this thought: "Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less."</p>

        <p><em>Read the four extracts below on the theme of volcanoes.</em><br><br>
For questions <strong>21 – 30</strong>, choose the option (<strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, <strong>C</strong> or <strong>D</strong>) which you think best answers the question.<br>
<br>
<strong>Extract A</strong><br>
So how do volcanoes erupt? Deep within the Earth it is so hot that some rocks slowly melt and become a thick flowing substance called magma. Since it is lighter than the solid rock around it, magma rises and collects in magma chambers. Eventually, some of the magma pushes through vents and fissures to the Earth's surface. Magma that has erupted is called lava.<br>
<br>
Some volcanic eruptions are explosive and others are not. If magma is thin and runny, gases can escape easily from it. When this type of magma erupts, it flows out of the volcano. A good example is the eruptions at Hawaii’s volcanoes. Lava flows rarely kill people because they move slowly enough for people to get out of their way. If magma is thick and sticky, gases cannot escape easily. Pressure builds up until the gases escape violently and explode. A good example is the eruption of Washington’s Mount St. Helens. In this type of eruption, the magma blasts into the air and breaks apart into pieces called tephra. Tephra can range in size from tiny particles of ash to house-size boulders.<br>
<br>
Explosive volcanic eruptions can be dangerous and deadly. They can blast out clouds of hot tephra from the side or top of a volcano. These fiery clouds race down mountainsides destroying almost everything in their path. Ash erupted into the sky falls back to Earth like powdery snow. If thick enough, blankets of ash can suffocate plants, animals, and humans. When hot volcanic materials mix with water from streams or melted snow and ice, mudflows form. Mudflows have buried entire communities located near erupting volcanoes.<br>
<br>
<strong>Extract B</strong><br>
The ancient cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum thrived near the base of Mount Vesuvius at the Bay of Naples in the modern-day Italy. In the time of the early Roman Empire, 20,000 people lived in Pompeii, including merchants, manufacturers, and farmers who exploited the rich soil of the region with numerous vineyards and orchards. None suspected that the black fertile earth was the legacy of earlier eruptions of Mount Vesuvius.<br>
<br>
On August 24, 79 AD, after centuries of dormancy, Mount Vesuvius erupted in southern Italy, devastating the prosperous Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum and killing thousands. The cities, buried under a thick layer of volcanic material and mud, were never rebuilt and largely forgotten in the course of history.

Today, Mount Vesuvius is the only active volcano on the European mainland. Its last eruption was in 1944 and its last major eruption in 1631. Another eruption is expected in the near future, which could be devastating for 700,000 people who live in “death zones” around Vesuvius.<br>

Diamonds are brought to the surface from the Earth’s mantle in a rare type of volcanic magma called kimberlite and erupted at a rare type of volcanic vent called a diatreme or pipe. Kimberlite is a gas-rich igneous rock that contains diamonds and other upper mantle minerals. The source depth for kimberlite magmas is estimated at 200 km, more than twice as deep as the source region for most magmas. At a depth of 200 km the pressure is 60,000 times greater than the surface and the temperature is about 1500 C. Kimberlite magmas are rich in carbon dioxide and water which brings the magma quickly and violently to the surface. Kimberlite was named for the rock associated with diamonds in Kimberley, South Africa. Kimberlite magmas form "pipes" as they erupt. A tuff cone is at the surface and formed by base-surge deposits. In the subsurface, a funnel-shaped body narrows to a depth of hundreds of meters. The pipe (also called a diatreme) is filled with kimberlite, with or without diamonds (only 1 in 5 of the pipes at Kimberley contain diamonds).<br>

On Aug. 27, 1883, just after 10 a.m., the eruption of the Krakatoa volcano in Indonesia made the loudest sound known to history — a terrifying roar that sent sound waves around the world four times and could be heard 3,000 miles away on the island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean. That, for purpose of comparison, is the same as Californians hearing a noise made in New York. In Rodrigues, as in other distant places, the noise was taken to be cannon fire. In western Australia, 2,000 miles distant, people thought war had erupted. In Batavia (now Jakarta), a gas works barometer spiked to an equivalent of 172 decibels, meaning the sound, even 100 miles from its origin, was still many times louder than a jet engine. The devastation from the explosion — which packed power equivalent to 10,000 Hiroshima-sized atomic bombs — made the Krakatoa eruption one of history’s deadliest natural disasters. More than 36,400 people died, from lava flows that raced at 60 miles per hour and tsunamis that reached a height of 120 feet and wiped out some 165 coastal villages. Little was left of the Krakatoa Island in the wake of the explosion. In 1927, a volcanic island known as Anak Krakatoa (child of Krakatoa) emerged from the caldera left behind by the big blast.</p>

<br>
<strong>Extract A</strong><br>
So how do volcanoes erupt? Deep within the Earth it is so hot that some rocks slowly melt and become a thick flowing substance called magma. Since it is lighter than the solid rock around it, magma rises and collects in magma chambers. Eventually, some of the magma pushes through vents and fissures to the Earth's surface. Magma that has erupted is called lava.<br>
<br>
Some volcanic eruptions are explosive and others are not. If magma is thin and runny, gases can escape easily from it. When this type of magma erupts, it flows out of the volcano. A good example is the eruptions at Hawaii’s volcanoes. Lava flows rarely kill people because they move slowly enough for people to get out of their way. If magma is thick and sticky, gases cannot escape easily. Pressure builds up until the gases escape violently and explode. A good example is the eruption of Washington’s Mount St. Helens. In this type of eruption, the magma blasts into the air and breaks apart into pieces called tephra. Tephra can range in size from tiny particles of ash to house-size boulders.<br>
<br>
Explosive volcanic eruptions can be dangerous and deadly. They can blast out clouds of hot tephra from the side or top of a volcano. These fiery clouds race down mountainsides destroying almost everything in their path. Ash erupted into the sky falls back to Earth like powdery snow. If thick enough, blankets of ash can suffocate plants, animals, and humans. When hot volcanic materials mix with water from streams or melted snow and ice, mudflows form. Mudflows have buried entire communities located near erupting volcanoes.<br>

<strong>Extract B</strong><br>
The ancient cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum thrived near the base of Mount Vesuvius at the Bay of Naples in the modern-day Italy. In the time of the early Roman Empire, 20,000 people lived in Pompeii, including merchants, manufacturers, and farmers who exploited the rich soil of the region with numerous vineyards and orchards. None suspected that the black fertile earth was the legacy of earlier eruptions of Mount Vesuvius.<br>
<br>
On August 24, 79 AD, after centuries of dormancy, Mount Vesuvius erupted in southern Italy, devastating the prosperous Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum and killing thousands. The cities, buried under a thick layer of volcanic material and mud, were never rebuilt and largely forgotten in the course of history. In the 18th century, Pompeii and Herculaneum were rediscovered and excavated, providing an archaeological record of everyday life in ancient civilisation, startlingly preserved in sudden death.<br>

Kimberlite was named for the rock associated with diamonds in Kimberley, South Africa. Kimberlite magmas form "pipes" as they erupt. A tuff cone is at the surface and formed by base-surge deposits. In the subsurface, a funnel-shaped body narrows to a depth of hundreds of meters. The pipe (also called a diatreme) is filled with kimberlite, with or without diamonds (only 1 in 5 of the pipes at Kimberley contain diamonds).<br>

On Aug. 27, 1883, just after 10 a.m., the eruption of the Krakatoa volcano in Indonesia made the loudest sound known to history — a terrifying roar that sent sound waves around the world four times and could be heard 3,000 miles away on the island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean. That, for purpose of comparison, is the same as Californians hearing a noise made in New York. In Rodrigues, as in other distant places, the noise was taken to be cannon fire. In western Australia, 2,000 miles distant, people thought war had erupted. In Batavia (now Jakarta), a gas works barometer spiked to an equivalent of 172 decibels, meaning the sound, even 100 miles from its origin, was still many times louder than a jet engine. The devastation from the explosion — which packed power equivalent to 10,000 Hiroshima-sized atomic bombs — made the Krakatoa eruption one of history’s deadliest natural disasters. More than 36,400 people died, from lava flows that raced at 60 miles per hour and tsunamis that reached a height of 120 feet and wiped out some 165 coastal villages. Little was left of the Krakatoa Island in the wake of the explosion. In 1927, a volcanic island known as Anak Krakatoa (child of Krakatoa) emerged from the caldera left behind by the big blast.</p>

For questions <strong>21 – 30</strong>, choose the option (<strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, <strong>C</strong> or <strong>D</strong>) which you think best answers the question.<br>
<br>
<strong>Extract A</strong><br>
So how do volcanoes erupt? Deep within the Earth it is so hot that some rocks slowly melt and become a thick flowing substance called magma. Since it is lighter than the solid rock around it, magma rises and collects in magma chambers. Eventually, some of the magma pushes through vents and fissures to the Earth's surface. Magma that has erupted is called lava.<br>
<br>
Some volcanic eruptions are explosive and others are not. If magma is thin and runny, gases can escape easily from it. When this type of magma erupts, it flows out of the volcano. A good example is the eruptions at Hawaii’s volcanoes. Lava flows rarely kill people because they move slowly enough for people to get out of their way. If magma is thick and sticky, gases cannot escape easily. Pressure builds up until the gases escape violently and explode. A good example is the eruption of Washington’s Mount St. Helens. In this type of eruption, the magma blasts into the air and breaks apart into pieces called tephra. Tephra can range in size from tiny particles of ash to house-size boulders.<br>
<br>
Explosive volcanic eruptions can be dangerous and deadly. They can blast out clouds of hot tephra from the side or top of a volcano. These fiery clouds race down mountainsides destroying almost everything in their path. Ash erupted into the sky falls back to Earth like powdery snow. If thick enough, blankets of ash can suffocate plants, animals, and humans. When hot volcanic materials mix with water from streams or melted snow and ice, mudflows form. Mudflows have buried entire communities located near erupting volcanoes.<br>
<br>
<strong>Extract B</strong><br>
The ancient cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum thrived near the base of Mount Vesuvius at the Bay of Naples in the modern-day Italy. In the time of the early Roman Empire, 20,000 people lived in Pompeii, including merchants, manufacturers, and farmers who exploited the rich soil of the region with numerous vineyards and orchards. None suspected that the black fertile earth was the legacy of earlier eruptions of Mount Vesuvius.<br>
<br>
On August 24, 79 AD, after centuries of dormancy, Mount Vesuvius erupted in southern Italy, devastating the prosperous Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum and killing thousands. The cities, buried under a thick layer of volcanic material and mud, were never rebuilt and largely forgotten in the course of history. In the 18th century, Pompeii and Herculaneum were rediscovered and excavated, providing an archaeological record of everyday life in ancient civilisation, startlingly preserved in sudden death.<br>
<br>
Today, Mount Vesuvius is the only active volcano on the European mainland. Its last eruption was in 1944 and its last major eruption in 1631. Another eruption is expected in the near future, which could be devastating for 700,000 people who live in “death zones” around Vesuvius.<br>
<br>
<strong>Extract C</strong><br>
Diamonds are brought to the surface from the Earth’s mantle in a rare type of volcanic magma called kimberlite and erupted at a rare type of volcanic vent called a diatreme or pipe. Kimberlite is a gas-rich igneous rock that contains diamonds and other upper mantle minerals. The source depth for kimberlite magmas is estimated at 200 km, more than twice as deep as the source region for most magmas. At a depth of 200 km the pressure is 60,000 times greater than the surface and the temperature is about 1500 C. Kimberlite magmas are rich in carbon dioxide and water which brings the magma quickly and violently to the surface. Kimberlite was named for the rock associated with diamonds in Kimberley, South Africa. Kimberlite magmas form "pipes" as they erupt. A tuff cone is at the surface and formed by base-surge deposits.
