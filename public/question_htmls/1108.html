            <p>The HMS Birkenhead, also referred to as HM Troopship Birkenhead or Steam Frigate Birkenhead, was one of the first iron-hulled ships built for the Royal Navy. She was designed as a steam frigate, but was converted to a troopship before being commissioned. She was ship-wrecked on 26 February 1852, while transporting troops to Algoa Bay at Danger Point near Gansbaai, 87 miles (140 kilometres) from Cape Town in the Cape Colony. There were not enough serviceable lifeboats for all the passengers, and the soldiers famously stood firm on board, thereby allowing&nbsp;the women and children to board the boats safely and escape the sinking. Only 193 of the estimated 643 people on board survived, and the soldiers’ chivalry gave rise to the unofficial “women and children first” protocol when abandoning ship, while the “Birkenhead drill” of Rudyard Kipling’s poem came to describe courage in face of hopeless circumstances.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Deep in the bottom of the sea, some 3,800 metres below the surface of the freezing Atlantic Ocean, lies the wreckage of a ship: the unmistakable carcass of the Titanic, once man’s grandest mechanical achievement, now stripped of its former glory, after it sank in 1912. According to the famous movie, almost one long century later, intrigued by Titanic’s hidden riches, the modern treasure hunter, Brock Lovett, and his well-equipped technical crew, find themselves in the middle of the ocean, digging for answers for the past three years; nevertheless, without any success. But, when centenarian Rose Calvert, one of the few survivors of the Titanic, learns about this ambitious crusade, she decides to unfold her incredible and utterly tragic story; one that intertwines the extraordinary journey of the exquisite, deep-blue Heart-of-the-Ocean diamond of King Louis XVI, with the unlikely romance of Rose and the young bohemian vagabond, Jack Dawson. Now, an emotional trip down memory lane awaits. Can the mistakes of the past teach a lesson in humility to paupers and royalty alike?</p>

            <p>The Queen Anne’s Revenge has to be the world’s most famous pirate ship. In 1717, the pirate, Blackbeard captured La Concorde, a French slaving vessel. He realised that it would make a perfect pirate ship. It was large yet fast and big enough to mount 40 cannons on board. He renamed it Queen Anne’s Revenge: the name referred to Anne, Queen of England and Scotland. Many pirates favoured the return of the throne of Great Britain from the House of Hanover to the House of Stuart. It had changed hands after Anne’s death. Blackbeard preferred to intimidate his victims into surrendering, as fights were costly. For several months in 1717-18, Blackbeard used the Queen Anne’s Revenge to effectively terrorize shipping in the Atlantic. Between the massive frigate and his own fearsome appearance and reputation, Blackbeard’s victims rarely put up a fight and handed over their cargoes peacefully. He plundered the shipping lanes at will. He was even able to blockade the port of Charleston for a week in April of 1718, looting several ships. In June of 1718, the Queen Anne’s Revenge hit a sandbar off of North Carolina and had to be abandoned. Blackbeard took the opportunity to make off with all of the loot and a select few of his favorite pirates, leaving the others to fend for themselves. Blackbeard went legit (sort of) for a little while, but within a few months, Blackbeard returned to piracy and in November, 1718, he was killed by pirate hunters in a pitched battle off of North Carolina. In 1996, a shipwreck believed to be that of the Queen Anne’s Revenge was discovered off North Carolina. For 15 years it was excavated and studied, and in 2011 it was confirmed to be Blackbeard’s ship. The shipwreck has yielded many interesting artifacts, including weapons, cannons, medical gear and a massive anchor.</p>

            <p>Appearing in Richard Wagner’s opera as a man searching for love, as a ship manned by octopusfaced Davy Jones in Pirates of the Caribbean, and even as a green spirit in the animation SpongeBob SquarePants, the Flying Dutchman is a popular maritime legend. Known for its terrible storms and treacherous outcrops of rock, The Cape of Good Hope in South Africa (around Cape Town) once had a far darker name: The Cape of Storms. It is from here that the legend of the Flying Dutchman set sail. The story behind of the Flying Dutchman begins in 1641 with a sea captain, Hendrik van der Decken and his crew who were returning to Holland from the Far East when they, like all trade ships, had to risk the dangerous passage around The Cape of Good Hope. Legend has it that, as van der Decken and his crew attempted to round the Cape, a storm began. The crew begged their captain not to sail into the storm, but he was determined to face the chaotic waters and screaming winds. Van der Decken vowed that he would sail around the Cape, even if it took him ‘until Doomsday’ to accomplish it. Some say that, at one point, an angel appeared to van der Decken, and the Dutch trader shot at his otherworldly visitor. With that, the ship’s fate was sealed. The Flying Dutchman is said to appear as a ghostly, glowing ship. It will materialise suddenly and then, just as suddenly, vanish. Some claim the ship, doomed to sail the seas forever, will attempt to make contact with other travellers, and that seeing the Flying Dutchman is a sign of horrible misfortune to come. Whether maritime superstition or true event, the Flying Dutchman continues to haunt the Cape and stories of the sea. Standing on the beach on South Africa’s southern coast, looking out into the swirling clouds and crashing waves, you may just catch a glimpse of a strange-looking ship desperate to get home.</p>

            <p>The HMS Birkenhead, also referred to as HM Troopship Birkenhead or Steam Frigate Birkenhead, was one of the first iron-hulled ships built for the Royal Navy. She was designed as a steam frigate, but was converted to a troopship before being commissioned. She was ship-wrecked on 26 February 1852, while transporting troops to Algoa Bay at Danger Point near Gansbaai, 87 miles (140 kilometres) from Cape Town in the Cape Colony. There were not enough serviceable lifeboats for all the passengers, and the soldiers famously stood firm on board, thereby allowing&nbsp;the women and children to board the boats safely and escape the sinking. Only 193 of the estimated 643 people on board survived, and the soldiers’ chivalry gave rise to the unofficial “women and children first” protocol when abandoning ship, while the “Birkenhead drill” of Rudyard Kipling’s poem came to describe courage in face of hopeless circumstances.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Deep in the bottom of the sea, some 3,800 metres below the surface of the freezing Atlantic Ocean, lies the wreckage of a ship: the unmistakable carcass of the Titanic, once man’s grandest mechanical achievement, now stripped of its former glory, after it sank in 1912. According to the famous movie, almost one long century later, intrigued by Titanic’s hidden riches, the modern treasure hunter, Brock Lovett, and his well-equipped technical crew, find themselves in the middle of the ocean, digging for answers for the past three years; nevertheless, without any success. But, when centenarian Rose Calvert, one of the few survivors of the Titanic, learns about this ambitious crusade, she decides to unfold her incredible and utterly tragic story; one that intertwines the extraordinary journey of the exquisite, deep-blue Heart-of-the-Ocean diamond of King Louis XVI, with the unlikely romance of Rose and the young bohemian vagabond, Jack Dawson. Now, an emotional trip down memory lane awaits. Can the mistakes of the past teach a lesson in humility to paupers and royalty alike?</p>

            <p>The Queen Anne’s Revenge has to be the world’s most famous pirate ship. In 1717, the pirate, Blackbeard captured La Concorde, a French slaving vessel. He realised that it would make a perfect pirate ship. It was large yet fast and big enough to mount 40 cannons on board. He renamed it Queen Anne’s Revenge: the name referred to Anne, Queen of England and Scotland. Many pirates favoured the return of the throne of Great Britain from the House of Hanover to the House of Stuart. It had changed hands after Anne’s death. Blackbeard preferred to intimidate his victims into surrendering, as fights were costly. For several months in 1717-18, Blackbeard used the Queen Anne’s Revenge to effectively terrorize shipping in the Atlantic. Between the massive frigate and his own fearsome appearance and reputation, Blackbeard’s victims rarely put up a fight and handed over their cargoes peacefully. He plundered the shipping lanes at will. He was even able to blockade the port of Charleston for a week in April of 1718, looting several ships. In June of 1718, the Queen Anne’s Revenge hit a sandbar off of North Carolina and had to be abandoned. Blackbeard took the opportunity to make off with all of the loot and a select few of his favorite pirates, leaving the others to fend for themselves. Blackbeard went legit (sort of) for a little while, but within a few months, Blackbeard returned to piracy and in November, 1718, he was killed by pirate hunters in a pitched battle off of North Carolina. In 1996, a shipwreck believed to be that of the Queen Anne’s Revenge was discovered off North Carolina. For 15 years it was excavated and studied, and in 2011 it was confirmed to be Blackbeard’s ship. The shipwreck has yielded many interesting artifacts, including weapons, cannons, medical gear and a massive anchor.</p>

            <p>Appearing in Richard Wagner’s opera as a man searching for love, as a ship manned by octopusfaced Davy Jones in Pirates of the Caribbean, and even as a green spirit in the animation SpongeBob SquarePants, the Flying Dutchman is a popular maritime legend. Known for its terrible storms and treacherous outcrops of rock, The Cape of Good Hope in South Africa (around Cape Town) once had a far darker name: The Cape of Storms. It is from here that the legend of the Flying Dutchman set sail. The story behind of the Flying Dutchman begins in 1641 with a sea captain, Hendrik van der Decken and his crew who were returning to Holland from the Far East when they, like all trade ships, had to risk the dangerous passage around The Cape of Good Hope. Legend has it that, as van der Decken and his crew attempted to round the Cape, a storm began. The crew begged their captain not to sail into the storm, but he was determined to face the chaotic waters and screaming winds. Van der Decken vowed that he would sail around the Cape, even if it took him ‘until Doomsday’ to accomplish it. Some say that, at one point, an angel appeared to van der Decken, and the Dutch trader shot at his otherworldly visitor. With that, the ship’s fate was sealed. The Flying Dutchman is said to appear as a ghostly, glowing ship. It will materialise suddenly and then, just as suddenly, vanish. Some claim the ship, doomed to sail the seas forever, will attempt to make contact with other travellers, and that seeing the Flying Dutchman is a sign of horrible misfortune to come. Whether maritime superstition or true event, the Flying Dutchman continues to haunt the Cape and stories of the sea. Standing on the beach on South Africa’s southern coast, looking out into the swirling clouds and crashing waves, you may just catch a glimpse of a strange-looking ship desperate to get home.</p>

            <p>The HMS Birkenhead, also referred to as HM Troopship Birkenhead or Steam Frigate Birkenhead, was one of the first iron-hulled ships built for the Royal Navy. She was designed as a steam frigate, but was converted to a troopship before being commissioned. She was ship-wrecked on 26 February 1852, while transporting troops to Algoa Bay at Danger Point near Gansbaai, 87 miles (140 kilometres) from Cape Town in the Cape Colony. There were not enough serviceable lifeboats for all the passengers, and the soldiers famously stood firm on board, thereby allowing&nbsp;the women and children to board the boats safely and escape the sinking. Only 193 of the estimated 643 people on board survived, and the soldiers’ chivalry gave rise to the unofficial “women and children first” protocol when abandoning ship, while the “Birkenhead drill” of Rudyard Kipling’s poem came to describe courage in face of hopeless circumstances.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Deep in the bottom of the sea, some 3,800 metres below the surface of the freezing Atlantic Ocean, lies the wreckage of a ship: the unmistakable carcass of the Titanic, once man’s grandest mechanical achievement, now stripped of its former glory, after it sank in 1912. According to the famous movie, almost one long century later, intrigued by Titanic’s hidden riches, the modern treasure hunter, Brock Lovett, and his well-equipped technical crew, find themselves in the middle of the ocean, digging for answers for the past three years; nevertheless, without any success. But, when centenarian Rose Calvert, one of the few survivors of the Titanic, learns about this ambitious crusade, she decides to unfold her incredible and utterly tragic story; one that intertwines the extraordinary journey of the exquisite, deep-blue Heart-of-the-Ocean diamond of King Louis XVI, with the unlikely romance of Rose and the young bohemian vagabond, Jack Dawson. Now, an emotional trip down memory lane awaits. Can the mistakes of the past teach a lesson in humility to paupers and royalty alike?</p>

            <p>The Queen Anne’s Revenge has to be the world’s most famous pirate ship. In 1717, the pirate, Blackbeard captured La Concorde, a French slaving vessel. He realised that it would make a perfect pirate ship. It was large yet fast and big enough to mount 40 cannons on board. He renamed it Queen Anne’s Revenge: the name referred to Anne, Queen of England and Scotland. Many pirates favoured the return of the throne of Great Britain from the House of Hanover to the House of Stuart. It had changed hands after Anne’s death. Blackbeard preferred to intimidate his victims into surrendering, as fights were costly. For several months in 1717-18, Blackbeard used the Queen Anne’s Revenge to effectively terrorize shipping in the Atlantic. Between the massive frigate and his own fearsome appearance and reputation, Blackbeard’s victims rarely put up a fight and handed over their cargoes peacefully. He plundered the shipping lanes at will. He was even able to blockade the port of Charleston for a week in April of 1718, looting several ships. In June of 1718, the Queen Anne’s Revenge hit a sandbar off of North Carolina and had to be abandoned. Blackbeard took the opportunity to make off with all of the loot and a select few of his favorite pirates, leaving the others to fend for themselves. Blackbeard went legit (sort of) for a little while, but within a few months, Blackbeard returned to piracy and in November, 1718, he was killed by pirate hunters in a pitched battle off of North Carolina. In 1996, a shipwreck believed to be that of the Queen Anne’s Revenge was discovered off North Carolina. For 15 years it was excavated and studied, and in 2011 it was confirmed to be Blackbeard’s ship. The shipwreck has yielded many interesting artifacts, including weapons, cannons, medical gear and a massive anchor.</p>

            <p>Appearing in Richard Wagner’s opera as a man searching for love, as a ship manned by octopusfaced Davy Jones in Pirates of the Caribbean, and even as a green spirit in the animation SpongeBob SquarePants, the Flying Dutchman is a popular maritime legend. Known for its terrible storms and treacherous outcrops of rock, The Cape of Good Hope in South Africa (around Cape Town) once had a far darker name: The Cape of Storms. It is from here that the legend of the Flying Dutchman set sail. The story behind of the Flying Dutchman begins in 1641 with a sea captain, Hendrik van der Decken and his crew who were returning to Holland from the Far East when they, like all trade ships, had to risk the dangerous passage around The Cape of Good Hope. Legend has it that, as van der Decken and his crew attempted to round the Cape, a storm began. The crew begged their captain not to sail into the storm, but he was determined to face the chaotic waters and screaming winds. Van der Decken vowed that he would sail around the Cape, even if it took him ‘until Doomsday’ to accomplish it. Some say that, at one point, an angel appeared to van der Decken, and the Dutch trader shot at his otherworldly visitor. With that, the ship’s fate was sealed. The Flying Dutchman is said to appear as a ghostly, glowing ship. It will materialise suddenly and then, just as suddenly, vanish. Some claim the ship, doomed to sail the seas forever, will attempt to make contact with other travellers, and that seeing the Flying Dutchman is a sign of horrible misfortune to come. Whether maritime superstition or true event, the Flying Dutchman continues to haunt the Cape and stories of the sea. Standing on the beach on South Africa’s southern coast, looking out into the swirling clouds and crashing waves, you may just catch a glimpse of a strange-looking ship desperate to get home.</p>

            <p>The HMS Birkenhead, also referred to as HM Troopship Birkenhead or Steam Frigate Birkenhead, was one of the first iron-hulled ships built for the Royal Navy. She was designed as a steam frigate, but was converted to a troopship before being commissioned. She was ship-wrecked on 26 February 1852, while transporting troops to Algoa Bay at Danger Point near Gansbaai, 87 miles (140 kilometres) from Cape Town in the Cape Colony. There were not enough serviceable lifeboats for all the passengers, and the soldiers famously stood firm on board, thereby allowing&nbsp;the women and children to board the boats safely and escape the sinking. Only 193 of the estimated 643 people on board survived, and the soldiers’ chivalry gave rise to the unofficial “women and children first” protocol when abandoning ship, while the “Birkenhead drill” of Rudyard Kipling’s poem came to describe courage in face of hopeless circumstances.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Deep in the bottom of the sea, some 3,800 metres below the surface of the freezing Atlantic Ocean, lies the wreckage of a ship: the unmistakable carcass of the Titanic, once man’s grandest mechanical achievement, now stripped of its former glory, after it sank in 1912. According to the famous movie, almost one long century later, intrigued by Titanic’s hidden riches, the modern treasure hunter, Brock Lovett, and his well-equipped technical crew, find themselves in the middle of the ocean, digging for answers for the past three years; nevertheless, without any success. But, when centenarian Rose Calvert, one of the few survivors of the Titanic, learns about this ambitious crusade, she decides to unfold her incredible and utterly tragic story; one that intertwines the extraordinary journey of the exquisite, deep-blue Heart-of-the-Ocean diamond of King Louis XVI, with the unlikely romance of Rose and the young bohemian vagabond, Jack Dawson. Now, an emotional trip down memory lane awaits. Can the mistakes of the past teach a lesson in humility to paupers and royalty alike?</p>

            <p>The Queen Anne’s Revenge has to be the world’s most famous pirate ship. In 1717, the pirate, Blackbeard captured La Concorde, a French slaving vessel. He realised that it would make a perfect pirate ship. It was large yet fast and big enough to mount 40 cannons on board. He renamed it Queen Anne’s Revenge: the name referred to Anne, Queen of England and Scotland. Many pirates favoured the return of the throne of Great Britain from the House of Hanover to the House of Stuart. It had changed hands after Anne’s death. Blackbeard preferred to intimidate his victims into surrendering, as fights were costly. For several months in 1717-18, Blackbeard used the Queen Anne’s Revenge to effectively terrorize shipping in the Atlantic. Between the massive frigate and his own fearsome appearance and reputation, Blackbeard’s victims rarely put up a fight and handed over their cargoes peacefully. He plundered the shipping lanes at will. He was even able to blockade the port of Charleston for a week in April of 1718, looting several ships. In June of 1718, the Queen Anne’s Revenge hit a sandbar off of North Carolina and had to be abandoned. Blackbeard took the opportunity to make off with all of the loot and a select few of his favorite pirates, leaving the others to fend for themselves. Blackbeard went legit (sort of) for a little while, but within a few months, Blackbeard returned to piracy and in November, 1718, he was killed by pirate hunters in a pitched battle off of North Carolina. In 1996, a shipwreck believed to be that of the Queen Anne’s Revenge was discovered off North Carolina. For 15 years it was excavated and studied, and in 2011 it was confirmed to be Blackbeard’s ship. The shipwreck has yielded many interesting artifacts, including weapons, cannons, medical gear and a massive anchor.</p>

            <p>Appearing in Richard Wagner’s opera as a man searching for love, as a ship manned by octopusfaced Davy Jones in Pirates of the Caribbean, and even as a green spirit in the animation SpongeBob SquarePants, the Flying Dutchman is a popular maritime legend. Known for its terrible storms and treacherous outcrops of rock, The Cape of Good Hope in South Africa (around Cape Town) once had a far darker name: The Cape of Storms. It is from here that the legend of the Flying Dutchman set sail. The story behind of the Flying Dutchman begins in 1641 with a sea captain, Hendrik van der Decken and his crew who were returning to Holland from the Far East when they, like all trade ships, had to risk the dangerous passage around The Cape of Good Hope. Legend has it that, as van der Decken and his crew attempted to round the Cape, a storm began. The crew begged their captain not to sail into the storm, but he was determined to face the chaotic waters and screaming winds. Van der Decken vowed that he would sail around the Cape, even if it took him ‘until Doomsday’ to accomplish it. Some say that, at one point, an angel appeared to van der Decken, and the Dutch trader shot at his otherworldly visitor. With that, the ship’s fate was sealed. The Flying Dutchman is said to appear as a ghostly, glowing ship. It will materialise suddenly and then, just as suddenly, vanish. Some claim the ship, doomed to sail the seas forever, will attempt to make contact with other travellers, and that seeing the Flying Dutchman is a sign of horrible misfortune to come. Whether maritime superstition or true event, the Flying Dutchman continues to haunt the Cape and stories of the sea. Standing on the beach on South Africa’s southern coast, looking out into the swirling clouds and crashing waves, you may just catch a glimpse of a strange-looking ship desperate to get home.</p>
