        <p><em>Read the texts below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>The Mississippi River</strong><br><br>
The Mississippi River is one of the largest rivers globally and among the biggest in the United States. This 2,340-mile body of water has been crossed for exploration, used for transportation, and has been the subject of many works of fiction. However, anyone that studies water would agree that rivers are somewhat odd and that it can be hard to discover their origin.<br>
<br>
The Mississippi River starts in Lake Itasca, an area of Minnesota (a state that is in the centre of the USA) that is rife with other lakes. This lake is fed by several streams and marks the accepted headwaters or the beginning of the Mississippi River. Interestingly, that means the Mississippi River is completely in the United States. Only China has a complete river flowing through it that is longer.<br>
<br>
If you were to follow the Mississippi River from Lake Itasca until the end of the river on a map, you’d see an obvious important impact of this body of water. The river forms most of the borders of about ten states throughout the course of its flow. If you’ve ever wondered why some states, like Illinois, have unusual borders, that is one explanation. Not only is this river significant for boundaries, but it continues to be important for trade, hydroelectric energy, and the ecology of a large swath of the country.<br>
<br>
The Mississippi River is the most famous river in the United States, flowing southward through ten states. The states that the river flows through are: Arkansas; Illinois; Iowa; Louisiana; Kentucky; Minnesota; Mississippi; Missouri; Tennessee; Wisconsin. Anyone familiar with a map of the United States can see that the Mississippi River practically bisects the country from top to bottom.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In fact, the river itself is so long that it is considered as three distinct parts when discussing its features. These divisions are called the following. The Upper Mississippi River: begins at the headwaters and flows to St. Louis, Missouri, where it forms a confluence with the Missouri River. The Middle Mississippi River- begins at the Mississippi River-Missouri River confluence and flows to the Ohio River confluence. The Lower Mississippi River- begins at the Mississippi River-Ohio River confluence and ends in the Gulf of Mexico on the coast, where the river mouth forms. The Mississippi River-Ohio River confluence is especially important since the Ohio River contributes more water volume than any other tributary.<br>

<strong>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</strong><br>
<br>
When the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a big bend on the Illinois side, and hacked off cottonwood branches with the hatchet, and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there had been a cave-in in the bank there. A tow-head is a sandbar that has cottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth.<br>
<br>
We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois side, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place, so we warn’t afraid of anybody running across us. We laid there all day, and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore, and up-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle. ...<br>
<br>
When it was beginning to come on dark, we poked our heads out of the cottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing in sight; so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the things dry. Jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above the level of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps was out of reach of steamboat waves. Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for to hold it to its place; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather or chilly; the wigwam would keep it from being seen. We made an extra steering-oar, too, because one of the others might get broke on a snag or something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern on, because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat coming down-stream, to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn’t have to light it for up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they call a “crossing”; for the river was pretty high yet, very low banks being still a little under water; so up-bound boats didn’t always run the channel, but hunted easy water.<br>
<br>
This second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current that was making over four mile an hour. We catched fish and talked, and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness. It was kind of solemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking up at the stars, and we didn’t ever feel like talking loud, and it warn’t often that we laughed—only a little kind of a low chuckle. We had mighty good weather as a general thing, and nothing ever happened to us at all—that night, nor the next, nor the next.<br>
<br>
Every night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides, nothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see. The fifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world lit up. In St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand people in St. Louis, but I never believed it till I see that wonderful spread of lights at two o’clock that still night. There warn’t a sound there; everybody was asleep.<br>
<br>
Every night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o’clock at some little village, and buy ten or fifteen cents’ worth of meal or bacon or other stuff to eat; and sometimes I <span class="txt-underline"><strong>lifted</strong></span> a chicken that warn’t roosting comfortable, and took him along. Pap always said, take a chicken when you get a chance, because if you don’t want him yourself you can easy find somebody that does, and a good deed ain’t ever forgot. I never see pap when he didn’t want the chicken himself, but that is what he used to say, anyway.<br>

Not only is this river significant for boundaries, but it continues to be important for trade, hydroelectric energy, and the ecology of a large swath of the country.<br>
<br>
The Mississippi River is the most famous river in the United States, flowing southward through ten states. The states that the river flows through are: Arkansas; Illinois; Iowa; Louisiana; Kentucky; Minnesota; Mississippi; Missouri; Tennessee; Wisconsin. Anyone familiar with a map of the United States can see that the Mississippi River practically bisects the country from top to bottom.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In fact, the river itself is so long that it is considered as three distinct parts when discussing its features. These divisions are called the following. The Upper Mississippi River: begins at the headwaters and flows to St. Louis, Missouri, where it forms a confluence with the Missouri River. The Middle Mississippi River- begins at the Mississippi River-Missouri River confluence and flows to the Ohio River confluence. The Lower Mississippi River- begins at the Mississippi River-Ohio River confluence and ends in the Gulf of Mexico on the coast, where the river mouth forms. The Mississippi River-Ohio River confluence is especially important since the Ohio River contributes more water volume than any other tributary.<br>

<strong>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</strong><br>
<br>
When the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a big bend on the Illinois side, and hacked off cottonwood branches with the hatchet, and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there had been a cave-in in the bank there. A tow-head is a sandbar that has cottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth.<br>
<br>
We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois side, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place, so we warn’t afraid of anybody running across us. We laid there all day, and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore, and up-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle. ...<br>
<br>
When it was beginning to come on dark, we poked our heads out of the cottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing in sight; so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the things dry. Jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above the level of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps was out of reach of steamboat waves. Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for to hold it to its place; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather or chilly; the wigwam would keep it from being seen. We made an extra steering-oar, too, because one of the others might get broke on a snag or something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern on, because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat coming down-stream, to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn’t have to light it for up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they call a “crossing”; for the river was pretty high yet, very low banks being still a little under water; so up-bound boats didn’t always run the channel, but hunted easy water.<br>
<br>
This second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current that was making over four mile an hour. We catched fish and talked, and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness. It was kind of solemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking up at the stars, and we didn’t ever feel like talking loud, and it warn’t often that we laughed—only a little kind of a low chuckle. We had mighty good weather as a general thing, and nothing ever happened to us at all—that night, nor the next, nor the next.<br>
<br>
Every night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides, nothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see. The fifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world lit up. In St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand people in St. Louis, but I never believed it till I see that wonderful spread of lights at two o’clock that still night. There warn’t a sound there; everybody was asleep.<br>
<br>
Every night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o’clock at some little village, and buy ten or fifteen cents’ worth of meal or bacon or other stuff to eat; and sometimes I <span class="txt-underline"><strong>lifted</strong></span> a chicken that warn’t roosting comfortable, and took him along. Pap always said, take a chicken when you get a chance, because if you don’t want him yourself you can easy find somebody that does, and a good deed ain’t ever forgot. I never see pap when he didn’t want the chicken himself, but that is what he used to say, anyway.<br>

We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois side, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place, so we warn’t afraid of anybody running across us. We laid there all day, and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore, and up-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle. ...<br>
<br>
When it was beginning to come on dark, we poked our heads out of the cottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing in sight; so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the things dry. Jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above the level of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps was out of reach of steamboat waves. Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for to hold it to its place; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather or chilly; the wigwam would keep it from being seen. We made an extra steering-oar, too, because one of the others might get broke on a snag or something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern on, because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat coming down-stream, to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn’t have to light it for up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they call a “crossing”; for the river was pretty high yet, very low banks being still a little under water; so up-bound boats didn’t always run the channel, but hunted easy water.<br>
<br>
This second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current that was making over four mile an hour. We catched fish and talked, and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness. It was kind of solemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking up at the stars, and we didn’t ever feel like talking loud, and it warn’t often that we laughed—only a little kind of a low chuckle. We had mighty good weather as a general thing, and nothing ever happened to us at all—that night, nor the next, nor the next.<br>
<br>
Every night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides, nothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see. The fifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world lit up. In St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand people in St. Louis, but I never believed it till I see that wonderful spread of lights at two o’clock that still night. There warn’t a sound there; everybody was asleep.<br>
<br>
Every night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o’clock at some little village, and buy ten or fifteen cents’ worth of meal or bacon or other stuff to eat; and sometimes I <span class="txt-underline"><strong>lifted</strong></span> a chicken that warn’t roosting comfortable, and took him along. Pap always said, take a chicken when you get a chance, because if you don’t want him yourself you can easy find somebody that does, and a good deed ain’t ever forgot. I never see pap when he didn’t want the chicken himself, but that is what he used to say, anyway.<br>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>TRASH</strong><br><br><em>by Andy Mulligan</em><br><br>
My name is Raphael Fernandez and I am a dumpsite boy.<br>
<br>
People say to me, 'I guess you just never know what you'll find, sifting through rubbish! Today could be your lucky day.' I say to them, 'Friend, I think I know what I find.' And I know what everyone finds, because I know what we've been finding for all the years I've<br>
been working, which is eleven years. It's the one word: stuppa, which means--and I'm sorry if I offend--it's our word for human muck. I don't want to upset anyone, that's not my business here. But there's a lot of things hard to come by in our sweet city, and one of the things too many people don't have is toilets and running water. So when they have to go, they do it where they can. Most of those people live in boxes, and the boxes are stacked up tall and high. So, when you use the toilet, you do it on a piece of paper, and you wrap it up and put it in the trash. The trash bags come together. All over the city, trash bags get loaded onto carts, and from carts onto trucks or even trains--you'd be amazed at how much trash this city makes. Piles and piles of it, and it all ends up here with us. The trucks and trains never stop, and nor do we. Crawl and crawl, and sort and sort.<br>
<br>
It's a place they call Behala, and it's rubbish-town. Three years ago, it was Smoky Mountain, but Smoky Mountain got so bad they closed it down and shifted us along the road. The piles stack up--and I mean Himalayas: you could climb forever, and many people do . . . up and down, into the valleys. The mountains go right from the docks to the marshes, one whole long world of steaming trash. I am one of the rubbish boys, picking through the stuff this city throws away.<br>
<br>
'But you must find interesting things?' someone said to me. 'Sometimes, no?'<br>
<br>
We get visitors, you see. It's mainly foreigners visiting the Mission School, which they set up years ago and just about stays open. I always smile, and I say, '<span class="txt-underline"><strong>Sometimes, sir!</strong></span> Sometimes, ma'am!'<br>
<br>
What I really mean is, No, never--because what we mainly find is stupp.<br>
<br>
'What you got there?' I say to Gardo.<br>
<br>
'What d'you think, boy?' says Gardo.<br>
<br>
And I know. The interesting parcel that looked like something nice wrapped up? What a surprise! It's stupp, and Gardo's picking his way on, wiping his hands on his shirt and hoping to find something we can sell. All day, sun or rain, over the hills we go.<br>
<br>
You want to come see? Well, you can smell Behala long before you see it. It must be about two hundred football pitches big, or maybe a thousand basketball courts--I don't&nbsp;know: it seems to go on forever. Nor do I know how much of it is stupp, but on a bad day it seems like most of it, and to spend your life wading through it, breathing it, sleeping beside it--well . . . maybe one day you'll find 'something nice'. Oh yes.<br>
<br>
<strong><span class="txt-underline">Then one day I did.</span></strong><br>
<br>
I was a trash boy since I was old enough to move without help and pick things up. That was what? --three years old, and I was sorting.<br>
<br>
Let me tell you what we're looking for.<br>
<br>
Plastic, because plastic can be turned into cash, fast--by the kilo. White plastic is best, and that goes in one pile; blue in the next.<br>
<br>
Paper, if it's white and clean--that means if we can clean it and dry it. Cardboard also.<br>
<br>
Tin cans--anything metal. Glass, if it's a bottle. Cloth or rags of any kind--that means the occasional T-shirt, a pair of pants, a bit of sack that wrapped something up. The kids round here, half the stuff we wear is what we found, but most we pile up, weigh and sell. You should see me, dressed to kill. I wear a pair of hacked-off jeans and a too-big T-shirt that I can roll up onto my head when the sun gets bad. I don't wear shoes--one, because I don't have any, and two, because you need to feel with your feet. The Mission School had a big push on getting us boots, but most of the kids sold them on. The trash is soft, and our feet are hard as hooves.<br>
<br>
Rubber is good. Just last week we got a freak delivery of old tyres from somewhere. Snapped up in minutes, they were, the men getting in first and driving us off. A half-good tyre can fetch half a dollar, and a dead tyre holds down the roof of your house. We get the fast food too, and that's a little business in itself. It doesn't come near me and Gardo, it goes down the far end, and about a hundred kids sort out the straws, the cups and the chicken bones. Everything turned, cleaned and bagged up--cycled down to the weighers, weighed and sold. Onto the trucks that take it back to the city, round it goes. On a good day I'll make two hundred pesos. On a bad, maybe fifty? So you live day to day and hope you don't get sick. Your life is the hook you carry, there in your hand, turning the trash.<br>
<br>
'What's that you got, Gardo?'<br>
'Stupp. What about you?'<br>
Turn over the paper. 'Stupp.'<br>
<br>
I have to say, though: I'm a trash boy with style. I work with Gardo most of the time, and between us we move fast. Some of the little kids and the old people just poke and poke, like everything's got to be turned over--but among the stupp, I can pull out the paper and plastic fast, so I don't do so bad. Gardo's my partner, and we always work together. He looks after me.<br>

But there's a lot of things hard to come by in our sweet city, and one of the things too many people don't have is toilets and running water. So when they have to go, they do it where they can. Most of those people live in boxes, and the boxes are stacked up tall and high. So, when you use the toilet, you do it on a piece of paper, and you wrap it up and put it in the trash. The trash bags come together. All over the city, trash bags get loaded onto carts, and from carts onto trucks or even trains--you'd be amazed at how much trash this city makes. Piles and piles of it, and it all ends up here with us. The trucks and trains never stop, and nor do we. Crawl and crawl, and sort and sort.<br>
<br>
It's a place they call Behala, and it's rubbish-town. Three years ago, it was Smoky Mountain, but Smoky Mountain got so bad they closed it down and shifted us along the road. The piles stack up--and I mean Himalayas: you could climb forever, and many people do . . . up and down, into the valleys. The mountains go right from the docks to the marshes, one whole long world of steaming trash. I am one of the rubbish boys, picking through the stuff this city throws away.<br>
<br>
'But you must find interesting things?' someone said to me. 'Sometimes, no?'<br>
<br>
We get visitors, you see. It's mainly foreigners visiting the Mission School, which they set up years ago and just about stays open. I always smile, and I say, '<span class="txt-underline"><strong>Sometimes, sir!</strong></span> Sometimes, ma'am!'<br>
<br>
What I really mean is, No, never--because what we mainly find is stupp.<br>
<br>
'What you got there?' I say to Gardo.<br>
<br>
'What d'you think, boy?' says Gardo.<br>
<br>
And I know. The interesting parcel that looked like something nice wrapped up? What a surprise! It's stupp, and Gardo's picking his way on, wiping his hands on his shirt and hoping to find something we can sell. All day, sun or rain, over the hills we go.<br>
<br>
You want to come see? Well, you can smell Behala long before you see it. It must be about two hundred football pitches big, or maybe a thousand basketball courts--I don't&nbsp;know: it seems to go on forever. Nor do I know how much of it is stupp, but on a bad day it seems like most of it, and to spend your life wading through it, breathing it, sleeping beside it--well . . . maybe one day you'll find 'something nice'. Oh yes.<br>
<br>
<strong><span class="txt-underline">Then one day I did.</span></strong><br>
<br>
I was a trash boy since I was old enough to move without help and pick things up. That was what? --three years old, and I was sorting.<br>
<br>
Let me tell you what we're looking for.<br>
<br>
Plastic, because plastic can be turned into cash, fast--by the kilo. White plastic is best, and that goes in one pile; blue in the next.<br>
<br>
Paper, if it's white and clean--that means if we can clean it and dry it. Cardboard also.<br>
<br>
Tin cans--anything metal. Glass, if it's a bottle. Cloth or rags of any kind--that means the occasional T-shirt, a pair of pants, a bit of sack that wrapped something up. The kids round here, half the stuff we wear is what we found, but most we pile up, weigh and sell. You should see me, dressed to kill. I wear a pair of hacked-off jeans and a too-big T-shirt that I can roll up onto my head when the sun gets bad. I don't wear shoes--one, because I don't have any, and two, because you need to feel with your feet. The Mission School had a big push on getting us boots, but most of the kids sold them on. The trash is soft, and our feet are hard as hooves.<br>
<br>
Rubber is good. Just last week we got a freak delivery of old tyres from somewhere. Snapped up in minutes, they were, the men getting in first and driving us off. A half-good tyre can fetch half a dollar, and a dead tyre holds down the roof of your house. We get the fast food too, and that's a little business in itself. It doesn't come near me and Gardo, it goes down the far end, and about a hundred kids sort out the straws, the cups and the chicken bones. Everything turned, cleaned and bagged up--cycled down to the weighers, weighed and sold. Onto the trucks that take it back to the city, round it goes. On a good day I'll make two hundred pesos. On a bad, maybe fifty? So you live day to day and hope you don't get sick. Your life is the hook you carry, there in your hand, turning the trash.<br>
<br>
'What's that you got, Gardo?'<br>
'Stupp. What about you?'<br>
Turn over the paper. 'Stupp.'<br>
<br>
I have to say, though: I'm a trash boy with style. I work with Gardo most of the time, and between us we move fast. Some of the little kids and the old people just poke and poke, like everything's got to be turned over--but among the stupp, I can pull out the paper and plastic fast, so I don't do so bad. Gardo's my partner, and we always work together. He looks after me.<br>

Piles and piles of it, and it all ends up here with us. The trucks and trains never stop, and nor do we. Crawl and crawl, and sort and sort.<br>
<br>
It's a place they call Behala, and it's rubbish-town. Three years ago, it was Smoky Mountain, but Smoky Mountain got so bad they closed it down and shifted us along the road. The piles stack up--and I mean Himalayas: you could climb forever, and many people do . . . up and down, into the valleys. The mountains go right from the docks to the marshes, one whole long world of steaming trash. I am one of the rubbish boys, picking through the stuff this city throws away.<br>
<br>
'But you must find interesting things?' someone said to me. 'Sometimes, no?'<br>
<br>
We get visitors, you see. It's mainly foreigners visiting the Mission School, which they set up years ago and just about stays open. I always smile, and I say, '<span class="txt-underline"><strong>Sometimes, sir!</strong></span> Sometimes, ma'am!'<br>
<br>
What I really mean is, No, never--because what we mainly find is stupp.<br>
<br>
'What you got there?' I say to Gardo.<br>
<br>
'What d'you think, boy?' says Gardo.<br>
<br>
And I know. The interesting parcel that looked like something nice wrapped up? What a surprise! It's stupp, and Gardo's picking his way on, wiping his hands on his shirt and hoping to find something we can sell. All day, sun or rain, over the hills we go.<br>
<br>
You want to come see? Well, you can smell Behala long before you see it. It must be about two hundred football pitches big, or maybe a thousand basketball courts--I don't&nbsp;know: it seems to go on forever. Nor do I know how much of it is stupp, but on a bad day it seems like most of it, and to spend your life wading through it, breathing it, sleeping beside it--well . . . maybe one day you'll find 'something nice'. Oh yes.<br>
<br>
<strong><span class="txt-underline">Then one day I did.</span></strong><br>
<br>
I was a trash boy since I was old enough to move without help and pick things up. That was what? --three years old, and I was sorting.<br>
<br>
Let me tell you what we're looking for.<br>
<br>
Plastic, because plastic can be turned into cash, fast--by the kilo. White plastic is best, and that goes in one pile; blue in the next.<br>
<br>
Paper, if it's white and clean--that means if we can clean it and dry it. Cardboard also.<br>
<br>
Tin cans--anything metal. Glass, if it's a bottle. Cloth or rags of any kind--that means the occasional T-shirt, a pair of pants, a bit of sack that wrapped something up. The kids round here, half the stuff we wear is what we found, but most we pile up, weigh and sell. You should see me, dressed to kill. I wear a pair of hacked-off jeans and a too-big T-shirt that I can roll up onto my head when the sun gets bad. I don't wear shoes--one, because I don't have any, and two, because you need to feel with your feet. The Mission School had a big push on getting us boots, but most of the kids sold them on. The trash is soft, and our feet are hard as hooves.<br>
<br>
Rubber is good. Just last week we got a freak delivery of old tyres from somewhere. Snapped up in minutes, they were, the men getting in first and driving us off. A half-good tyre can fetch half a dollar, and a dead tyre holds down the roof of your house. We get the fast food too, and that's a little business in itself. It doesn't come near me and Gardo, it goes down the far end, and about a hundred kids sort out the straws, the cups and the chicken bones. Everything turned, cleaned and bagged up--cycled down to the weighers, weighed and sold. Onto the trucks that take it back to the city, round it goes. On a good day I'll make two hundred pesos. On a bad, maybe fifty? So you live day to day and hope you don't get sick. Your life is the hook you carry, there in your hand, turning the trash.<br>
<br>
'What's that you got, Gardo?'<br>
'Stupp. What about you?'<br>
Turn over the paper. 'Stupp.'<br>
<br>
I have to say, though: I'm a trash boy with style. I work with Gardo most of the time, and between us we move fast. Some of the little kids and the old people just poke and poke, like everything's got to be turned over--but among the stupp, I can pull out the paper and plastic fast, so I don't do so bad. Gardo's my partner, and we always work together. He looks after me.<br>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>TRASH</strong><br><br><em>by Andy Mulligan</em><br><br>
My name is Raphael Fernandez and I am a dumpsite boy.<br>
<br>
People say to me, 'I guess you just never know what you'll find, sifting through rubbish! Today could be your lucky day.' I say to them, 'Friend, I think I know what I find.' And I know what everyone finds, because I know what we've been finding for all the years I've<br>
been working, which is eleven years. It's the one word: stuppa, which means--and I'm sorry if I offend--it's our word for human muck. I don't want to upset anyone, that's not my business here. But there's a lot of things hard to come by in our sweet city, and one of the things too many people don't have is toilets and running water. So when they have to go, they do it where they can. Most of those people live in boxes, and the boxes are stacked up tall and high. So, when you use the toilet, you do it on a piece of paper, and you wrap it up and put it in the trash.

We get visitors, you see. It's mainly foreigners visiting the Mission School, which they set up years ago and just about stays open. I always smile, and I say, '<span class="txt-underline"><strong>Sometimes, sir!</strong></span> Sometimes, ma'am!'<br>
<br>
What I really mean is, No, never--because what we mainly find is stupp.<br>
<br>
'What you got there?' I say to Gardo.<br>
<br>
'What d'you think, boy?' says Gardo.<br>
<br>
And I know. The interesting parcel that looked like something nice wrapped up? What a surprise! It's stupp, and Gardo's picking his way on, wiping his hands on his shirt and hoping to find something we can sell. All day, sun or rain, over the hills we go.<br>
<br>
You want to come see? Well, you can smell Behala long before you see it. It must be about two hundred football pitches big, or maybe a thousand basketball courts--I don't&nbsp;know: it seems to go on forever. Nor do I know how much of it is stupp, but on a bad day it seems like most of it, and to spend your life wading through it, breathing it, sleeping beside it--well . . . maybe one day you'll find 'something nice'. Oh yes.<br>
<br>
<strong><span class="txt-underline">Then one day I did.</span></strong><br>
<br>
I was a trash boy since I was old enough to move without help and pick things up. That was what? --three years old, and I was sorting.<br>
<br>
Let me tell you what we're looking for.<br>
<br>
Plastic, because plastic can be turned into cash, fast--by the kilo. White plastic is best, and that goes in one pile; blue in the next.<br>
<br>
Paper, if it's white and clean--that means if we can clean it and dry it. Cardboard also.<br>
<br>
Tin cans--anything metal. Glass, if it's a bottle. Cloth or rags of any kind--that means the occasional T-shirt, a pair of pants, a bit of sack that wrapped something up. The kids round here, half the stuff we wear is what we found, but most we pile up, weigh and sell. You should see me, dressed to kill. I wear a pair of hacked-off jeans and a too-big T-shirt that I can roll up onto my head when the sun gets bad. I don't wear shoes--one, because I don't have any, and two, because you need to feel with your feet. The Mission School had a big push on getting us boots, but most of the kids sold them on. The trash is soft, and our feet are hard as hooves.<br>
<br>
Rubber is good. Just last week we got a freak delivery of old tyres from somewhere. Snapped up in minutes, they were, the men getting in first and driving us off. A half-good tyre can fetch half a dollar, and a dead tyre holds down the roof of your house. We get the fast food too, and that's a little business in itself. It doesn't come near me and Gardo, it goes down the far end, and about a hundred kids sort out the straws, the cups and the chicken bones. Everything turned, cleaned and bagged up--cycled down to the weighers, weighed and sold. Onto the trucks that take it back to the city, round it goes. On a good day I'll make two hundred pesos. On a bad, maybe fifty? So you live day to day and hope you don't get sick. Your life is the hook you carry, there in your hand, turning the trash.<br>
<br>
'What's that you got, Gardo?'<br>
'Stupp. What about you?'<br>
Turn over the paper. 'Stupp.'<br>
<br>
I have to say, though: I'm a trash boy with style. I work with Gardo most of the time, and between us we move fast. Some of the little kids and the old people just poke and poke, like everything's got to be turned over--but among the stupp, I can pull out the paper and plastic fast, so I don't do so bad. Gardo's my partner, and we always work together. He looks after me.<br>

<strong>12 ..........</strong> . In their native countries, these brave people do everything they can to keep endangered animals like elephants and rhinos safe. Across the continent of Africa, rangers are kept busy day and night. Working in small teams, they prevent poaching, clear up harmful snares that could harm wildlife, and patrol enormous wild areas.<br>
<br>
More often than not, wildlife rangers are men. In African countries, women are expected to work in the home. 13 .......... . Plus, the hard and dangerous tasks of a wildlife ranger mean that the job is frequently seen as unsuitable for women. Ranger training can be a difficult and physically demanding process, which requires lots of skills that women are not traditionally trained in. As a result, just 11% of wildlife rangers are women. However, these women make up many successful female anti-poaching teams in many countries around the world, including at least 18 African countries.<br>
<br>
So, let’s meet some of these incredible wildlife-defending women.<br>
<br>
Nyaradzo is a 29-year-old ranger from the Akashinga Anti-Poaching Unit in Zimbabwe. She joined the unit in 2017, and studies Wildlife Ecology and Conservation at the Chinhoyi University of Technology alongside her job! Before she became a ranger, Nyaradzo was forced to drop out of school and get married. 14 .......... . – something many African women cannot afford to do on their own.<br>
<br>
Sithabile is a Community Scout for the National Park Rescue in Zimbabwe. Once a tomato seller, she now protects wildlife and wild spaces within the important Chizarira National Park. Sithabile says: “Usually, men are the first preference to be employed by companies. But now I have the respect of my community, and I will be able to build my children’s future.” All-female teams, like Sithabile’s, often succeed in ways that all-male teams do not. 15 .......... .<br>
<br>
Many people don’t know about the hard work of these extraordinary rangers, so UK charity ‘How Many Elephants’ have created a new awareness day: World Female Ranger Day. On June 23rd every year, people will celebrate female wildlife rangers all over the world. There are many more women out there just like Nyaradzo and Sithabile, who are working hard to make a difference – to the animals, wild places, and to their communities too! The founder of ‘How Many Elephants’, adventurer Holly Budge, teamed up with colleague Margot Dempsey to create World Female Ranger Day. <strong>16 ..........</strong> . As a result, she knows just how important it is to encourage more women to get involved. She says: “We are looking forward to bringing together female rangers around the world to celebrate their incredible work, identify the challenges they face, and provide them with the support they need through our fundraising and awareness efforts.” Amazing!<br>

Female Wildlife Rangers<br>

<strong>12 ..........</strong> . In their native countries, these brave people do everything they can to keep endangered animals like elephants and rhinos safe. Across the continent of Africa, rangers are kept busy day and night. Working in small teams, they prevent poaching, clear up harmful snares that could harm wildlife, and patrol enormous wild areas.<br>
<br>
More often than not, wildlife rangers are men. In African countries, women are expected to work in the home. 13 .......... . Plus, the hard and dangerous tasks of a wildlife ranger mean that the job is frequently seen as unsuitable for women. Ranger training can be a difficult and physically demanding process, which requires lots of skills that women are not traditionally trained in. As a result, just 11% of wildlife rangers are women. However, these women make up many successful female anti-poaching teams in many countries around the world, including at least 18 African countries.<br>
<br>
So, let’s meet some of these incredible wildlife-defending women.<br>
<br>
Nyaradzo is a 29-year-old ranger from the Akashinga Anti-Poaching Unit in Zimbabwe. She joined the unit in 2017, and studies Wildlife Ecology and Conservation at the Chinhoyi University of Technology alongside her job! Before she became a ranger, Nyaradzo was forced to drop out of school and get married. 14 .......... . – something many African women cannot afford to do on their own.<br>
<br>
Sithabile is a Community Scout for the National Park Rescue in Zimbabwe. Once a tomato seller, she now protects wildlife and wild spaces within the important Chizarira National Park. Sithabile says: “Usually, men are the first preference to be employed by companies. But now I have the respect of my community, and I will be able to build my children’s future.” All-female teams, like Sithabile’s, often succeed in ways that all-male teams do not. 15 .......... .<br>
<br>
Many people don’t know about the hard work of these extraordinary rangers, so UK charity ‘How Many Elephants’ have created a new awareness day: World Female Ranger Day. On June 23rd every year, people will celebrate female wildlife rangers all over the world. There are many more women out there just like Nyaradzo and Sithabile, who are working hard to make a difference – to the animals, wild places, and to their communities too! The founder of ‘How Many Elephants’, adventurer Holly Budge, teamed up with colleague Margot Dempsey to create World Female Ranger Day. <strong>16 ..........</strong> . As a result, she knows just how important it is to encourage more women to get involved. She says: “We are looking forward to bringing together female rangers around the world to celebrate their incredible work, identify the challenges they face, and provide them with the support they need through our fundraising and awareness efforts.” Amazing!<br>

Female Wildlife Rangers<br>

<br>
<strong>12 ..........</strong> . In their native countries, these brave people do everything they can to keep endangered animals like elephants and rhinos safe. Across the continent of Africa, rangers are kept busy day and night. Working in small teams, they prevent poaching, clear up harmful snares that could harm wildlife, and patrol enormous wild areas.<br>
<br>
More often than not, wildlife rangers are men. In African countries, women are expected to work in the home. 13 .......... . Plus, the hard and dangerous tasks of a wildlife ranger mean that the job is frequently seen as unsuitable for women. Ranger training can be a difficult and physically demanding process, which requires lots of skills that women are not traditionally trained in. As a result, just 11% of wildlife rangers are women. However, these women make up many successful female anti-poaching teams in many countries around the world, including at least 18 African countries.<br>
<br>
So, let’s meet some of these incredible wildlife-defending women.<br>
<br>
Nyaradzo is a 29-year-old ranger from the Akashinga Anti-Poaching Unit in Zimbabwe. She joined the unit in 2017, and studies Wildlife Ecology and Conservation at the Chinhoyi University of Technology alongside her job! Before she became a ranger, Nyaradzo was forced to drop out of school and get married. 14 .......... . – something many African women cannot afford to do on their own.<br>
<br>
Sithabile is a Community Scout for the National Park Rescue in Zimbabwe. Once a tomato seller, she now protects wildlife and wild spaces within the important Chizarira National Park. Sithabile says: “Usually, men are the first preference to be employed by companies. But now I have the respect of my community, and I will be able to build my children’s future.” All-female teams, like Sithabile’s, often succeed in ways that all-male teams do not. 15 .......... .<br>
<br>
Many people don’t know about the hard work of these extraordinary rangers, so UK charity ‘How Many Elephants’ have created a new awareness day: World Female Ranger Day. On June 23rd every year, people will celebrate female wildlife rangers all over the world. There are many more women out there just like Nyaradzo and Sithabile, who are working hard to make a difference – to the animals, wild places, and to their communities too! The founder of ‘How Many Elephants’, adventurer Holly Budge, teamed up with colleague Margot Dempsey to create World Female Ranger Day. <strong>16 ..........</strong> . As a result, she knows just how important it is to encourage more women to get involved. She says: “We are looking forward to bringing together female rangers around the world to celebrate their incredible work, identify the challenges they face, and provide them with the support they need through our fundraising and awareness efforts.” Amazing!<br>

When you’re writing it’s rather like going on a very long walk, across valleys and mountains and things, and you get the first view of what you see and you write it down. Then you walk a bit further, maybe up on to the top of a hill, and you see something else, then you write that and you go on like that, day after day, getting different views of the same landscape. The highest mountain on the walk is obviously the end of the book because it’s got to be the best view of all, when everything comes together and you can look back and see everything you’ve done all ties up. But it’s a very, very long, slow process.<br>
<br>
It always starts with a tiny little seed of an idea, a little germ, and that even doesn’t come very easily. You can be mooching around for a year or so before you get a good one. When I do get a good one, I quickly write it down, so I don’t forget it. I don’t dash up here and start to write it. I’m very careful. I walk around it and look at it and sniff it and then see if I think it will go. Because once you start, you’re embarked on a year’s work and so it’s a big decision.<br>

Roald Dahl was a spy, an ace fighter pilot, a chocolate historian and a medical inventor. He was also the author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Matilda, The BFG, and a treasury of original, evergreen, and beloved children’s books. He remains for many the world’s No. 1 storyteller.<br>
<br>
Born in Llandaff, Wales, on 13th September 1916 to Norwegian parents, Harald Dahl and Sofie Magdalene Hesselberg, Dahl was named after Roald Amundsen, the Norwegian who had been the first man to reach the South Pole just four years earlier. A heroic start in life. But his early years were blighted by the tragic deaths of his older sister, Astri, and his father.<br>
<br>
Wanting the best for her only son, his mother sent him to boarding school - first to St Peter's, Weston-super-Mare; then, in 1929, to Repton - where many bizarre and memorable events would later be recounted in Boy. Pupils at Repton were invited to trial chocolate bars, a memory that stayed with Dahl throughout his life, inspiring Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.<br>

A week later, I was standing outside the bright yellow front door of Gipsy House, his modest eighteenth century whitewashed home. I rang the bell. An explosion of dogs barking heralded the arrival of a gigantic figure in a long red cardigan. He looked down at me. He was six foot five inches tall, craggy and broad of beam. His body seemed larger than the doorway and far, far too big for the proportions of the cottage. He ush ered me through into a cosy sitting room where a log fire burned generously in the fireplace. He seemed a trifle surprised. I asked if I had got the date wrong. “No,” he said. “I was expecting you.” He asked me to wait a moment, then left the room. His strides were huge and ponderous, but strangely graceful—a bit like a giraffe. On one wall a triptych of distorted Francis Bacon heads glared out at me alarmingly, reminding me that for years, Dahl’s adult publishers had dubbed him “the Master of the Macabre”. On an adjacent wall, another Bacon head—this one a distorted swirl of green and white—returned my gaze. Around them a dazzlingly eclectic group of paintings and artefacts decorated the room: colourful oils, a collection of outsize antique Norwegian pipes, a primitive mask, a sober Dutch landscape and some stylised geometric paintings. I learned over lunch that these were the works of the Russian Suprematists: Popova, Malevich and Goncharova.&nbsp;<br>

My four friends and I had come across a loose floor-board at the back of the classroom, and when we pried it up with the blade of a pocket-knife, we discovered a big hollow space underneath. This, we decided, would be our secret hiding place for sweets and other small treasures. Every afternoon, when the last lesson was over, the five of us would wait until the classroom had emptied, then we would lift up the floor-board and examine our secret hoard. One day, when we lifted it up, we found a dead mouse lying among our treasures. It was an exciting discovery. Thwaites took it out by its tail and waved it in front of our faces. “What shall we do with it?” he cried. “It stinks!” someone else shouted. “Throw it out the window quick!” “Hold on a tick,” I said. “Don’t throw it away.” Thwaites hesitated. They all looked at me. When writing about oneself, one must strive to be truthful. Truth is more important than modesty. I must tell you, therefore, that it was I and I alone who had the idea for the great and daring Mouse Plot. We all have our moments of brilliance and glory, and this one was mine. “Why don’t we,” I said, “slip it into one of Mrs. Pratchett’s jars of sweets? Then when she puts her dirty hand in to grab a handful, she’ll grab a stinky dead mouse instead.” The other four stared at me in wonder. Then, as the sheer genius of the plot began to sink in, they all started grinning.<br>
