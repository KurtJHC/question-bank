          <strong>Extract A</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again. It seemed to me I stood by the iron gate leading to the drive, and for a while I could not enter, for the way was barred to me. There was a padlock and chain upon the gate. I called in my dream to the lodge-keeper, and had no answer, and peering closer through the rusted spokes of the gate I saw that the lodge was uninhabited. Then, like all dreamers, I was possessed of a sudden with supernatural powers and passed like a spirit through the barrier before me. The drive wound away in front of me, twisting and turning as it had always done, but as I advanced I was aware that a change had come upon it; it was narrow and unkempt, not the drive that we had known. At first I was puzzled, and it was only when I bent my head to avoid the low swinging branch of a tree that I realized what had happened. Nature had come into her own again and, little by little, in her stealthy, insidious way had encroached upon the drive with long, tenacious fingers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Extract B</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Why do we feel the urge to talk about our dreams? We like to talk about dreams to help us prepare for how to act in dangerous situations in the future. Most of your dreams are going to seem pretty boring to most people. But if you’re going to talk about some of your dreams, pick the ones in which you deal with a problem in some new way. This would make them more interesting than your happy dreams, and if you feel that you learned something about how to deal with a threat, maybe your audience will, too.</p>
        <p>We tend to think of dreams as being really weird, but in truth, about 80 percent of dreams depict ordinary situations. We’re just more likely to remember and talk about the strange or dangerous ones. Information we do not understand can often rouse our curiosity, particularly in the presence of strong emotion. The emotional pull of dreams makes even the strangest incongruities seem meaningful and worthy of discussion and interpretation.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Extract C</strong>
        </p>
        <p>One morning, when I was younger, I gave a detailed description of my previous night’s dream to my mother. When I finished, she said, “I’m going to tell you something. Don’t ever share your dreams with anyone. It’s boring to listen to other people’s dreams.” I was offended at first. But of course she was right; it’s almost always deadly to hear other people talk about their dreams. As a rule, dreams die in the glare of the waking world, their shimmering aura evaporating in the harsh air outside the psyche. And yet, paradoxically, it’s the emotional aura of dreams that makes them feel so urgently worth sharing in the first place.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I still share my dreams – just not verbally. Like so many other writers (and artists too) I employ dreams in my creative work. They’re an engine, a lending library. It’s a thrill to awake with a strange, arresting image in mind, or still grasping the thread of an allegorical dream story.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Extract D</strong>
        </p>
        <p>For the first time in a long while, I had a dream which I feel like writing down. This was a dream where I was auditioning for an acting job, and the dream went lucid; I realized that what was going on was a dream. So, as I often do in these situations, I chilled out and tried not to actively do anything; I often like to just see what the dream reveals. A nondescript person came up to me and handed me a small white book with gold lettering. "Remember this book," said the person, "because when you wake up you're going to want to get a copy. Really remember it." I thanked them and looked at the book in my hand. There was a title and author's name written on it, but I couldn't interpret the text. I'd look at it, trying to remember what it said, then I'd look away, and when I looked back it said something completely different and I was unable to remember what I'd just read.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There’s a great Batman episode all about this! Sometimes I can fully recall bits of dreamed text, but on waking after other dreams, it’s all gone.&nbsp;</p>

We’re just more likely to remember and talk about the strange or dangerous ones. Information we do not understand can often rouse our curiosity, particularly in the presence of strong emotion. The emotional pull of dreams makes even the strangest incongruities seem meaningful and worthy of discussion and interpretation.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Extract C</strong>
        </p>
        <p>One morning, when I was younger, I gave a detailed description of my previous night’s dream to my mother. When I finished, she said, “I’m going to tell you something. Don’t ever share your dreams with anyone. It’s boring to listen to other people’s dreams.” I was offended at first. But of course she was right; it’s almost always deadly to hear other people talk about their dreams. As a rule, dreams die in the glare of the waking world, their shimmering aura evaporating in the harsh air outside the psyche. And yet, paradoxically, it’s the emotional aura of dreams that makes them feel so urgently worth sharing in the first place.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I still share my dreams – just not verbally. Like so many other writers (and artists too) I employ dreams in my creative work. They’re an engine, a lending library. It’s a thrill to awake with a strange, arresting image in mind, or still grasping the thread of an allegorical dream story.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Extract D</strong>
        </p>
        <p>For the first time in a long while, I had a dream which I feel like writing down. This was a dream where I was auditioning for an acting job, and the dream went lucid; I realized that what was going on was a dream. So, as I often do in these situations, I chilled out and tried not to actively do anything; I often like to just see what the dream reveals. A nondescript person came up to me and handed me a small white book with gold lettering. "Remember this book," said the person, "because when you wake up you're going to want to get a copy. Really remember it." I thanked them and looked at the book in my hand. There was a title and author's name written on it, but I couldn't interpret the text. I'd look at it, trying to remember what it said, then I'd look away, and when I looked back it said something completely different and I was unable to remember what I'd just read.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There’s a great Batman episode all about this! Sometimes I can fully recall bits of dreamed text, but on waking after other dreams, it’s all gone.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>Octopus farming</strong><br><br>
Plans to create octopus farms in coastal waters round the world have been denounced by an international group of researchers. They say the move is ethically inexcusable and environmentally dangerous, and have called on private companies, academic institutions and governments to block funding for these ventures.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The researchers say that farming octopuses would require the catching of vast amounts of fish and shellfish to feed them, putting further pressure on the planet’s already threatened marine livestock. The group, led by Professor Jennifer Jacquet of New York University, argues that octopuses are highly developed and curious creatures.&nbsp;<strong>15&nbsp;</strong>_____ ‘We can see no reason why, in the 21st century, a sophisticated, complex animal should become the source of mass-produced food,’ says Jacquet. “Octopuses eat fish and shellfish, and supplying enough to feed large numbers of them puts further pressure on the food chain. It is unsustainable. Octopus factory farming is ethically and ecologically unjustified.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There are about 300 species of octopus and many behave in surprisingly sophisticated ways. In tests, some have been shown to use tools, for example.&nbsp;<strong>16&nbsp;</strong>_____ Once octopuses have solved a problem, they retain a long-term memory of the solution,’ the researchers state in a paper in Issues in Science and Technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Octopuses are also a culinary delicacy. About 350,000 tonnes are caught every year and served in restaurants from Spain to Chile and from Mexico to Australia. However, numbers of octopus caught are reported to be in decline.&nbsp;<strong>17&nbsp;</strong>_____ Wild-caught males and females are allowed to mate. Then their fertile eggs hatch out in containers and are grown into adults to be sold to markets round the globe.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>18&nbsp;</strong>_____ This has made feeding them difficult and expensive. Keeping young animals in water whose salinity and temperature are carefully controlled has also proved tricky. These drawbacks have prevented octopus farms from making progress – until recently. Aquaculturists have learned that the young of some octopus species are less fussy about the food they eat and have used these species as basic stock for breeding.&nbsp;<strong>19&nbsp;</strong>_____ As a result, companies in Australia, Japan and Mexico have said they are hatching octopus&nbsp;eggs in captivity and will soon be ready to sell farmed octopuses.&nbsp;<strong>20&nbsp;</strong>_____ The main markets for the animals – the US, Europe, Japan and China – are areas where people are already well-fed. Octopuses are delicacies and do not deserve to be the focus of intensive farming. Peter Godfrey-Smith of Sydney University commented: ‘Why should research money be used to support a project that will inevitably have so many welfare and environmental problems once it is scaled up?’&nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>Octopus farming</strong><br><br>
Plans to create octopus farms in coastal waters round the world have been denounced by an international group of researchers. They say the move is ethically inexcusable and environmentally dangerous, and have called on private companies, academic institutions and governments to block funding for these ventures.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The researchers say that farming octopuses would require the catching of vast amounts of fish and shellfish to feed them, putting further pressure on the planet’s already threatened marine livestock. The group, led by Professor Jennifer Jacquet of New York University, argues that octopuses are highly developed and curious creatures.&nbsp;<strong>15</strong>_____ ‘We can see no reason why, in the 21st century, a sophisticated, complex animal should become the source of mass-produced food,’ says Jacquet. “Octopuses eat fish and shellfish, and supplying enough to feed large numbers of them puts further pressure on the food chain. It is unsustainable. Octopus factory farming is ethically and ecologically unjustified.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There are about 300 species of octopus and many behave in surprisingly sophisticated ways. In tests, some have been shown to use tools, for example.&nbsp;<strong>16</strong>_____ Once octopuses have solved a problem, they retain a long-term memory of the solution,’ the researchers state in a paper in Issues in Science and Technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Octopuses are also a culinary delicacy. About 350,000 tonnes are caught every year and served in restaurants from Spain to Chile and from Mexico to Australia. However, numbers of octopus caught are reported to be in decline.&nbsp;<strong>17</strong>_____ Wild-caught males and females are allowed to mate. Then their fertile eggs hatch out in containers and are grown into adults to be sold to markets round the globe.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>18</strong>_____ This has made feeding them difficult and expensive. Keeping young animals in water whose salinity and temperature are carefully controlled has also proved tricky. These drawbacks have prevented octopus farms from making progress – until recently. Aquaculturists have learned that the young of some octopus species are less fussy about the food they eat and have used these species as basic stock for breeding.&nbsp;<strong>19</strong>_____ As a result, companies in Australia, Japan and Mexico have said they are hatching octopus&nbsp;eggs in captivity and will soon be ready to sell farmed octopuses.&nbsp;<strong>20</strong>_____ The main markets for the animals – the US, Europe, Japan and China – are areas where people are already well-fed. Octopuses are delicacies and do not deserve to be the focus of intensive farming. Peter Godfrey-Smith of Sydney University commented: ‘Why should research money be used to support a project that will inevitably have so many welfare and environmental problems once it is scaled up?’&nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>Octopus farming</strong><br><br>
Plans to create octopus farms in coastal waters round the world have been denounced by an international group of researchers. They say the move is ethically inexcusable and environmentally dangerous, and have called on private companies, academic institutions and governments to block funding for these ventures.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The researchers say that farming octopuses would require the catching of vast amounts of fish and shellfish to feed them, putting further pressure on the planet’s already threatened marine livestock. The group, led by Professor Jennifer Jacquet of New York University, argues that octopuses are highly developed and curious creatures.&nbsp;<strong>15&nbsp;</strong>_____ ‘We can see no reason why, in the 21st century, a sophisticated, complex animal should become the source of mass-produced food,’ says Jacquet. “Octopuses eat fish and shellfish, and supplying enough to feed large numbers of them puts further pressure on the food chain. It is unsustainable. Octopus factory farming is ethically and ecologically unjustified.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There are about 300 species of octopus and many behave in surprisingly sophisticated ways. In tests, some have been shown to use tools, for example.&nbsp;<strong>16&nbsp;</strong>_____ Once octopuses have solved a problem, they retain a long-term memory of the solution,’ the researchers state in a paper in Issues in Science and Technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Octopuses are also a culinary delicacy. About 350,000 tonnes are caught every year and served in restaurants from Spain to Chile and from Mexico to Australia. However, numbers of octopus caught are reported to be in decline.&nbsp;<strong>17&nbsp;</strong>_____ Wild-caught males and females are allowed to mate. Then their fertile eggs hatch out in containers and are grown into adults to be sold to markets round the globe.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>18&nbsp;</strong>_____ This has made feeding them difficult and expensive. Keeping young animals in water whose salinity and temperature are carefully controlled has also proved tricky. These drawbacks have prevented octopus farms from making progress – until recently. Aquaculturists have learned that the young of some octopus species are less fussy about the food they eat and have used these species as basic stock for breeding.&nbsp;<strong>19&nbsp;</strong>_____ As a result, companies in Australia, Japan and Mexico have said they are hatching octopus&nbsp;eggs in captivity and will soon be ready to sell farmed octopuses.&nbsp;<strong>20&nbsp;</strong>_____ The main markets for the animals – the US, Europe, Japan and China – are areas where people are already well-fed. Octopuses are delicacies and do not deserve to be the focus of intensive farming. Peter Godfrey-Smith of Sydney University commented: ‘Why should research money be used to support a project that will inevitably have so many welfare and environmental problems once it is scaled up?’&nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>Octopus farming</strong><br><br>
Plans to create octopus farms in coastal waters round the world have been denounced by an international group of researchers. They say the move is ethically inexcusable and environmentally dangerous, and have called on private companies, academic institutions and governments to block funding for these ventures.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The researchers say that farming octopuses would require the catching of vast amounts of fish and shellfish to feed them, putting further pressure on the planet’s already threatened marine livestock. The group, led by Professor Jennifer Jacquet of New York University, argues that octopuses are highly developed and curious creatures.&nbsp;<strong>15</strong>&nbsp;_____ ‘We can see no reason why, in the 21st century, a sophisticated, complex animal should become the source of mass-produced food,’ says Jacquet. “Octopuses eat fish and shellfish, and supplying enough to feed large numbers of them puts further pressure on the food chain. It is unsustainable. Octopus factory farming is ethically and ecologically unjustified.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There are about 300 species of octopus and many behave in surprisingly sophisticated ways. In tests, some have been shown to use tools, for example.&nbsp;<strong>16</strong>&nbsp;_____ Once octopuses have solved a problem, they retain a long-term memory of the solution,’ the researchers state in a paper in Issues in Science and Technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Octopuses are also a culinary delicacy. About 350,000 tonnes are caught every year and served in restaurants from Spain to Chile and from Mexico to Australia. However, numbers of octopus caught are reported to be in decline.&nbsp;<strong>17</strong>&nbsp;_____ Wild-caught males and females are allowed to mate. Then their fertile eggs hatch out in containers and are grown into adults to be sold to markets round the globe.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>18</strong>&nbsp;_____ This has made feeding them difficult and expensive. Keeping young animals in water whose salinity and temperature are carefully controlled has also proved tricky. These drawbacks have prevented octopus farms from making progress – until recently. Aquaculturists have learned that the young of some octopus species are less fussy about the food they eat and have used these species as basic stock for breeding.&nbsp;<strong>19</strong>&nbsp;_____ As a result, companies in Australia, Japan and Mexico have said they are hatching octopus&nbsp;eggs in captivity and will soon be ready to sell farmed octopuses.&nbsp;<strong>20</strong>&nbsp;_____ The main markets for the animals – the US, Europe, Japan and China – are areas where people are already well-fed. Octopuses are delicacies and do not deserve to be the focus of intensive farming. Peter Godfrey-Smith of Sydney University commented: ‘Why should research money be used to support a project that will inevitably have so many welfare and environmental problems once it is scaled up?’&nbsp;</p>
