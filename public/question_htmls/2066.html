        <p><strong>The Bank Deposit</strong><br><em>My notes about what I am reading</em><br><br><em><strong>1 </strong></em>Jennifer watched as her mother carefully counted the money from the cash register and filled out the morning’s bank deposit slip. It was the first week of summer vacation, and Jennifer was finally getting the chance to work a real job. Mom and Dad had agreed to let her work part-time at the family diner to earn enough money to buy the new computer she wanted. Jennifer was in charge of cleaning the tables after people finished eating. She worked hard and tried to do a good job to show her parents that they had made a good decision. She wished she could do more than just clean up, but her mother said she was too young to take orders or cook meals.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> “It must be taking your father longer than he expected,” Mom said, glancing at the door. Normally Mom would walk across the street to the bank and deposit the money right away. But Dad had taken their car in for some repair work that morning and wasn’t back yet. “I guess I’ll just have to take this money to the bank later,” Mom said, walking into her office. She locked the money in a small lockbox in the desk drawer and put the key into her apron pocket.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> “I can take it for you, Mom,” Jennifer said, trying to be as helpful as possible.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> “That’s O.K.,” Mom said. “I need you to do just what you’re doing.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> Jennifer frowned. She knew that her mother didn’t trust her with the money. “The bank’s right across the street,” she muttered.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “Oh, no!” Mom said after refilling a customer’s coffee cup. “We’re almost out of coffee, and the supply truck won’t get here for another hour.” She looked at her watch nervously. “Jennifer,” she said, reaching into her apron pocket and taking out some folded money, “will you go across the street to Fred’s Market and buy a can of coffee?”</p>
        <p><em><strong>7 </strong></em>“Sure,” Jennifer said, taking the money from her mother. She went back to the office to grab her jacket while Mom <span class="txt-underline"><strong>resumed</strong></span> waiting on customers &nbsp;saw the key to the lockbox tucked between the folded dollar bills. Jennifer remembered the bank deposit in the desk drawer. She knew it was ready to take to the bank. “I’ll surprise Mom and take the deposit to the bank on my way to the market,” she thought. “Then she’ll see that I can be trusted.” She took the key, unlocked the lockbox, and took out the bank bag. “I’ll be right back,” she said as she headed out the door.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “O.K. Thanks, Jennifer,” Mom called after her.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> Jennifer walked across the street to the bank. “I should put the money in the bank first,” she said to herself. But when she opened the bank door, she saw a long line. “Maybe there won’t be as many people after I go to the market,” she thought. She walked next door to the market and found the coffee aisle. As she grabbed a can of coffee, she set the bank bag down and reached into her pocket to get the money for her purchase. Jennifer counted the dollar bills out as she walked toward the front of the store. Then she went up to the cashier and paid for the coffee.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> “Thanks, honey,” Mom said when Jennifer walked into the diner. “Why don’t you open the can and make a pot of coffee? Do you remember how?”</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> “Sure!” Jennifer said. She could see that Mom was busy, and it felt good to be helping out. Just as she was starting the pot of coffee, her father returned.</p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> “Hi, Dad,” Jennifer said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> “Frank,” Mom said as Dad walked into the diner, “can you take the money to the bank before you get started? It’s in the desk drawer.” Jennifer felt her stomach drop. The bank deposit! Her heart raced. What had she done with the bank deposit?</p>
        <p><em><strong>14</strong></em> “I don’t see it,” Dad called a moment later from the office.</p>
        <p><em><strong>15</strong></em> “Well, I put it right there,” Mom said, walking back to the office. After frantically searching the office, she sighed. “Somebody must have sneaked in here and taken it while I was busy with customers and Jennifer was at the store.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>16</strong></em> “We should call the police,” Dad said.</p>
        <p><strong><em>17</em></strong> “Mom, Dad,” Jennifer said hesitantly as she approached them, “I lost the bank deposit.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>18</strong></em> “What?” Mom asked, puzzled. Jennifer explained as quickly as she could. “You must have left it at the market,” Mom said. “Let’s go look. Maybe someone turned it in.” Jennifer and Mom dashed across the street to Fred’s Market and asked the manager if anyone had turned in a bank bag. No one had. Then they retraced Jennifer’s steps through the store. Finally Jennifer spotted the bank bag lying on the floor, under the edge of a shelf.</p>
        <p><em><strong>19</strong></em> “Mom,” Jennifer said, “I found it!”</p>
        <p><em><strong>20</strong></em> Mom opened the bag nervously. “Well,” she said, frowning, “the money is gone.” Jennifer hung her head. “But the checks and the credit card receipts are still here, so it’s not a total loss.” Jennifer felt terrible. She went with her mother to the bank to deposit the checks. Then they went back to the diner and explained everything to her father.</p>
        <p><em><strong>21</strong></em> “I just wanted to show you and Mom that I could do more than wipe tables,” Jennifer finished.</p>
        <p><em><strong>22</strong></em> “Jennifer,” Dad said, “I know you were trying to help, but that doesn’t excuse what you’ve done.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>23</strong></em> “I guess you don’t want me to work here anymore,” she said softly, her face burning red. Jennifer felt sick to her stomach. She couldn’t even look at her parents.</p>
        <p><em><strong>24</strong></em> “On the contrary,” Dad said. “You need to work to reimburse the diner for the money you lost. And after you’ve paid your debt, you might still be able to save enough for that new computer.”</p>

        <p><strong>The Bank Deposit</strong><br><em>My notes about what I am reading</em><br><br><em><strong>1 </strong></em>Jennifer watched as her mother carefully counted the money from the cash register and filled out the morning’s bank deposit slip. It was the first week of summer vacation, and Jennifer was finally getting the chance to work a real job. Mom and Dad had agreed to let her work part-time at the family diner to earn enough money to buy the new computer she wanted. Jennifer was in charge of cleaning the tables after people finished eating. She worked hard and tried to do a good job to show her parents that they had made a good decision. She wished she could do more than just clean up, but her mother said she was too young to take orders or cook meals.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> “It must be taking your father longer than he expected,” Mom said, glancing at the door. Normally Mom would walk across the street to the bank and deposit the money right away. But Dad had taken their car in for some repair work that morning and wasn’t back yet. “I guess I’ll just have to take this money to the bank later,” Mom said, walking into her office. She locked the money in a small lockbox in the desk drawer and put the key into her apron pocket.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> “I can take it for you, Mom,” Jennifer said, trying to be as helpful as possible.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> “That’s O.K.,” Mom said. “I need you to do just what you’re doing.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> Jennifer frowned. She knew that her mother didn’t trust her with the money. “The bank’s right across the street,” she muttered.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “Oh, no!” Mom said after refilling a customer’s coffee cup. “We’re almost out of coffee, and the supply truck won’t get here for another hour.” She looked at her watch nervously. “Jennifer,” she said, reaching into her apron pocket and taking out some folded money, “will you go across the street to Fred’s Market and buy a can of coffee?”</p>
        <p><em><strong>7 </strong></em>“Sure,” Jennifer said, taking the money from her mother. She went back to the office to grab her jacket while Mom <span class="txt-underline"><strong>resumed</strong></span> waiting on customers &nbsp;saw the key to the lockbox tucked between the folded dollar bills. Jennifer remembered the bank deposit in the desk drawer. She knew it was ready to take to the bank. “I’ll surprise Mom and take the deposit to the bank on my way to the market,” she thought. “Then she’ll see that I can be trusted.” She took the key, unlocked the lockbox, and took out the bank bag. “I’ll be right back,” she said as she headed out the door.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “O.K. Thanks, Jennifer,” Mom called after her.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> Jennifer walked across the street to the bank. “I should put the money in the bank first,” she said to herself. But when she opened the bank door, she saw a long line. “Maybe there won’t be as many people after I go to the market,” she thought. She walked next door to the market and found the coffee aisle. As she grabbed a can of coffee, she set the bank bag down and reached into her pocket to get the money for her purchase. Jennifer counted the dollar bills out as she walked toward the front of the store. Then she went up to the cashier and paid for the coffee.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> “Thanks, honey,” Mom said when Jennifer walked into the diner. “Why don’t you open the can and make a pot of coffee? Do you remember how?”</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> “Sure!” Jennifer said. She could see that Mom was busy, and it felt good to be helping out. Just as she was starting the pot of coffee, her father returned.</p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> “Hi, Dad,” Jennifer said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> “Frank,” Mom said as Dad walked into the diner, “can you take the money to the bank before you get started? It’s in the desk drawer.” Jennifer felt her stomach drop. The bank deposit! Her heart raced. What had she done with the bank deposit?</p>
        <p><em><strong>14</strong></em> “I don’t see it,” Dad called a moment later from the office.</p>
        <p><em><strong>15</strong></em> “Well, I put it right there,” Mom said, walking back to the office. After frantically searching the office, she sighed. “Somebody must have sneaked in here and taken it while I was busy with customers and Jennifer was at the store.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>16</strong></em> “We should call the police,” Dad said.</p>
        <p><strong><em>17</em></strong> “Mom, Dad,” Jennifer said hesitantly as she approached them, “I lost the bank deposit.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>18</strong></em> “What?” Mom asked, puzzled. Jennifer explained as quickly as she could. “You must have left it at the market,” Mom said. “Let’s go look. Maybe someone turned it in.” Jennifer and Mom dashed across the street to Fred’s Market and asked the manager if anyone had turned in a bank bag. No one had. Then they retraced Jennifer’s steps through the store. Finally Jennifer spotted the bank bag lying on the floor, under the edge of a shelf.</p>
        <p><em><strong>19</strong></em> “Mom,” Jennifer said, “I found it!”</p>
        <p><em><strong>20</strong></em> Mom opened the bag nervously. “Well,” she said, frowning, “the money is gone.” Jennifer hung her head. “But the checks and the credit card receipts are still here, so it’s not a total loss.” Jennifer felt terrible.

        <p><em><strong>24</strong></em> “On the contrary,” Dad said. “You need to work to reimburse the diner for the money you lost. And after you’ve paid your debt, you might still be able to save enough for that new computer.”</p>

        <p><strong>The Bank Deposit</strong><br><em>My notes about what I am reading</em><br><br><em><strong>1 </strong></em>Jennifer watched as her mother carefully counted the money from the cash register and filled out the morning’s bank deposit slip. It was the first week of summer vacation, and Jennifer was finally getting the chance to work a real job. Mom and Dad had agreed to let her work part-time at the family diner to earn enough money to buy the new computer she wanted. Jennifer was in charge of cleaning the tables after people finished eating. She worked hard and tried to do a good job to show her parents that they had made a good decision. She wished she could do more than just clean up, but her mother said she was too young to take orders or cook meals.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> “It must be taking your father longer than he expected,” Mom said, glancing at the door. Normally Mom would walk across the street to the bank and deposit the money right away. But Dad had taken their car in for some repair work that morning and wasn’t back yet. “I guess I’ll just have to take this money to the bank later,” Mom said, walking into her office. She locked the money in a small lockbox in the desk drawer and put the key into her apron pocket.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> “I can take it for you, Mom,” Jennifer said, trying to be as helpful as possible.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> “That’s O.K.,” Mom said. “I need you to do just what you’re doing.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> Jennifer frowned. She knew that her mother didn’t trust her with the money. “The bank’s right across the street,” she muttered.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “Oh, no!” Mom said after refilling a customer’s coffee cup. “We’re almost out of coffee, and the supply truck won’t get here for another hour.” She looked at her watch nervously. “Jennifer,” she said, reaching into her apron pocket and taking out some folded money, “will you go across the street to Fred’s Market and buy a can of coffee?”</p>
        <p><em><strong>7 </strong></em>“Sure,” Jennifer said, taking the money from her mother. She went back to the office to grab her jacket while Mom <span class="txt-underline"><strong>resumed</strong></span> waiting on customers &nbsp;saw the key to the lockbox tucked between the folded dollar bills. Jennifer remembered the bank deposit in the desk drawer. She knew it was ready to take to the bank. “I’ll surprise Mom and take the deposit to the bank on my way to the market,” she thought. “Then she’ll see that I can be trusted.” She took the key, unlocked the lockbox, and took out the bank bag. “I’ll be right back,” she said as she headed out the door.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “O.K. Thanks, Jennifer,” Mom called after her.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> Jennifer walked across the street to the bank. “I should put the money in the bank first,” she said to herself. But when she opened the bank door, she saw a long line. “Maybe there won’t be as many people after I go to the market,” she thought. She walked next door to the market and found the coffee aisle. As she grabbed a can of coffee, she set the bank bag down and reached into her pocket to get the money for her purchase. Jennifer counted the dollar bills out as she walked toward the front of the store. Then she went up to the cashier and paid for the coffee.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> “Thanks, honey,” Mom said when Jennifer walked into the diner. “Why don’t you open the can and make a pot of coffee? Do you remember how?”</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> “Sure!” Jennifer said. She could see that Mom was busy, and it felt good to be helping out. Just as she was starting the pot of coffee, her father returned.</p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> “Hi, Dad,” Jennifer said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> “Frank,” Mom said as Dad walked into the diner, “can you take the money to the bank before you get started? It’s in the desk drawer.” Jennifer felt her stomach drop. The bank deposit! Her heart raced. What had she done with the bank deposit?</p>
        <p><em><strong>14</strong></em> “I don’t see it,” Dad called a moment later from the office.</p>
        <p><em><strong>15</strong></em> “Well, I put it right there,” Mom said, walking back to the office. After frantically searching the office, she sighed. “Somebody must have sneaked in here and taken it while I was busy with customers and Jennifer was at the store.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>16</strong></em> “We should call the police,” Dad said.</p>
        <p><strong><em>17</em></strong> “Mom, Dad,” Jennifer said hesitantly as she approached them, “I lost the bank deposit.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>18</strong></em> “What?” Mom asked, puzzled. Jennifer explained as quickly as she could. “You must have left it at the market,” Mom said. “Let’s go look. Maybe someone turned it in.” Jennifer and Mom dashed across the street to Fred’s Market and asked the manager if anyone had turned in a bank bag. No one had. Then they retraced Jennifer’s steps through the store. Finally Jennifer spotted the bank bag lying on the floor, under the edge of a shelf.</p>
        <p><em><strong>19</strong></em> “Mom,” Jennifer said, “I found it!”</p>
        <p><em><strong>20</strong></em> Mom opened the bag nervously. “Well,” she said, frowning, “the money is gone.” Jennifer hung her head. “But the checks and the credit card receipts are still here, so it’s not a total loss.” Jennifer felt terrible.

        <p><em><strong>23</strong></em> “I guess you don’t want me to work here anymore,” she said softly, her face burning red. Jennifer felt sick to her stomach. She couldn’t even look at her parents.</p>
        <p><em><strong>24</strong></em> “On the contrary,” Dad said. “You need to work to reimburse the diner for the money you lost. And after you’ve paid your debt, you might still be able to save enough for that new computer.”</p>

        <p><strong>The Bank Deposit</strong><br><em>My notes about what I am reading</em><br><br><em><strong>1 </strong></em>Jennifer watched as her mother carefully counted the money from the cash register and filled out the morning’s bank deposit slip. It was the first week of summer vacation, and Jennifer was finally getting the chance to work a real job. Mom and Dad had agreed to let her work part-time at the family diner to earn enough money to buy the new computer she wanted. Jennifer was in charge of cleaning the tables after people finished eating. She worked hard and tried to do a good job to show her parents that they had made a good decision. She wished she could do more than just clean up, but her mother said she was too young to take orders or cook meals.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> “It must be taking your father longer than he expected,” Mom said, glancing at the door. Normally Mom would walk across the street to the bank and deposit the money right away. But Dad had taken their car in for some repair work that morning and wasn’t back yet. “I guess I’ll just have to take this money to the bank later,” Mom said, walking into her office. She locked the money in a small lockbox in the desk drawer and put the key into her apron pocket.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> “I can take it for you, Mom,” Jennifer said, trying to be as helpful as possible.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> “That’s O.K.,” Mom said. “I need you to do just what you’re doing.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> Jennifer frowned. She knew that her mother didn’t trust her with the money. “The bank’s right across the street,” she muttered.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “Oh, no!” Mom said after refilling a customer’s coffee cup. “We’re almost out of coffee, and the supply truck won’t get here for another hour.” She looked at her watch nervously. “Jennifer,” she said, reaching into her apron pocket and taking out some folded money, “will you go across the street to Fred’s Market and buy a can of coffee?”</p>
        <p><em><strong>7 </strong></em>“Sure,” Jennifer said, taking the money from her mother. She went back to the office to grab her jacket while Mom <span class="txt-underline"><strong>resumed</strong></span> waiting on customers &nbsp;saw the key to the lockbox tucked between the folded dollar bills. Jennifer remembered the bank deposit in the desk drawer. She knew it was ready to take to the bank. “I’ll surprise Mom and take the deposit to the bank on my way to the market,” she thought. “Then she’ll see that I can be trusted.” She took the key, unlocked the lockbox, and took out the bank bag. “I’ll be right back,” she said as she headed out the door.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “O.K. Thanks, Jennifer,” Mom called after her.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> Jennifer walked across the street to the bank. “I should put the money in the bank first,” she said to herself. But when she opened the bank door, she saw a long line. “Maybe there won’t be as many people after I go to the market,” she thought. She walked next door to the market and found the coffee aisle. As she grabbed a can of coffee, she set the bank bag down and reached into her pocket to get the money for her purchase. Jennifer counted the dollar bills out as she walked toward the front of the store. Then she went up to the cashier and paid for the coffee.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> “Thanks, honey,” Mom said when Jennifer walked into the diner. “Why don’t you open the can and make a pot of coffee? Do you remember how?”</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> “Sure!” Jennifer said. She could see that Mom was busy, and it felt good to be helping out. Just as she was starting the pot of coffee, her father returned.</p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> “Hi, Dad,” Jennifer said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> “Frank,” Mom said as Dad walked into the diner, “can you take the money to the bank before you get started? It’s in the desk drawer.” Jennifer felt her stomach drop. The bank deposit! Her heart raced. What had she done with the bank deposit?</p>
        <p><em><strong>14</strong></em> “I don’t see it,” Dad called a moment later from the office.</p>
        <p><em><strong>15</strong></em> “Well, I put it right there,” Mom said, walking back to the office. After frantically searching the office, she sighed. “Somebody must have sneaked in here and taken it while I was busy with customers and Jennifer was at the store.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>16</strong></em> “We should call the police,” Dad said.</p>
        <p><strong><em>17</em></strong> “Mom, Dad,” Jennifer said hesitantly as she approached them, “I lost the bank deposit.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>18</strong></em> “What?” Mom asked, puzzled. Jennifer explained as quickly as she could. “You must have left it at the market,” Mom said. “Let’s go look. Maybe someone turned it in.” Jennifer and Mom dashed across the street to Fred’s Market and asked the manager if anyone had turned in a bank bag. No one had. Then they retraced Jennifer’s steps through the store. Finally Jennifer spotted the bank bag lying on the floor, under the edge of a shelf.</p>
        <p><em><strong>19</strong></em> “Mom,” Jennifer said, “I found it!”</p>
        <p><em><strong>20</strong></em> Mom opened the bag nervously. “Well,” she said, frowning, “the money is gone.” Jennifer hung her head. “But the checks and the credit card receipts are still here, so it’s not a total loss.” Jennifer felt terrible. She went with her mother to the bank to deposit the checks. Then they went back to the diner and explained everything to her father.</p>
        <p><em><strong>21</strong></em> “I just wanted to show you and Mom that I could do more than wipe tables,” Jennifer finished.</p>
        <p><em><strong>22</strong></em> “Jennifer,” Dad said, “I know you were trying to help, but that doesn’t excuse what you’ve done.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>23</strong></em> “I guess you don’t want me to work here anymore,” she said softly, her face burning red. Jennifer felt sick to her stomach. She couldn’t even look at her parents.</p>
        <p><em><strong>24</strong></em> “On the contrary,” Dad said. “You need to work to reimburse the diner for the money you lost. And after you’ve paid your debt, you might still be able to save enough for that new computer.”</p>

          <strong>The Smithsonian Institution—</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How It Started</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Troy Mason</em><br><br><em><strong>1</strong></em> There is still mystery surrounding how the Smithsonian Institution was founded. In his will James Smithson gave more than $500,000 to the United States. He wanted the government to establish an institution to help increase and spread knowledge. Congress accepted his gift and in 1846 created the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. No one is really sure why Mr. Smithson gave this money to our country. He wasn’t a U.S. citizen. In fact, Smithson was born in France, grew up in England, and was educated there at Oxford University. He never even set foot in the United States.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2 </strong></em>The Smithsonian Institution had a humble beginning. It started in a large stone building called the Castle. At first the Castle was home to a variety of objects from the areas of art and natural history. The Castle also had a chemistry laboratory and a library.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> Since 1846 the Smithsonian has grown into a multibuilding organization. It now includes a zoo and 16 museums. The National Air and Space Museum, which opened in 1976, is one of the Smithsonian’s most popular museums.</p>

</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> The National Air and Space Museum is dedicated to the history of flying. The museum has more than 20 galleries, a theater, and a planetarium. Inside the museum are many famous aircraft, &nbsp;including the <strong>Wright 1903 Flyer</strong>, also known as the <strong>Kitty Hawk</strong>. On December 17, 1903, Wilbur and Orville Wright made the world’s first flights in the <strong>Kitty Hawk</strong>. Also displayed is the <strong>Spirit of St. Louis</strong>, the plane in which Charles Lindbergh made the first solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> The museum holds some of the first U.S. spacecraft. These include John Glenn’s <strong>Mercury Friendship 7</strong> capsule, which was the first U.S. spacecraft to orbit Earth. Also on display is the <strong>Apollo 11</strong> command module <strong>Columbia</strong>. In 1969 the <strong>Columbia’s</strong> lunar module <strong>Eagle</strong> was the first spacecraft to land on the moon.</p>

          <strong>The Smithsonian Institution—</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How It Started</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Troy Mason</em><br><br><em><strong>1</strong></em> There is still mystery surrounding how the Smithsonian Institution was founded. In his will James Smithson gave more than $500,000 to the United States. He wanted the government to establish an institution to help increase and spread knowledge. Congress accepted his gift and in 1846 created the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. No one is really sure why Mr. Smithson gave this money to our country. He wasn’t a U.S. citizen. In fact, Smithson was born in France, grew up in England, and was educated there at Oxford University. He never even set foot in the United States.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2 </strong></em>The Smithsonian Institution had a humble beginning. It started in a large stone building called the Castle. At first the Castle was home to a variety of objects from the areas of art and natural history. The Castle also had a chemistry laboratory and a library.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> Since 1846 the Smithsonian has grown into a multibuilding organization. It now includes a zoo and 16 museums. The National Air and Space Museum, which opened in 1976, is one of the Smithsonian’s most popular museums.</p>

</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> The National Air and Space Museum is dedicated to the history of flying. The museum has more than 20 galleries, a theater, and a planetarium. Inside the museum are many famous aircraft, &nbsp;including the <strong>Wright 1903 Flyer</strong>, also known as the <strong>Kitty Hawk</strong>. On December 17, 1903, Wilbur and Orville Wright made the world’s first flights in the <strong>Kitty Hawk</strong>. Also displayed is the <strong>Spirit of St. Louis</strong>, the plane in which Charles Lindbergh made the first solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> The museum holds some of the first U.S. spacecraft. These include John Glenn’s <strong>Mercury Friendship 7</strong> capsule, which was the first U.S. spacecraft to orbit Earth. Also on display is the <strong>Apollo 11</strong> command module <strong>Columbia</strong>. In 1969 the <strong>Columbia’s</strong> lunar module <strong>Eagle</strong> was the first spacecraft to land on the moon.</p>

          <em>On April 23 the Clear Springs sixth-grade class will visit the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum. This issue of the Clear Springs Cougar will give readers information about the museum and its history. The next issue will describe the students’ visit.</em>

          <strong>The Smithsonian Institution—</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How It Started</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Troy Mason</em><br><br><em><strong>1</strong></em> There is still mystery surrounding how the Smithsonian Institution was founded. In his will James Smithson gave more than $500,000 to the United States. He wanted the government to establish an institution to help increase and spread knowledge. Congress accepted his gift and in 1846 created the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. No one is really sure why Mr. Smithson gave this money to our country. He wasn’t a U.S. citizen. In fact, Smithson was born in France, grew up in England, and was educated there at Oxford University. He never even set foot in the United States.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2 </strong></em>The Smithsonian Institution had a humble beginning. It started in a large stone building called the Castle. At first the Castle was home to a variety of objects from the areas of art and natural history. The Castle also had a chemistry laboratory and a library.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> Since 1846 the Smithsonian has grown into a multibuilding organization. It now includes a zoo and 16 museums. The National Air and Space Museum, which opened in 1976, is one of the Smithsonian’s most popular museums.</p>

</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> The National Air and Space Museum is dedicated to the history of flying. The museum has more than 20 galleries, a theater, and a planetarium. Inside the museum are many famous aircraft, &nbsp;including the <strong>Wright 1903 Flyer</strong>, also known as the <strong>Kitty Hawk</strong>. On December 17, 1903, Wilbur and Orville Wright made the world’s first flights in the <strong>Kitty Hawk</strong>. Also displayed is the <strong>Spirit of St. Louis</strong>, the plane in which Charles Lindbergh made the first solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> The museum holds some of the first U.S. spacecraft. These include John Glenn’s <strong>Mercury Friendship 7</strong> capsule, which was the first U.S. spacecraft to orbit Earth. Also on display is the <strong>Apollo 11</strong> command module <strong>Columbia</strong>. In 1969 the <strong>Columbia’s</strong> lunar module <strong>Eagle</strong> was the first spacecraft to land on the moon.</p>

            <strong>The Wright Brothers’ <em>Kitty Hawk</em></strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> The <strong>Kitty Hawk</strong>, officially called the <strong>Wright 1903 Flyer</strong>, was the first famous aircraft that we saw. Standing under the long, narrow wings, we found it hard to imagine flying in what looks like a paper airplane. It is incredible to think that 100 years ago, two brothers who were bicycle mechanics made a plane of wood and fabric that flew for the first time. Orville Wright piloted the plane, which flew for 120 feet and remained in the air for 12 seconds. The brothers made three more flights that day. It was really inspiring for all of us to hear about two young men who followed their dream and changed the world with their invention.</p>

          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>Spaceflight</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> Another crowd pleaser was the gallery that houses the first U.S. spacecraft. John Glenn’s <strong>Mercury Friendship 7</strong> capsule is by far the most fascinating space exhibit in the museum. On Glenn’s 1962 flight, he alone circled Earth three times in less than five hours. Looking at the small cylinder that was the first module, we found it hard to believe that it weighs almost 3,000 pounds. The black marks on the module from the heat of reentering Earth’s atmosphere made the dangers of space travel seem more real to us.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> The next display we saw was the <strong>Apollo 11 </strong>mission command module <strong>Columbia</strong>. Astronauts Neil Armstrong and Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin, Jr., were the first men to land on the moon. On July 20, 1969, they touched down on a rocky plain of the moon in the lunar module <strong>Eagle</strong>. They explored the moon on foot and returned to the module with surface material. We were actually able to look at these moon rocks. It was hard to believe that these rocks were once part of the moon we see almost every night. Many of us wondered aloud whether there would be space travel in our future. I wondered whether I would one day touch the moon.</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>Other Sights</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> The Lockheed Martin IMAX Theater, with its five-story-high movie screen, was also a very popular part of the museum.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>The flight film that we watched made us feel as if we were actually on board a highspeed jet airplane. At one point during the movie, several students swayed back and forth as the plane turned spirals in the sky. One student compared it to riding a roller coaster.</p>

            <strong>A Trip Worth Taking</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> The National Air and Space Museum is definitely a place worth visiting. Touring the museum was an incredible experience for us. A big THANK YOU to James Smithson, who made this museum available to everyone!</p>

            <strong>The Wright Brothers’ <em>Kitty Hawk</em></strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> The <strong>Kitty Hawk</strong>, officially called the <strong>Wright 1903 Flyer</strong>, was the first famous aircraft that we saw. Standing under the long, narrow wings, we found it hard to imagine flying in what looks like a paper airplane. It is incredible to think that 100 years ago, two brothers who were bicycle mechanics made a plane of wood and fabric that flew for the first time. Orville Wright piloted the plane, which flew for 120 feet and remained in the air for 12 seconds. The brothers made three more flights that day. It was really inspiring for all of us to hear about two young men who followed their dream and changed the world with their invention.</p>

        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> Another crowd pleaser was the gallery that houses the first U.S. spacecraft. John Glenn’s <strong>Mercury Friendship 7</strong> capsule is by far the most fascinating space exhibit in the museum. On Glenn’s 1962 flight, he alone circled Earth three times in less than five hours. Looking at the small cylinder that was the first module, we found it hard to believe that it weighs almost 3,000 pounds. The black marks on the module from the heat of reentering Earth’s atmosphere made the dangers of space travel seem more real to us.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> The next display we saw was the <strong>Apollo 11 </strong>mission command module <strong>Columbia</strong>. Astronauts Neil Armstrong and Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin, Jr., were the first men to land on the moon. On July 20, 1969, they touched down on a rocky plain of the moon in the lunar module <strong>Eagle</strong>. They explored the moon on foot and returned to the module with surface material. We were actually able to look at these moon rocks. It was hard to believe that these rocks were once part of the moon we see almost every night. Many of us wondered aloud whether there would be space travel in our future. I wondered whether I would one day touch the moon.</p>

Standing under the long, narrow wings, we found it hard to imagine flying in what looks like a paper airplane. It is incredible to think that 100 years ago, two brothers who were bicycle mechanics made a plane of wood and fabric that flew for the first time. Orville Wright piloted the plane, which flew for 120 feet and remained in the air for 12 seconds. The brothers made three more flights that day. It was really inspiring for all of us to hear about two young men who followed their dream and changed the world with their invention.</p>

        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> Another crowd pleaser was the gallery that houses the first U.S. spacecraft. John Glenn’s <strong>Mercury Friendship 7</strong> capsule is by far the most fascinating space exhibit in the museum. On Glenn’s 1962 flight, he alone circled Earth three times in less than five hours. Looking at the small cylinder that was the first module, we found it hard to believe that it weighs almost 3,000 pounds. The black marks on the module from the heat of reentering Earth’s atmosphere made the dangers of space travel seem more real to us.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> The next display we saw was the <strong>Apollo 11 </strong>mission command module <strong>Columbia</strong>. Astronauts Neil Armstrong and Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin, Jr., were the first men to land on the moon. On July 20, 1969, they touched down on a rocky plain of the moon in the lunar module <strong>Eagle</strong>. They explored the moon on foot and returned to the module with surface material. We were actually able to look at these moon rocks. It was hard to believe that these rocks were once part of the moon we see almost every night. Many of us wondered aloud whether there would be space travel in our future. I wondered whether I would one day touch the moon.</p>

        <p>The flight film that we watched made us feel as if we were actually on board a highspeed jet airplane. At one point during the movie, several students swayed back and forth as the plane turned spirals in the sky. One student compared it to riding a roller coaster.</p>

          <strong>Sixth Graders Visit the National Air and Space Museum</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Chris Allen</em><br><br><em><strong>1</strong></em> Our English teachers would have been proud! We, the sixth-grade class of Clear Springs Middle School, must have used every synonym for the word awesomethat there is. And awesome is exactly what the National Air and Space Museum is. “Cool” and “neat” were just some of the expressions students used to describe the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>impressive</strong></span> museum tour. It is easy to understand why more than nine million people visit the museum every year. Almost every event in the history of human flight is represented in one of the museum’s many galleries. It was truly a phenomenal experience to reach out and touch the famous airplanes and amazing spaceships that we’ve all heard and read about.</p>

          <em>On April 23 the Clear Springs sixth-grade class will visit the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum. This issue of the Clear Springs Cougar will give readers information about the museum and its history. The next issue will describe the students’ visit.</em>

          <strong>The Smithsonian Institution—How It Started</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Troy Mason</em><br><br><em><strong>1</strong></em>&nbsp;There is still mystery surrounding how the Smithsonian Institution was founded. In his will James Smithson gave more than $500,000 to the United States. He wanted the government to establish an institution to help increase and spread knowledge. Congress accepted his gift and in 1846 created the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. No one is really sure why Mr. Smithson gave this money to our country. He wasn’t a U.S. citizen. In fact, Smithson was born in France, grew up in England, and was educated there at Oxford University. He never even set foot in the United States.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em>&nbsp;The Smithsonian Institution had a humble beginning. It started in a large stone building called the Castle. At first the Castle was home to a variety of objects from the areas of art and natural history. The Castle also had a chemistry laboratory and a library.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em>&nbsp;Since 1846 the Smithsonian has grown into a multibuilding organization. It now includes a zoo and 16 museums. The National Air and Space Museum, which opened in 1976, is one of the Smithsonian’s most popular museums.</p>
        <p>

        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> Our English teachers would have been proud! We, the sixth-grade class of Clear Springs Middle School, must have used every synonym for the word awesomethat there is. And awesome is exactly what the National Air and Space Museum is. “Cool” and “neat” were just some of the expressions students used to describe the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>impressive</strong></span> museum tour. It is easy to understand why more than nine million people visit the museum every year. Almost every event in the history of human flight is represented in one of the museum’s many galleries. It was truly a phenomenal experience to reach out and touch the famous airplanes and amazing spaceships that we’ve all heard and read about.</p>

            <strong>The Wright Brothers’ <em>Kitty Hawk</em></strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> The <strong>Kitty Hawk</strong>, officially called the <strong>Wright 1903 Flyer</strong>, was the first famous aircraft that we saw. Standing under the long, narrow wings, we found it hard to imagine flying in what looks like a paper airplane. It is incredible to think that 100 years ago, two brothers who were bicycle mechanics made a plane of wood and fabric that flew for the first time. Orville Wright piloted the plane, which flew for 120 feet and remained in the air for 12 seconds. The brothers made three more flights that day. It was really inspiring for all of us to hear about two young men who followed their dream and changed the world with their invention.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> Another crowd pleaser was the gallery that houses the first U.S. spacecraft. John Glenn’s <strong>Mercury Friendship 7</strong> capsule is by far the most fascinating space exhibit in the museum. On Glenn’s 1962 flight, he alone circled Earth three times in less than five hours. Looking at the small cylinder that was the first module, we found it hard to believe that it weighs almost 3,000 pounds. The black marks on the module from the heat of reentering Earth’s atmosphere made the dangers of space travel seem more real to us.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> The next display we saw was the <strong>Apollo 11 </strong>mission command module <strong>Columbia</strong>. Astronauts Neil Armstrong and Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin, Jr., were the first men to land on the moon. On July 20, 1969, they touched down on a rocky plain of the moon in the lunar module <strong>Eagle</strong>. They explored the moon on foot and returned to the module with surface material. We were actually able to look at these moon rocks. It was hard to believe that these rocks were once part of the moon we see almost every night. Many of us wondered aloud whether there would be space travel in our future. I wondered whether I would one day touch the moon.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> The Lockheed Martin IMAX Theater, with its five-story-high movie screen, was also a very popular part of the museum.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The flight film that we watched made us feel as if we were actually on board a highspeed jet airplane. At one point during the movie, several students swayed back and forth as the plane turned spirals in the sky. One student compared it to riding a roller coaster.</p>

          <em>On April 23 the Clear Springs sixth-grade class will visit the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum. This issue of the Clear Springs Cougar will give readers information about the museum and its history. The next issue will describe the students’ visit.</em>

          <strong>The Smithsonian Institution—How It Started</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Troy Mason</em><br><br><em><strong>1</strong></em>&nbsp;There is still mystery surrounding how the Smithsonian Institution was founded. In his will James Smithson gave more than $500,000 to the United States. He wanted the government to establish an institution to help increase and spread knowledge. Congress accepted his gift and in 1846 created the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. No one is really sure why Mr. Smithson gave this money to our country. He wasn’t a U.S. citizen. In fact, Smithson was born in France, grew up in England, and was educated there at Oxford University. He never even set foot in the United States.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em>&nbsp;The Smithsonian Institution had a humble beginning. It started in a large stone building called the Castle. At first the Castle was home to a variety of objects from the areas of art and natural history. The Castle also had a chemistry laboratory and a library.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em>&nbsp;Since 1846 the Smithsonian has grown into a multibuilding organization. It now includes a zoo and 16 museums. The National Air and Space Museum, which opened in 1976, is one of the Smithsonian’s most popular museums.</p>

          <em>On April 23 the Clear Springs sixth-grade class will visit the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum. This issue of the Clear Springs Cougar will give readers information about the museum and its history. The next issue will describe the students’ visit.</em>

          <strong>The Smithsonian Institution—How It Started</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Troy Mason</em><br><br><em><strong>1</strong></em>&nbsp;There is still mystery surrounding how the Smithsonian Institution was founded. In his will James Smithson gave more than $500,000 to the United States. He wanted the government to establish an institution to help increase and spread knowledge. Congress accepted his gift and in 1846 created the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. No one is really sure why Mr. Smithson gave this money to our country. He wasn’t a U.S. citizen. In fact, Smithson was born in France, grew up in England, and was educated there at Oxford University. He never even set foot in the United States.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em>&nbsp;The Smithsonian Institution had a humble beginning. It started in a large stone building called the Castle. At first the Castle was home to a variety of objects from the areas of art and natural history. The Castle also had a chemistry laboratory and a library.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em>&nbsp;Since 1846 the Smithsonian has grown into a multibuilding organization. It now includes a zoo and 16 museums. The National Air and Space Museum, which opened in 1976, is one of the Smithsonian’s most popular museums.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em>&nbsp;The National Air and Space Museum is dedicated to the history of flying. The museum has more than 20 galleries, a theater, and a planetarium. Inside the museum are many famous aircraft, &nbsp;including the&nbsp;<strong>Wright 1903 Flyer</strong>, also known as the&nbsp;<strong>Kitty Hawk</strong>. On December 17, 1903, Wilbur and Orville Wright made the world’s first flights in the&nbsp;<strong>Kitty Hawk</strong>. Also displayed is the&nbsp;<strong>Spirit of St. Louis</strong>, the plane in which Charles Lindbergh made the first solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em>&nbsp;The museum holds some of the first U.S. spacecraft. These include John Glenn’s&nbsp;<strong>Mercury Friendship 7</strong>&nbsp;capsule, which was the first U.S. spacecraft to orbit Earth. Also on display is the&nbsp;<strong>Apollo 11&nbsp;</strong>command module&nbsp;<strong>Columbia</strong>. In 1969 the&nbsp;<strong>Columbia’s</strong>&nbsp;lunar module&nbsp;<strong>Eagle</strong>&nbsp;was the first spacecraft to land on the moon.</p>

          <strong>Sixth Graders Visit the National Air and Space Museum</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Chris Allen</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> Our English teachers would have been proud! We, the sixth-grade class of Clear Springs Middle School, must have used every synonym for the word awesomethat there is. And awesome is exactly what the National Air and Space Museum is. “Cool” and “neat” were just some of the expressions students used to describe the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>impressive</strong></span> museum tour. It is easy to understand why more than nine million people visit the museum every year. Almost every event in the history of human flight is represented in one of the museum’s many galleries. It was truly a phenomenal experience to reach out and touch the famous airplanes and amazing spaceships that we’ve all heard and read about.</p>
        <p>

            <strong>The Wright Brothers’ <em>Kitty Hawk</em></strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> The <strong>Kitty Hawk</strong>, officially called the <strong>Wright 1903 Flyer</strong>, was the first famous aircraft that we saw. Standing under the long, narrow wings, we found it hard to imagine flying in what looks like a paper airplane. It is incredible to think that 100 years ago, two brothers who were bicycle mechanics made a plane of wood and fabric that flew for the first time. Orville Wright piloted the plane, which flew for 120 feet and remained in the air for 12 seconds. The brothers made three more flights that day. It was really inspiring for all of us to hear about two young men who followed their dream and changed the world with their invention.</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>Spaceflight</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> Another crowd pleaser was the gallery that houses the first U.S. spacecraft. John Glenn’s <strong>Mercury Friendship 7</strong> capsule is by far the most fascinating space exhibit in the museum. On Glenn’s 1962 flight, he alone circled Earth three times in less than five hours. Looking at the small cylinder that was the first module, we found it hard to believe that it weighs almost 3,000 pounds. The black marks on the module from the heat of reentering Earth’s atmosphere made the dangers of space travel seem more real to us.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> The next display we saw was the <strong>Apollo 11 </strong>mission command module <strong>Columbia</strong>. Astronauts Neil Armstrong and Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin, Jr., were the first men to land on the moon. On July 20, 1969, they touched down on a rocky plain of the moon in the lunar module <strong>Eagle</strong>. They explored the moon on foot and returned to the module with surface material. We were actually able to look at these moon rocks. It was hard to believe that these rocks were once part of the moon we see almost every night. Many of us wondered aloud whether there would be space travel in our future. I wondered whether I would one day touch the moon.</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>Other Sights</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> The Lockheed Martin IMAX Theater, with its five-story-high movie screen, was also a very popular part of the museum.</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="70%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766027060/xk8tiuv602oihmu63htk.png" alt="ASS_Y4_EN_17_3">


        </p>
        <p>The flight film that we watched made us feel as if we were actually on board a highspeed jet airplane. At one point during the movie, several students swayed back and forth as the plane turned spirals in the sky. One student compared it to riding a roller coaster.</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>A Trip Worth Taking</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> The National Air and Space Museum is definitely a place worth visiting. Touring the museum was an incredible experience for us. A big THANK YOU to James Smithson, who made this museum available to everyone!</p>

          <strong>Riding to Win</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>My notes about what I am reading</em><br><br><em><strong>1</strong></em> Tacy waited anxiously for the gate to open and her race to begin. She could feel her horse Stubby restlessly stomping the ground. Tacy tried to pretend it was just like all her practices back at her father’s ranch, but she couldn’t fool herself. The rodeo crowd buzzed in the background, and the air seemed charged with excitement. “I can do this,” Tacy told herself. Tacy looked over at her sister Sheri, who was always calm. Sheri had been through this many times before. Sheri smiled and gave Tacy a thumbs-up sign.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> Then the gate opened, and Stubby charged out toward the first barrel. The big chestnut horse knew what to do without Tacy even guiding him. They had spent many hours practicing, so circling the barrels was automatic for both of them. But now Tacy thought Stubby was going a little too fast. She tugged on the reins and guided him carefully around the first barrel. Stubby seemed to fight her, as if to say, “I can do this. Let me show you.” But Tacy didn’t want to mess up. It was the first of two rides to determine the winner of the Ranger County Rodeo Junior Barrel Racing Championship. Riders had two chances to circle the three barrels with their horse and return to the starting point. The contestant with the fastest combined time would win.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> After Stubby got around the first barrel, Tacy let him gain speed across the arena toward the second barrel. She could feel the powerful horse digging into the ground and picking up speed. Tacy knew they needed to be fast to have a chance of winning, but she also knew that missing a barrel or knocking one over could put her in last place. She didn’t trust her racing skills that much yet. She pulled back on the reins, just a little, to make sure that Stubby was not going too fast. Stubby snorted as they circled the second barrel. Now he shot toward the final barrel at the end of the arena. Tacy slowed him again, leaning into the turn as they rounded the barrel. She urged him forward, and he sped back to the line. Tacy looked for her time: 19.6 seconds. Not bad for the newest rider in the championship. So far that put her in fourth place out of more than twenty riders.</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="100%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766021306/t3cstywfilxfwnrhoccf.png" alt="ASS_Y4_EN_25">


        </p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> Now it was her sister’s second turn. “Ride carefully,” Tacy said as her sister waited at the line.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> “Lynda Adams finished her first race in 18.1,” Sheri reminded her. “I’m not going to beat that by riding carefully.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “But—” Tacy started to protest as the gate opened and Sheri raced out. She was riding a black mare named Beetle. Beetle and Sheri headed full speed toward the first barrel. “Slow down. Slow down,” Tacy whispered. Tacy had watched her sister race before but never this fast. She was sure that Sheri would knock the barrel over. Beetle’s front hooves dug in, and the mare’s hind legs swiveled hard, looking as if they would wind around the barrel. Somehow Sheri and Beetle made it safely around and began racing for the second barrel. Tacy looked at the clock; Sheri had made good time. “Be careful,” she pleaded under her breath, but Sheri and Beetle charged full speed. Again, somehow, Beetle managed to get cleanly around the barrel. Now they were charging for the last barrel. Tacy could see they were making great time. She could hear the roar of the crowd building. “Maybe Sheri can beat Lynda’s time!” Tacy thought. But then Beetle cut around the last barrel too early, knocking it down. The crowd groaned as Sheri and Beetle raced back to the start gate. Their time was 18.0, but a fivesecond penalty was added for knocking one barrel over, bringing their time to 23.0 seconds—last place.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> “Sheri, why weren’t you more careful?” Tacy asked her sister in surprise. “Now you don’t have a chance to win.”</p>
        <p><strong><em>8</em></strong> “I told you, Tacy,” Sheri said. “I didn’t have a chance to win anyway if I rode carefully. So I rode to win.” Tacy walked away slowly. She had another ride to make. She might still be able to finish in the top three. “I’m not like you, Tacy,” Sheri called after her. “I try my best to win, and if I lose, well, I’ll just try again next time.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> Tacy mounted Stubby and got ready for her second ride. Sheri’s words were still in her ears. Lynda Adams was just finishing her second ride. Her horse had slipped a little, and she had finished her second run in 19.8 seconds. Tacy did the math in her head. She needed to finish in 18.0 seconds to beat Lynda. “That’s crazy,” she thought. She had ridden that fast in practice but never in a real rodeo. If Stubby slipped, she wouldn’t finish in the top three. She looked over at Sheri. Her sister smiled and clapped her hands. “Come on, Tacy!” she yelled. “You can do it!”</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> But it was Sheri’s earlier words that echoed through Tacy’s mind as the gate opened: “<em><strong>I’m not like you, Tacy.</strong></em>” Stubby seemed to be charging too hard. She started to pull him back, but something stopped her. Instead, she leaned into the turn and let her horse swing around toward the first barrel. Stubby had never felt so fast. The ground seemed to thunder under them as he tore for the second barrel. In a dizzying whirl, Stubby was around it and streaking toward the third and final turn. Tacy could hear the noise of the crowd rising as they saw that she had a chance. Now Stubby turned hard around the last barrel, his hind legs bumping it as he dug for the finish. “That’s it,” Tacy thought. With a five-second penalty, she would finish near the bottom. But the crowd noise was increasing! The barrel had wobbled but hadn’t fallen. As Stubby flashed across the line, Tacy saw her time: 17.9 seconds! She had done it. She had won! She looked at Sheri, who was jumping up and down. “Way to go, Tacy!” she shouted. “Way to go!”</p>

          <strong>Riding to Win</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>My notes about what I am reading</em><br><br><em><strong>1</strong></em> Tacy waited anxiously for the gate to open and her race to begin. She could feel her horse Stubby restlessly stomping the ground. Tacy tried to pretend it was just like all her practices back at her father’s ranch, but she couldn’t fool herself. The rodeo crowd buzzed in the background, and the air seemed charged with excitement. “I can do this,” Tacy told herself. Tacy looked over at her sister Sheri, who was always calm. Sheri had been through this many times before. Sheri smiled and gave Tacy a thumbs-up sign.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> Then the gate opened, and Stubby charged out toward the first barrel. The big chestnut horse knew what to do without Tacy even guiding him. They had spent many hours practicing, so circling the barrels was automatic for both of them. But now Tacy thought Stubby was going a little too fast. She tugged on the reins and guided him carefully around the first barrel. Stubby seemed to fight her, as if to say, “I can do this. Let me show you.” But Tacy didn’t want to mess up. It was the first of two rides to determine the winner of the Ranger County Rodeo Junior Barrel Racing Championship. Riders had two chances to circle the three barrels with their horse and return to the starting point. The contestant with the fastest combined time would win.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> After Stubby got around the first barrel, Tacy let him gain speed across the arena toward the second barrel. She could feel the powerful horse digging into the ground and picking up speed. Tacy knew they needed to be fast to have a chance of winning, but she also knew that missing a barrel or knocking one over could put her in last place. She didn’t trust her racing skills that much yet. She pulled back on the reins, just a little, to make sure that Stubby was not going too fast. Stubby snorted as they circled the second barrel. Now he shot toward the final barrel at the end of the arena. Tacy slowed him again, leaning into the turn as they rounded the barrel. She urged him forward, and he sped back to the line. Tacy looked for her time: 19.6 seconds. Not bad for the newest rider in the championship. So far that put her in fourth place out of more than twenty riders.</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="100%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766039230/amvwe9a1ck0j9bmsdjbc.png" alt="ASS_Y4_EN_25">


        </p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> Now it was her sister’s second turn. “Ride carefully,” Tacy said as her sister waited at the line.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> “Lynda Adams finished her first race in 18.1,” Sheri reminded her. “I’m not going to beat that by riding carefully.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “But—” Tacy started to protest as the gate opened and Sheri raced out. She was riding a black mare named Beetle. Beetle and Sheri headed full speed toward the first barrel. “Slow down. Slow down,” Tacy whispered. Tacy had watched her sister race before but never this fast. She was sure that Sheri would knock the barrel over. Beetle’s front hooves dug in, and the mare’s hind legs swiveled hard, looking as if they would wind around the barrel. Somehow Sheri and Beetle made it safely around and began racing for the second barrel. Tacy looked at the clock; Sheri had made good time. “Be careful,” she pleaded under her breath, but Sheri and Beetle charged full speed. Again, somehow, Beetle managed to get cleanly around the barrel. Now they were charging for the last barrel. Tacy could see they were making great time. She could hear the roar of the crowd building. “Maybe Sheri can beat Lynda’s time!” Tacy thought. But then Beetle cut around the last barrel too early, knocking it down. The crowd groaned as Sheri and Beetle raced back to the start gate. Their time was 18.0, but a fivesecond penalty was added for knocking one barrel over, bringing their time to 23.0 seconds—last place.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> “Sheri, why weren’t you more careful?” Tacy asked her sister in surprise. “Now you don’t have a chance to win.”</p>
        <p><strong><em>8</em></strong> “I told you, Tacy,” Sheri said. “I didn’t have a chance to win anyway if I rode carefully. So I rode to win.” Tacy walked away slowly. She had another ride to make. She might still be able to finish in the top three. “I’m not like you, Tacy,” Sheri called after her. “I try my best to win, and if I lose, well, I’ll just try again next time.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> Tacy mounted Stubby and got ready for her second ride. Sheri’s words were still in her ears. Lynda Adams was just finishing her second ride. Her horse had slipped a little, and she had finished her second run in 19.8 seconds. Tacy did the math in her head. She needed to finish in 18.0 seconds to beat Lynda. “That’s crazy,” she thought. She had ridden that fast in practice but never in a real rodeo. If Stubby slipped, she wouldn’t finish in the top three. She looked over at Sheri. Her sister smiled and clapped her hands. “Come on, Tacy!” she yelled. “You can do it!”</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> But it was Sheri’s earlier words that echoed through Tacy’s mind as the gate opened: “<em><strong>I’m not like you, Tacy.</strong></em>” Stubby seemed to be charging too hard. She started to pull him back, but something stopped her. Instead, she leaned into the turn and let her horse swing around toward the first barrel. Stubby had never felt so fast. The ground seemed to thunder under them as he tore for the second barrel. In a dizzying whirl, Stubby was around it and streaking toward the third and final turn. Tacy could hear the noise of the crowd rising as they saw that she had a chance. Now Stubby turned hard around the last barrel, his hind legs bumping it as he dug for the finish. “That’s it,” Tacy thought. With a five-second penalty, she would finish near the bottom. But the crowd noise was increasing! The barrel had wobbled but hadn’t fallen. As Stubby flashed across the line, Tacy saw her time: 17.9 seconds! She had done it. She had won! She looked at Sheri, who was jumping up and down. “Way to go, Tacy!” she shouted. “Way to go!”</p>

Tacy looked at the clock; Sheri had made good time. “Be careful,” she pleaded under her breath, but Sheri and Beetle charged full speed. Again, somehow, Beetle managed to get cleanly around the barrel. Now they were charging for the last barrel. Tacy could see they were making great time. She could hear the roar of the crowd building. “Maybe Sheri can beat Lynda’s time!” Tacy thought. But then Beetle cut around the last barrel too early, knocking it down. The crowd groaned as Sheri and Beetle raced back to the start gate. Their time was 18.0, but a fivesecond penalty was added for knocking one barrel over, bringing their time to 23.0 seconds—last place.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> “Sheri, why weren’t you more careful?” Tacy asked her sister in surprise. “Now you don’t have a chance to win.”</p>
        <p><strong><em>8</em></strong> “I told you, Tacy,” Sheri said. “I didn’t have a chance to win anyway if I rode carefully. So I rode to win.” Tacy walked away slowly. She had another ride to make. She might still be able to finish in the top three. “I’m not like you, Tacy,” Sheri called after her. “I try my best to win, and if I lose, well, I’ll just try again next time.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> Tacy mounted Stubby and got ready for her second ride. Sheri’s words were still in her ears. Lynda Adams was just finishing her second ride. Her horse had slipped a little, and she had finished her second run in 19.8 seconds. Tacy did the math in her head. She needed to finish in 18.0 seconds to beat Lynda. “That’s crazy,” she thought. She had ridden that fast in practice but never in a real rodeo. If Stubby slipped, she wouldn’t finish in the top three. She looked over at Sheri. Her sister smiled and clapped her hands. “Come on, Tacy!” she yelled. “You can do it!”</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> But it was Sheri’s earlier words that echoed through Tacy’s mind as the gate opened: “<em><strong>I’m not like you, Tacy.</strong></em>” Stubby seemed to be charging too hard. She started to pull him back, but something stopped her. Instead, she leaned into the turn and let her horse swing around toward the first barrel. Stubby had never felt so fast. The ground seemed to thunder under them as he tore for the second barrel. In a dizzying whirl, Stubby was around it and streaking toward the third and final turn. Tacy could hear the noise of the crowd rising as they saw that she had a chance. Now Stubby turned hard around the last barrel, his hind legs bumping it as he dug for the finish. “That’s it,” Tacy thought. With a five-second penalty, she would finish near the bottom. But the crowd noise was increasing! The barrel had wobbled but hadn’t fallen. As Stubby flashed across the line, Tacy saw her time: 17.9 seconds! She had done it. She had won! She looked at Sheri, who was jumping up and down. “Way to go, Tacy!” she shouted. “Way to go!”</p>

        <p><strong>Riding to Win</strong><br><em>My notes about what I am reading</em><br><br><em><strong>1</strong></em> Tacy waited anxiously for the gate to open and her race to begin. She could feel her horse Stubby restlessly stomping the ground. Tacy tried to pretend it was just like all her practices back at her father’s ranch, but she couldn’t fool herself. The rodeo crowd buzzed in the background, and the air seemed charged with excitement. “I can do this,” Tacy told herself. Tacy looked over at her sister Sheri, who was always calm. Sheri had been through this many times before. Sheri smiled and gave Tacy a thumbs-up sign.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> Then the gate opened, and Stubby charged out toward the first barrel. The big chestnut horse knew what to do without Tacy even guiding him. They had spent many hours practicing, so circling the barrels was automatic for both of them. But now Tacy thought Stubby was going a little too fast. She tugged on the reins and guided him carefully around the first barrel. Stubby seemed to fight her, as if to say, “I can do this. Let me show you.” But Tacy didn’t want to mess up. It was the first of two rides to determine the winner of the Ranger County Rodeo Junior Barrel Racing Championship. Riders had two chances to circle the three barrels with their horse and return to the starting point. The contestant with the fastest combined time would win.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> After Stubby got around the first barrel, Tacy let him gain speed across the arena toward the second barrel. She could feel the powerful horse digging into the ground and picking up speed. Tacy knew they needed to be fast to have a chance of winning, but she also knew that missing a barrel or knocking one over could put her in last place. She didn’t trust her racing skills that much yet. She pulled back on the reins, just a little, to make sure that Stubby was not going too fast. Stubby snorted as they circled the second barrel. Now he shot toward the final barrel at the end of the arena. Tacy slowed him again, leaning into the turn as they rounded the barrel. She urged him forward, and he sped back to the line. Tacy looked for her time: 19.6 seconds. Not bad for the newest rider in the championship. So far that put her in fourth place out of more than twenty riders.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> Now it was her sister’s second turn. “Ride carefully,” Tacy said as her sister waited at the line.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> “Lynda Adams finished her first race in 18.1,” Sheri reminded her. “I’m not going to beat that by riding carefully.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “But—” Tacy started to protest as the gate opened and Sheri raced out. She was riding a black mare named Beetle. Beetle and Sheri headed full speed toward the first barrel. “Slow down. Slow down,” Tacy whispered. Tacy had watched her sister race before but never this fast. She was sure that Sheri would knock the barrel over. Beetle’s front hooves dug in, and the mare’s hind legs swiveled hard, looking as if they would wind around the barrel. Somehow Sheri and Beetle made it safely around and began racing for the second barrel.

        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> Now it was her sister’s second turn. “Ride carefully,” Tacy said as her sister waited at the line.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> “Lynda Adams finished her first race in 18.1,” Sheri reminded her. “I’m not going to beat that by riding carefully.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “But—” Tacy started to protest as the gate opened and Sheri raced out. She was riding a black mare named Beetle. Beetle and Sheri headed full speed toward the first barrel. “Slow down. Slow down,” Tacy whispered. Tacy had watched her sister race before but never this fast. She was sure that Sheri would knock the barrel over. Beetle’s front hooves dug in, and the mare’s hind legs swiveled hard, looking as if they would wind around the barrel. Somehow Sheri and Beetle made it safely around and began racing for the second barrel. Tacy looked at the clock; Sheri had made good time. “Be careful,” she pleaded under her breath, but Sheri and Beetle charged full speed. Again, somehow, Beetle managed to get cleanly around the barrel. Now they were charging for the last barrel. Tacy could see they were making great time. She could hear the roar of the crowd building. “Maybe Sheri can beat Lynda’s time!” Tacy thought. But then Beetle cut around the last barrel too early, knocking it down. The crowd groaned as Sheri and Beetle raced back to the start gate. Their time was 18.0, but a fivesecond penalty was added for knocking one barrel over, bringing their time to 23.0 seconds—last place.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> “Sheri, why weren’t you more careful?” Tacy asked her sister in surprise. “Now you don’t have a chance to win.”</p>
        <p><strong><em>8</em></strong> “I told you, Tacy,” Sheri said. “I didn’t have a chance to win anyway if I rode carefully. So I rode to win.” Tacy walked away slowly. She had another ride to make. She might still be able to finish in the top three. “I’m not like you, Tacy,” Sheri called after her. “I try my best to win, and if I lose, well, I’ll just try again next time.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> Tacy mounted Stubby and got ready for her second ride. Sheri’s words were still in her ears. Lynda Adams was just finishing her second ride. Her horse had slipped a little, and she had finished her second run in 19.8 seconds. Tacy did the math in her head. She needed to finish in 18.0 seconds to beat Lynda. “That’s crazy,” she thought. She had ridden that fast in practice but never in a real rodeo. If Stubby slipped, she wouldn’t finish in the top three. She looked over at Sheri. Her sister smiled and clapped her hands. “Come on, Tacy!” she yelled. “You can do it!”</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> But it was Sheri’s earlier words that echoed through Tacy’s mind as the gate opened: “<em><strong>I’m not like you, Tacy.</strong></em>” Stubby seemed to be charging too hard. She started to pull him back, but something stopped her. Instead, she leaned into the turn and let her horse swing around toward the first barrel. Stubby had never felt so fast. The ground seemed to thunder under them as he tore for the second barrel. In a dizzying whirl, Stubby was around it and streaking toward the third and final turn. Tacy could hear the noise of the crowd rising as they saw that she had a chance. Now Stubby turned hard around the last barrel, his hind legs bumping it as he dug for the finish. “That’s it,” Tacy thought. With a five-second penalty, she would finish near the bottom. But the crowd noise was increasing! The barrel had wobbled but hadn’t fallen. As Stubby flashed across the line, Tacy saw her time: 17.9 seconds! She had done it. She had won! She looked at Sheri, who was jumping up and down. “Way to go, Tacy!” she shouted. “Way to go!”</p>

        <p><strong>Riding to Win</strong><br><em>My notes about what I am reading</em><br><br><em><strong>1</strong></em> Tacy waited anxiously for the gate to open and her race to begin. She could feel her horse Stubby restlessly stomping the ground. Tacy tried to pretend it was just like all her practices back at her father’s ranch, but she couldn’t fool herself. The rodeo crowd buzzed in the background, and the air seemed charged with excitement. “I can do this,” Tacy told herself. Tacy looked over at her sister Sheri, who was always calm. Sheri had been through this many times before. Sheri smiled and gave Tacy a thumbs-up sign.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> Then the gate opened, and Stubby charged out toward the first barrel. The big chestnut horse knew what to do without Tacy even guiding him. They had spent many hours practicing, so circling the barrels was automatic for both of them. But now Tacy thought Stubby was going a little too fast. She tugged on the reins and guided him carefully around the first barrel. Stubby seemed to fight her, as if to say, “I can do this. Let me show you.” But Tacy didn’t want to mess up. It was the first of two rides to determine the winner of the Ranger County Rodeo Junior Barrel Racing Championship. Riders had two chances to circle the three barrels with their horse and return to the starting point. The contestant with the fastest combined time would win.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> After Stubby got around the first barrel, Tacy let him gain speed across the arena toward the second barrel. She could feel the powerful horse digging into the ground and picking up speed. Tacy knew they needed to be fast to have a chance of winning, but she also knew that missing a barrel or knocking one over could put her in last place. She didn’t trust her racing skills that much yet. She pulled back on the reins, just a little, to make sure that Stubby was not going too fast. Stubby snorted as they circled the second barrel. Now he shot toward the final barrel at the end of the arena. Tacy slowed him again, leaning into the turn as they rounded the barrel. She urged him forward, and he sped back to the line. Tacy looked for her time: 19.6 seconds. Not bad for the newest rider in the championship. So far that put her in fourth place out of more than twenty riders.</p>

Tacy knew they needed to be fast to have a chance of winning, but she also knew that missing a barrel or knocking one over could put her in last place. She didn’t trust her racing skills that much yet. She pulled back on the reins, just a little, to make sure that Stubby was not going too fast. Stubby snorted as they circled the second barrel. Now he shot toward the final barrel at the end of the arena. Tacy slowed him again, leaning into the turn as they rounded the barrel. She urged him forward, and he sped back to the line. Tacy looked for her time: 19.6 seconds. Not bad for the newest rider in the championship. So far that put her in fourth place out of more than twenty riders.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> Now it was her sister’s second turn. “Ride carefully,” Tacy said as her sister waited at the line.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> “Lynda Adams finished her first race in 18.1,” Sheri reminded her. “I’m not going to beat that by riding carefully.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “But—” Tacy started to protest as the gate opened and Sheri raced out. She was riding a black mare named Beetle. Beetle and Sheri headed full speed toward the first barrel. “Slow down. Slow down,” Tacy whispered. Tacy had watched her sister race before but never this fast. She was sure that Sheri would knock the barrel over. Beetle’s front hooves dug in, and the mare’s hind legs swiveled hard, looking as if they would wind around the barrel. Somehow Sheri and Beetle made it safely around and began racing for the second barrel. Tacy looked at the clock; Sheri had made good time. “Be careful,” she pleaded under her breath, but Sheri and Beetle charged full speed. Again, somehow, Beetle managed to get cleanly around the barrel. Now they were charging for the last barrel. Tacy could see they were making great time. She could hear the roar of the crowd building. “Maybe Sheri can beat Lynda’s time!” Tacy thought. But then Beetle cut around the last barrel too early, knocking it down. The crowd groaned as Sheri and Beetle raced back to the start gate. Their time was 18.0, but a fivesecond penalty was added for knocking one barrel over, bringing their time to 23.0 seconds—last place.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> “Sheri, why weren’t you more careful?” Tacy asked her sister in surprise. “Now you don’t have a chance to win.”</p>
        <p><strong><em>8</em></strong> “I told you, Tacy,” Sheri said. “I didn’t have a chance to win anyway if I rode carefully. So I rode to win.” Tacy walked away slowly. She had another ride to make. She might still be able to finish in the top three. “I’m not like you, Tacy,” Sheri called after her. “I try my best to win, and if I lose, well, I’ll just try again next time.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> Tacy mounted Stubby and got ready for her second ride. Sheri’s words were still in her ears. Lynda Adams was just finishing her second ride. Her horse had slipped a little, and she had finished her second run in 19.8 seconds. Tacy did the math in her head. She needed to finish in 18.0 seconds to beat Lynda. “That’s crazy,” she thought. She had ridden that fast in practice but never in a real rodeo. If Stubby slipped, she wouldn’t finish in the top three. She looked over at Sheri. Her sister smiled and clapped her hands. “Come on, Tacy!” she yelled. “You can do it!”</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> But it was Sheri’s earlier words that echoed through Tacy’s mind as the gate opened: “<em><strong>I’m not like you, Tacy.</strong></em>” Stubby seemed to be charging too hard. She started to pull him back, but something stopped her. Instead, she leaned into the turn and let her horse swing around toward the first barrel. Stubby had never felt so fast. The ground seemed to thunder under them as he tore for the second barrel. In a dizzying whirl, Stubby was around it and streaking toward the third and final turn. Tacy could hear the noise of the crowd rising as they saw that she had a chance. Now Stubby turned hard around the last barrel, his hind legs bumping it as he dug for the finish. “That’s it,” Tacy thought. With a five-second penalty, she would finish near the bottom. But the crowd noise was increasing! The barrel had wobbled but hadn’t fallen. As Stubby flashed across the line, Tacy saw her time: 17.9 seconds! She had done it. She had won! She looked at Sheri, who was jumping up and down. “Way to go, Tacy!” she shouted. “Way to go!”</p>

        <p><strong>Riding to Win</strong><br><em>My notes about what I am reading</em><br><br><em><strong>1</strong></em> Tacy waited anxiously for the gate to open and her race to begin. She could feel her horse Stubby restlessly stomping the ground. Tacy tried to pretend it was just like all her practices back at her father’s ranch, but she couldn’t fool herself. The rodeo crowd buzzed in the background, and the air seemed charged with excitement. “I can do this,” Tacy told herself. Tacy looked over at her sister Sheri, who was always calm. Sheri had been through this many times before. Sheri smiled and gave Tacy a thumbs-up sign.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> Then the gate opened, and Stubby charged out toward the first barrel. The big chestnut horse knew what to do without Tacy even guiding him. They had spent many hours practicing, so circling the barrels was automatic for both of them. But now Tacy thought Stubby was going a little too fast. She tugged on the reins and guided him carefully around the first barrel. Stubby seemed to fight her, as if to say, “I can do this. Let me show you.” But Tacy didn’t want to mess up. It was the first of two rides to determine the winner of the Ranger County Rodeo Junior Barrel Racing Championship. Riders had two chances to circle the three barrels with their horse and return to the starting point. The contestant with the fastest combined time would win.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> After Stubby got around the first barrel, Tacy let him gain speed across the arena toward the second barrel. She could feel the powerful horse digging into the ground and picking up speed. Tacy knew they needed to be fast to have a chance of winning, but she also knew that missing a barrel or knocking one over could put her in last place. She didn’t trust her racing skills that much yet. She pulled back on the reins, just a little, to make sure that Stubby was not going too fast. Stubby snorted as they circled the second barrel. Now he shot toward the final barrel at the end of the arena. Tacy slowed him again, leaning into the turn as they rounded the barrel. She urged him forward, and he sped back to the line. Tacy looked for her time: 19.6 seconds. Not bad for the newest rider in the championship. So far that put her in fourth place out of more than twenty riders.</p>

        <p><strong>Riding to Win</strong><br><em>My notes about what I am reading</em><br><br><em><strong>1</strong></em> Tacy waited anxiously for the gate to open and her race to begin. She could feel her horse Stubby restlessly stomping the ground. Tacy tried to pretend it was just like all her practices back at her father’s ranch, but she couldn’t fool herself. The rodeo crowd buzzed in the background, and the air seemed charged with excitement. “I can do this,” Tacy told herself. Tacy looked over at her sister Sheri, who was always calm. Sheri had been through this many times before. Sheri smiled and gave Tacy a thumbs-up sign.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> Then the gate opened, and Stubby charged out toward the first barrel. The big chestnut horse knew what to do without Tacy even guiding him. They had spent many hours practicing, so circling the barrels was automatic for both of them. But now Tacy thought Stubby was going a little too fast. She tugged on the reins and guided him carefully around the first barrel. Stubby seemed to fight her, as if to say, “I can do this. Let me show you.” But Tacy didn’t want to mess up. It was the first of two rides to determine the winner of the Ranger County Rodeo Junior Barrel Racing Championship. Riders had two chances to circle the three barrels with their horse and return to the starting point. The contestant with the fastest combined time would win.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> After Stubby got around the first barrel, Tacy let him gain speed across the arena toward the second barrel. She could feel the powerful horse digging into the ground and picking up speed. Tacy knew they needed to be fast to have a chance of winning, but she also knew that missing a barrel or knocking one over could put her in last place. She didn’t trust her racing skills that much yet. She pulled back on the reins, just a little, to make sure that Stubby was not going too fast. Stubby snorted as they circled the second barrel. Now he shot toward the final barrel at the end of the arena. Tacy slowed him again, leaning into the turn as they rounded the barrel. She urged him forward, and he sped back to the line. Tacy looked for her time: 19.6 seconds. Not bad for the newest rider in the championship. So far that put her in fourth place out of more than twenty riders.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> Now it was her sister’s second turn. “Ride carefully,” Tacy said as her sister waited at the line.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> “Lynda Adams finished her first race in 18.1,” Sheri reminded her. “I’m not going to beat that by riding carefully.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “But—” Tacy started to protest as the gate opened and Sheri raced out. She was riding a black mare named Beetle. Beetle and Sheri headed full speed toward the first barrel. “Slow down. Slow down,” Tacy whispered. Tacy had watched her sister race before but never this fast. She was sure that Sheri would knock the barrel over. Beetle’s front hooves dug in, and the mare’s hind legs swiveled hard, looking as if they would wind around the barrel. Somehow Sheri and Beetle made it safely around and began racing for the second barrel. Tacy looked at the clock; Sheri had made good time. “Be careful,” she pleaded under her breath, but Sheri and Beetle charged full speed. Again, somehow, Beetle managed to get cleanly around the barrel. Now they were charging for the last barrel. Tacy could see they were making great time. She could hear the roar of the crowd building. “Maybe Sheri can beat Lynda’s time!” Tacy thought. But then Beetle cut around the last barrel too early, knocking it down. The crowd groaned as Sheri and Beetle raced back to the start gate. Their time was 18.0, but a fivesecond penalty was added for knocking one barrel over, bringing their time to 23.0 seconds—last place.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> “Sheri, why weren’t you more careful?” Tacy asked her sister in surprise. “Now you don’t have a chance to win.”</p>
        <p><strong><em>8</em></strong> “I told you, Tacy,” Sheri said. “I didn’t have a chance to win anyway if I rode carefully. So I rode to win.” Tacy walked away slowly. She had another ride to make. She might still be able to finish in the top three. “I’m not like you, Tacy,” Sheri called after her. “I try my best to win, and if I lose, well, I’ll just try again next time.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> Tacy mounted Stubby and got ready for her second ride. Sheri’s words were still in her ears. Lynda Adams was just finishing her second ride. Her horse had slipped a little, and she had finished her second run in 19.8 seconds. Tacy did the math in her head. She needed to finish in 18.0 seconds to beat Lynda. “That’s crazy,” she thought. She had ridden that fast in practice but never in a real rodeo. If Stubby slipped, she wouldn’t finish in the top three. She looked over at Sheri. Her sister smiled and clapped her hands. “Come on, Tacy!” she yelled. “You can do it!”</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> But it was Sheri’s earlier words that echoed through Tacy’s mind as the gate opened: “<em><strong>I’m not like you, Tacy.</strong></em>” Stubby seemed to be charging too hard. She started to pull him back, but something stopped her. Instead, she leaned into the turn and let her horse swing around toward the first barrel. Stubby had never felt so fast. The ground seemed to thunder under them as he tore for the second barrel. In a dizzying whirl, Stubby was around it and streaking toward the third and final turn. Tacy could hear the noise of the crowd rising as they saw that she had a chance. Now Stubby turned hard around the last barrel, his hind legs bumping it as he dug for the finish. “That’s it,” Tacy thought. With a five-second penalty, she would finish near the bottom. But the crowd noise was increasing! The barrel had wobbled but hadn’t fallen. As Stubby flashed across the line, Tacy saw her time: 17.9 seconds! She had done it. She had won! She looked at Sheri, who was jumping up and down. “Way to go, Tacy!” she shouted. “Way to go!”</p>
