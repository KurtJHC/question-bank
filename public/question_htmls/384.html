        </p>
        <p><em>1</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The check bounced. “Insufficient funds,” says the little note attached. Well, I’m sure it’s just a mistake. Probably the people didn’t make a transfer in time or something. “No big deal,” I keep saying to myself, standing at the mailbox.</p>
        <p><em>2</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the check bounced! Isn’t that strange? I mean, is there a message here? The check was payment to us for the sale of Cricket, our ex-horse, and Sassy, our ex-mule. A sale, truth be told, I’ve been regretting. And now the check has bounced. Is it a sign?</p>
        <p><em>3</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; No, of course not. Probably just a clerical error.</p>
        <p><em>4</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, as I take the long walk back home, I get a picture in my head. I imagine that somehow Cricket and Sassy understand that the check bounced, that they understand the legal ramifications of this, that technically the deal is null and void, and in one burst of horse energy they leap over the buyer’s fence and come bounding in slow motion, as if in a shampoo commercial, up our driveway, toward me, kicking and snorting with glee, and I run toward them and we hug and live happily ever after. Together. As it was meant to be.</p>
        <p><em>5</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I get home I snap out of it. No, we did the right thing, selling Cricket and Sassy. They’re in a better place now. Cricket will be a brood mare. A mom!</p>
        <p><em>6</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; And Sassy, her friend, will be at her side. It’s better for them. Better for us. Cricket, a registered American saddlebred, is too much horse for novices like us. And Sassy is too short for an adult to ride. And we have another horse and mule that we do ride. So this really is the best thing for all concerned. And what did I tell myself ? Yes, some friendships are meant to end. That’s it. Never mind that Cricket was our love-horse, the horse that walked up our driveway on our wedding day. And Sassy was our love-mule, the mule that walked up our driveway beside her. They had flowers in their hair. Never mind! Because some friendships are just meant to end. And I am a mature person with a logical head who understands this.</p>
        <p><em>7</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; So I call Cricket and Sassy’s new owners. “The check bounced,” I say.</p>
        <p><em>8</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; “Oh, that’s our stupid bank,” the woman says. Then she gives me her bank’s stupid phone number, should I want to call for proof that her account is in good standing, which I don’t really, but I write the number down anyway. “Just resubmit the check, okay?” she says. I ask her how Cricket and Sassy are doing, and she says, “Great!” Nothing more. I wish she had said more.</p>
        <p><em>9</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Meantime, all this horse thinking gets my mind on Billy. Because not all fading friendships are meant to end. Billy is the neighbor who sold Cricket and Sassy to us. He’s the one who rode Sassy up the driveway on our wedding day, his feet dragging on the ground. Tom, his son, rode Cricket. They’re the ones who put the flowers in their hair. Billy and I used to see each other more. I don’t know why we’ve drifted. There never seems to be a real reason for friendships to fade. Friendships take work. Maybe that’s all there is to it.</p>
        <p><em>10&nbsp;</em>&nbsp; I call Billy just to say hi. He seems happy to hear from me. “We got a donkey!” he says. “She’s so goofy. You’d love her.” I tell him the news about Cricket and Sassy, and when I mention the buyers he seems concerned: “Did you happen to insist on a certified check?”</p>
        <p><em>11&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Oh.</p>
        <p><em>12&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Sure enough, a few days later, I’m at the mailbox. “Insufficient funds.” I can’t believe it. What do they think, I’m an idiot or something? I stomp into the house. What about that bank phone number? I’ll call that bank, I’ll get to the bottom of this. What did I do with that number? I must have thrown it out. I start picking through the trash.</p>
        <p><em>13&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Here it is! But the paper is wet and the number is blurred.</p>
        <p><em>14&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Isn’t that strange? I mean, is there a message here? It’s hard not to think of disappearing ink as a message from above. I start getting shampoo commercials in my head again. Oh, dear.</p>
        <p><em>15&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Why am I putting myself through all of this? Why can’t I just admit that I made a mistake? Not just the part about selling my beloved pets to, well, some questionable buyers. But selling them at all. And, anyway, why can’t we breed Cricket? A lot of work, perhaps. But wouldn’t that be an amazing experience?</p>
        <p><em>16&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>I imagine Cricket back in our barn. I imagine brushing her, telling her everything I’ve learned. “Well, Cricket, friendships take work,” I’ll say. “That’s all there is to it.”</p>
        <p><em>17&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>So I call the woman, sound very businesslike. “The check bounced again,” I say calmly. “The deal is off.” Strangely, she doesn’t sound surprised. I get the distinct sense she and her husband have been through this before.</p>
        <p><em>18&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>I call Billy. “Would you be able to go pick up Cricket and Sassy in your horse trailer and bring them back home?” I ask. He says of course. No questions asked. And I think that’s what friends are for. And I say yeah, I’d love to stop over and meet his new donkey.</p>

        <p><em>1</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The check bounced. “Insufficient funds,” says the little note attached. Well, I’m sure it’s just a mistake. Probably the people didn’t make a transfer in time or something. “No big deal,” I keep saying to myself, standing at the mailbox.</p>
        <p><em>2</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the check bounced! Isn’t that strange? I mean, is there a message here? The check was payment to us for the sale of Cricket, our ex-horse, and Sassy, our ex-mule. A sale, truth be told, I’ve been regretting. And now the check has bounced. Is it a sign?</p>
        <p><em>3</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; No, of course not. Probably just a clerical error.</p>
        <p><em>4</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, as I take the long walk back home, I get a picture in my head. I imagine that somehow Cricket and Sassy understand that the check bounced, that they understand the legal ramifications of this, that technically the deal is null and void, and in one burst of horse energy they leap over the buyer’s fence and come bounding in slow motion, as if in a shampoo commercial, up our driveway, toward me, kicking and snorting with glee, and I run toward them and we hug and live happily ever after. Together. As it was meant to be.</p>
        <p><em>5</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I get home I snap out of it. No, we did the right thing, selling Cricket and Sassy. They’re in a better place now. Cricket will be a brood mare. A mom!</p>
        <p><em>6</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; And Sassy, her friend, will be at her side. It’s better for them. Better for us. Cricket, a registered American saddlebred, is too much horse for novices like us. And Sassy is too short for an adult to ride. And we have another horse and mule that we do ride. So this really is the best thing for all concerned. And what did I tell myself ? Yes, some friendships are meant to end. That’s it. Never mind that Cricket was our love-horse, the horse that walked up our driveway on our wedding day. And Sassy was our love-mule, the mule that walked up our driveway beside her. They had flowers in their hair. Never mind! Because some friendships are just meant to end. And I am a mature person with a logical head who understands this.</p>
        <p><em>7</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; So I call Cricket and Sassy’s new owners. “The check bounced,” I say.</p>
        <p><em>8</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; “Oh, that’s our stupid bank,” the woman says. Then she gives me her bank’s stupid phone number, should I want to call for proof that her account is in good standing, which I don’t really, but I write the number down anyway. “Just resubmit the check, okay?” she says. I ask her how Cricket and Sassy are doing, and she says, “Great!” Nothing more. I wish she had said more.</p>
        <p><em>9</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Meantime, all this horse thinking gets my mind on Billy. Because not all fading friendships are meant to end. Billy is the neighbor who sold Cricket and Sassy to us. He’s the one who rode Sassy up the driveway on our wedding day, his feet dragging on the ground. Tom, his son, rode Cricket. They’re the ones who put the flowers in their hair. Billy and I used to see each other more. I don’t know why we’ve drifted. There never seems to be a real reason for friendships to fade. Friendships take work. Maybe that’s all there is to it.</p>
        <p><em>10&nbsp;</em>&nbsp; I call Billy just to say hi. He seems happy to hear from me. “We got a donkey!” he says. “She’s so goofy. You’d love her.” I tell him the news about Cricket and Sassy, and when I mention the buyers he seems concerned: “Did you happen to insist on a certified check?”</p>
        <p><em>11&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Oh.</p>
        <p><em>12&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Sure enough, a few days later, I’m at the mailbox. “Insufficient funds.” I can’t believe it. What do they think, I’m an idiot or something? I stomp into the house. What about that bank phone number? I’ll call that bank, I’ll get to the bottom of this. What did I do with that number? I must have thrown it out. I start picking through the trash.</p>
        <p><em>13&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Here it is! But the paper is wet and the number is blurred.</p>
        <p><em>14&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Isn’t that strange? I mean, is there a message here? It’s hard not to think of disappearing ink as a message from above. I start getting shampoo commercials in my head again. Oh, dear.</p>
        <p><em>15&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Why am I putting myself through all of this? Why can’t I just admit that I made a mistake? Not just the part about selling my beloved pets to, well, some questionable buyers. But selling them at all. And, anyway, why can’t we breed Cricket? A lot of work, perhaps. But wouldn’t that be an amazing experience?</p>
        <p><em>16&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>I imagine Cricket back in our barn. I imagine brushing her, telling her everything I’ve learned. “Well, Cricket, friendships take work,” I’ll say. “That’s all there is to it.”</p>
        <p><em>17&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>So I call the woman, sound very businesslike. “The check bounced again,” I say calmly. “The deal is off.” Strangely, she doesn’t sound surprised. I get the distinct sense she and her husband have been through this before.</p>
        <p><em>18&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>I call Billy. “Would you be able to go pick up Cricket and Sassy in your horse trailer and bring them back home?” I ask. He says of course. No questions asked. And I think that’s what friends are for. And I say yeah, I’d love to stop over and meet his new donkey.</p>

        <p><em>1</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The check bounced. “Insufficient funds,” says the little note attached. Well, I’m sure it’s just a mistake. Probably the people didn’t make a transfer in time or something. “No big deal,” I keep saying to myself, standing at the mailbox.</p>
        <p><em>2</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the check bounced! Isn’t that strange? I mean, is there a message here? The check was payment to us for the sale of Cricket, our ex-horse, and Sassy, our ex-mule. A sale, truth be told, I’ve been regretting. And now the check has bounced. Is it a sign?</p>
        <p><em>3</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; No, of course not. Probably just a clerical error.</p>
        <p><em>4</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, as I take the long walk back home, I get a picture in my head. I imagine that somehow Cricket and Sassy understand that the check bounced, that they understand the legal ramifications of this, that technically the deal is null and void, and in one burst of horse energy they leap over the buyer’s fence and come bounding in slow motion, as if in a shampoo commercial, up our driveway, toward me, kicking and snorting with glee, and I run toward them and we hug and live happily ever after. Together. As it was meant to be.</p>
        <p><em>5</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I get home I snap out of it. No, we did the right thing, selling Cricket and Sassy. They’re in a better place now. Cricket will be a brood mare. A mom!</p>
        <p><em>6</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; And Sassy, her friend, will be at her side. It’s better for them. Better for us. Cricket, a registered American saddlebred, is too much horse for novices like us. And Sassy is too short for an adult to ride. And we have another horse and mule that we do ride. So this really is the best thing for all concerned. And what did I tell myself ? Yes, some friendships are meant to end. That’s it. Never mind that Cricket was our love-horse, the horse that walked up our driveway on our wedding day. And Sassy was our love-mule, the mule that walked up our driveway beside her. They had flowers in their hair. Never mind! Because some friendships are just meant to end. And I am a mature person with a logical head who understands this.</p>
        <p><em>7</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; So I call Cricket and Sassy’s new owners. “The check bounced,” I say.</p>
        <p><em>8</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; “Oh, that’s our stupid bank,” the woman says. Then she gives me her bank’s stupid phone number, should I want to call for proof that her account is in good standing, which I don’t really, but I write the number down anyway. “Just resubmit the check, okay?” she says. I ask her how Cricket and Sassy are doing, and she says, “Great!” Nothing more. I wish she had said more.</p>
        <p><em>9</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Meantime, all this horse thinking gets my mind on Billy. Because not all fading friendships are meant to end. Billy is the neighbor who sold Cricket and Sassy to us. He’s the one who rode Sassy up the driveway on our wedding day, his feet dragging on the ground. Tom, his son, rode Cricket. They’re the ones who put the flowers in their hair. Billy and I used to see each other more. I don’t know why we’ve drifted. There never seems to be a real reason for friendships to fade. Friendships take work. Maybe that’s all there is to it.</p>
        <p><em>10&nbsp;</em>&nbsp; I call Billy just to say hi. He seems happy to hear from me. “We got a donkey!” he says. “She’s so goofy. You’d love her.” I tell him the news about Cricket and Sassy, and when I mention the buyers he seems concerned: “Did you happen to insist on a certified check?”</p>
        <p><em>11&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Oh.</p>
        <p><em>12&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Sure enough, a few days later, I’m at the mailbox. “Insufficient funds.” I can’t believe it. What do they think, I’m an idiot or something? I stomp into the house. What about that bank phone number? I’ll call that bank, I’ll get to the bottom of this. What did I do with that number? I must have thrown it out. I start picking through the trash.</p>
        <p><em>13&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Here it is! But the paper is wet and the number is blurred.</p>
        <p><em>14&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Isn’t that strange? I mean, is there a message here? It’s hard not to think of disappearing ink as a message from above. I start getting shampoo commercials in my head again. Oh, dear.</p>
        <p><em>15&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Why am I putting myself through all of this? Why can’t I just admit that I made a mistake? Not just the part about selling my beloved pets to, well, some questionable buyers. But selling them at all. And, anyway, why can’t we breed Cricket? A lot of work, perhaps. But wouldn’t that be an amazing experience?</p>
        <p><em>16&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>I imagine Cricket back in our barn. I imagine brushing her, telling her everything I’ve learned. “Well, Cricket, friendships take work,” I’ll say. “That’s all there is to it.”</p>
        <p><em>17&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>So I call the woman, sound very businesslike. “The check bounced again,” I say calmly. “The deal is off.” Strangely, she doesn’t sound surprised. I get the distinct sense she and her husband have been through this before.</p>
        <p><em>18&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>I call Billy. “Would you be able to go pick up Cricket and Sassy in your horse trailer and bring them back home?” I ask. He says of course. No questions asked. And I think that’s what friends are for. And I say yeah, I’d love to stop over and meet his new donkey.</p>

        </p>
        <p>1 &nbsp;&nbsp;The early-morning August sun was rising over the mountains across the lake. Alan sat next to his father in the small metal boat. He and his father had been to this fishing spot many times over the summer. Alan usually loved being here, but today his heart was heavy.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp;&nbsp; Alan’s father leaned back and sighed comfortably. “I’m really glad we were able to have one last fishing weekend before you have to go back to school. It’s a perfect day to relax,” he said. His fishing line started to jerk. “And a perfect day to catch a big fish,” he added. Alan’s father reeled in a large catfish and scooped it up with the net. He held up the fish like a trophy.</p>
        <p>3 &nbsp;“Dad expects everything to be the best,” thought Alan. “I wonder what he’ll say when I tell him I don’t want to try out for the football team this year.” Alan tried to push the thought out of his mind and concentrate on putting the worm on the hook.</p>
        <p>4 &nbsp;“Here, Alan, let me show you a better way to get that bait on your hook,” Dad said, reaching for Alan’s fishing pole.</p>
        <p>5 “I’ve got it, Dad,” Alan answered, pulling away as he roughly put the worm onto the hook, nearly tearing it to pieces.</p>
        <p>6 &nbsp;“O.K., but try to be a little more careful. You don’t want it to fall apart,” his father said, looking at the mangled bait. “Now, let me show you how to cast just right so you can catch the biggest fish.”</p>
        <p>7 &nbsp;“No, thanks,” Alan mumbled.</p>
        <p>8 “C’mon, you can do it! Just try,” Dad said. “Watch how I do it.” He demonstrated a perfect cast. Then he leaned back in the boat and pushed his hat down low over his forehead. “Now, you try.”</p>
        <p>9 &nbsp;<em>You can do it! Just try. Watch how I do it.</em> The words rang over and over in Alan’s mind. It seemed to Alan that they were the only words his father had said all summer. Alan had told his father at the beginning of summer that he was thinking about trying out for his school’s football team. Although Alan hadn’t played much football before, he knew Dad would be pleased if he made the team. Dad always talked about how he had played football in high school and college. He was more than willing to help Alan learn the game.</p>
        <p>10 &nbsp;The first day they practiced, Dad had thrown the ball to Alan. “You can catch it! Just try!” his father had called. Alan had run as fast as he could to catch the ball, but it hit his chest hard and bounced out of his hands. He stumbled and fell to the ground.</p>
        <p>11 &nbsp;“Don’t worry, Alan. You’ll get it next time. Here, watch how I hold my hands to catch the ball,” Dad had told him. All summer he and Dad had practiced football in the yard. Over and over again Alan would miss, and Dad would try to show him how to improve his skills. By the beginning of August, Alan had made some improvement, but he had also begun to loathe the game. He couldn’t even stand the sight of a football.</p>
        <p>12 &nbsp;Alan tried to bring his thoughts back to fishing. He raised his pole and threw the line out into the water, where it immediately became <span class="txt-underline">intertwined</span> with his father’s line. Alan tried to pull his line free from his father’s, but the tangle only got worse.</p>
        <p>13 &nbsp;“See, I can’t! I don’t want to! And I don’t want to play football, either!” Alan blurted out. The words escaped before he knew it. Instantly he wished he could take them back.</p>
        <p>14 &nbsp;“But I thought you liked football! You were getting really good at it,” his father said.</p>
        <p>15 &nbsp;“No, Dad, I just wanted to try it because you liked it. You were the one who was good at it, not me.” Alan looked down at the water. “You always told me that I had to be the best. Well, I’m not the best.”</p>
        <p>16 His father shook his head sadly. “Son, I never said, ‘Be the best.’ Don’t you remember? I always say, ‘Do your best.’ ”</p>
        <p>17 &nbsp;Alan sank farther down into his seat. The small boat rocked and then calmed. All around, everything was still and silent. Neither Alan nor Dad said a word in the uncomfortable silence.</p>
        <p>18 &nbsp;It was probably only a few minutes, but it seemed like hours before either of them spoke. Finally Alan’s father took out his pocketknife. “I guess we’ll just have to cut these lines and start over,” Dad said. With a quick tug of his knife, he cut the tangled lines and began pulling them in.</p>
        <p>19 &nbsp;Alan reached into the tackle box and then fixed his line. He attached new bait to the hook, being more careful this time, and cast the line out as far as he could. Before long the bobber went under, and his line tightened.</p>
        <p>20 “You’ve got a bite!” his father said, pointing. Alan jerked the pole to set the hook and began reeling in the line. But the line slackened, and the hook came up empty.</p>
        <p>21 “It got away,” Alan said, sighing.</p>
        <p>22 “That’s O.K.,” Dad said as he cast his own line. “You can’t expect to catch them all.”</p>
        <p>23 Alan glanced over at his father with a smile.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em>1</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;“Michael Bevons,” the teacher called. “Michael Bevons.”</p>
        <p><em>2</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;It was clear to everyone in the room that the teacher was calling my name. I was, after all, the new kid. I was expected to parade to the front of the room so all the students could stare at this person named Michael Bevons.</p>
        <p><em>3</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;Such was my fate. This change was set in motion two months ago when my mother broached the subject of moving from burning-hot Texas to tolerably hot Southern California. Even though this was the first I’d heard of it, I didn’t really have any objections. I was sure that I would make a lot of friends in California. Everyone knows that people there are more open-minded than anywhere else. In the small Texas town where we lived, people didn’t understand why I love skateboarding and punk music. My mother was excited about her new job. Plus, she would be living near my aunt. Although I didn’t exactly share in the joy of being near my younger cousins, I figured the new scene would suit me just fine.</p>
        <p><em>4</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;But after we arrived, my conception of California changed completely. No one in my neighborhood seemed to share my interests. I happened to move to a place in California where everything is about being in or on the water. I had lived in West Texas my whole life, and I had never even been to a beach. I quickly discovered that sand is no good for skateboarding. And as far as music, I think cricket symphonies are the only thing my new neighbors listen to. When I wasn’t practicing guitar, the neighborhood was nearly silent. I rode my skateboard alone on the sidewalk and played only solos on my guitar.</p>
        <p><em>5</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;I felt right at home today while riding the bus to school—I had been alone in West Texas, and I was alone here. The bus crawled along as kids murmured questions like “What’s his deal?” about the new person on board. My hair, a carefully spiked Mohawk, appeared to be the focus of every conversation.</p>
        <p><em>6</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;I didn’t get it. I had thought that in California, people would know that being different was cool. Nope. I was still just that weirdo that people hoped would not sit next to them. But I wasn’t about to go home and change my hairstyle. Then I’d lose what dignity I had left. So I walked into the classroom anyway.</p>
        <p><em>7</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;“Would you like to come get your book, Michael?” the teacher asked.</p>
        <p><em>8</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;“Actually, no,” I thought. But I knew I didn’t have a choice.</p>
        <p><em>9</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;In the few moments before I was to make my move, I had already calculated the number of steps it would take to reach her desk—nine. I hoped to blaze the path with the quickness of a sprinter. As I took each step, I cringed, thinking at any point that the whispering would start again.</p>
        <p><em>10&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>“We’re starting a new chapter today, so you came on a good day, Michael,” the teacher said cheerfully. She was holding out the book with both hands and smiled as I took it from her.</p>
        <p><em>11&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>“One more thing,” she said. “Robert will show you around today.”</p>
        <p><em>12&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>“All right,” I muttered before starting back to my seat.</p>
        <p><em>13&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>“He’s the class clown,” the teacher said, “so don’t let him annoy you too much.” She seemed to be addressing Robert rather than me.</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
                  <img width="77%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyilvwllw/image/upload/v1767483344/y74x2d8nadwgflhxqupc.png" alt="stt19_RC_11">


        </p>
        <p><em>14&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>As I scanned the room, one student hopped on his chair and started acting like a monkey, miming the peeling of a banana and grunting. “He’s the class monkey today,” a student near him said.</p>
        <p><em>15&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>Robert was the perfect shield. While he was distracting the other students, I quickly retreated to my desk.</p>
        <p><em>16&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>The rest of the class time went by fairly quickly. Fortunately, everyone appeared engaged with the teacher’s lesson, so no one was looking my way. When the bell rang, I let most of the students exit before I did. Robert came to my side and asked what was next on my schedule.</p>
        <p><em>17&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>“Science—Room 120B,” I said.</p>
        <p><em>18&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>“You’re going to love that,” Robert said.</p>
        <p><em>19&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>“Really?” I asked.</p>
        <p><em>20&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>“No, not at all. I was kidding,” he quickly replied, smiling. “I’m in there, too, and it’s a true test of my clowning skills to make that class interesting.”</p>
        <p><em>21&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>So we walked together to Room 120B. Robert told me to take a desk near his. After science was math. I was on my own, since Robert went to band class then.</p>
        <p><em>22&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>Robert peeked at my schedule before he left and saw that we both had lunch at the same time. He told me to wait for him outside my math class. I did. I waited and waited, but Robert didn’t show up. I told myself I should have known better and started toward the lunchroom alone.</p>
        <p><em>23&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>Then I heard someone call, “Hey, Michael. Wait up.” Robert was lugging a tuba case.</p>
        <p><em>24&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>That was when I began to think that this move might just work out O.K. “Dude, you play the tuba? That could be so punk!” I said. “Let me tell you what I’ve got in mind.”</p>

        <p>Questions 13 - 15 refer to “<strong>A Brief History of RoboCup</strong>”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the history of artificial intelligence and robotics, the year 1997 will be remembered as a turning point. In May 1997,&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">IBM Deep Blue</span>&nbsp;defeated the human world champion in chess. Forty years of challenge in the AI community came to a successful conclusion. On July 4, 1997, NASA’s&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">MARS Pathfinder mission</span>&nbsp;made a successful landing and the first autonomous robotics system, Sojourner, was deployed on the surface of Mars. Together with these accomplishments, RoboCup made its first steps toward the development of robotic soccer players which can beat a human World Cup champion team.<br>
<br>
The idea of robots playing soccer was first mentioned by&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">Professor Alan Mackworth</span>. Then, independently, a group of Japanese researchers organized a Workshop on Grand Challenges in Artificial Intelligence in October, 1992 in Tokyo, discussing possible grand challenge problems. This workshop led to a series of discussions about using the game of soccer for promoting science and technology. A series of investigations were carried out, including a technology feasibility study, a social impact assessment, and a financial feasibility study. In addition, rules were drafted, as well as prototype development of soccer robots and simulator systems. As a result of these studies, the researchers&nbsp;concluded that the project was feasible and desirable. In June 1993, a group of researchers, including Minoru Asada, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, and Hiroaki Kitano, decided to launch a robot competition, tentatively named the Robot J-League (J-League is the name of the newly established Japanese Professional soccer league). Within a month, however, they received overwhelming reactions from researchers outside of Japan, requesting that the initiative be extended as an international joint project. Accordingly, they renamed the project as the Robot World Cup Initiative, “RoboCup” for short.</p>

        <p>Questions 13 - 15 refer to “<strong>A Brief History of RoboCup</strong>”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the history of artificial intelligence and robotics, the year 1997 will be remembered as a turning point. In May 1997,&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">IBM Deep Blue</span>&nbsp;defeated the human world champion in chess. Forty years of challenge in the AI community came to a successful conclusion. On July 4, 1997, NASA’s&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">MARS Pathfinder mission</span>&nbsp;made a successful landing and the first autonomous robotics system, Sojourner, was deployed on the surface of Mars. Together with these accomplishments, RoboCup made its first steps toward the development of robotic soccer players which can beat a human World Cup champion team.<br>
<br>
The idea of robots playing soccer was first mentioned by&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">Professor Alan Mackworth</span>. Then, independently, a group of Japanese researchers organized a Workshop on Grand Challenges in Artificial Intelligence in October, 1992 in Tokyo, discussing possible grand challenge problems. This workshop led to a series of discussions about using the game of soccer for promoting science and technology. A series of investigations were carried out, including a technology feasibility study, a social impact assessment, and a financial feasibility study. In addition, rules were drafted, as well as prototype development of soccer robots and simulator systems. As a result of these studies, the researchers&nbsp;concluded that the project was feasible and desirable. In June 1993, a group of researchers, including Minoru Asada, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, and Hiroaki Kitano, decided to launch a robot competition, tentatively named the Robot J-League (J-League is the name of the newly established Japanese Professional soccer league). Within a month, however, they received overwhelming reactions from researchers outside of Japan, requesting that the initiative be extended as an international joint project. Accordingly, they renamed the project as the Robot World Cup Initiative, “RoboCup” for short.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <strong>Interview Transcript – Oprah and JK Rowling (author of Harry Potter)</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Winfrey: – That you thought would be particularly stimulating to your creative process. That’s why you wanted to come here? To finish?</p>
        <p>Rowling: Well, it turned out to be stimulating. As I was finishing&nbsp;<em>Deathly Hallows&nbsp;</em>there came a day where the window cleaner came, the kids were at home, the dogs were barking, and I could not work and this light-bulb went on over my head and I thought ‘I can throw money at this problem. I can now solve this problem.’ For years and years and years I just would go to a café and sit in a different kind of noise and work. I thought ‘I can go to a quiet place’. So I came to this hotel because it’s a beautiful hotel, but I didn’t intend to stay here. They were so nice to me here – and I think writers can be a little bit superstitious – so the first day’s writing went well so I kept coming back to this hotel and I ended-up finishing the last of the<em>&nbsp;Harry Potter</em>&nbsp;books in this hotel.</p>
        <p>Winfrey: We have a lot of things in common.</p>
        <p>Rowling: Yeah.</p>
        <p>Winfrey: First of all you know this is the last year that I’m doing the&nbsp;<em>Oprah Show</em>. I will go on and do other things but when I came to the end of&nbsp;<em>Hallows </em>–&nbsp;the ‘last trace of steam evaporated in the autumn air’, ‘the train rounded a corner’, ‘Harry’s hand was still raised in farewell’. ““He’ll be alright,” murmured Ginny. As Harry looked at her he lowered his hand absentmindedly and touched the lightning scar on his forehead. “I know he will”. The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well.” When I came to the end of that I mourned not only for the end of the series but for you. I cannot imagine what that was like.</p>
        <p>Rowling: It was huge.</p>
        <p>Winfrey: I can’t imagine.</p>
        <p>Rowling: I kept – It was a bereavement. It was. It was a bereavement. It was huge. I think one way – although I knew it was coming we all know that the people we love are mortal – we are mortal. We know it’s going to end. You cannot prepare yourself for it. So even though I always knew it would be seven books – that was it. I knew how it was going to end. When it ended I was in a slight state of shock.</p>
        <p>Winfrey: What did you do when you finished?</p>
        <p>Rowling: Well, initially I was elated but then there came a point – I cried as I’ve only ever cried once before in my life and that was when my mother died. It was uncontrollable and I’m&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>a big crier. You know – I cry, but I’m not someone who can sort of keep crying going. You know what I mean? Some people can – do floods for hours. I’ve never – only twice in my life have I done that. For seventeen years I’d had that – through very tumultuous times in my personal life and I – I’d always had that. And if it was an escape for all these children you can imagine what it would have been for me. And it was not just the world. It was the discipline of working and it was the structure it gave to my life and I knew I’d still be writing but I had to mourn Harry.</p>
        <p>Winfrey: Did you know ‘all is well’ was going to be the last line?</p>
        <p>Rowling: Yeah, I did.</p>
