          <strong>Friday the 13<sup>th</sup></strong>
        </p>
        <p>To be superstitious means believing in theories that are not logical or rational in the physical world e.g., believing that certain things, dates or events bring good or bad luck. The number 13 is seen as bad luck by many people and Friday the 13<sup>th</sup> is considered to be the unluckiest day of the year. There is actually a name for the irrational fear of Friday the 13<sup>th</sup>. It’s called <em>friggatriskaidekaphobia</em> and it affects millions of people all over the world. <strong>12 ……….</strong> Symptoms of the phobia include heart palpitations, shortness of breath and a dry mouth and have feelings of panic, terror and dread, in extreme cases. <strong>13 ………</strong></p>
        <p>There are certainly many scary movies and one even titled ‘Friday the 13<sup>th</sup>’, which surely make people’s phobias worse, but this strange condition has been in existence for a very, very long time. As a large number of superstitions and phobias originate from oral tradition, it makes it impossible to be accurate, so a lot of it is guesswork. Thomas Fernsler, an associate policy scientist at the University of Delaware, thinks that people believe that 12 is the ‘perfect’ number. Some instances of 12 are; 12 apostles of Jesus, 12 tribes of Israel, 12 zodiac signs, 12 hours on a clock and 12 months in a year. <strong>14 ……….</strong>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Another fascinating theory comes from the Vikings age (793-1066 AD) in Scandinavia. Donald Dossey, a folklore historian, describes a myth about 12 gods enjoying the banquet of Valhalla. An uninvited guest, Loki, the god of mischief disturbed everyone and had Baldr, the god of joy and gladness killed. <strong>15 ………. </strong>Also, the majority of hotels in the Western world do not have a 13<sup>th</sup> floor. Some airlines do not have a row 13 in their seating and some airports do not have a gate 13, to avoid superstitious passengers and flight crew from panicking. In addition to this, many athletes will not wear the number 13 on their jersey.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The day, Friday even without the date of the 13<sup>th</sup>, has also been seen in a dim light. In the Bible, Jesus Christ was crucified on a Friday and even though the date was not the 13<sup>th</sup> , he died after eating his last meal, known as the Last Supper.<strong> 16 ……….</strong> According to some biblical scholars, Eve could have tempted Adam with the forbidden fruit on a Friday. In addition to this, Adam and Eve’s son, Cain murdered his brother, Abel on a Friday. It seems like Friday was not a great day in the Christian calendar.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Nowadays, Friday the 13<sup>th</sup> can impact the economy because when the ominous date comes around,<em> friggatriskaidekaphobia</em> sufferers tend not to go to work, make big decisions nor do any travelling. It seems that people need not worry at all about Friday the 13<sup>th</sup> because in a 2008 study by the Dutch Centre for Insurance Statistics, it found that there were less car accidents, fires and theft on the 13<sup>th</sup> than on other Fridays.<strong> 17 ……….</strong> It is now very popular for stores to have big sales on Friday the 13<sup>th</sup> to entice people to&nbsp;spend money. In recent years, the sales have been really successful especially with online shopping, so there has been a shift in some people’s mindset surrounding the date.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Friday the 13<sup>th</sup></strong>
        </p>
        <p>To be superstitious means believing in theories that are not logical or rational in the physical world e.g., believing that certain things, dates or events bring good or bad luck. The number 13 is seen as bad luck by many people and Friday the 13<sup>th</sup> is considered to be the unluckiest day of the year. There is actually a name for the irrational fear of Friday the 13<sup>th</sup>. It’s called <em>friggatriskaidekaphobia</em> and it affects millions of people all over the world. <strong>12 ……….</strong> Symptoms of the phobia include heart palpitations, shortness of breath and a dry mouth and have feelings of panic, terror and dread, in extreme cases. <strong>13 ………</strong></p>
        <p>There are certainly many scary movies and one even titled ‘Friday the 13<sup>th</sup>’, which surely make people’s phobias worse, but this strange condition has been in existence for a very, very long time. As a large number of superstitions and phobias originate from oral tradition, it makes it impossible to be accurate, so a lot of it is guesswork. Thomas Fernsler, an associate policy scientist at the University of Delaware, thinks that people believe that 12 is the ‘perfect’ number. Some instances of 12 are; 12 apostles of Jesus, 12 tribes of Israel, 12 zodiac signs, 12 hours on a clock and 12 months in a year. <strong>14 ……….</strong>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Another fascinating theory comes from the Vikings age (793-1066 AD) in Scandinavia. Donald Dossey, a folklore historian, describes a myth about 12 gods enjoying the banquet of Valhalla. An uninvited guest, Loki, the god of mischief disturbed everyone and had Baldr, the god of joy and gladness killed. <strong>15 ………. </strong>Also, the majority of hotels in the Western world do not have a 13<sup>th</sup> floor. Some airlines do not have a row 13 in their seating and some airports do not have a gate 13, to avoid superstitious passengers and flight crew from panicking. In addition to this, many athletes will not wear the number 13 on their jersey.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The day, Friday even without the date of the 13<sup>th</sup>, has also been seen in a dim light. In the Bible, Jesus Christ was crucified on a Friday and even though the date was not the 13<sup>th</sup> , he died after eating his last meal, known as the Last Supper.<strong> 16 ……….</strong> According to some biblical scholars, Eve could have tempted Adam with the forbidden fruit on a Friday. In addition to this, Adam and Eve’s son, Cain murdered his brother, Abel on a Friday. It seems like Friday was not a great day in the Christian calendar.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Nowadays, Friday the 13<sup>th</sup> can impact the economy because when the ominous date comes around,<em> friggatriskaidekaphobia</em> sufferers tend not to go to work, make big decisions nor do any travelling. It seems that people need not worry at all about Friday the 13<sup>th</sup> because in a 2008 study by the Dutch Centre for Insurance Statistics, it found that there were less car accidents, fires and theft on the 13<sup>th</sup> than on other Fridays.<strong> 17 ……….</strong> It is now very popular for stores to have big sales on Friday the 13<sup>th</sup> to entice people to&nbsp;spend money. In recent years, the sales have been really successful especially with online shopping, so there has been a shift in some people’s mindset surrounding the date.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
For more than 100 years, various sports for athletes with an impairment have taken place. However, the official Paralympics didn’t start to evolve until after World War II. It was formed to help the many war veterans and civilians who were sadly injured during the war.<br>
<br>
Dr Ludwig Guttmann, a German-British neurologist (a specialist physician who diagnoses and treats conditions of the brain, spinal cord and nerves) opened a spinal injuries centre at the Stoke Mandeville Hospital. The hospital is in England and still operates today. The spinal centre was established in 1944 to treat people who had significant injuries, as requested by the British government.<br>
<br>
Over the years, activities that were initially designed to get patients up and moving to help their injuries, turned into recreational sport which then became competitive sport.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Just four years after the spinal injuries centre opened, during the same time as the 1948 Olympic Games in London took place, an archery competition for 16 wheelchair athletes was organised by Dr Guttmann. Then, after another four years, The Stoke Mandeville Games became an international event when Dutch ex-servicemen joined.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
In 1960, these games transformed into the first Paralympic Games which were held in Rome. It featured 400 athletes from 23 countries. Ever since then, like the Olympics, the Paralympic Games have been held every four years around the world. Since the Summer Games of 1988 and the Winter Games of 1992, the Olympic and Paralympic Games have been held at the same host cities and venues<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
At this present time, there are 28 Paralympic sports sanctioned by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC). There are 22 summer sports and six winter sports. Some of the many summer sports include archery, athletics, cycling, equestrian, swimming, triathlon, wheelchair tennis and wheelchair rugby. The six winter sports are alpine skiing, biathlon, cross-country skiing, ice hockey, snowboard and wheelchair curling.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The newest winter sport is snowboard and that was introduced in the Sochi 2014 Paralympic Winter Games. In the recently passed Tokyo 2020 Games, two new sports, badminton and taekwondo made their exciting debut. Even if people aren’t usually massive sports fan, they are sure to find something to watch that interests them.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Being a Paralympian is a truly amazing and admirable achievement and these athletes face many challenges, both personally and professionally. But perhaps the most incredible people are Paralympians who are refugees. Their bravery, strength, talent and determination are nothing short of inspiring.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
This year at the Tokyo 2020 Games, the Refugee Paralympic Team consisted of six outstanding athletes; Parfait Hakizimana (taekwondo), Anas Al Khalifa (canoeing), Alia Issa (athletics), Ibrahim Al Hussein (swimming), Shahrad Nasajpour (discus-throwing) and Abbas Karimi (swimming). All of these immensely talented athletes have devastating, shocking and emotional stories but they have overcome many obstacles to compete in the games.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The team is a representation of over 82.4 million people worldwide who have been forced to flee their homes due to wars, persecution and abuse of their human rights. Unfortunately, 12 million refugees have a disability. The Refugee Paralympic Team’s aim is to give hope and promote inclusion for refugees with disabilities.</p>

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
For more than 100 years, various sports for athletes with an impairment have taken place. However, the official Paralympics didn’t start to evolve until after World War II. It was formed to help the many war veterans and civilians who were sadly injured during the war.<br>
<br>
Dr Ludwig Guttmann, a German-British neurologist (a specialist physician who diagnoses and treats conditions of the brain, spinal cord and nerves) opened a spinal injuries centre at the Stoke Mandeville Hospital. The hospital is in England and still operates today. The spinal centre was established in 1944 to treat people who had significant injuries, as requested by the British government.<br>
<br>
Over the years, activities that were initially designed to get patients up and moving to help their injuries, turned into recreational sport which then became competitive sport.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Just four years after the spinal injuries centre opened, during the same time as the 1948 Olympic Games in London took place, an archery competition for 16 wheelchair athletes was organised by Dr Guttmann. Then, after another four years, The Stoke Mandeville Games became an international event when Dutch ex-servicemen joined.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
In 1960, these games transformed into the first Paralympic Games which were held in Rome. It featured 400 athletes from 23 countries. Ever since then, like the Olympics, the Paralympic Games have been held every four years around the world. Since the Summer Games of 1988 and the Winter Games of 1992, the Olympic and Paralympic Games have been held at the same host cities and venues<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
At this present time, there are 28 Paralympic sports sanctioned by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC). There are 22 summer sports and six winter sports. Some of the many summer sports include archery, athletics, cycling, equestrian, swimming, triathlon, wheelchair tennis and wheelchair rugby. The six winter sports are alpine skiing, biathlon, cross-country skiing, ice hockey, snowboard and wheelchair curling.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The newest winter sport is snowboard and that was introduced in the Sochi 2014 Paralympic Winter Games. In the recently passed Tokyo 2020 Games, two new sports, badminton and taekwondo made their exciting debut. Even if people aren’t usually massive sports fan, they are sure to find something to watch that interests them.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Being a Paralympian is a truly amazing and admirable achievement and these athletes face many challenges, both personally and professionally. But perhaps the most incredible people are Paralympians who are refugees. Their bravery, strength, talent and determination are nothing short of inspiring.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
This year at the Tokyo 2020 Games, the Refugee Paralympic Team consisted of six outstanding athletes; Parfait Hakizimana (taekwondo), Anas Al Khalifa (canoeing), Alia Issa (athletics), Ibrahim Al Hussein (swimming), Shahrad Nasajpour (discus-throwing) and Abbas Karimi (swimming). All of these immensely talented athletes have devastating, shocking and emotional stories but they have overcome many obstacles to compete in the games.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The team is a representation of over 82.4 million people worldwide who have been forced to flee their homes due to wars, persecution and abuse of their human rights. Unfortunately, 12 million refugees have a disability. The Refugee Paralympic Team’s aim is to give hope and promote inclusion for refugees with disabilities.<br>

        <p>The game of “Noughts and Crosses” uses a grid like the one shown below. Each player chooses either 0’s or X’s. They take turns to fill in one of the empty squares in the grid. To win the game you need to place three of your symbols in a line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. In the grid shown below, the 0’s won as there are three 0’s in a line. Often in “Noughts and Crosses” there is no winner, which means that all the squares in the grid are filled, and neither player has made a line.<br>
<br>
Sam and Tom wanted to make their own “Noughts and Crosses” game, so they drew a grid on a piece of cardboard and then Sam found some blue bottle lids to use for 0’s and Tom found some green bottle lids to use for X’s.&nbsp;</p>
