          <strong>Long-nosed fur seals&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Recently, there was a sighting of a long-nosed fur seal in Victoria. This fur seal was tagged in Tasmania when it was a pup, 25 years ago. This particular male fur seal was born on Maatsyuker Island. <strong>12 ………. </strong>The fur seal was tagged with ‘830’ in 1996, so that researchers could track the movements of the special animal. The wildlife officers in Victoria who discovered the fur seal saw his tag and decided to find out where he came from.</p>
        <p>When marine biologist, Sam Thalmann from the Tasmanian environment department received news that the fur seal had been sighted in Victoria, he stated, “We were excited to respond to this call and gain important updated information from research activities conducted more than 20 years ago.” <strong>13 ………. </strong>Seeing as though this particular fur seal is now 25 years old, it has given researchers thrilling and interesting new knowledge that wild fur seals in Australia could have a longer lifespan than originally thought. Another piece of good news is that the fur seal was in great physical condition and hopefully he will do well in the years to come.</p>
        <p>The coasts of south-eastern Australia, southern New South Wales and also New Zealand are where long-nosed fur seals can be found. Sadly, in the 1800s, these lovely seals were hunted until they were nearly extinct. <strong>14 ………. </strong>Seal hunters sent at least 100,000 skins from the Kangaroo Island region alone, between 1800 and 1830. It took the fur seal population a long time to recover.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In 1987, the small population of fur seals recolonised in the waters of Tasmania and formed a breeding colony on Maatsuyker Island. When the male seal who was discovered in Victoria was tagged 25 years ago, less than 100 pups were born per year. Now, there are around 117,000 fur seals swimming around Australia and New Zealand, which is an improvement but the population is still quite low. <strong>15 ……….</strong> People face fines of up to $100,000 for killing or harming them.</p>
        <p>If people are lucky enough to see these beautiful fur seals in the wild, they can often be seen with their flippers in the air, floating. This regulates their body temperature and is called ‘sailing’ or ‘jug handling’. Humans should never approach fur seals because they are very big and strong wild animals.<strong> 16 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>It is also important to know that humans should never feed any marine mammals. Seals tend to eat squid, cuttlefish, lobster and, of course, fish. Feeding seals can cause them to be dependent on people. <strong>17 ……….</strong> This can cause problems for the person fishing as well as the animal as injuries can occur.</p>

<p>Most people around the world have heard of Disney but people may not know about who Walt Disney was as a man and all of his fantastic achievements. Walter Elias Disney was born on 5<sup>th</sup> December 1901, in Chicago, USA. He was a motion picture and television producer as well as a pioneer of cartoon films. He created the extraordinarily famous cartoon character, Mickey Mouse and was the founder of the thrilling and family fun theme parks, Disneyland and Disney World.<br>
<br>
On 15<sup>th</sup> December 1966, Disney sadly died from lung cancer. Soon after his death, a very bizarre rumour began spreading that Disney’s body was frozen and buried beneath the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland California. It was thought that somehow when medical technology was advanced enough, he could be brought back to life. Disney’s daughter, Diane, has stated that this is definitely just a rumour but can anyone really be sure?<br>
&nbsp;<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Disney and his brother, Roy founded The Walt Disney Studios after working at Kansas City Film Ad Company. During his time working at the ad company, he made cut out animated commercials and started playing around with hand drawn animation using cameras. This really sparked his interest in animation and led to him opening up his own studio.<br>
<br>
In the late 1920s, the cartoons featuring Mickey Mouse and his friends were created. The first successful film starring the lovable Mickey Mouse was called Steamboat Willie. It’s hard to imagine now, with all the technology we have today, but at the time, sound was only just beginning to be available in films. Walt Disney voiced Mickey Mouse and the character was drawn by Ub Iwerks, the chief animator at the studio. Steamboat Willie and Mickey Mouse were an immediate hit with the general public. This was the start of the popularity of the enthusiastic, little mouse whom we still love today.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
During the time that Disney was alive, he produced more than 100 feature films. His first full-length animated film premiered in 1937 and that film was Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. It was so unbelievably successful that it generated $1.499 million. That was a huge amount of money in those days and an even greater achievement because it was during the Great Depression. The Great Depression (1929-1939) was the worst economic crisis in the history of the industrialised world. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs also won eight Oscars, which are awards for artistic and technical excellence in the film industry.</p>

<p>This immense success motivated The Walt Disney Studios to keep producing full-length films. In 1964, Walt Disney’s final masterpiece was the motion picture Mary Poppins. He produced it by himself and it was a mix of live action and animation. Since his death in 1966, The Walt Disney Studios has produced a massive number of entertaining and very iconic films and television shows. There are simply too many to mention here!<br>

In 1955, in California, USA, Disney opened its first, fantastic, family friendly theme park called Disneyland. The land was once an orange grove and was transformed into a world of wonder, excitement and where dreams come true. Disneyland soon had a reputation as the ultimate family destination. Children and adults alike could enjoy the food, rides and meet the all-important and special Disney characters. The theme park was very profitable and tourists were swiftly coming from all over the world. Disneyland theme parks are now located in Orlando, Florida, Tokyo, Paris, Hong Kong and Shanghai. There are now several Disney Worlds and Disney Resorts. At the multiple Disney Resorts, families can stay in variety of Disney themed hotel rooms, villas, bungalows and even camp, to have the ultimate, unforgettable Disney experience.<br>

It’s hard to imagine now, with all the technology we have today, but at the time, sound was only just beginning to be available in films. Walt Disney voiced Mickey Mouse and the character was drawn by Ub Iwerks, the chief animator at the studio. Steamboat Willie and Mickey Mouse were an immediate hit with the general public.

During the time that Disney was alive, he produced more than 100 feature films. His first full-length animated film premiered in 1937 and that film was Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. It was so unbelievably successful that it generated $1.499 million. That was a huge amount of money in those days and an even greater achievement because it was during the Great Depression. The Great Depression (1929-1939) was the worst economic crisis in the history of the industrialised world. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs also won eight Oscars, which are awards for artistic and technical excellence in the film industry.</p>

<p>Most people around the world have heard of Disney but people may not know about who Walt Disney was as a man and all of his fantastic achievements. Walter Elias Disney was born on 5<sup>th</sup> December 1901, in Chicago, USA. He was a motion picture and television producer as well as a pioneer of cartoon films. He created the extraordinarily famous cartoon character, Mickey Mouse and was the founder of the thrilling and family fun theme parks, Disneyland and Disney World.<br>
<br>
On 15<sup>th</sup> December 1966, Disney sadly died from lung cancer. Soon after his death, a very bizarre rumour began spreading that Disney’s body was frozen and buried beneath the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland California. It was thought that somehow when medical technology was advanced enough, he could be brought back to life. Disney’s daughter, Diane, has stated that this is definitely just a rumour but can anyone really be sure?<br>
