        <p>Questions 9 - 11 relate to the extract from “The Secret Garden” by Frances Hodgsen Burnett:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was the sweetest, most mysterious-looking place anyone could imagine. The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of climbing roses, which were so thick that they were matted together. Mary Lennox knew they were roses because she had seen a great many roses in India. All the ground was covered with grass of a wintry brown, and out of it grew clumps of bushes which were surely rose-bushes if they were alive. There were numbers of standard roses which had so spread their branches that they were like little trees. There were other trees in the garden, and one of the things which made the place look strangest and loveliest was that climbing roses had run all over them and swung down long tendrils which made light swaying curtains, and here and there they had caught at each other or at a far-reaching branch and had crept from one tree to another and made lovely bridges of themselves. There were neither leaves nor roses on them now, and Mary did not know whether they were dead or alive, but their thin grey or brown branches and sprays looked like a sort of hazy mantle spreading over everything, walls and trees and even brown grass, where they had fallen from their fastenings and run along the ground. It was this hazy tangle from tree to tree which made it look so mysterious. Mary had thought it must be different from other gardens which had not been left all by themselves so long; and indeed, it was different from any other place she had ever seen in her life.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“How still it is!” she whispered. “How still!”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then she waited a moment and listened at the stillness. The robin, who had flown to his treetop, was still as all the rest. He did not even flutter his wings; he sat without stirring, and looked at Mary.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“No wonder it is still,” she whispered again. “I am the first person who has spoken in here for ten years.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She moved away from the door, stepping as softly as if she were afraid of awakening someone. She was glad that there was grass under her feet and that her steps made no sounds. She walked under one of the fairy-like arches between the trees and looked up at the sprays and tendrils which formed them.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I wonder if they are all quite dead,” she said. “Is it all a quite dead garden? I wish it wasn’t.”</p>

          <strong>Making Wine and Vinegar</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When wine grapes are picked at the end of summer, they are crushed soon after they are picked. Wine grapes are either crushed by treading on them or by machine. If people trample the grapes with their feet, the weight is not great enough to crush the seeds and add bitterness to the juice. Grapes are still trodden in some parts of Spain and Portugal, but most are crushed by machines. Their juice (called <em>must</em>) mixes with the wine yeast found in the grapes themselves and starts to ferment. The wine yeast works to change the sugar in the must into alcohol, although there are many ferments that may spoil the wine. The wine maker exposes the must to the air, since the wine yeast thrives on oxygen and the bad ferments do not. The temperature of fermenting grape juice is also controlled, since the wine yeast works best at 24 degrees Celsius. When fermentation stops (10-30 days), the juice is transferred to a large wooden vessel called a cask. Six or nine months later, the product is wine. The wine may be bottled at once or, if it is very good quality, it may be left to mature for some months in the cask.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Vinegar is made from wine in countries where wine is made, but it may also be made from malted barley, apples, sugar or rice. Whatever alcoholic liquid is used is pumped into a vessel that is capable of holding up to 45,000 litres, although it is only half filled. In the middle of the vessel is a stage on which layers of birch twigs are placed, and below this air holes are bored in. The liquid is then pumped over the birch twigs through a sparge, which is just like the sprinkler used for watering gardens. This way, a large amount of the liquid is exposed to the air. The process takes about six days; after this time, the vinegar is kept for some months in large storage vessels for the right flavour to be produced.</p>

  A hang glider spends time at around a couple hundred feet, at most. Thus, malfunctions only have a couple of seconds to be fixed (in skydiving you have a few minutes to fix a malfunctioning wing). Thus, hang gliding cannot match skydiving’s safety record. In hang gliding reserve, parachutes are not mandatory, and are small round parachutes which can result in bone crunching landings. Skydiving reserve parachutes are square parachutes similar to the main parachute.&nbsp;<br>
