          <strong>Extract A : From <em>Beauty Really IS Skin Deep</em> by Lizzie Parry&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It's long been thought that symmetrical facial features are a sign of being more attractive, signalling a person's good health. But new research has revealed beauty really is just skin deep, and does not protect against illness.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A study of almost 5,000 British teenagers found those with symmetrical facial features - regarded by many as being more attractive - were just as likely to fall ill as their asymmetrical counterparts. The research flies in the face of previous findings that suggest there are fewer cases of illness among physically desirable people.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A team led by Dr Nicholas Pound, of Brunel University, used 3D face scans of 15-year-olds taking part to compare their features with a range of common illnesses as they grew up. They found no association between the rate of 16 infections - including measles, mumps, tonsilitis, flu and glandular fever - and a person's looks. In addition, when analysing symptoms including diarrhoea, vomiting, high temperature and earache, researchers found no link with good looks.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, another study of 15,000 young men and women found the more attractive they were rated, the less likely they were to suffer from a wide range of health problems including asthma, diabetes and high blood pressure. Researchers in the U.S. said good looks may be a marker of good genes, which also signal good health, as well as increasing the likelihood of having healthy offspring.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The men and women were put into five categories - very unattractive, unattractive, about average, attractive or very attractive. The more attractive the person was rated, the lower the risk of ill health. For instance, for each increase in the rating of physical attractiveness for men, there was a 13 per cent reduction in the likelihood of a diagnosis for high cholesterol, a 20 per cent drop in the risk of high blood pressure and a 15 per cent reduction in the probability of being diagnosed with depression.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Women who were rated as more attractive were 21 per cent less likely to be diagnosed with high blood pressure, 22 per cent less likely to have diabetes, 12 per cent less likely to be asthmatic and 17 per cent less likely to suffer from depression. Both the men and women who were rated as very physically attractive were also more positive about their own health and had fewer days off work due to illness.</p>

          <strong>Extract B : From <em>More than Skin Deep, Beauty Enriches Lives </em>by Elizabeth Farrelly</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Numerous studies point to the importance of beauty to wellbeing. People heal faster after surgery when they look onto green space. Fine art practice helps people with mental illness. Singing lifts the spirit. Yet this is still peering through the wrong end of the telescope; still valuing beauty in terms of utility.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The point is, beauty doesn't just make you feel better; it makes you feel differently. Only when we value beauty for its own sake – not for any measurable utility, for its status value or health outcomes but beauty for beauty – do we experience its beneficence.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To love beauty for its own sake is to transcend the ego. Beauty, wrote Iris Murdoch (under her Oxford philosopher mantle), is "the magnetism which draws us out of the cave". It is what the mystics mean when they talk of "losing yourself". This clearly moves into the realm of the spirit, which is why beauty has traditionally centred almost all forms of sacred ritual.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This is about learning to love nature not for her sustenance, as infants might, but as evolved subjects, for her own sake. In buildings and cities, where the reign of the blockheads is even more entrenched, the beauty question is even more embarrassing – but also more important.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Extract A : From <em>Beauty Really IS Skin Deep</em> by Lizzie Parry&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It's long been thought that symmetrical facial features are a sign of being more attractive, signalling a person's good health. But new research has revealed beauty really is just skin deep, and does not protect against illness.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A study of almost 5,000 British teenagers found those with symmetrical facial features - regarded by many as being more attractive - were just as likely to fall ill as their asymmetrical counterparts. The research flies in the face of previous findings that suggest there are fewer cases of illness among physically desirable people.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A team led by Dr Nicholas Pound, of Brunel University, used 3D face scans of 15-year-olds taking part to compare their features with a range of common illnesses as they grew up. They found no association between the rate of 16 infections - including measles, mumps, tonsilitis, flu and glandular fever - and a person's looks. In addition, when analysing symptoms including diarrhoea, vomiting, high temperature and earache, researchers found no link with good looks.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, another study of 15,000 young men and women found the more attractive they were rated, the less likely they were to suffer from a wide range of health problems including asthma, diabetes and high blood pressure. Researchers in the U.S. said good looks may be a marker of good genes, which also signal good health, as well as increasing the likelihood of having healthy offspring.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The men and women were put into five categories - very unattractive, unattractive, about average, attractive or very attractive. The more attractive the person was rated, the lower the risk of ill health. For instance, for each increase in the rating of physical attractiveness for men, there was a 13 per cent reduction in the likelihood of a diagnosis for high cholesterol, a 20 per cent drop in the risk of high blood pressure and a 15 per cent reduction in the probability of being diagnosed with depression.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Women who were rated as more attractive were 21 per cent less likely to be diagnosed with high blood pressure, 22 per cent less likely to have diabetes, 12 per cent less likely to be asthmatic and 17 per cent less likely to suffer from depression. Both the men and women who were rated as very physically attractive were also more positive about their own health and had fewer days off work due to illness.</p>

          <strong>Extract B : From <em>More than Skin Deep, Beauty Enriches Lives </em>by Elizabeth Farrelly</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Numerous studies point to the importance of beauty to wellbeing. People heal faster after surgery when they look onto green space. Fine art practice helps people with mental illness. Singing lifts the spirit. Yet this is still peering through the wrong end of the telescope; still valuing beauty in terms of utility.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The point is, beauty doesn't just make you feel better; it makes you feel differently. Only when we value beauty for its own sake – not for any measurable utility, for its status value or health outcomes but beauty for beauty – do we experience its beneficence.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To love beauty for its own sake is to transcend the ego. Beauty, wrote Iris Murdoch (under her Oxford philosopher mantle), is "the magnetism which draws us out of the cave". It is what the mystics mean when they talk of "losing yourself". This clearly moves into the realm of the spirit, which is why beauty has traditionally centred almost all forms of sacred ritual.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This is about learning to love nature not for her sustenance, as infants might, but as evolved subjects, for her own sake. In buildings and cities, where the reign of the blockheads is even more entrenched, the beauty question is even more embarrassing – but also more important.&nbsp;</p>

Why does the beauty question become more embarrassing yet important at the end of Extract B?<br>

            <p>Pure (distilled) water has no flavor. Most naturally occurring waters contain some minerals and these impart a ‘taste.’ Many bottled waters have a label statement to the effect that minerals have been added for taste. These are usually calcium, magnesium, and potassium. People perceive the tastes of different minerals and the concentration of minerals but most people find the taste of a small quantity of dissolved minerals preferable to the lack of taste in distilled water. If you are accustomed to drinking water with some mineral content you may perceive that distilled water ‘tastes’ unusual even though it doesn’t contain any material that can actually be tasted.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;- Richard&nbsp;</p>

            <p>For thousands of years, philosophers claimed that water had no flavour. It’s the baseline for the sense of taste, they said—a starting point and null condition. What water is to tongues, darkness is to eyes and silence is to ears. “The natural substance water per se tends to be tasteless,” wrote Aristotle. In his view, it serves only as the vehicle for flavor. But eventually, scientists began to notice that a draught of pure distilled water could provoke a certain taste. Some found it bitter on the tongue; others said it was insipid. By the 1920s, evidence was mounting that water changes flavor depending on what you happen to have tasted just before. Take a sip of Poland Spring after putting something acidic on your tongue, and it may taste a little sweet. Drink some after eating salt, and it could have a hint of bitterness.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Pure (distilled) water has no flavor. Most naturally occurring waters contain some minerals and these impart a ‘taste.’ Many bottled waters have a label statement to the effect that minerals have been added for taste. These are usually calcium, magnesium, and potassium. People perceive the tastes of different minerals and the concentration of minerals but most people find the taste of a small quantity of dissolved minerals preferable to the lack of taste in distilled water. If you are accustomed to drinking water with some mineral content you may perceive that distilled water ‘tastes’ unusual even though it doesn’t contain any material that can actually be tasted.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;- Richard&nbsp;</p>

        <p>In 1912 John Bradfield, a civil engineer with the New South Wales Department of Public Works, presented plans to Australia’s parliament for the construction of a bridge over Sydney Harbour, with options for either a suspension bridge or a cantilever bridge design. <strong>27 _______</strong> The year after Bradfield submitted his plans, his cantilever design was accepted, and he was appointed to lead the project. Work on the bridge was delayed by World War I, however, and it was not until 1922, with the passage of the Sydney Harbour Bridge Act, that funding for the project became available. <strong>28 _______</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The building contract was awarded to the English enterprise Dorman Long &amp; Co., which hired Sir Ralph Freeman to perform detailed design work. <strong>29 _______</strong> An arch bridge was chosen because it was less expensive than a cantilever design and capable of handling heavier loads. Construction began in 1924 under Bradfield’s supervision. The deep waters of Sydney Harbour made temporary supports impractical, so the steel arch was assembled by building out from each bank. The two sides met in the middle in 1930, and the bridge was officially opened with an elaborate ceremony on March 19, 1932.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Despite Bradfield’s submission of proposals for the bridge design, Freeman considered himself to be the bridge’s true designer.<strong> 30 _______</strong></p>

          <strong>THE SYDNEY HARBOUR BRIDGE&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Sydney Harbour Bridge </strong>is a steel-arch bridge built across Sydney Harbour (Port Jackson), Australia. The bridge, opened in 1932, serves as the primary transportation link between Sydney and its suburbs on the northern side of the harbour. <strong>26 _______ </strong>Along its length, it features four railroad tracks, a highway, and two pedestrian walkways.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In 1912 John Bradfield, a civil engineer with the New South Wales Department of Public Works, presented plans to Australia’s parliament for the construction of a bridge over Sydney Harbour, with options for either a suspension bridge or a cantilever bridge design. <strong>27 _______</strong> The year after Bradfield submitted his plans, his cantilever design was accepted, and he was appointed to lead the project. Work on the bridge was delayed by World War I, however, and it was not until 1922, with the passage of the Sydney Harbour Bridge Act, that funding for the project became available. <strong>28 _______</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The building contract was awarded to the English enterprise Dorman Long &amp; Co., which hired Sir Ralph Freeman to perform detailed design work. <strong>29 _______</strong> An arch bridge was chosen because it was less expensive than a cantilever design and capable of handling heavier loads. Construction began in 1924 under Bradfield’s supervision. The deep waters of Sydney Harbour made temporary supports impractical, so the steel arch was assembled by building out from each bank. The two sides met in the middle in 1930, and the bridge was officially opened with an elaborate ceremony on March 19, 1932.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Despite Bradfield’s submission of proposals for the bridge design, Freeman considered himself to be the bridge’s true designer.<strong> 30 _______</strong></p>
