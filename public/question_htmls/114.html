            <strong>Introduction</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp;Photographs, maps, oral accounts, and written records are not the only clues to the past. Buildings and places are records, too. Old buildings are part of a community’s past as well as its present. Long after its original occupants are gone, a building remains as a reminder of the human activities it once enclosed. Remodeling may make an old building look modern or adjust it for new uses, but something of the past is always there. A building’s location, the materials used to construct it, the way it looks, and its uses all reflect life in a town as it used to be.</p>

            <strong>Locations Of Buildings</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>Most towns expanded around a main street. This part of town was busy with foot traffic, vehicles, children, pigs, and dogs. Hotels, blacksmith shops, saloons, livery stables, restaurants, and government buildings lined main street. It was here that railroads and stagelines had their offices. Property was expensive on main street, so land was not wasted. Buildings were huddled together and expanded up, rather than out.</p>
        <p>Private homes and boarding houses surrounded the business district. Working people who walked to work lived in <span class="txt-underline">residences</span> near their jobs. Those who could afford to own carriages and horses lived at the edge of town away from the noise and dirt of main street. Large lots and yards separated one home from another. Churches and schools were usually built in residential areas.</p>
        <p>With the introduction of street cars and automobiles, people could move farther from the center of town. They no longer had to live near work or shopping areas. Streets were made longer and wider for automobiles, and parking lots and garages replaced the livery stables and blacksmith shops. Buildings could be put almost anywhere. Distance was no longer a big problem.</p>
        <p>

            <strong>Building Materials</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;In Nevada, building materials were scarce. There were few forests to provide lumber and no quick and easy supply of bricks and cement. Some of the earliest buildings were made of sun dried mud and straw bricks called adobe. Very few of these adobe buildings are left any more. Wind and water have washed their walls back into the soil.</p>
        <p>As people streamed into the state seeking quick mining riches, they would build “rag towns” with materials at hand. Shelters were made from cloth which was stretched tent-like over wooden frames. When available, logs and stones were used as building materials. Even large pieces of metal were put up to protect against the weather.</p>
        <p>When mining booms began, more services as well as more buildings were needed. Bricklayers, carpenters, and other craftsmen came to build. Stone quarries were opened. Brick ovens were built. Wood was cut from the Sierra forests and shipped throughout the state by wagon or railroad. Houses, barns, businesses, churches, and govern ment buildings were built for the quickly expanding population.</p>

            <strong>Style</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>Buildings are much like people. They come in different shapes, sizes, and colors. They do different things, and they have different moods. Some are bright and delicate with frills everywhere. They seem playful and inviting. <strong>Others are dark, sturdy blocks that take themselves very seriously</strong>. Once in a while, you might meet a quiet, plain building that looks like an old friend. To a h istorian, all of these things are part of a building’s style.</p>
        <p>Style is a clue to a building’s age. It also tells something about what was thought to be “good taste” by those who built and used the structure. There are special words to describe a building’s style and parts of a building.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;Some names come from the period when the building and others like it were built. Some come from earlier periods; these were copied or revived (renewed). Most buildings in Nevada are a mixture of styles. However, two styles strongly influenced early Nevada builders, Greek Revival and Victorian.</p>
        <p>From 1820 to 1840, it was very popular in the United States to have buildings look like Greek temples. The special marks of this style, called Greek Revival, are pillared porches, low, sometimes flat roofs, corniced eaves, and pediments. Many public buildings and mansions in Washington, D.C. were Greek Revival, and this style was brought west with settlers. It was in fashion in California and Nevada by 1860.</p>
        <p>A Greek Revival building is simple and square. A Victorian one is an explosion of rooms, angles, and wooden icicles. The style was named for the period from 1836 to about 1900 when Queen Victor ia’s taste ruled England and America. Victorian buildings have steeply pitched roofs with barge-board trim and arched windows. Structures move up and out with bays and additions. Carpenters could buy books with floor plans and ready made trim patterns. These patterns could be cut cheaply out of wood to decorate a house.</p>

          <strong>Keep Going</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>My toes don’t hurt anymore. That’s not good.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;All day, Ted’s feet had been feeling like someone was slowly moving a blowtorch back and forth beneath his soles. But now he couldn’t feel his toes at all. When he removed a boot to take a look, Ted was surprised by the waxy, grayish color of his feet. His toes felt like small nubs of wood between his fingers. He decided that he had preferred the pain.</p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Keep going.</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The snowfall had been epic. Ted didn’t know such a snowfall was possible, but Ted had never hiked the Sierra Nevadas in winter before. In fact, he had never hiked any mountains before. Being a city boy, the nearest thing to a mountain Ted had hiked had been the time he had done the Empire State Building climb—an annual race up the stairs of the landmark skyscraper. It was an incredible challenge that did absolutely nothing to prepare Ted for hiking the Sierra Nevada mountains in winter.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>So tired. Keep going.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The trip had been ill planned from the beginning. Ted and a few friends from school had decided on a whim to drive up to the mountains for a day hike. They threw a few things into school knapsacks—energy bars, water bottles, gum—and hit the road. Nobody bothered to check the weather report.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>&nbsp;I should sit down. No—Keep going.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody was sure how Ted got separated from the group. Even Ted wasn’t sure. They had all been hiking down a trail together when Ted paused, just paused, ever so briefly to look at a deer in the distance. He had never seen a deer in the wild before, and it took him by surprise. It occurred to Ted to take a picture, but as he fumbled for his camera, the deer spooked and ran off. Disappointed, Ted turned back to his friends. They weren’t there.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>This looks familiar. No, maybe it doesn’t. Keep going.</em></p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Ted set off quickly down the path. He thought he’d just jog a bit to catch up to them. But he was soon presented with a fork in the path. Left or right? Ted listened briefly and thought he heard voices in that direction. To the left. He ran.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Am I absolutely sure I have nothing to make fire? Yes, I’m sure. Check again.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After running for a while, Ted stopped and listened. He heard a lot of sounds—birds, wind, maybe fl owing water, creaking tree limbs—but no voices. No laughing. No people. In a fl ash Ted remembered his cell phone. The wave of relief that washed over him made him realize how&nbsp; uncomfortably close he had been to panic. He’d call one of his friends and they’d figure out how to find each other. Ted flipped open his phone. “No Service.”</p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Last piece of gum. I’ll swallow it. At least I’ll have something in my stomach.</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of finding his friends, Ted decided to find his way back to the car. He knew that they had been hiking downhill and away from the sun, so it made sense to hike uphill toward the sun. Ted thought the ridge ahead looked familiar. He crested the ridge only to find another, identical ridge before him. And so it went.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>So tired. Find a place to sit. Maybe a little further.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Ted walked all that first day. When it got dark, he used his cell phone as a flashlight to stumble his way along. It was only after the battery died that Ted made a bed of pine boughs and lay down for a fitful sleep. He was up with the first light of dawn, moving.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>I’ve been here before. I’m going in circles. I should stop.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The second day was much the same as the first—except for the weather. The temperature began to drop and the sky took on a menacing look. The snow started just after noon. The blizzard raged on. It was in the midst of this hundred-year blizzard that Ted discovered that he could no longer feel his toes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Maybe if I just sit and wait, someone will find me.</em></p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As Ted struggled to continue, he felt the great weight of his fatigue pushing him down.</p>
        <p>He slumped down in the snow. Two ridges over, a search party was on the move. They had been tracking Ted since a few hours after he had been separated from his friends. When they realized Ted was not with them, his friends immediately returned to the car and drove to a place where they could get a cell phone signal. A Ranger search party was on the scene within an hour.</p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I’ll wait.</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Since the beginning, the Rangers had been just behind Ted. He was never more than an hour or two from rescue. But the weather and Ted’s constant motion had left the Rangers struggling to keep up. They were amazed that he could keep going. If only he would stop for a while, they would soon catch up to him.</p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Someone will come soon.</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As Ted sat, his mind began to wander.</p>
        <p>25&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>&nbsp;A little boy walks through an aquarium with his classmates. He is a restless little boy, never wanting to linger at the exhibits like the other children. He always wants to see what’s around the next corner. Around that next corner are sharks. The tour guide explains that most sharks must keep moving in order to breathe. This small bit of trivia nestles itself deep within the boy’s mind. It makes sense to him.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Ted snapped back into the present. He forced himself to stand on his wooden feet.</p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Keep going.</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;His brain <span class="txt-underline">foggy</span> with fatigue and cold, Ted mistakenly set off in the direction he had come, following his own footsteps as if they were a guide trail. It was the first good decision he had made in days.</p>

          <strong>The Deepest Place on Earth</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You may know that the highest place on Earth is the top of a mountain named Mt. Everest, but do you know what the deepest place on Earth is? It is a very unusual place called the Mariana Trench.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mariana Trench is located in the Pacific Ocean, south of Japan. It is named the Mariana Trench because it is near the Mariana Islands.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mariana Trench is like an enormous ditch at the bottom of the ocean. The trench is over 1,500 miles long, and some parts of the trench are 40 miles wide. If you could dive to the bottom of the trench, you would be over 35,000 feet deep. That is almost seven miles below the surface of the ocean!</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In fact, the Mariana Trench is so big and deep that Mt. Everest could fit inside the trench. And if Mt. Everest were inside the trench, there would still be about 7,000 feet of water between the top of the mountain and the surface of the ocean.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The water in the trench is so cold it is almost freezing. Some areas in the trench are very hot, though. These areas are called <strong>hydrothermal vents</strong>. The vents are openings in the earth through which very hot water shoots up through the ocean floor like smoke from a chimney. The water from the vents is so hot that in some places it is over 500°F (that is 300°C)!</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So can anything live in this very deep place where the water is either very cold or very hot? Let’s take a closer look.</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>Life at the Bottom</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>In the Mariana Trench there is no sunlight because the sun’s rays cannot reach so far down into the water. Without light, no plants can grow in the trench.</p>
        <p>There are some unusual animals that live here, though. These are animals that depend on senses other than sight to help them move around and find food. There are special types of crabs, clams, shrimps, and worms that live near the vents. Some of these animals can even produce light with&nbsp;a part of their body. One of these animals is the deep sea anglerfish. This fish is only about&nbsp; 5 inches long, but it is very scary-looking. It has a large mouth with very long sharp teeth. It cannot swim fast, but that is not a problem because the anglerfish has a body part called a photophore. The photophore sticks out from the head of the anglerfish and hangs over its mouth. It is a very special body part because it produces a blue-green light. When the anglerfish waves the light back and forth in the dark water, other fish come over for a look. When a fish comes too close, the anglerfish opens its huge mouth and captures its food!</p>
        <p>There is a lot going on in the Mariana Trench. It is very dangerous, though, for human divers to study the trench. So there is still much to be learned about the deepest place on Earth.</p>

          <strong>Holiday Safety Tips</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Frenzied holiday shopping adds to the magic of the season. However, crowded malls and stores are prime targets for purse snatchers, pick pockets and thieves.</p>
        <p>Holiday shoppers are easy prey because they carry more cash than usual, use credit cards more frequently and become distracted by the hunt for that perfect gift.</p>
        <p>Check this list twice to protect your holiday treasures:</p>

            <strong>Introduction</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp;Photographs, maps, oral accounts, and written records are not the only clues to the past. Buildings and places are records, too. Old buildings are part of a community’s past as well as its present. Long after its original occupants are gone, a building remains as a reminder of the human activities it once enclosed. Remodeling may make an old building look modern or adjust it for new uses, but something of the past is always there. A building’s location, the materials used to construct it, the way it looks, and its uses all reflect life in a town as it used to be.</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>Locations Of Buildings</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>Most towns expanded around a main street. This part of town was busy with foot traffic, vehicles, children, pigs, and dogs. Hotels, blacksmith shops, saloons, livery stables, restaurants, and government buildings lined main street. It was here that railroads and stagelines had their offices. Property was expensive on main street, so land was not wasted. Buildings were huddled together and expanded up, rather than out.</p>
        <p>Private homes and boarding houses surrounded the business district. Working people who walked to work lived in <span class="txt-underline">residences</span> near their jobs. Those who could afford to own carriages and horses lived at the edge of town away from the noise and dirt of main street. Large lots and yards separated one home from another. Churches and schools were usually built in residential areas.</p>
        <p>With the introduction of street cars and automobiles, people could move farther from the center of town. They no longer had to live near work or shopping areas. Streets were made longer and wider for automobiles, and parking lots and garages replaced the livery stables and blacksmith shops. Buildings could be put almost anywhere. Distance was no longer a big problem.</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>Building Materials</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;In Nevada, building materials were scarce. There were few forests to provide lumber and no quick and easy supply of bricks and cement. Some of the earliest buildings were made of sun dried mud and straw bricks called adobe. Very few of these adobe buildings are left any more. Wind and water have washed their walls back into the soil.</p>
        <p>As people streamed into the state seeking quick mining riches, they would build “rag towns” with materials at hand. Shelters were made from cloth which was stretched tent-like over wooden frames. When available, logs and stones were used as building materials. Even large pieces of metal were put up to protect against the weather.</p>
        <p>When mining booms began, more services as well as more buildings were needed. Bricklayers, carpenters, and other craftsmen came to build. Stone quarries were opened. Brick ovens were built. Wood was cut from the Sierra forests and shipped throughout the state by wagon or railroad. Houses, barns, businesses, churches, and govern ment buildings were built for the quickly expanding population.</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>Style</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>Buildings are much like people. They come in different shapes, sizes, and colors. They do different things, and they have different moods. Some are bright and delicate with frills everywhere. They seem playful and inviting. <strong>Others are dark, sturdy blocks that take themselves very seriously</strong>. Once in a while, you might meet a quiet, plain building that looks like an old friend. To a h istorian, all of these things are part of a building’s style.</p>
        <p>Style is a clue to a building’s age. It also tells something about what was thought to be “good taste” by those who built and used the structure. There are special words to describe a building’s style and parts of a building.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;Some names come from the period when the building and others like it were built. Some come from earlier periods; these were copied or revived (renewed). Most buildings in Nevada are a mixture of styles. However, two styles strongly influenced early Nevada builders, Greek Revival and Victorian.</p>
        <p>From 1820 to 1840, it was very popular in the United States to have buildings look like Greek temples. The special marks of this style, called Greek Revival, are pillared porches, low, sometimes flat roofs, corniced eaves, and pediments. Many public buildings and mansions in Washington, D.C. were Greek Revival, and this style was brought west with settlers. It was in fashion in California and Nevada by 1860.</p>
        <p>A Greek Revival building is simple and square. A Victorian one is an explosion of rooms, angles, and wooden icicles. The style was named for the period from 1836 to about 1900 when Queen Victor ia’s taste ruled England and America. Victorian buildings have steeply pitched roofs with barge-board trim and arched windows. Structures move up and out with bays and additions. Carpenters could buy books with floor plans and ready made trim patterns. These patterns could be cut cheaply out of wood to decorate a house.</p>

            <strong>Introduction</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp;Photographs, maps, oral accounts, and written records are not the only clues to the past. Buildings and places are records, too. Old buildings are part of a community’s past as well as its present. Long after its original occupants are gone, a building remains as a reminder of the human activities it once enclosed. Remodeling may make an old building look modern or adjust it for new uses, but something of the past is always there. A building’s location, the materials used to construct it, the way it looks, and its uses all reflect life in a town as it used to be.</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>Locations Of Buildings</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>Most towns expanded around a main street. This part of town was busy with foot traffic, vehicles, children, pigs, and dogs. Hotels, blacksmith shops, saloons, livery stables, restaurants, and government buildings lined main street. It was here that railroads and stagelines had their offices. Property was expensive on main street, so land was not wasted. Buildings were huddled together and expanded up, rather than out.</p>
        <p>Private homes and boarding houses surrounded the business district. Working people who walked to work lived in <span class="txt-underline">residences</span> near their jobs. Those who could afford to own carriages and horses lived at the edge of town away from the noise and dirt of main street. Large lots and yards separated one home from another. Churches and schools were usually built in residential areas.</p>
        <p>With the introduction of street cars and automobiles, people could move farther from the center of town. They no longer had to live near work or shopping areas. Streets were made longer and wider for automobiles, and parking lots and garages replaced the livery stables and blacksmith shops. Buildings could be put almost anywhere. Distance was no longer a big problem.</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>Building Materials</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;In Nevada, building materials were scarce. There were few forests to provide lumber and no quick and easy supply of bricks and cement. Some of the earliest buildings were made of sun dried mud and straw bricks called adobe. Very few of these adobe buildings are left any more. Wind and water have washed their walls back into the soil.</p>
        <p>As people streamed into the state seeking quick mining riches, they would build “rag towns” with materials at hand. Shelters were made from cloth which was stretched tent-like over wooden frames. When available, logs and stones were used as building materials. Even large pieces of metal were put up to protect against the weather.</p>
        <p>When mining booms began, more services as well as more buildings were needed. Bricklayers, carpenters, and other craftsmen came to build. Stone quarries were opened. Brick ovens were built. Wood was cut from the Sierra forests and shipped throughout the state by wagon or railroad. Houses, barns, businesses, churches, and govern ment buildings were built for the quickly expanding population.</p>

          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>Style</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>Buildings are much like people. They come in different shapes, sizes, and colors. They do different things, and they have different moods. Some are bright and delicate with frills everywhere. They seem playful and inviting. <strong>Others are dark, sturdy blocks that take themselves very seriously</strong>. Once in a while, you might meet a quiet, plain building that looks like an old friend. To a h istorian, all of these things are part of a building’s style.</p>
        <p>Style is a clue to a building’s age. It also tells something about what was thought to be “good taste” by those who built and used the structure. There are special words to describe a building’s style and parts of a building.</p>

            <strong>Introduction</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp;Photographs, maps, oral accounts, and written records are not the only clues to the past. Buildings and places are records, too. Old buildings are part of a community’s past as well as its present. Long after its original occupants are gone, a building remains as a reminder of the human activities it once enclosed. Remodeling may make an old building look modern or adjust it for new uses, but something of the past is always there. A building’s location, the materials used to construct it, the way it looks, and its uses all reflect life in a town as it used to be.</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>Locations Of Buildings</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>Most towns expanded around a main street. This part of town was busy with foot traffic, vehicles, children, pigs, and dogs. Hotels, blacksmith shops, saloons, livery stables, restaurants, and government buildings lined main street. It was here that railroads and stagelines had their offices. Property was expensive on main street, so land was not wasted. Buildings were huddled together and expanded up, rather than out.</p>
        <p>Private homes and boarding houses surrounded the business district. Working people who walked to work lived in <span class="txt-underline">residences</span> near their jobs. Those who could afford to own carriages and horses lived at the edge of town away from the noise and dirt of main street. Large lots and yards separated one home from another. Churches and schools were usually built in residential areas.</p>
        <p>With the introduction of street cars and automobiles, people could move farther from the center of town. They no longer had to live near work or shopping areas. Streets were made longer and wider for automobiles, and parking lots and garages replaced the livery stables and blacksmith shops. Buildings could be put almost anywhere. Distance was no longer a big problem.</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>Building Materials</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;In Nevada, building materials were scarce. There were few forests to provide lumber and no quick and easy supply of bricks and cement. Some of the earliest buildings were made of sun dried mud and straw bricks called adobe. Very few of these adobe buildings are left any more. Wind and water have washed their walls back into the soil.</p>
        <p>As people streamed into the state seeking quick mining riches, they would build “rag towns” with materials at hand. Shelters were made from cloth which was stretched tent-like over wooden frames. When available, logs and stones were used as building materials. Even large pieces of metal were put up to protect against the weather.</p>
        <p>When mining booms began, more services as well as more buildings were needed. Bricklayers, carpenters, and other craftsmen came to build. Stone quarries were opened. Brick ovens were built. Wood was cut from the Sierra forests and shipped throughout the state by wagon or railroad. Houses, barns, businesses, churches, and govern ment buildings were built for the quickly expanding population.</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>Style</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>Buildings are much like people. They come in different shapes, sizes, and colors. They do different things, and they have different moods. Some are bright and delicate with frills everywhere. They seem playful and inviting. <strong>Others are dark, sturdy blocks that take themselves very seriously</strong>. Once in a while, you might meet a quiet, plain building that looks like an old friend. To a h istorian, all of these things are part of a building’s style.</p>
        <p>Style is a clue to a building’s age. It also tells something about what was thought to be “good taste” by those who built and used the structure. There are special words to describe a building’s style and parts of a building.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;Some names come from the period when the building and others like it were built. Some come from earlier periods; these were copied or revived (renewed). Most buildings in Nevada are a mixture of styles. However, two styles strongly influenced early Nevada builders, Greek Revival and Victorian.</p>
        <p>From 1820 to 1840, it was very popular in the United States to have buildings look like Greek temples.

        <p>Style is a clue to a building’s age. It also tells something about what was thought to be “good taste” by those who built and used the structure. There are special words to describe a building’s style and parts of a building.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;Some names come from the period when the building and others like it were built. Some come from earlier periods; these were copied or revived (renewed). Most buildings in Nevada are a mixture of styles. However, two styles strongly influenced early Nevada builders, Greek Revival and Victorian.</p>
        <p>From 1820 to 1840, it was very popular in the United States to have buildings look like Greek temples. The special marks of this style, called Greek Revival, are pillared porches, low, sometimes flat roofs, corniced eaves, and pediments. Many public buildings and mansions in Washington, D.C. were Greek Revival, and this style was brought west with settlers. It was in fashion in California and Nevada by 1860.</p>
        <p>A Greek Revival building is simple and square. A Victorian one is an explosion of rooms, angles, and wooden icicles. The style was named for the period from 1836 to about 1900 when Queen Victor ia’s taste ruled England and America. Victorian buildings have steeply pitched roofs with barge-board trim and arched windows. Structures move up and out with bays and additions. Carpenters could buy books with floor plans and ready made trim patterns. These patterns could be cut cheaply out of wood to decorate a house.</p>

        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Last Thursday, Mother told me</p>
        <p>That I could get a pet.</p>
        <p>I must’ve named a million;</p>
        <p>She hasn’t liked one yet!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mum says a baby elephant</p>
        <p>Will take up too much space.</p>
        <p>She insists a mountain lion</p>
        <p>Is much too hard to chase.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Pandas are too picky</p>
        <p>Since they only eat bamboo.</p>
        <p>She says that bears and tigers</p>
        <p>Should stay inside a zoo.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She can’t abide<sup>1</sup> a lizard,</p>
        <p>Or a python or a goat.</p>
        <p>And to keep an alligator,</p>
        <p>We’d need to build a moat.<sup>2</sup></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When I told her that an octopus</p>
        <p>Would make a striking<sup>3</sup> pet,</p>
        <p>She said I can’t have anything</p>
        <p>That makes the floor wet.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mum said a giant tortoise<sup>4</sup></p>
        <p>Is awkward and too slow.</p>
        <p>And when I said a porcupine,</p>
        <p>The answer still was no.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At last I said an emu,</p>
        <p>She had never heard of that.</p>
        <p>Imagine my amazement when</p>
        <p>She said yes to a cat!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1.&nbsp; <strong>can’t abide</strong>: can’t stand; thoroughly dislike; be unable to put up with something or someone</p>
        <p>2.&nbsp; <strong>moat</strong>: a dug-out place filled with water, usually around a castle</p>
        <p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>striking</strong>: unusual looking; attracting attention; impressive</p>

        <p>Last Thursday, Mother told me</p>
        <p>That I could get a pet.</p>
        <p>I must’ve named a million;</p>
        <p>She hasn’t liked one yet!</p>

        <p>Mum says a baby elephant</p>

        <p>She insists a mountain lion</p>
        <p>Is much too hard to chase.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Pandas are too picky</p>
        <p>Since they only eat bamboo.</p>
        <p>She says that bears and tigers</p>
        <p>Should stay inside a zoo.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She can’t abide<sup>1</sup> a lizard,</p>
        <p>Or a python or a goat.</p>
        <p>And to keep an alligator,</p>
        <p>We’d need to build a moat.<sup>2</sup></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When I told her that an octopus</p>
        <p>Would make a striking<sup>3</sup> pet,</p>
        <p>She said I can’t have anything</p>
        <p>That makes the floor wet.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mum said a giant tortoise<sup>4</sup></p>
        <p>Is awkward and too slow.</p>
        <p>And when I said a porcupine,</p>
        <p>The answer still was no.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>At last I said an emu,</p>
        <p>She had never heard of that.</p>
        <p>Imagine my amazement when</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1.&nbsp; <strong>can’t abide</strong>: can’t stand; thoroughly dislike; be unable to put up with something or someone</p>
        <p>2.&nbsp; <strong>moat</strong>: a dug-out place filled with water, usually around a castle</p>
        <p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>striking</strong>: unusual looking; attracting attention; impressive</p>
