        <p>Read the following extract from Malcolm Knox’s <em><span class="txt-underline">Bluebird</span></em> to answer Questions 31 - 35.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On the deck of the Lodge, Gordon Grimes screened his eyes. The sun was playing peeka-boo over a bank of clouds that would soon burn off, summer continuing its insurgency against the season formerly known as spring.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hearing a whistle from his left, Gordon turned to see his bearded young neighbour waving cheerfully. David Archer’s humble grin spoke of disbelief at their shared good fortune. Gordon, on edge due to both an ongoing dispute with Archer and the underlying fact that Archer’s fortune was built on a more solid economic base than his, raised his hand tentatively, torn between the suspicion that Archer was having him on and the greater anxiety that his friendliness was genuine. Archer cupped his hands worshipfully to the sky. In their single mediation session before the dispute was given a court date, Archer had referred to this headland as Bluebird’s ‘dress circle,’ which Gordon took to mean that the people down below must be actors.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gordon bracing against his balcony rail, might have held a premium ticket, but he felt far from premium. He had got away with nothing except the view.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He swept his eyes over the beach. Six ancient clubbies were practising their march-past, pausing around the reel to debate who would pick up which corner. Six into four never did go. Mathematics, like their opinions, stood immutably against progress. Gordon squinted down at the top car park, where his crew had been rolling up since the pre-dawn. He could pick them out of the Sunday crowd just as animals, in a mass of humans, see only the fellows of their species. Morning surfs complete, they milled about, a cluster of non-working working folk falsely remembering empty waves, bandying hot air and urban myth.</p>

          <strong>The Bottled Water Scam</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I’ve always been suspicious of the bottled water industry, that it had to be an ingenious marketing plot tapping into our fear of faucets. How do you know what you’re getting in the bottle? Not to mention the environmental scars, pricing and chemicals. Well, a new documentary blows the lid on bottled water, although it appears some people have started to catch on anyway.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Not only is (bottled) water a clear waste of resources (only 20% of plastic water bottles used in the US are recycled), it’s an incredible waste of money for consumers, who pay more than the price of petrol for water that is marketed as ‘pure’ but in reality, is largely unregulated, full of harmful toxins like BPA and far less safe for drinking than free tap water. In fact, 40% of the time, bottled water is nothing but municipal tap water freed from the government oversight that keeps it safe.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A backlash against bottled water seems to be building, from an environmental standpoint and an economic one. Last month, a community in Australia banned it together, which will save $2.5 million a year.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Today, Nestle reported a drop in profits, mainly due to weakness in water sales. From the Wall Street Journal: “Analysts say the drop is owed partly to growing environmental and health concerns about bottled water – and partly to the global recession, as cash-strapped consumers trade down to tap water… last month, in a separate earnings call, Pepsi Bottling Group reported a similar shift: “<em>One of the first things that a shopper can decide to do is consume tap water as opposed to purchasing bottle water,</em>” said Robert King, president of the company’s North American division, “<em>and I think we are seeing just a pretty dramatic change in the growth trajectory of that category.</em>”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Of course, in many communities, unfiltered tap water isn’t the answer either. I use a pitcher filter at home, and here at Marketplace, we’ve switched to bottle-less water coolers. They tap right into your water line.</p>

          <strong>The Bottled Water Scam</strong>

        <p>I’ve always been suspicious of the bottled water industry, that it had to be an ingenious marketing plot tapping into our fear of faucets.

        <p>A backlash against bottled water seems to be building, from an environmental standpoint and an economic one. Last month, a community in Australia banned it together, which will save $2.5 million a year.</p>
