          <strong>WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE ABOLISHED ALL EXAMS?</strong>

        <p>Finland is fashionable&nbsp;among educationalists because it is seen as proof that you can have a great education system without neoliberal high-stakes testing and accountability. Finland gained this status on the back of its PISA results and even though these results have significantly declined since the start of the century, Finland remains as popular&nbsp;as ever.&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">Pundits laud its progressiveness</span>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So, if anywhere has avoided exams, it’s Finland, right? Wrong. It’s true that Finland doesn’t have the number of standardised tests that characterise Australia, England or the U.S. but it’s worth noting that&nbsp;students in the academic stream at the end of High School sit a set of six-hour exams.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><br>
Oh. So if Finland can’t have an education system without traditional exams, where can? Is it even possible? What would it look like?<br>
<br>
I had an interesting discussion on Twitter about this. Chris Woldhuis was at a conference where Eric Mazur was speaking. It appears as if Mazur made a claim, consistent with previous comments on the topic, that, “Cheating in an assessment is not a problem with the students, it is a problem with the assessment.” I disputed this and Chris and I had a discussion. Chris’s view was that if it is possible to cheat then the form of assessment is not right – we’re not asking students to solve&nbsp;<em>real&nbsp;</em>problems. My view was that&nbsp;<em>any&nbsp;</em>form of assessment is vulnerable to cheating and so I asked Chris for an example of the sort&nbsp;of problem&nbsp;he had in mind. He suggested, “Students run a cafe, make a profit.”<br>
<br>
If we moved away from exams in favour of assessing&nbsp;projects of this kind then this would cause a number of practical problems. How can every student do something like run a cafe? Would the cafe be run as a team? If so, how can we be sure that everyone is playing an equal role? Perhaps we don’t really mind whether they&nbsp;<em>are&nbsp;</em>playing equal roles&nbsp;but, if so, how can we form any sort of assessment of the learning of individuals?<br>
<br>
If something important like university entrance depends upon your ability to run a cafe and make a profit then the possibilities for gaming this system are endless. Wealthy parents could, for instance, buy a lot of coffee. The authentic nature of the project means that it is not sealed-off from the outside world and so our rich kids&nbsp;could perhaps&nbsp;pay for&nbsp;advice from successful cafe owners, accountants, advertising creatives and so on.<br>
<br>
Traditional exams are, in fact,&nbsp;<em>far more</em>&nbsp;equitable. Students sit these tests naked of their privilege and have to solve problems&nbsp;on their own rather than have this done for them. No, I’m not arguing that this takes away the advantages of the rich completely. They still have access to learning resources&nbsp;that poorer students don’t have. But I can’t think of a better way of minimising these advantages than with a traditional test.<br>
<br>
When you also take account of the fact that&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">exams are subject to less bias</span>&nbsp;than the kind of teacher assessment you would need for a project, the equity case is overwhelming.</p>

          <strong>A BRIEF HISTORY OF TELEVISION</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The first television shows were experimental, sporadic broadcasts viewable only within a very short range from the&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">broadcast tower</span>&nbsp;starting in the 1930s. Televised events such as the&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">1936 Summer Olympics</span>&nbsp;in Germany, the 1937&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">coronation of King George VI</span>&nbsp;in the UK, and&nbsp;David Sarnoff's&nbsp;famous introduction at the&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">1939 New York World's Fair</span>&nbsp;in the US spurred a growth in the medium, but&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">World War II</span>&nbsp;put a halt to development until after the war.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">1947 World Series</span>&nbsp;inspired many Americans to buy their first television set and then in 1948, the popular&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">radio show&nbsp;<em>Texaco Star Theater</em></span>&nbsp;made the move and became the first weekly televised&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">variety show</span>, earning host&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">Milton Berle</span>&nbsp;the name "Mr Television" and demonstrating that the medium was a stable, modern form of entertainment which could attract&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">advertisers</span>. The first national&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">live television</span>&nbsp;broadcast in the US took place on September 4, 1951 when President&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">Harry Truman</span>'s speech at the&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">Japanese Peace Treaty Conference</span>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">San Francisco</span>&nbsp;was transmitted over&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">AT&amp;T</span>'s transcontinental&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">cable</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">microwave radio relay</span>&nbsp;system to broadcast stations in local markets.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The first national colour broadcast (the 1954&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">Tournament of Roses Parade</span>) in the US occurred on January 1, 1954. During the following ten years most network broadcasts, and nearly all local programming, continued to be in black-and-white. A colour transition was announced for Autumn of 1965, during which over half of all network prime-time programming would be broadcast in colour. The first all-colour prime-time season came just one year later. In 1972, the last holdout among daytime network shows converted to colour, resulting in the first completely all-colour network season.</p>

          <strong>A BRIEF HISTORY OF TELEVISION</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The first television shows were experimental, sporadic broadcasts viewable only within a very short range from the&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">broadcast tower</span>&nbsp;starting in the 1930s. Televised events such as the&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">1936 Summer Olympics</span>&nbsp;in Germany, the 1937&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">coronation of King George VI</span>&nbsp;in the UK, and&nbsp;David Sarnoff's&nbsp;famous introduction at the&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">1939 New York World's Fair</span>&nbsp;in the US spurred a growth in the medium, but&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">World War II</span>&nbsp;put a halt to development until after the war.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">1947 World Series</span>&nbsp;inspired many Americans to buy their first television set and then in 1948, the popular&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">radio show&nbsp;<em>Texaco Star Theater</em></span>&nbsp;made the move and became the first weekly televised&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">variety show</span>, earning host&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">Milton Berle</span>&nbsp;the name "Mr Television" and demonstrating that the medium was a stable, modern form of entertainment which could attract&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">advertisers</span>. The first national&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">live television</span>&nbsp;broadcast in the US took place on September 4, 1951 when President&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">Harry Truman</span>'s speech at the&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">Japanese Peace Treaty Conference</span>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">San Francisco</span>&nbsp;was transmitted over&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">AT&amp;T</span>'s transcontinental&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">cable</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">microwave radio relay</span>&nbsp;system to broadcast stations in local markets.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The first national colour broadcast (the 1954&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">Tournament of Roses Parade</span>) in the US occurred on January 1, 1954. During the following ten years most network broadcasts, and nearly all local programming, continued to be in black-and-white. A colour transition was announced for Autumn of 1965, during which over half of all network prime-time programming would be broadcast in colour. The first all-colour prime-time season came just one year later. In 1972, the last holdout among daytime network shows converted to colour, resulting in the first completely all-colour network season.</p>
