        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>The Silver Chair</strong><br><br><em>by C.S.Lewis</em><br><br>
Without a glance at Jill the lion rose to its feet and gave one last blow. Then, as if satisfied with its work, it turned and stalked slowly away, back into the forest.<br>
<br>
"It must be a dream, it must, it must," said Jill to herself. "I'll wake up in a moment." But it wasn't, and she didn't.<br>
<br>
"I do wish we'd never come to this dreadful place," said Jill. "I don't believe Scrubb knew any more about it than I do. Or if he did, he had no business to bring me here without warning me what it was like. It's not my fault he fell over that cliff. If he'd left me alone we should both be all right." Then she remembered again the scream that Scrubb had given when he fell, and burst into tears.<br>
<br>
Crying is all right in its way while it lasts. But you have to stop sooner or later and then you still have to decide what to do. When Jill stopped, she found she was dreadfully thirsty. She had been lying face downward, and now she sat up. The birds had ceased singing and there was perfect silence except for one small persistent sound which seemed to come a good distance away. She listened carefully and felt almost sure it was the sound of running water.<br>
<br>
Jill got up and looked round her very carefully. There was no sign of the lion; but there were so many trees about that it might easily be quite close without her seeing it. For all she knew, there might be several lions. But her thirst was very bad now, and she plucked up her courage to go and look for that running water. She went on tip-toes, stealing cautiously from tree to tree, and stopping to peer round her at every step.<br>
<br>
The wood was so still that it was not difficult to decide where the sound was coming from. It grew clearer every moment and, sooner than she expected, she came to an open glade and saw the stream, bright as glass, running across the turf a stone's throw away from her. But although the sight of the water made her feel ten times thirstier than before, she didn't rush forward and drink. She stood as still as if she had been turned into stone, with her mouth wide open. And she had a very good reason; just on this side of the stream lay the lion.<br>
<br>
It lay with its head raised and its two fore-paws out in front of it, like the lions in Trafalgar Square. She knew at once that it had seen her, for its eyes looked straight into hers for a moment and then turned away—as if it knew her quite well and didn't think much of her.<br>
<br>
"If I run away, it'll be after me in a moment," thought Jill. "And if I go on, I shall run straight into its mouth." Anyway, she couldn't have moved if she had tried, and she couldn't take her eyes off it. How long this lasted, she could not be sure; it seemed like hours. And the thirst became so bad that she almost felt she would not mind being eaten by the lion if only she could be sure of getting a mouthful of water first.<br>
<br>
"If you're thirsty, you may drink."<br>
<br>
They were the first words she had heard since Scrubb had spoken to her on the edge of the cliff. For a second she stared here and there, wondering who had spoken. Then the voice said again, "If you are thirsty, come and drink," and of course she remembered what Scrubb had said about animals talking in that other world, and realised that it was the lion speaking. Anyway, she had seen its lips move this time, and the voice was not like a man's. It was deeper, wilder, and stronger; a sort of heavy, golden voice. It did not make her any less frightened than she had been before, but it made her frightened in rather a different way.<br>
<br>
"Are you not thirsty?" said the Lion.<br>
<br>
"I'm dying of thirst," said Jill.<br>
<br>
"Then drink," said the Lion.<br>
<br>
"May I—could I—would you mind going away while do?" said Jill.<br>
<br>
The Lion answered this only by a look and a very low growl. And as Jill gazed at its motionless bulk, she realised that she might as well have asked the whole mountain to move aside for her convenience.<br>
<br>
The delicious rippling noise of the stream was driving her nearly frantic.<br>
<br>
"Will you promise not to—do anything to me, if I do come?" said Jill.<br>
<br>
"I make no promise," said the Lion.<br>
<br>
Jill was so thirsty now that, without noticing it, she had come a step nearer.<br>
<br>
"Do you eat girls?" she said.<br>
<br>
"I have swallowed up girls and boys, women and men, kings and emperors, cities and realms," said the Lion. It didn't say this as if it were boasting, nor as if it were sorry, nor as if it were angry. It just said it.<br>
<br>
"I daren't come and drink," said Jill.<br>
<br>
"Then you will die of thirst," said the Lion.<br>
<br>
"Oh dear!" said Jill, coming another step nearer. "I suppose I must go and look for another stream then."<br>
<br>
"There is no other stream," said the Lion.<br>
<br>
It never occurred to Jill to disbelieve the Lion—no one who had seen his stern face could do that—and her mind suddenly made itself up. It was the worst thing she had ever had to do, but she went forward to the stream, knelt down, and began scooping up water in her hand. It was the coldest, most refreshing water she had ever tasted. You didn't need to drink much of it, for it quenched your thirst at once. Before she tasted it she had been intending to make a dash away from the Lion the moment she had finished. Now, she realised that this would be on the whole the most dangerous thing of all. She got up and stood there with her lips still wet from drinking.<br>

A free bird leaps<br>

and dips his wing<br>
in the orange sun rays<br>
and <span class="txt-underline"><strong>dares to claim the sky.</strong></span><br>

with a fearful trill<br>
of things unknown<br>
but longed for still<br>
and his tune is heard<br>
on the distant hill<br>
for the caged bird<br>
sings of freedom.<br>
<br>
The free bird thinks of another breeze<br>
and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees<br>
and the fat worms waiting on a dawn bright lawn<br>
and he names the sky his own.<br>

A free bird leaps<br>
on the back of the wind<br>

till the current ends<br>
and dips his wing<br>
in the orange sun rays<br>
and <span class="txt-underline"><strong>dares to claim the sky.</strong></span><br>

But a bird that stalks<br>
down his narrow cage<br>

his bars of rage<br>
his wings are clipped and<br>
his feet are tied<br>
so he opens his throat to sing.<br>
<br>
The caged bird sings<br>
with a fearful trill<br>
of things unknown<br>
but longed for still<br>
and his tune is heard<br>
on the distant hill<br>
for the caged bird<br>
sings of freedom.<br>
<br>
The free bird thinks of another breeze<br>
and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees<br>
and the fat worms waiting on a dawn bright lawn<br>
and he names the sky his own.<br>

<span class="txt-underline"><strong>But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams</strong></span><br>

his wings are clipped and his feet are tied<br>

<strong>Social media: a blessing and a curse</strong><br>
<br>
<em>Our Social Media Manager, Tess Macpherson-Woods, shares her experience working here in the busy world of social media.</em><br>
<br>
When I tell people what I do for a living, I think this often conjures up images of me surrounded by kittens and puppies, scrolling through Facebook at my leisure... As much as I love my job, kittens and puppies - this couldn't be further from the truth!<strong> 12 .......... .</strong> As a nation of animal lovers, we all feel very strongly about speaking up for the voiceless, and want to help - but as well-intentioned as posts and comments online may be, they can sometimes make it harder for us to help.<br>
<br>
Every day we use social media to achieve amazing things, from finding perpetrators of animal cruelty, to rehoming animals, offering the best pet care advice, and gathering petition signatures to change the law. <strong>13 .......... </strong>. We're incredibly grateful for these passionate and dedicated animal lovers - we couldn't help as many animals as we do without them!<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, with social media also comes fake news, malicious rumours and inaccuracies, which can spread like wildfire. Sometimes such posts are shared by people who don't understand the restrictions we face as a charity, or our very stretched resources; other times they're shared by people who have had a negative experience with us in the past, perhaps due to harming an animal themselves. These posts are not only damaging to our reputation, affecting our ability to help animals, but they can also be unintentionally damaging to specific animals' lives.<br>
<br>
In the past reports have been made to us, with people expecting immediate action and updates, and have then shared our perceived lack of action on social media. <strong>14 ..........</strong> . There are times when people wrongly claim to have reported concerns to us, say we've not attended when we've barely been given a chance to do so, or tell the world that we don't care. <strong>15 ...........</strong><br>
<br>
Each day, my small team deals with hundreds of messages on our social channels. We love speaking to inspirational animal advocates, passionate pet owners, keen campaigners, and fabulous fundraisers - but we also have to deal with terrible trolls. <strong>16 ..........</strong> . It's a sad fact that there will always be people that don't like us. As an organisation which investigates and prosecutes people for animal cruelty, we'll always have enemies, and people's expectations of us (often, wrongly, as the animal police!) will always be far greater than we can realistically deliver.<br>
<br>
As a charity, we have no legal powers and a call comes in every 30 seconds, but we have fewer than 400 full-time members of staff in our inspectorate to pick up these calls.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, people's expectations are that we should arrive within minutes to seize an abused dog without evidence or the police to sign them over to us, always be there to collect a poorly but mobile fox, or immediately come to the rescue of a legally tethered, healthy horse. <strong>17 ..........</strong> . Unfortunately, receiving more calls about these incidents without more information won't help the situation - and sharing the issue online and trolling us will also make things more difficult to solve.<br>

<strong>Social media: a blessing and a curse</strong><br>
<br>
<em>Our Social Media Manager, Tess Macpherson-Woods, shares her experience working here in the busy world of social media.</em><br>
<br>
When I tell people what I do for a living, I think this often conjures up images of me surrounded by kittens and puppies, scrolling through Facebook at my leisure... As much as I love my job, kittens and puppies - this couldn't be further from the truth!<strong> 12 .......... .</strong> As a nation of animal lovers, we all feel very strongly about speaking up for the voiceless, and want to help - but as well-intentioned as posts and comments online may be, they can sometimes make it harder for us to help.<br>
<br>
Every day we use social media to achieve amazing things, from finding perpetrators of animal cruelty, to rehoming animals, offering the best pet care advice, and gathering petition signatures to change the law. <strong>13 .......... </strong>. We're incredibly grateful for these passionate and dedicated animal lovers - we couldn't help as many animals as we do without them!<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, with social media also comes fake news, malicious rumours and inaccuracies, which can spread like wildfire. Sometimes such posts are shared by people who don't understand the restrictions we face as a charity, or our very stretched resources; other times they're shared by people who have had a negative experience with us in the past, perhaps due to harming an animal themselves. These posts are not only damaging to our reputation, affecting our ability to help animals, but they can also be unintentionally damaging to specific animals' lives.<br>
<br>
In the past reports have been made to us, with people expecting immediate action and updates, and have then shared our perceived lack of action on social media. <strong>14 ..........</strong> . There are times when people wrongly claim to have reported concerns to us, say we've not attended when we've barely been given a chance to do so, or tell the world that we don't care. <strong>15 ...........</strong><br>
<br>
Each day, my small team deals with hundreds of messages on our social channels. We love speaking to inspirational animal advocates, passionate pet owners, keen campaigners, and fabulous fundraisers - but we also have to deal with terrible trolls. <strong>16 ..........</strong> . It's a sad fact that there will always be people that don't like us. As an organisation which investigates and prosecutes people for animal cruelty, we'll always have enemies, and people's expectations of us (often, wrongly, as the animal police!) will always be far greater than we can realistically deliver.<br>
<br>
As a charity, we have no legal powers and a call comes in every 30 seconds, but we have fewer than 400 full-time members of staff in our inspectorate to pick up these calls.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, people's expectations are that we should arrive within minutes to seize an abused dog without evidence or the police to sign them over to us, always be there to collect a poorly but mobile fox, or immediately come to the rescue of a legally tethered, healthy horse. <strong>17 ..........</strong> . Unfortunately, receiving more calls about these incidents without more information won't help the situation - and sharing the issue online and trolling us will also make things more difficult to solve.<br>

                In doing so, this has given the owner a 'heads-up' about our potential involvement, leading to the animals being moved and us being unable to intervene, or conditions improving, but only to the extent that they're legally compliant, as opposed to endorsed by us.

<strong>Social media: a blessing and a curse</strong><br>
<br>
<em>Our Social Media Manager, Tess Macpherson-Woods, shares her experience working here in the busy world of social media.</em><br>
<br>
When I tell people what I do for a living, I think this often conjures up images of me surrounded by kittens and puppies, scrolling through Facebook at my leisure... As much as I love my job, kittens and puppies - this couldn't be further from the truth!<strong> 12 .......... .</strong> As a nation of animal lovers, we all feel very strongly about speaking up for the voiceless, and want to help - but as well-intentioned as posts and comments online may be, they can sometimes make it harder for us to help.<br>
<br>
Every day we use social media to achieve amazing things, from finding perpetrators of animal cruelty, to rehoming animals, offering the best pet care advice, and gathering petition signatures to change the law. <strong>13 .......... </strong>. We're incredibly grateful for these passionate and dedicated animal lovers - we couldn't help as many animals as we do without them!<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, with social media also comes fake news, malicious rumours and inaccuracies, which can spread like wildfire. Sometimes such posts are shared by people who don't understand the restrictions we face as a charity, or our very stretched resources; other times they're shared by people who have had a negative experience with us in the past, perhaps due to harming an animal themselves. These posts are not only damaging to our reputation, affecting our ability to help animals, but they can also be unintentionally damaging to specific animals' lives.<br>
<br>
In the past reports have been made to us, with people expecting immediate action and updates, and have then shared our perceived lack of action on social media. <strong>14 ..........</strong> . There are times when people wrongly claim to have reported concerns to us, say we've not attended when we've barely been given a chance to do so, or tell the world that we don't care. <strong>15 ...........</strong><br>
<br>
Each day, my small team deals with hundreds of messages on our social channels. We love speaking to inspirational animal advocates, passionate pet owners, keen campaigners, and fabulous fundraisers - but we also have to deal with terrible trolls. <strong>16 ..........</strong> . It's a sad fact that there will always be people that don't like us. As an organisation which investigates and prosecutes people for animal cruelty, we'll always have enemies, and people's expectations of us (often, wrongly, as the animal police!) will always be far greater than we can realistically deliver.<br>
<br>
As a charity, we have no legal powers and a call comes in every 30 seconds, but we have fewer than 400 full-time members of staff in our inspectorate to pick up these calls.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, people's expectations are that we should arrive within minutes to seize an abused dog without evidence or the police to sign them over to us, always be there to collect a poorly but mobile fox, or immediately come to the rescue of a legally tethered, healthy horse. <strong>17 ..........</strong> . Unfortunately, receiving more calls about these incidents without more information won't help the situation - and sharing the issue online and trolling us will also make things more difficult to solve.<br>

<strong>Social media: a blessing and a curse</strong><br>
<br>
<em>Our Social Media Manager, Tess Macpherson-Woods, shares her experience working here in the busy world of social media.</em><br>
<br>
When I tell people what I do for a living, I think this often conjures up images of me surrounded by kittens and puppies, scrolling through Facebook at my leisure... As much as I love my job, kittens and puppies - this couldn't be further from the truth!<strong> 12 .......... .</strong> As a nation of animal lovers, we all feel very strongly about speaking up for the voiceless, and want to help - but as well-intentioned as posts and comments online may be, they can sometimes make it harder for us to help.<br>
<br>
Every day we use social media to achieve amazing things, from finding perpetrators of animal cruelty, to rehoming animals, offering the best pet care advice, and gathering petition signatures to change the law. <strong>13 .......... </strong>. We're incredibly grateful for these passionate and dedicated animal lovers - we couldn't help as many animals as we do without them!<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, with social media also comes fake news, malicious rumours and inaccuracies, which can spread like wildfire. Sometimes such posts are shared by people who don't understand the restrictions we face as a charity, or our very stretched resources; other times they're shared by people who have had a negative experience with us in the past, perhaps due to harming an animal themselves. These posts are not only damaging to our reputation, affecting our ability to help animals, but they can also be unintentionally damaging to specific animals' lives.<br>
<br>
In the past reports have been made to us, with people expecting immediate action and updates, and have then shared our perceived lack of action on social media. <strong>14 ..........</strong> . There are times when people wrongly claim to have reported concerns to us, say we've not attended when we've barely been given a chance to do so, or tell the world that we don't care. <strong>15 ...........</strong><br>
<br>
Each day, my small team deals with hundreds of messages on our social channels. We love speaking to inspirational animal advocates, passionate pet owners, keen campaigners, and fabulous fundraisers - but we also have to deal with terrible trolls. <strong>16 ..........</strong> . It's a sad fact that there will always be people that don't like us. As an organisation which investigates and prosecutes people for animal cruelty, we'll always have enemies, and people's expectations of us (often, wrongly, as the animal police!) will always be far greater than we can realistically deliver.<br>
<br>
As a charity, we have no legal powers and a call comes in every 30 seconds, but we have fewer than 400 full-time members of staff in our inspectorate to pick up these calls.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, people's expectations are that we should arrive within minutes to seize an abused dog without evidence or the police to sign them over to us, always be there to collect a poorly but mobile fox, or immediately come to the rescue of a legally tethered, healthy horse. <strong>17 ..........</strong> . Unfortunately, receiving more calls about these incidents without more information won't help the situation - and sharing the issue online and trolling us will also make things more difficult to solve.<br>

                In doing so, this has given the owner a 'heads-up' about our potential involvement, leading to the animals being moved and us being unable to intervene, or conditions improving, but only to the extent that they're legally compliant, as opposed to endorsed by us.

      <div class="col-6">{^ <strong>Extract A</strong> ^}<br>
horse, (Equus caballus), a hoofed herbivorous mammal of the family Equidae. It comprises a single species, Equus caballus, whose numerous varieties are called breeds. Before the advent of mechanised vehicles, the horse was widely used as a draft animal, and riding on horseback was one of the chief means of transportation.<br>
<br>
In prehistoric times the wild horse was probably first hunted for food. Research suggests that domestication had taken place by approximately 6,000 years ago. It is supposed that the horse was first used by a tribe of Indo-European origin that lived in the steppes north of the chain of mountains adjacent to the Black and Caspian seas. Influenced by climate, food, and humans, the horse rapidly acquired its present form.<br>
<br>
The relationship of the horse to humans has been unique. The horse is a partner and friend. It has ploughed fields and brought in the harvest, hauled goods and conveyed passengers, followed game and tracked cattle, and carried combatants into battle and adventurers to unknown lands. It has provided recreation in the form of jousts, tournaments, carousels, and the sport of riding. The influence of the horse is expressed in the English language in such terms as chivalry and cavalier, which connote honour, respect, good manners, and straightforwardness.<br>
<br>
{^ <strong>Extract B</strong> ^}<br>
Old Zoey knew his mood well enough and whinnied her warning, backing off into the dark recesses of the stable, but she need not have warned me for I sensed his intention. One look at the raised stick sent my heart thumping wildly with fear. Terrified, I knew I could not run, for there was nowhere to go, so I put my back to him and lashed out behind me. I felt my&nbsp; hooves strike home. I heard a cry of pain and turned to see him crawling out of the stable door dragging one leg stiffly behind him and muttering words of cruel vengeance.<br>
<br>
That next morning both Albert and his father came out together to the stables. His father was walking with a pronounced limp. They were carrying a collar each and I could see that Albert had been crying for his pale cheeks were stained with tears. They stood together at the stable door. I noticed with infinite pride and pleasure that my Albert was already taller than his father whose face was drawn and lined with pain. ‘If your mother hadn’t begged me last night, Albert, I’d have shot that horse on the spot. He could’ve killed me. Now I’m warning you, if that animal is not ploughing straight as an arrow inside a week, he’ll be sold on, and that’s a promise. It’s up to you. You say you can deal with him, and I’ll give you just one chance. He won’t let me go near him. He’s wild and vicious, and unless you make it your business to tame him and train him inside that week, he’s going. Do you understand? That horse has to earn his keep like everyone else around here – I don’t care how showy he is – that horse has got to learn how to work. And I’ll promise you another thing, Albert, if I have to lose that bet, then he has to go.’ He dropped the collar on the ground and turned on his heel to go. ‘Father,’ said Albert with resolution in his voice. ‘I’ll train Joey – I’ll train him to plough all right – but you must promise never to raise a stick to him again. He can’t be handled that way, I know him, Father. I know him as if he were my own brother.’ ‘You train him, Albert, you handle him. Don’t care how you do it. I don’t want to know,’ said his father dismissively. ‘I’ll not go near the brute again. I’d shoot him first.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^ <strong>Extract C</strong> ^}<br>
Horse-drawn streetcars first appeared in American cities in the early 1830s when the New York &amp; Harlem Railroad began running trains from Harlem to 27th Street, substituting horses for steam south of that point as required by a city statute. By 1838, the railroad possessed one hundred horses, forty cars, and four locomotives, with a depot and stables at 27th Street. Four horses pulled the car along iron strips laid on granite blocks. The tracks rose several inches above the street surface and provided a smooth ride for the vehicle on the rails, but proved a hindrance to cross town traffic. In 1845, the New York Common Council prohibited steam locomotives below 32nd Street, a limit extended in 1856 to 42nd Street, and the number of horse-drawn cars expanded. Passenger loads grew rapidly, as the streetcar provided a smoother ride and cheaper fares than the<br>
omnibus.<br>
<br>
{^ <strong>Extract D</strong> ^}<br>
“Opinions are like butts; everyone has one,” my Dad told me over the phone as I was crying. I had just come back from a riding lesson where I spent almost the entire lesson trying to hold back tears while I was being lectured about how unknowledgeable I was<br>
about horses.<br>
<br>
When the time comes to finally buy your own horse it can be intimidating, but mostly it should be an exciting time for any rider. I could not wait to start looking around. I was, of course, open to advice from my mentors and parents because it’s a big financial decision, but ultimately, I ’m a grown woman, it’s my money, and it will be my horse.<br>
<br>
When I first announced that I would be buying a horse, the horror stories I heard filled me with anxiety. I was made to feel as though I was going to be just another fool who would be scammed because of my lack of years in the equestrian world. I was told how many horses I should look at, how long I should take before responding to an offer on a horse, and so on, as if there is some secret formula for buying the perfect horse at the perfect time and at the perfect price. Every horse I looked at was too old, too young, too green, skinny, crazy, or too expensive. The list went on and I got to the point where I felt defeated and close to giving up on buying a horse at all because it would never be the right horse for me. I was even told: All you see is a horse with four legs and a tail; I see much more. I was terrified of offending and upsetting these people.<br>

horse, (Equus caballus), a hoofed herbivorous mammal of the family Equidae. It comprises a single species, Equus caballus, whose numerous varieties are called breeds. Before the advent of mechanised vehicles, the horse was widely used as a draft animal, and riding on horseback was one of the chief means of transportation.<br>
<br>
In prehistoric times the wild horse was probably first hunted for food. Research suggests that domestication had taken place by approximately 6,000 years ago. It is supposed that the horse was first used by a tribe of Indo-European origin that lived in the steppes north of the chain of mountains adjacent to the Black and Caspian seas. Influenced by climate, food, and humans, the horse rapidly acquired its present form.<br>
<br>
The relationship of the horse to humans has been unique. The horse is a partner and friend. It has ploughed fields and brought in the harvest, hauled goods and conveyed passengers, followed game and tracked cattle, and carried combatants into battle and adventurers to unknown lands. It has provided recreation in the form of jousts, tournaments, carousels, and the sport of riding. The influence of the horse is expressed in the English language in such terms as chivalry and cavalier, which connote honour, respect, good manners, and straightforwardness.<br>

Old Zoey knew his mood well enough and whinnied her warning, backing off into the dark recesses of the stable, but she need not have warned me for I sensed his intention. One look at the raised stick sent my heart thumping wildly with fear. Terrified, I knew I could not run, for there was nowhere to go, so I put my back to him and lashed out behind me. I felt my&nbsp; hooves strike home. I heard a cry of pain and turned to see him crawling out of the stable door dragging one leg stiffly behind him and muttering words of cruel vengeance.<br>
<br>
That next morning both Albert and his father came out together to the stables. His father was walking with a pronounced limp. They were carrying a collar each and I could see that Albert had been crying for his pale cheeks were stained with tears. They stood together at the stable door. I noticed with infinite pride and pleasure that my Albert was already taller than his father whose face was drawn and lined with pain. ‘If your mother hadn’t begged me last night, Albert, I’d have shot that horse on the spot. He could’ve killed me. Now I’m warning you, if that animal is not ploughing straight as an arrow inside a week, he’ll be sold on, and that’s a promise. It’s up to you. You say you can deal with him, and I’ll give you just one chance. He won’t let me go near him. He’s wild and vicious, and unless you make it your business to tame him and train him inside that week, he’s going. Do you understand? That horse has to earn his keep like everyone else around here – I don’t care how showy he is – that horse has got to learn how to work. And I’ll promise you another thing, Albert, if I have to lose that bet, then he has to go.’ He dropped the collar on the ground and turned on his heel to go. ‘Father,’ said Albert with resolution in his voice. ‘I’ll train Joey – I’ll train him to plough all right – but you must promise never to raise a stick to him again. He can’t be handled that way, I know him, Father. I know him as if he were my own brother.’ ‘You train him, Albert, you handle him. Don’t care how you do it. I don’t want to know,’ said his father dismissively. ‘I’ll not go near the brute again. I’d shoot him first.&nbsp;<br>

Horse-drawn streetcars first appeared in American cities in the early 1830s when the New York &amp; Harlem Railroad began running trains from Harlem to 27th Street, substituting horses for steam south of that point as required by a city statute. By 1838, the railroad possessed one hundred horses, forty cars, and four locomotives, with a depot and stables at 27th Street. Four horses pulled the car along iron strips laid on granite blocks. The tracks rose several inches above the street surface and provided a smooth ride for the vehicle on the rails, but proved a hindrance to cross town traffic. In 1845, the New York Common Council prohibited steam locomotives below 32nd Street, a limit extended in 1856 to 42nd Street, and the number of horse-drawn cars expanded. Passenger loads grew rapidly, as the streetcar provided a smoother ride and cheaper fares than the<br>

“Opinions are like butts; everyone has one,” my Dad told me over the phone as I was crying. I had just come back from a riding lesson where I spent almost the entire lesson trying to hold back tears while I was being lectured about how unknowledgeable I was<br>
about horses.<br>
<br>
When the time comes to finally buy your own horse it can be intimidating, but mostly it should be an exciting time for any rider. I could not wait to start looking around. I was, of course, open to advice from my mentors and parents because it’s a big financial decision, but ultimately, I ’m a grown woman, it’s my money, and it will be my horse.<br>
<br>
When I first announced that I would be buying a horse, the horror stories I heard filled me with anxiety. I was made to feel as though I was going to be just another fool who would be scammed because of my lack of years in the equestrian world. I was told how many horses I should look at, how long I should take before responding to an offer on a horse, and so on, as if there is some secret formula for buying the perfect horse at the perfect time and at the perfect price. Every horse I looked at was too old, too young, too green, skinny, crazy, or too expensive. The list went on and I got to the point where I felt defeated and close to giving up on buying a horse at all because it would never be the right horse for me. I was even told: All you see is a horse with four legs and a tail; I see much more. I was terrified of offending and upsetting these people.<br>

I was told how many horses I should look at, how long I should take before responding to an offer on a horse, and so on, as if there is some secret formula for buying the perfect horse at the perfect time and at the perfect price. Every horse I looked at was too old, too young, too green, skinny, crazy, or too expensive. The list went on and I got to the point where I felt defeated and close to giving up on buying a horse at all because it would never be the right horse for me. I was even told: All you see is a horse with four legs and a tail; I see much more. I was terrified of offending and upsetting these people.<br>

horse, (Equus caballus), a hoofed herbivorous mammal of the family Equidae. It comprises a single species, Equus caballus, whose numerous varieties are called breeds. Before the advent of mechanised vehicles, the horse was widely used as a draft animal, and riding on horseback was one of the chief means of transportation.<br>
<br>
In prehistoric times the wild horse was probably first hunted for food. Research suggests that domestication had taken place by approximately 6,000 years ago. It is supposed that the horse was first used by a tribe of Indo-European origin that lived in the steppes north of the chain of mountains adjacent to the Black and Caspian seas. Influenced by climate, food, and humans, the horse rapidly acquired its present form.<br>
<br>
The relationship of the horse to humans has been unique. The horse is a partner and friend. It has ploughed fields and brought in the harvest, hauled goods and conveyed passengers, followed game and tracked cattle, and carried combatants into battle and adventurers to unknown lands. It has provided recreation in the form of jousts, tournaments, carousels, and the sport of riding. The influence of the horse is expressed in the English language in such terms as chivalry and cavalier, which connote honour, respect, good manners, and straightforwardness.<br>

Old Zoey knew his mood well enough and whinnied her warning, backing off into the dark recesses of the stable, but she need not have warned me for I sensed his intention. One look at the raised stick sent my heart thumping wildly with fear. Terrified, I knew I could not run, for there was nowhere to go, so I put my back to him and lashed out behind me. I felt my&nbsp; hooves strike home. I heard a cry of pain and turned to see him crawling out of the stable door dragging one leg stiffly behind him and muttering words of cruel vengeance.<br>
<br>
That next morning both Albert and his father came out together to the stables. His father was walking with a pronounced limp. They were carrying a collar each and I could see that Albert had been crying for his pale cheeks were stained with tears. They stood together at the stable door. I noticed with infinite pride and pleasure that my Albert was already taller than his father whose face was drawn and lined with pain. ‘If your mother hadn’t begged me last night, Albert, I’d have shot that horse on the spot. He could’ve killed me. Now I’m warning you, if that animal is not ploughing straight as an arrow inside a week, he’ll be sold on, and that’s a promise. It’s up to you. You say you can deal with him, and I’ll give you just one chance. He won’t let me go near him. He’s wild and vicious, and unless you make it your business to tame him and train him inside that week, he’s going. Do you understand? That horse has to earn his keep like everyone else around here – I don’t care how showy he is – that horse has got to learn how to work. And I’ll promise you another thing, Albert, if I have to lose that bet, then he has to go.’ He dropped the collar on the ground and turned on his heel to go. ‘Father,’ said Albert with resolution in his voice. ‘I’ll train Joey – I’ll train him to plough all right – but you must promise never to raise a stick to him again. He can’t be handled that way, I know him, Father. I know him as if he were my own brother.’ ‘You train him, Albert, you handle him. Don’t care how you do it. I don’t want to know,’ said his father dismissively. ‘I’ll not go near the brute again. I’d shoot him first.&nbsp;<br>

Horse-drawn streetcars first appeared in American cities in the early 1830s when the New York &amp; Harlem Railroad began running trains from Harlem to 27th Street, substituting horses for steam south of that point as required by a city statute. By 1838, the railroad possessed one hundred horses, forty cars, and four locomotives, with a depot and stables at 27th Street. Four horses pulled the car along iron strips laid on granite blocks. The tracks rose several inches above the street surface and provided a smooth ride for the vehicle on the rails, but proved a hindrance to cross town traffic. In 1845, the New York Common Council prohibited steam locomotives below 32nd Street, a limit extended in 1856 to 42nd Street, and the number of horse-drawn cars expanded. Passenger loads grew rapidly, as the streetcar provided a smoother ride and cheaper fares than the<br>
omnibus.<br>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>The Silver Chair</strong><br><br><em>by C.S.Lewis</em><br><br>
Without a glance at Jill the lion rose to its feet and gave one last blow. Then, as if satisfied with its work, it turned and stalked slowly away, back into the forest.<br>
<br>
"It must be a dream, it must, it must," said Jill to herself. "I'll wake up in a moment." But it wasn't, and she didn't.<br>
<br>
"I do wish we'd never come to this dreadful place," said Jill. "I don't believe Scrubb knew any more about it than I do. Or if he did, he had no business to bring me here without warning me what it was like. It's not my fault he fell over that cliff. If he'd left me alone we should both be all right." Then she remembered again the scream that Scrubb had given when he fell, and burst into tears.<br>
<br>
Crying is all right in its way while it lasts. But you have to stop sooner or later and then you still have to decide what to do. When Jill stopped, she found she was dreadfully thirsty. She had been lying face downward, and now she sat up. The birds had ceased singing and there was perfect silence except for one small persistent sound which seemed to come a good distance away. She listened carefully and felt almost sure it was the sound of running water.<br>
<br>
Jill got up and looked round her very carefully. There was no sign of the lion; but there were so many trees about that it might easily be quite close without her seeing it. For all she knew, there might be several lions. But her thirst was very bad now, and she plucked up her courage to go and look for that running water. She went on tip-toes, stealing cautiously from tree to tree, and stopping to peer round her at every step.<br>
<br>
The wood was so still that it was not difficult to decide where the sound was coming from. It grew clearer every moment and, sooner than she expected, she came to an open glade and saw the stream, bright as glass, running across the turf a stone's throw away from her. But although the sight of the water made her feel ten times thirstier than before, she didn't rush forward and drink. She stood as still as if she had been turned into stone, with her mouth wide open. And she had a very good reason; just on this side of the stream lay the lion.<br>
<br>
It lay with its head raised and its two fore-paws out in front of it, like the lions in Trafalgar Square. She knew at once that it had seen her, for its eyes looked straight into hers for a moment and then turned away—as if it knew her quite well and didn't think much of her.<br>
<br>
"If I run away, it'll be after me in a moment," thought Jill. "And if I go on, I shall run straight into its mouth." Anyway, she couldn't have moved if she had tried, and she couldn't take her eyes off it. How long this lasted, she could not be sure; it seemed like hours. And the thirst became so bad that she almost felt she would not mind being eaten by the lion if only she could be sure of getting a mouthful of water first.<br>
<br>
"If you're thirsty, you may drink."<br>
<br>
They were the first words she had heard since Scrubb had spoken to her on the edge of the cliff. For a second she stared here and there, wondering who had spoken. Then the voice said again, "If you are thirsty, come and drink," and of course she remembered what Scrubb had said about animals talking in that other world, and realised that it was the lion speaking. Anyway, she had seen its lips move this time, and the voice was not like a man's. It was deeper, wilder, and stronger; a sort of heavy, golden voice. It did not make her any less frightened than she had been before, but it made her frightened in rather a different way.<br>
<br>
"Are you not thirsty?" said the Lion.<br>
<br>
"I'm dying of thirst," said Jill.<br>
<br>
"Then drink," said the Lion.<br>
<br>
"May I—could I—would you mind going away while do?" said Jill.<br>
<br>
The Lion answered this only by a look and a very low growl. And as Jill gazed at its motionless bulk, she realised that she might as well have asked the whole mountain to move aside for her convenience.<br>
<br>
The delicious rippling noise of the stream was driving her nearly frantic.<br>
<br>
"Will you promise not to—do anything to me, if I do come?" said Jill.<br>
<br>
"I make no promise," said the Lion.<br>
<br>
Jill was so thirsty now that, without noticing it, she had come a step nearer.<br>
<br>
"Do you eat girls?" she said.<br>
<br>
"I have swallowed up girls and boys, women and men, kings and emperors, cities and realms," said the Lion. It didn't say this as if it were boasting, nor as if it were sorry, nor as if it were angry. It just said it.<br>
<br>
"I daren't come and drink," said Jill.<br>
<br>
"Then you will die of thirst," said the Lion.<br>
<br>
"Oh dear!" said Jill, coming another step nearer. "I suppose I must go and look for another stream then."<br>
<br>
"There is no other stream," said the Lion.<br>
<br>
It never occurred to Jill to disbelieve the Lion—no one who had seen his stern face could do that—and her mind suddenly made itself up. It was the worst thing she had ever had to do, but she went forward to the stream, knelt down, and began scooping up water in her hand. It was the coldest, most refreshing water she had ever tasted. You didn't need to drink much of it, for it quenched your thirst at once. Before she tasted it she had been intending to make a dash away from the Lion the moment she had finished. Now, she realised that this would be on the whole the most dangerous thing of all. She got up and stood there with her lips still wet from drinking.<br>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>The Silver Chair</strong><br><br><em>by C.S.Lewis</em><br><br>
Without a glance at Jill the lion rose to its feet and gave one last blow. Then, as if satisfied with its work, it turned and stalked slowly away, back into the forest.<br>
<br>
"It must be a dream, it must, it must," said Jill to herself. "I'll wake up in a moment." But it wasn't, and she didn't.<br>
<br>
"I do wish we'd never come to this dreadful place," said Jill. "I don't believe Scrubb knew any more about it than I do. Or if he did, he had no business to bring me here without warning me what it was like. It's not my fault he fell over that cliff. If he'd left me alone we should both be all right." Then she remembered again the scream that Scrubb had given when he fell, and burst into tears.<br>
<br>
Crying is all right in its way while it lasts. But you have to stop sooner or later and then you still have to decide what to do. When Jill stopped, she found she was dreadfully thirsty. She had been lying face downward, and now she sat up. The birds had ceased singing and there was perfect silence except for one small persistent sound which seemed to come a good distance away. She listened carefully and felt almost sure it was the sound of running water.<br>
<br>
Jill got up and looked round her very carefully. There was no sign of the lion; but there were so many trees about that it might easily be quite close without her seeing it. For all she knew, there might be several lions. But her thirst was very bad now, and she plucked up her courage to go and look for that running water. She went on tip-toes, stealing cautiously from tree to tree, and stopping to peer round her at every step.<br>
<br>
The wood was so still that it was not difficult to decide where the sound was coming from. It grew clearer every moment and, sooner than she expected, she came to an open glade and saw the stream, bright as glass, running across the turf a stone's throw away from her. But although the sight of the water made her feel ten times thirstier than before, she didn't rush forward and drink. She stood as still as if she had been turned into stone, with her mouth wide open. And she had a very good reason; just on this side of the stream lay the lion.<br>
<br>
It lay with its head raised and its two fore-paws out in front of it, like the lions in Trafalgar Square. She knew at once that it had seen her, for its eyes looked straight into hers for a moment and then turned away—as if it knew her quite well and didn't think much of her.<br>
<br>
"If I run away, it'll be after me in a moment," thought Jill. "And if I go on, I shall run straight into its mouth." Anyway, she couldn't have moved if she had tried, and she couldn't take her eyes off it. How long this lasted, she could not be sure; it seemed like hours. And the thirst became so bad that she almost felt she would not mind being eaten by the lion if only she could be sure of getting a mouthful of water first.<br>
<br>
"If you're thirsty, you may drink."<br>
<br>
They were the first words she had heard since Scrubb had spoken to her on the edge of the cliff. For a second she stared here and there, wondering who had spoken. Then the voice said again, "If you are thirsty, come and drink," and of course she remembered what Scrubb had said about animals talking in that other world, and realised that it was the lion speaking. Anyway, she had seen its lips move this time, and the voice was not like a man's. It was deeper, wilder, and stronger; a sort of heavy, golden voice. It did not make her any less frightened than she had been before, but it made her frightened in rather a different way.<br>

"Are you not thirsty?" said the Lion.<br>
<br>

<br>
"Do you eat girls?" she said.<br>
<br>
"I have swallowed up girls and boys, women and men, kings and emperors, cities and realms," said the Lion. It didn't say this as if it were boasting, nor as if it were sorry, nor as if it were angry. It just said it.<br>
<br>
"I daren't come and drink," said Jill.<br>

"Do you eat girls?" she said.<br>
<br>
"I have swallowed up girls and boys, women and men, kings and emperors, cities and realms," said the Lion. It didn't say this as if it were boasting, nor as if it were sorry, nor as if it were angry. It just said it.<br>
<br>
"I daren't come and drink," said Jill.<br>
<br>
"Then you will die of thirst," said the Lion.<br>
<br>
"Oh dear!" said Jill, coming another step nearer. "I suppose I must go and look for another stream then."<br>
<br>
"There is no other stream," said the Lion.<br>
<br>
It never occurred to Jill to disbelieve the Lion—no one who had seen his stern face could do that—and her mind suddenly made itself up. It was the worst thing she had ever had to do, but she went forward to the stream, knelt down, and began scooping up water in her hand. It was the coldest, most refreshing water she had ever tasted. You didn't need to drink much of it, for it quenched your thirst at once. Before she tasted it she had been intending to make a dash away from the Lion the moment she had finished. Now, she realised that this would be on the whole the most dangerous thing of all. She got up and stood there with her lips still wet from drinking.<br>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>The Silver Chair</strong><br><br><em>by C.S.Lewis</em><br><br>
Without a glance at Jill the lion rose to its feet and gave one last blow. Then, as if satisfied with its work, it turned and stalked slowly away, back into the forest.<br>
<br>
"It must be a dream, it must, it must," said Jill to herself. "I'll wake up in a moment." But it wasn't, and she didn't.<br>
<br>
"I do wish we'd never come to this dreadful place," said Jill. "I don't believe Scrubb knew any more about it than I do. Or if he did, he had no business to bring me here without warning me what it was like. It's not my fault he fell over that cliff. If he'd left me alone we should both be all right." Then she remembered again the scream that Scrubb had given when he fell, and burst into tears.<br>
<br>
Crying is all right in its way while it lasts. But you have to stop sooner or later and then you still have to decide what to do. When Jill stopped, she found she was dreadfully thirsty. She had been lying face downward, and now she sat up. The birds had ceased singing and there was perfect silence except for one small persistent sound which seemed to come a good distance away. She listened carefully and felt almost sure it was the sound of running water.<br>
<br>
Jill got up and looked round her very carefully. There was no sign of the lion; but there were so many trees about that it might easily be quite close without her seeing it. For all she knew, there might be several lions. But her thirst was very bad now, and she plucked up her courage to go and look for that running water. She went on tip-toes, stealing cautiously from tree to tree, and stopping to peer round her at every step.<br>
<br>
The wood was so still that it was not difficult to decide where the sound was coming from. It grew clearer every moment and, sooner than she expected, she came to an open glade and saw the stream, bright as glass, running across the turf a stone's throw away from her. But although the sight of the water made her feel ten times thirstier than before, she didn't rush forward and drink. She stood as still as if she had been turned into stone, with her mouth wide open. And she had a very good reason; just on this side of the stream lay the lion.<br>
<br>
It lay with its head raised and its two fore-paws out in front of it, like the lions in Trafalgar Square. She knew at once that it had seen her, for its eyes looked straight into hers for a moment and then turned away—as if it knew her quite well and didn't think much of her.<br>
<br>
"If I run away, it'll be after me in a moment," thought Jill. "And if I go on, I shall run straight into its mouth." Anyway, she couldn't have moved if she had tried, and she couldn't take her eyes off it. How long this lasted, she could not be sure; it seemed like hours. And the thirst became so bad that she almost felt she would not mind being eaten by the lion if only she could be sure of getting a mouthful of water first.<br>
<br>
"If you're thirsty, you may drink."<br>
<br>
They were the first words she had heard since Scrubb had spoken to her on the edge of the cliff. For a second she stared here and there, wondering who had spoken. Then the voice said again, "If you are thirsty, come and drink," and of course she remembered what Scrubb had said about animals talking in that other world, and realised that it was the lion speaking. Anyway, she had seen its lips move this time, and the voice was not like a man's. It was deeper, wilder, and stronger; a sort of heavy, golden voice. It did not make her any less frightened than she had been before, but it made her frightened in rather a different way.<br>
<br>
"Are you not thirsty?" said the Lion.<br>
<br>
"I'm dying of thirst," said Jill.<br>
<br>
"Then drink," said the Lion.<br>
<br>
"May I—could I—would you mind going away while do?" said Jill.<br>
<br>
The Lion answered this only by a look and a very low growl. And as Jill gazed at its motionless bulk, she realised that she might as well have asked the whole mountain to move aside for her convenience.<br>
<br>
The delicious rippling noise of the stream was driving her nearly frantic.<br>
<br>
"Will you promise not to—do anything to me, if I do come?" said Jill.<br>
<br>
"I make no promise," said the Lion.<br>
<br>
Jill was so thirsty now that, without noticing it, she had come a step nearer.<br>
<br>
"Do you eat girls?" she said.<br>
<br>
"I have swallowed up girls and boys, women and men, kings and emperors, cities and realms," said the Lion. It didn't say this as if it were boasting, nor as if it were sorry, nor as if it were angry. It just said it.<br>
<br>
"I daren't come and drink," said Jill.<br>
<br>
"Then you will die of thirst," said the Lion.<br>
<br>
"Oh dear!" said Jill, coming another step nearer. "I suppose I must go and look for another stream then."<br>
<br>
"There is no other stream," said the Lion.<br>
<br>
It never occurred to Jill to disbelieve the Lion—no one who had seen his stern face could do that—and her mind suddenly made itself up. It was the worst thing she had ever had to do, but she went forward to the stream, knelt down, and began scooping up water in her hand. It was the coldest, most refreshing water she had ever tasted.

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>The Silver Chair</strong><br><br><em>by C.S.Lewis</em><br><br>
Without a glance at Jill the lion rose to its feet and gave one last blow. Then, as if satisfied with its work, it turned and stalked slowly away, back into the forest.<br>
<br>
"It must be a dream, it must, it must," said Jill to herself. "I'll wake up in a moment." But it wasn't, and she didn't.<br>
<br>
"I do wish we'd never come to this dreadful place," said Jill. "I don't believe Scrubb knew any more about it than I do. Or if he did, he had no business to bring me here without warning me what it was like. It's not my fault he fell over that cliff. If he'd left me alone we should both be all right." Then she remembered again the scream that Scrubb had given when he fell, and burst into tears.<br>
<br>
Crying is all right in its way while it lasts. But you have to stop sooner or later and then you still have to decide what to do. When Jill stopped, she found she was dreadfully thirsty. She had been lying face downward, and now she sat up. The birds had ceased singing and there was perfect silence except for one small persistent sound which seemed to come a good distance away. She listened carefully and felt almost sure it was the sound of running water.<br>
<br>
Jill got up and looked round her very carefully. There was no sign of the lion; but there were so many trees about that it might easily be quite close without her seeing it. For all she knew, there might be several lions. But her thirst was very bad now, and she plucked up her courage to go and look for that running water. She went on tip-toes, stealing cautiously from tree to tree, and stopping to peer round her at every step.<br>
<br>
The wood was so still that it was not difficult to decide where the sound was coming from. It grew clearer every moment and, sooner than she expected, she came to an open glade and saw the stream, bright as glass, running across the turf a stone's throw away from her. But although the sight of the water made her feel ten times thirstier than before, she didn't rush forward and drink. She stood as still as if she had been turned into stone, with her mouth wide open. And she had a very good reason; just on this side of the stream lay the lion.<br>
<br>
It lay with its head raised and its two fore-paws out in front of it, like the lions in Trafalgar Square. She knew at once that it had seen her, for its eyes looked straight into hers for a moment and then turned away—as if it knew her quite well and didn't think much of her.<br>
<br>
"If I run away, it'll be after me in a moment," thought Jill. "And if I go on, I shall run straight into its mouth." Anyway, she couldn't have moved if she had tried, and she couldn't take her eyes off it. How long this lasted, she could not be sure; it seemed like hours. And the thirst became so bad that she almost felt she would not mind being eaten by the lion if only she could be sure of getting a mouthful of water first.<br>
<br>
"If you're thirsty, you may drink."<br>
<br>
They were the first words she had heard since Scrubb had spoken to her on the edge of the cliff. For a second she stared here and there, wondering who had spoken. Then the voice said again, "If you are thirsty, come and drink," and of course she remembered what Scrubb had said about animals talking in that other world, and realised that it was the lion speaking. Anyway, she had seen its lips move this time, and the voice was not like a man's. It was deeper, wilder, and stronger; a sort of heavy, golden voice. It did not make her any less frightened than she had been before, but it made her frightened in rather a different way.<br>
<br>
"Are you not thirsty?" said the Lion.<br>
<br>
"I'm dying of thirst," said Jill.<br>
<br>
"Then drink," said the Lion.<br>
<br>
"May I—could I—would you mind going away while do?" said Jill.<br>
<br>
The Lion answered this only by a look and a very low growl. And as Jill gazed at its motionless bulk, she realised that she might as well have asked the whole mountain to move aside for her convenience.<br>
<br>
The delicious rippling noise of the stream was driving her nearly frantic.<br>
<br>
"Will you promise not to—do anything to me, if I do come?" said Jill.<br>
<br>
"I make no promise," said the Lion.<br>
<br>
Jill was so thirsty now that, without noticing it, she had come a step nearer.<br>
<br>
"Do you eat girls?" she said.<br>
<br>
"I have swallowed up girls and boys, women and men, kings and emperors, cities and realms," said the Lion. It didn't say this as if it were boasting, nor as if it were sorry, nor as if it were angry. It just said it.<br>
<br>
"I daren't come and drink," said Jill.<br>
<br>
"Then you will die of thirst," said the Lion.<br>
<br>
"Oh dear!" said Jill, coming another step nearer. "I suppose I must go and look for another stream then."<br>
<br>
"There is no other stream," said the Lion.<br>
<br>
It never occurred to Jill to disbelieve the Lion—no one who had seen his stern face could do that—and her mind suddenly made itself up. It was the worst thing she had ever had to do, but she went forward to the stream, knelt down, and began scooping up water in her hand. It was the coldest, most refreshing water she had ever tasted. You didn't need to drink much of it, for it quenched your thirst at once. Before she tasted it she had been intending to make a dash away from the Lion the moment she had finished. Now, she realised that this would be on the whole the most dangerous thing of all. She got up and stood there with her lips still wet from drinking.<br>

        <p><em>Read the poem below by Maya Angelou then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</strong><br><br>
A free bird leaps<br>
on the back of the wind<br>
and floats downstream<br>
till the current ends<br>
and dips his wing<br>
in the orange sun rays<br>
and <span class="txt-underline"><strong>dares to claim the sky.</strong></span><br>
<br>
But a bird that stalks<br>
down his narrow cage<br>
can seldom see through<br>
his bars of rage<br>
his wings are clipped and<br>
his feet are tied<br>
so he opens his throat to sing.<br>
<br>
The caged bird sings<br>
with a fearful trill<br>
of things unknown<br>
but longed for still<br>
and his tune is heard<br>
on the distant hill<br>
for the caged bird<br>
sings of freedom.<br>
<br>
The free bird thinks of another breeze<br>
and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees<br>
and the fat worms waiting on a dawn bright lawn<br>
and he names the sky his own.<br>
<br>
B<span class="txt-underline"><strong>ut a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams</strong></span><br>
his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream<br>
his wings are clipped and his feet are tied<br>
so he opens his throat to sing.<br>

        <p><em>Read the poem below by Maya Angelou then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</strong><br><br>
A free bird leaps<br>
on the back of the wind<br>
and floats downstream<br>
till the current ends<br>
and dips his wing<br>
in the orange sun rays<br>
and <span class="txt-underline"><strong>dares to claim the sky.</strong></span><br>
<br>
But a bird that stalks<br>
down his narrow cage<br>
can seldom see through<br>
his bars of rage<br>
his wings are clipped and<br>
his feet are tied<br>
so he opens his throat to sing.<br>
<br>
The caged bird sings<br>
with a fearful trill<br>
of things unknown<br>
but longed for still<br>
and his tune is heard<br>
on the distant hill<br>
for the caged bird<br>
sings of freedom.<br>
<br>
The free bird thinks of another breeze<br>
and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees<br>
and the fat worms waiting on a dawn bright lawn<br>
and he names the sky his own.<br>
<br>
<span class="txt-underline"><strong>But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams</strong></span><br>
his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream<br>
his wings are clipped and his feet are tied<br>
so he opens his throat to sing.<br>
