          <strong>Tani’s Big Moves&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Tanitoluwa (Tani) Adewumi was introduced to the game of chess when he was six years old. His aim has always been to become the world’s youngest ever Grandmaster. <strong>12 ……</strong> Abhimanyu Mishra, is the current youngest Grandmaster. He reached that level at the age of 12 years, four months and 25 days old in June 2021.</p>
        <p>Tani is now 10 years old and on 1<sup>st</sup> May 2021 he became the United States’ newest national chess master. The title was awarded to him by the United States Chess Federation (USCF). It is certainly not an easy task to become a chess master. To win the title, players must acquire a rating of between 2200 and 2400. <strong>13 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>This very talented chess prodigy practises for hours every day after school. Now, that’s a lot of training and dedication! Tani said that the secret to his chess success is being able to think of his moves ahead of time. <strong>14 ……….</strong> He also stated that he has an ‘aggressive’ playing style and is very competitive and always gives 100 percent.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Tani became seriously interested in chess in 2017, when a teacher and chess instructor at his school in New York showed him the basics. He wanted so much to join the school chess club but his mum, Oluwatoyin, wasn’t sure if it was possible because of the travelling and chess competition costs. Tani’s family had fled Nigeria, Africa, and were living in a homeless shelter. <strong>15 ……….</strong>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Oluwatoyin spoke to the chess club’s instructor, Russell Makofsky about their current situation and he waived all of the costs. Tani’s family were very thankful for the generosity. At first, Tani was not as successful as he had hoped to be. But then, not even a year after joining the club, he earned seven trophies and was ranked number 27 in his age group. When Tani was eight years old in 2019, his family were still living in the homeless shelter. That same year, Tani made a name for himself when he defeated 73 competitors to win the New York State Scholastic Chess K-3 Championship. <strong>16 ……….</strong> The donated funds helped Tani’s family move into a permanent home.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Tani’s story is incredible, he went from being a refugee to a chess champion in just a few years. He has written about his unique and amazing path to success in an autobiography called <em>My Name Is Tani . . . And I Believe In Miracles</em>. What another fantastic achievement for Tani but it doesn’t end there! His book is going to be made into a movie by American author and comedian Trevor Noah. <strong>17 ……….</strong> And of course, Tani is practising hard to achieve his goal of becoming the youngest ever Grandmaster.</p>

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Sharks are mysterious and highly misunderstood aquatic creatures. When people think of sharks, they might think of the scary shark attacks reported on the news or the classic cult movie, <em>Jaws </em>from the 1970s. Unfortunately, there is a large degree of fear associated with sharks, perhaps because the average person doesn’t know much about them. Despite the fact that shark attacks are extremely rare, sadly not a lot of people have positive feelings about poor old sharks.<br>
<br>
Speaking of old, the earliest known shark identified, lived on Earth more than 420 million years ago. Sharks have outlived dinosaurs and countless other forms of life currently living on our planet. There are over 1,000 species of sharks and rays, with new species discovered every year!&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Sharks are a group of predatory fish which are identified by their cartilaginous skeleton, meaning that their internal skeleton is made up of flexible cartilage rather than bone. They have pectoral fins and five to seven gill slots on the side of their heads, to help them breathe and swim well.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Sharks are unique in many ways but their teeth are truly fascinating. Their teeth are embedded in their gums rather than attached to the jaw (in most other species) and are replaced throughout their life. Multiple rows of teeth grow in tiny grooves on the inside of the shark’s mouth and move forward when teeth need to be replaced. A shark will replace up to 30,000 to 40,000 teeth in their lifetime. People sometimes find sharks’ teeth washed up on the sand at beaches and it’s no wonder seeing as though they have so many!<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Requiem sharks are a group of sharks who travel through warm oceans. Requiem sharks include well-known species such as the Tiger shark, the Bull shark, the Blue shark, the Oceanic Whitetip shark and Reef sharks. Like most shark species, they have jagged, rough skin and sharp pointy teeth.<br>
<br>
Requiem sharks are quick and agile hunters and usually do most of their hunting at night. They eat a range of food sources depending on the species and their location. Some of their prey includes; bony fish, squids, octopuses, lobsters, turtles, marine mammals, seabird, other sharks and rays. Requiem sharks are often considered the "garbage cans" of the seas because they will eat almost anything.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
The Taronga Conservation Society has published some advice for people who are concerned about shark encounters. Firstly, it’s important to swim at a beach which is patrolled by surf life savers, and some beaches even have aerial shark patrols for extra safety.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Another wise thing to do is to always swim, dive or surf with other people. The more people that are around you reduces the chance of a shark approaching you. Some sharks are more active at dusk, dawn or at night, so it’s best to avoid swimming at these times. Also, do not enter the water if there are large schools of fish as they entice sharks to come close.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
And finally, it’s a good idea to leave any nice, shiny jewelry at home. The light that reflects off jewelry can look like the glistening sheen of fish scales which can also attract sharks. It is, of course, great to be prepared but the chances of being attacked by a shark and dying is 50 to 60 million to one.<br>

People sometimes find sharks’ teeth washed up on the sand at beaches and it’s no wonder seeing as though they have so many!<br>

Requiem sharks are a group of sharks who travel through warm oceans. Requiem sharks include well-known species such as the Tiger shark, the Bull shark, the Blue shark, the Oceanic Whitetip shark and Reef sharks. Like most shark species, they have jagged, rough skin and sharp pointy teeth.<br>
<br>
Requiem sharks are quick and agile hunters and usually do most of their hunting at night. They eat a range of food sources depending on the species and their location. Some of their prey includes; bony fish, squids, octopuses, lobsters, turtles, marine mammals, seabird, other sharks and rays. Requiem sharks are often considered the "garbage cans" of the seas because they will eat almost anything.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
The Taronga Conservation Society has published some advice for people who are concerned about shark encounters. Firstly, it’s important to swim at a beach which is patrolled by surf life savers, and some beaches even have aerial shark patrols for extra safety.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Another wise thing to do is to always swim, dive or surf with other people. The more people that are around you reduces the chance of a shark approaching you. Some sharks are more active at dusk, dawn or at night, so it’s best to avoid swimming at these times. Also, do not enter the water if there are large schools of fish as they entice sharks to come close.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
And finally, it’s a good idea to leave any nice, shiny jewelry at home. The light that reflects off jewelry can look like the glistening sheen of fish scales which can also attract sharks. It is, of course, great to be prepared but the chances of being attacked by a shark and dying is 50 to 60 million to one.<br>

Sharks are mysterious and highly misunderstood aquatic creatures. When people think of sharks, they might think of the scary shark attacks reported on the news or the classic cult movie,&nbsp;Jaws&nbsp;from the 1970s. Unfortunately, there is a large degree of fear associated with sharks, perhaps because the average person doesn’t know much about them. Despite the fact that shark attacks are extremely rare, sadly not a lot of people have positive feelings about poor old sharks.<br>
<br>
Speaking of old, the earliest known shark identified, lived on Earth more than 420 million years ago. Sharks have outlived dinosaurs and countless other forms of life currently living on our planet. There are over 1,000 species of sharks and rays, with new species discovered every year!&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Sharks are a group of predatory fish which are identified by their cartilaginous skeleton, meaning that their internal skeleton is made up of flexible cartilage rather than bone. They have pectoral fins and five to seven gill slots on the side of their heads, to help them breathe and swim well.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Sharks are unique in many ways but their teeth are truly fascinating. Their teeth are embedded in their gums rather than attached to the jaw (in most other species) and are replaced throughout their life. Multiple rows of teeth grow in tiny grooves on the inside of the shark’s mouth and move forward when teeth need to be replaced. A shark will replace up to 30,000 to 40,000 teeth in their lifetime.

  Winston’s laptop has a smart charging system designed to maximise battery health. It activates when the laptop hits less than 50% power. Once activated, the charger will continually charge until the laptop reaches 100% power, then it will deactivate.<br>

<strong>Nancy</strong>: “The computer is not charging right now so the battery must be above 50%.”<br>
