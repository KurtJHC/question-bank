        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>A World Without Email </strong><em>by Cal Newport&nbsp;</em><br><br>
On a Tuesday morning, just a couple of months into his new role, Acharya received an email from his CTO explaining that they had to temporarily shut down their office’s network due to a computer virus. “We all expected that this would be fixed in a couple of days,” Acharya told me when I later interviewed him about the incident. But this prediction proved wildly optimistic. The following week, an undersecretary of commerce convened a meeting. She explained that they suspected the virus infecting their network had come from a foreign power, and that Homeland Security was recommending that the network stay down while they traced the attack. Just to be safe, they were also going to destroy all the computers, laptops, printers— anything with a chip— in the office.</p>
        <p>One of the biggest impacts of this network shutdown was that the office lost the ability to send or receive emails. For security purposes, it was difficult for them to use personal email addresses to perform their government work, and bureaucratic hurdles kept them from setting up temporary accounts using other agencies’ networks. Acharya and his team were effectively cut off from the frenetic <span class="txt-underline"><strong>ping-pong</strong></span> of digital chatter that defines most highlevel work within the federal government. The blackout lasted six weeks. With a touch of gallows humour, they took to calling the fateful day when it all began “Dark Tuesday.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the sudden and unexpected loss of email made certain parts of Acharya’s work “quite hellish”. Because the rest of the government continued to rely heavily on this tool, he often worried about missing important meetings or requests. “There was an existing information pipeline,” he explained, “and I was out of the loop”. Another hardship was logistics. Acharya’s job required him to set up many meetings, and this task was substantially more annoying without the ability to coordinate over email.</p>
        <p>Perhaps less expected, however, was that Acharya’s work didn’t grind to a halt during these six weeks. He instead began to notice that he was actually getting better at his job. Lacking the ability to simply send a quick email when he had a question, he took to leaving his office to meet with people in person. Because these appointments were a pain to arrange, he scheduled longer blocks of time, allowing him to really get to know the people he was meeting and understand the nuances of their issues. As Acharya explained, these&nbsp;extended sessions proved “very valuable” for a new political appointee trying to learn the subtle dynamics of the federal government.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As I talked to Acharya about Dark Tuesday and its aftermath, it occurred to me that many of the hardships that made the blackout “hellish” seemed solvable. Acharya admitted, for example, that his concern about being out of the loop was largely alleviated by the simple habit of calling the White House each day to learn if there were any meetings he needed to know about. Presumably, a dedicated assistant or junior team member could handle this call. The other issue was the annoyance of scheduling meetings, but this could also be handled by an assistant or some sort of automated scheduling system. It seemed, in other words, that it might be possible to preserve the profound benefits of the email blackout while avoiding many of the accompanying annoyances. “What would you think of this way of working?” I asked after explaining my proposed fixes. The phone line went silent for a moment. I had pitched an idea so preposterous— permanently working without email— that Acharya’s mind had temporarily frozen.</p>

        <p><em>Read the poem below by Billy Collins then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Winter Syntax&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
A sentence starts out like a lone traveller&nbsp;<br>
heading into a blizzard at midnight,&nbsp;<br>
tilting into the wind, one arm shielding his face,&nbsp;<br>
the tails of his thin coat flapping behind him.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There are easier ways of making sense,&nbsp;<br>
the connoisseurship of gesture, for example.&nbsp;<br>
You hold a girl's face in your hands like a vase.&nbsp;<br>
You lift a gun from the glove compartment&nbsp;<br>
and toss it out the window into <span class="txt-underline"><strong>the desert heat</strong></span>.&nbsp;<br>
These cool moments are blazing with silence.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The full moon makes sense. When a cloud crosses it&nbsp;<br>
it becomes as eloquent as a bicycle leaning&nbsp;<br>
outside a drugstore or a dog who sleeps all afternoon&nbsp;<br>
in a corner of the couch.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Bare branches in winter are a form of writing.&nbsp;<br>
The unclothed body is autobiography.&nbsp;<br>
Every lake is a vowel, every island a noun.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But the traveller persists in his misery,&nbsp;<br>
struggling all night through the deepening snow,&nbsp;<br>
leaving <span class="txt-underline"><strong>a faint alphabet of bootprints&nbsp;</strong></span><br>
on the white hills and the white floors of valleys,&nbsp;<br>
a message for field mice and passing crows.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
At dawn he will spot the vine of smoke&nbsp;<br>
rising from your chimney, and when he stands&nbsp;<br>
before you shivering, draped in sparkling frost,&nbsp;<br>
a smile will appear in the beard of icicles,&nbsp;<br>
and the man will express a complete thought.</p>

        <p><em>Read the poem below by Billy Collins then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Winter Syntax&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
A sentence starts out like a lone traveller&nbsp;<br>
heading into a blizzard at midnight,&nbsp;<br>
tilting into the wind, one arm shielding his face,&nbsp;<br>
the tails of his thin coat flapping behind him.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There are easier ways of making sense,&nbsp;<br>
the connoisseurship of gesture, for example.&nbsp;<br>
You hold a girl's face in your hands like a vase.&nbsp;<br>
You lift a gun from the glove compartment&nbsp;<br>
and toss it out the window into&nbsp;the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>desert heat</strong></span>.&nbsp;<br>
These cool moments are blazing with silence.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The full moon makes sense. When a cloud crosses it&nbsp;<br>
it becomes as eloquent as a bicycle leaning&nbsp;<br>
outside a drugstore or a dog who sleeps all afternoon&nbsp;<br>
in a corner of the couch.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Bare branches in winter are a form of writing.&nbsp;<br>
The unclothed body is autobiography.&nbsp;<br>
Every lake is a vowel, every island a noun.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But the traveller persists in his misery,&nbsp;<br>
struggling all night through the deepening snow,&nbsp;<br>
leaving&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline"><strong>a faint alphabet of bootprints</strong></span>&nbsp;<br>
on the white hills and the white floors of valleys,&nbsp;<br>
a message for field mice and passing crows.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
At dawn he will spot the vine of smoke&nbsp;<br>
rising from your chimney, and when he stands&nbsp;<br>
before you shivering, draped in sparkling frost,&nbsp;<br>
a smile will appear in the beard of icicles,&nbsp;<br>
and the man will express a complete thought.</p>

        <p><em>Read the poem below by Billy Collins then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Winter Syntax&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
A sentence starts out like a lone traveller&nbsp;<br>
heading into a blizzard at midnight,&nbsp;<br>
tilting into the wind, one arm shielding his face,&nbsp;<br>
the tails of his thin coat flapping behind him.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There are easier ways of making sense,&nbsp;<br>
the connoisseurship of gesture, for example.&nbsp;<br>
You hold a girl's face in your hands like a vase.&nbsp;<br>
You lift a gun from the glove compartment&nbsp;<br>
and toss it out the window into&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline"><strong>the&nbsp;desert heat</strong></span>.&nbsp;<br>
These cool moments are blazing with silence.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The full moon makes sense. When a cloud crosses it&nbsp;<br>
it becomes as eloquent as a bicycle leaning&nbsp;<br>
outside a drugstore or a dog who sleeps all afternoon&nbsp;<br>
in a corner of the couch.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Bare branches in winter are a form of writing.&nbsp;<br>
The unclothed body is autobiography.&nbsp;<br>
Every lake is a vowel, every island a noun.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But the traveller persists in his misery,&nbsp;<br>
struggling all night through the deepening snow,&nbsp;<br>
leaving&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline"><strong>a faint alphabet of bootprints</strong></span>&nbsp;<br>
on the white hills and the white floors of valleys,&nbsp;<br>
a message for field mice and passing crows.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
At dawn he will spot the vine of smoke&nbsp;<br>
rising from your chimney, and when he stands&nbsp;<br>
before you shivering, draped in sparkling frost,&nbsp;<br>
a smile will appear in the beard of icicles,&nbsp;<br>
and the man will express a complete thought.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>What is Human Shelter &amp; Why Do Humans Need It?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Shelter is one of the fundamental requirements for every human being along with food and clothing. <strong>12 ……….</strong> So, humans need shelter to feel protected and for a sense of wellbeing. It is a comfortable place for a person where one can rest, rejuvenate and revive. In different phases of human life, there were varied forms of shelter. The history of human life gets traced to the primitive era. During the Palaeolithic age, also referred to as the stone age, for survival and in search of food, human beings lived under the trees and in natural caves. This era was around 25000 years ago.<strong> 13 ……….</strong> During this period, humans started using grass and wood to make their shelter in the form of a tent or hut. After this, was the Megalithic age, where formation of places of worship took place using stone. There have been many changes and transitions.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>The Stone Age</strong><br>
In the prehistoric era, man relied on nature for shelter and protection. The earliest form of housing was in the way of trees where people got minimal protection from the sun, rain and cold weather. <strong>14 ……….</strong> Another natural form of shelter was caves. These provide protection against weather but not from wild animals. The first man-made shelter got made with stones and tree branches. <strong>15 ……….</strong> With time, materials like stone slabs, bones and animal hide got used to building a stable, comfortable and secure shelter. Later, man started to make clay blocks and used it as the building block.<br>
<br>
<strong>Ancient Civilizations</strong><br>
Around 3100 BC, the ancient Egyptians started using sun-dried blocks to make flat-topped houses. Most domestic dwellings got built using perishable materials like wood and clay bricks. <strong>16 ………. </strong>The Assyrians further improved the concept of sun-dried bricks after 600 years. They discovered that baking bricks in the fire could make them harder and enhance their durability. They also started glazing the bricks to strengthen them and for improving their resistance to water.</p>
        <p>The ancient Greeks also lived in well-made stone houses with slanted roofs. Most of the structures were made using sun-dried bricks or wooden framework with some fibrous material like straw or seaweed. <strong>17 ……….</strong> They introduced the concept of central heating that provided them with protection from the cold weather. They started to lay down earthenware pipes under the floors and roof and ran hot water or air on them to heat.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>What is Human Shelter &amp; Why Do Humans Need It?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Shelter is one of the fundamental requirements for every human being along with food and clothing. <strong>12 ……….</strong> So, humans need shelter to feel protected and for a sense of wellbeing. It is a comfortable place for a person where one can rest, rejuvenate and revive. In different phases of human life, there were varied forms of shelter. The history of human life gets traced to the primitive era. During the Palaeolithic age, also referred to as the stone age, for survival and in search of food, human beings lived under the trees and in natural caves. This era was around 25000 years ago.<strong> 13 ……….</strong> During this period, humans started using grass and wood to make their shelter in the form of a tent or hut. After this, was the Megalithic age, where formation of places of worship took place using stone. There have been many changes and transitions.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>The Stone Age</strong><br>
In the prehistoric era, man relied on nature for shelter and protection. The earliest form of housing was in the way of trees where people got minimal protection from the sun, rain and cold weather. <strong>14 ……….</strong> Another natural form of shelter was caves. These provide protection against weather but not from wild animals. The first man-made shelter got made with stones and tree branches. <strong>15 ……….</strong> With time, materials like stone slabs, bones and animal hide got used to building a stable, comfortable and secure shelter. Later, man started to make clay blocks and used it as the building block.<br>
<br>
<strong>Ancient Civilizations</strong><br>
Around 3100 BC, the ancient Egyptians started using sun-dried blocks to make flat-topped houses. Most domestic dwellings got built using perishable materials like wood and clay bricks. <strong>16 ………. </strong>The Assyrians further improved the concept of sun-dried bricks after 600 years. They discovered that baking bricks in the fire could make them harder and enhance their durability. They also started glazing the bricks to strengthen them and for improving their resistance to water.</p>
        <p>The ancient Greeks also lived in well-made stone houses with slanted roofs. Most of the structures were made using sun-dried bricks or wooden framework with some fibrous material like straw or seaweed. <strong>17 ……….</strong> They introduced the concept of central heating that provided them with protection from the cold weather. They started to lay down earthenware pipes under the floors and roof and ran hot water or air on them to heat.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>What is Human Shelter &amp; Why Do Humans Need It?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Shelter is one of the fundamental requirements for every human being along with food and clothing. <strong>12 ……….</strong> So, humans need shelter to feel protected and for a sense of wellbeing. It is a comfortable place for a person where one can rest, rejuvenate and revive. In different phases of human life, there were varied forms of shelter. The history of human life gets traced to the primitive era. During the Palaeolithic age, also referred to as the stone age, for survival and in search of food, human beings lived under the trees and in natural caves. This era was around 25000 years ago.<strong> 13 ……….</strong> During this period, humans started using grass and wood to make their shelter in the form of a tent or hut. After this, was the Megalithic age, where formation of places of worship took place using stone. There have been many changes and transitions.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>The Stone Age</strong><br>
In the prehistoric era, man relied on nature for shelter and protection. The earliest form of housing was in the way of trees where people got minimal protection from the sun, rain and cold weather. <strong>14 ……….</strong> Another natural form of shelter was caves. These provide protection against weather but not from wild animals. The first man-made shelter got made with stones and tree branches. <strong>15 ……….</strong> With time, materials like stone slabs, bones and animal hide got used to building a stable, comfortable and secure shelter. Later, man started to make clay blocks and used it as the building block.<br>
<br>
<strong>Ancient Civilizations</strong><br>
Around 3100 BC, the ancient Egyptians started using sun-dried blocks to make flat-topped houses. Most domestic dwellings got built using perishable materials like wood and clay bricks. <strong>16 ………. </strong>The Assyrians further improved the concept of sun-dried bricks after 600 years. They discovered that baking bricks in the fire could make them harder and enhance their durability. They also started glazing the bricks to strengthen them and for improving their resistance to water.</p>
        <p>The ancient Greeks also lived in well-made stone houses with slanted roofs. Most of the structures were made using sun-dried bricks or wooden framework with some fibrous material like straw or seaweed.<strong> 17 ……….</strong> They introduced the concept of central heating that provided them with protection from the cold weather. They started to lay down earthenware pipes under the floors and roof and ran hot water or air on them to heat.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>What is Human Shelter &amp; Why Do Humans Need It?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Shelter is one of the fundamental requirements for every human being along with food and clothing. <strong>12 ……….</strong> So, humans need shelter to feel protected and for a sense of wellbeing. It is a comfortable place for a person where one can rest, rejuvenate and revive. In different phases of human life, there were varied forms of shelter. The history of human life gets traced to the primitive era. During the Palaeolithic age, also referred to as the stone age, for survival and in search of food, human beings lived under the trees and in natural caves. This era was around 25000 years ago.<strong> 13 ……….</strong> During this period, humans started using grass and wood to make their shelter in the form of a tent or hut. After this, was the Megalithic age, where formation of places of worship took place using stone. There have been many changes and transitions.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>The Stone Age</strong><br>
In the prehistoric era, man relied on nature for shelter and protection. The earliest form of housing was in the way of trees where people got minimal protection from the sun, rain and cold weather. <strong>14 ……….</strong> Another natural form of shelter was caves. These provide protection against weather but not from wild animals. The first man-made shelter got made with stones and tree branches. <strong>15 ……….</strong> With time, materials like stone slabs, bones and animal hide got used to building a stable, comfortable and secure shelter. Later, man started to make clay blocks and used it as the building block.<br>
<br>
<strong>Ancient Civilizations</strong><br>
Around 3100 BC, the ancient Egyptians started using sun-dried blocks to make flat-topped houses. Most domestic dwellings got built using perishable materials like wood and clay bricks. <strong>16 ………. </strong>The Assyrians further improved the concept of sun-dried bricks after 600 years. They discovered that baking bricks in the fire could make them harder and enhance their durability. They also started glazing the bricks to strengthen them and for improving their resistance to water.</p>
        <p>The ancient Greeks also lived in well-made stone houses with slanted roofs. Most of the structures were made using sun-dried bricks or wooden framework with some fibrous material like straw or seaweed. <strong>17 ………. </strong>They introduced the concept of central heating that provided them with protection from the cold weather. They started to lay down earthenware pipes under the floors and roof and ran hot water or air on them to heat.</p>

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Western medicine, which forms the basis of many of the world’s modern health systems, can be traced back to ancient times. While health and ill health was initially thought to be dictated by the Gods, the ancient Greeks were the first to look at the body through the lens of human biology. They studied health by looking at four bodily fluids or ‘humors’ — blood, black bile, yellow bile and phlegm.<br>
<br>
Today, western medicine remains largely founded on the principles established by the ancient Greeks. And as western medicine has evolved over the past 3,000 years, the key foundations of medical practice remain the same. Some of these include:<br>
<br>
• inquiry and examination of the physical body and its symptoms.<br>
• a scientific, evidence-based diagnosis of health, using clinically-proven treatments.<br>
• health as a human right that should be promoted and protected.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Eastern medicine refers to a range of medical practices that originated throughout Asia. And although these practices have evolved over thousands of years, they still retain many of their original approaches to healing today. The philosophy which underpins most eastern medicine is the practice of treating the whole person, and not just the symptom.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
While Australia is predominantly influenced by western medicine, many people use elements of eastern medicine as part of their approach to better health. Two of the most common forms of eastern medicine found in Australia are:<br>
<br>
1.&nbsp;Chinese medicine: Dating back more than 2,000 years, Chinese medicine looks at the balance of energy in the body that runs through invisible ‘meridians’. If a patient presents as unwell, a Chinese medicine practitioner will investigate where the flow of qi (pronounced ‘chee’) — or life force — may be blocked in the body by undertaking a tongue and pulse analysis.

Many principles and techniques from eastern medicine have become commonplace in western practices, for example treating the ‘whole person’ rather than a symptom or disease, or using techniques like meditation as part of treatment for mental health issues. And emerging research indicates that certain therapies originating from eastern medicine such as meditation, Chinese herbal medicine and acupuncture may work for a number of health conditions, and in some cases, the two schools of thought can be complementary. For example, if you visit your GP with complaints about a sore lower back, they may prescribe you with short-term pain medication, as well as refer you to a physiotherapist to build and strengthen lower back muscles. Your doctor or physio may also suggest evidence-based eastern therapies, such as acupuncture, as an alternative way to relieve pain.<br>

Western medicine, which forms the basis of many of the world’s modern health systems, can be traced back to ancient times. While health and ill health was initially thought to be dictated by the Gods, the ancient Greeks were the first to look at the body through the lens of human biology. They studied health by looking at four bodily fluids or ‘humors’ — blood, black bile, yellow bile and phlegm.<br>
<br>
Today, western medicine remains largely founded on the principles established by the ancient Greeks. And as western medicine has evolved over the past 3,000 years, the key foundations of medical practice remain the same. Some of these include:<br>
<br>
• inquiry and examination of the physical body and its symptoms.<br>
• a scientific, evidence-based diagnosis of health, using clinically-proven treatments.<br>
• health as a human right that should be promoted and protected.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Eastern medicine refers to a range of medical practices that originated throughout Asia. And although these practices have evolved over thousands of years, they still retain many of their original approaches to healing today. The philosophy which underpins most eastern medicine is the practice of treating the whole person, and not just the symptom.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
While Australia is predominantly influenced by western medicine, many people use elements of eastern medicine as part of their approach to better health. Two of the most common forms of eastern medicine found in Australia are:<br>
<br>
1.&nbsp;Chinese medicine: Dating back more than 2,000 years, Chinese medicine looks at the balance of energy in the body that runs through invisible ‘meridians’. If a patient presents as unwell, a Chinese medicine practitioner will investigate where the flow of qi (pronounced ‘chee’) — or life force — may be blocked in the body by undertaking a tongue and pulse analysis. Patients may be prescribed herbal medicines, acupuncture and remedial massage.<br>
<br>
2. Ayurveda: The ancient Indian practice of Ayurveda looks at the balance of three elemental energies — fire, water and air — and where an individual might have an excess of one of these elements. Patients of Ayurveda are treated via changes to diet, massage, herbal medicine and meditation.<br>

Today, western medicine remains largely founded on the principles established by the ancient Greeks. And as western medicine has evolved over the past 3,000 years, the key foundations of medical practice remain the same. Some of these include:<br>
<br>
• inquiry and examination of the physical body and its symptoms.<br>
• a scientific, evidence-based diagnosis of health, using clinically-proven treatments.<br>
• health as a human right that should be promoted and protected.<br>

Eastern medicine refers to a range of medical practices that originated throughout Asia. And although these practices have evolved over thousands of years, they still retain many of their original approaches to healing today. The philosophy which underpins most eastern medicine is the practice of treating the whole person, and not just the symptom.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
While Australia is predominantly influenced by western medicine, many people use elements of eastern medicine as part of their approach to better health. Two of the most common forms of eastern medicine found in Australia are:<br>
<br>
1.&nbsp;Chinese medicine: Dating back more than 2,000 years, Chinese medicine looks at the balance of energy in the body that runs through invisible ‘meridians’. If a patient presents as unwell, a Chinese medicine practitioner will investigate where the flow of qi (pronounced ‘chee’) — or life force — may be blocked in the body by undertaking a tongue and pulse analysis. Patients may be prescribed herbal medicines, acupuncture and remedial massage.<br>
<br>
2. Ayurveda: The ancient Indian practice of Ayurveda looks at the balance of three elemental energies — fire, water and air — and where an individual might have an excess of one of these elements. Patients of Ayurveda are treated via changes to diet, massage, herbal medicine and meditation.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Many principles and techniques from eastern medicine have become commonplace in western practices, for example treating the ‘whole person’ rather than a symptom or disease, or using techniques like meditation as part of treatment for mental health issues. And emerging research indicates that certain therapies originating from eastern medicine such as meditation, Chinese herbal medicine and acupuncture may work for a number of health conditions, and in some cases, the two schools of thought can be complementary. For example, if you visit your GP with complaints about a sore lower back, they may prescribe you with short-term pain medication, as well as refer you to a physiotherapist to build and strengthen lower back muscles. Your doctor or physio may also suggest evidence-based eastern therapies, such as acupuncture, as an alternative way to relieve pain.<br>

Western medicine, which forms the basis of many of the world’s modern health systems, can be traced back to ancient times. While health and ill health was initially thought to be dictated by the Gods, the ancient Greeks were the first to look at the body through the lens of human biology. They studied health by looking at four bodily fluids or ‘humors’ — blood, black bile, yellow bile and phlegm.<br>
