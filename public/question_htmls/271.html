        <p>For the next eight or ten months, Oliver was the victim of a systematic course of treachery and deception. He was brought up by hand. The hungry and destitute situation of the infant orphan was duly reported by the workhouse authorities to the parish authorities. The parish authorities inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities, whether there was no female then domiciled in 'the house' who was in a situation to impart to Oliver Twist, the consolation and nourishment of which he stood in need. The workhouse authorities replied with humility, that there was not. Upon this, the parish authorities <strong>magnanimously</strong> and humanely resolved, that Oliver should be 'farmed,' or, in other words, that he should be dispatched to a branch-workhouse some three miles off, where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders against the poor-laws, rolled about the floor all day, without the inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing, under the parental superintendence of an elderly female, who received the culprits at and for the consideration of sevenpence-halfpenny per small head per week. Sevenpence-halfpenny's worth per week is a good round diet for a child; a great deal may be got for sevenpence-halfpenny, quite enough to overload its stomach, and make it uncomfortable. The elderly female was a woman of wisdom and experience; she knew what was good for children; and she had a very accurate perception of what was good for herself. So, she appropriated the greater part of the weekly stipend to her own use, and consigned the rising parochial generation to even a shorter allowance than was originally provided for them. Thereby finding in the lowest depth a deeper still; and proving herself a very great experimental philosopher.</p>
        <p>Everybody knows the story of another experimental philosopher who had a great theory about a horse being able to live without eating, and who demonstrated it so well, that he had got his own horse down to a straw a day, and would unquestionably have rendered him a very spirited and rampacious animal on nothing at all, if he had not died, four-and-twenty hours before he was to have had his first comfortable bait of air. Unfortunately for, the experimental philosophy of the female to whose protecting care Oliver Twist was delivered over, a similar result usually attended the operation of HER system; for at the very moment when the child had contrived to exist upon the smallest possible portion of the weakest possible food, it did perversely happen in eight and a half cases out of ten, either that it sickened from want and cold, or fell into the fire from neglect, or got half-smothered by accident; in any one of which cases, the miserable little being was usually summoned into another world, and there gathered to the fathers it had never known in this.</p>
        <p>Occasionally, when there was some more than usually interesting inquest upon a parish child who had been overlooked in turning up a bedstead, or inadvertently scalded to death when there happened to be a washing--though the latter accident was very scarce, anything approaching to&nbsp; a washing being of rare occurance in the farm--the jury would take it into their heads to ask troublesome questions, or the parishioners would rebelliously affix their signatures to a remonstrance. But these <strong>impertinences</strong> were speedily checked by the evidence of the surgeon, and the testimony of the beadle; the former of whom had always opened the body and found nothing inside (which was very probable indeed), and the latter of whom invariably swore whatever the parish wanted; which was very self-devotional. Besides, the board made periodical pilgrimages to the farm, and always sent the beadle the day before, to say they were going. The children were neat and clean to behold, when THEY went; and what more would the people have!</p>
        <p>It cannot be expected that this system of farming would produce any very extraordinary or luxuriant crop. Oliver Twist's ninth birthday found him a pale thin child, somewhat diminutive in stature and decidely small in circumference. But nature or inheritance had implanted a good sturdy spirit in Oliver's breast. It had had plenty of room to expand, thanks to the spare diet of the establishment; and perhaps to this circumstance may be attributed his having any ninth birth-day at all. Be this as it may, however, it was his ninth birthday; and he was keeping it in the coal-cellar with a select party of two other young gentleman, who, after participating with him in a sound thrashing, had been locked up for atrociously presuming to be hungry, when Mrs. Mann, the good lady of the house, was unexpectedly startled by the apparition of Mr. Bumble, the beadle, striving to undo the wicket of the garden-gate.</p>

        <p>Occasionally, when there was some more than usually interesting inquest upon a parish child who had been overlooked in turning up a bedstead, or inadvertently scalded to death when there happened to be a washing--though the latter accident was very scarce, anything approaching to&nbsp; a washing being of rare occurance in the farm--the jury would take it into their heads to ask troublesome questions, or the parishioners would rebelliously affix their signatures to a remonstrance. But these <strong>impertinences</strong> were speedily checked by the evidence of the surgeon, and the testimony of the beadle; the former of whom had always opened the body and found nothing inside (which was very probable indeed), and the latter of whom invariably swore whatever the parish wanted; which was very self-devotional. Besides, the board made periodical pilgrimages to the farm, and always sent the beadle the day before, to say they were going. The children were neat and clean to behold, when THEY went; and what more would the people have!</p>
        <p>It cannot be expected that this system of farming would produce any very extraordinary or luxuriant crop. Oliver Twist's ninth birthday found him a pale thin child, somewhat diminutive in stature and decidely small in circumference. But nature or inheritance had implanted a good sturdy spirit in Oliver's breast. It had had plenty of room to expand, thanks to the spare diet of the establishment; and perhaps to this circumstance may be attributed his having any ninth birth-day at all. Be this as it may, however, it was his ninth birthday; and he was keeping it in the coal-cellar with a select party of two other young gentleman, who, after participating with him in a sound thrashing, had been locked up for atrociously presuming to be hungry, when Mrs. Mann, the good lady of the house, was unexpectedly startled by the apparition of Mr. Bumble, the beadle, striving to undo the wicket of the garden-gate.</p>

        <p>For the next eight or ten months, Oliver was the victim of a systematic course of treachery and deception. He was brought up by hand. The hungry and destitute situation of the infant orphan was duly reported by the workhouse authorities to the parish authorities. The parish authorities inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities, whether there was no female then domiciled in 'the house' who was in a situation to impart to Oliver Twist, the consolation and nourishment of which he stood in need. The workhouse authorities replied with humility, that there was not. Upon this, the parish authorities <strong>magnanimously</strong> and humanely resolved, that Oliver should be 'farmed,' or, in other words, that he should be dispatched to a branch-workhouse some three miles off, where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders against the poor-laws, rolled about the floor all day, without the inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing, under the parental superintendence of an elderly female, who received the culprits at and for the consideration of sevenpence-halfpenny per small head per week. Sevenpence-halfpenny's worth per week is a good round diet for a child; a great deal may be got for sevenpence-halfpenny, quite enough to overload its stomach, and make it uncomfortable. The elderly female was a woman of wisdom and experience; she knew what was good for children; and she had a very accurate perception of what was good for herself. So, she appropriated the greater part of the weekly stipend to her own use, and consigned the rising parochial generation to even a shorter allowance than was originally provided for them. Thereby finding in the lowest depth a deeper still; and proving herself a very great experimental philosopher.</p>

          <strong>International Currency</strong>
        </p>
        <p>If you travel internationally, you most likely will need to exchange your own&nbsp;currency&nbsp;for that of the country you are visiting. The amount of money you’ll get for a given amount of your country’s currency is based on internationally determined&nbsp;exchange rates. Exchange rates can be either fixed or floating. Fixed exchange rates use a standard, such as gold or another precious metal, and each unit of currency corresponds to a fixed quantity of that standard that should (theoretically) exist. For example, in 1968 the U.S. Treasury determined that it would buy and sell one ounce of gold at a cost of $35. Other countries would establish their own cost for the equivalent ounce. A floating exchange rate means that each currency isn’t necessarily backed by a resource.&nbsp;Current international exchange rates are determined by a managed floating exchange rate. A managed floating exchange rate means that each currency’s value is affected by the economic actions of its government or central bank.</p>
        <p>The managed floating exchange rate hasn’t always been used. The&nbsp;gold standard&nbsp;controlled international exchange rates until the 1910s. Another very similar system called the&nbsp;gold-exchange standard&nbsp;became prominent in the 1930s. This system allowed countries to back their currency not in gold but with other currencies on the gold standard, such as U.S. dollars and British pounds. The&nbsp;International Monetary Fund&nbsp;(IMF) was responsible for stabilizing the currency exchange rates until the 1970s, when the U.S. ended its use of fixed exchange rates.</p>
        <p>The dwindling amount of gold resources forced the U.S. to give up any gold-controlled standard, and the international monetary system began to be based on the dollar and other paper currencies. Governments can stabilize their exchange rates by importing a smaller amount of goods and exporting a larger amount. Similarly, they can devalue other currencies to boost the status of their own by selling them to other countries. The gold-standard exchange and the IMF added stability to the world market, but it didn’t come without its own problems. Linking a currency to a finite material would make the markets inflexible and could potentially lead to one country’s being able to economically isolate itself from trade. With a managed floating exchange rate, countries are encouraged to trade.</p>

          <strong>International Currency</strong>
        </p>
        <p>If you travel internationally, you most likely will need to exchange your own&nbsp;currency&nbsp;for that of the country you are visiting. The amount of money you’ll get for a given amount of your country’s currency is based on internationally determined&nbsp;exchange rates. Exchange rates can be either fixed or floating. Fixed exchange rates use a standard, such as gold or another precious metal, and each unit of currency corresponds to a fixed quantity of that standard that should (theoretically) exist. For example, in 1968 the U.S. Treasury determined that it would buy and sell one ounce of gold at a cost of $35. Other countries would establish their own cost for the equivalent ounce. A floating exchange rate means that each currency isn’t necessarily backed by a resource.&nbsp;Current international exchange rates are determined by a managed floating exchange rate.

          <strong>International Currency</strong>
        </p>
        <p>If you travel internationally, you most likely will need to exchange your own&nbsp;currency&nbsp;for that of the country you are visiting. The amount of money you’ll get for a given amount of your country’s currency is based on internationally determined&nbsp;exchange rates. Exchange rates can be either fixed or floating. Fixed exchange rates use a standard, such as gold or another precious metal, and each unit of currency corresponds to a fixed quantity of that standard that should (theoretically) exist. For example, in 1968 the U.S. Treasury determined that it would buy and sell one ounce of gold at a cost of $35. Other countries would establish their own cost for the equivalent ounce. A floating exchange rate means that each currency isn’t necessarily backed by a resource.&nbsp;Current international exchange rates are determined by a managed floating exchange rate. A managed floating exchange rate means that each currency’s value is affected by the economic actions of its government or central bank.</p>
        <p>The managed floating exchange rate hasn’t always been used. The&nbsp;gold standard&nbsp;controlled international exchange rates until the 1910s. Another very similar system called the&nbsp;gold-exchange standard&nbsp;became prominent in the 1930s. This system allowed countries to back their currency not in gold but with other currencies on the gold standard, such as U.S. dollars and British pounds. The&nbsp;International Monetary Fund&nbsp;(IMF) was responsible for stabilizing the currency exchange rates until the 1970s, when the U.S. ended its use of fixed exchange rates.</p>
        <p>The dwindling amount of gold resources forced the U.S. to give up any gold-controlled standard, and the international monetary system began to be based on the dollar and other paper currencies. Governments can stabilize their exchange rates by importing a smaller amount of goods and exporting a larger amount. Similarly, they can devalue other currencies to boost the status of their own by selling them to other countries. The gold-standard exchange and the IMF added stability to the world market, but it didn’t come without its own problems. Linking a currency to a finite material would make the markets inflexible and could potentially lead to one country’s being able to economically isolate itself from trade. With a managed floating exchange rate, countries are encouraged to trade.</p>

          <strong>Les Miserable</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <em>By Victor Hugo</em>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; When Fantine saw that she was making her living, she felt joyful for a moment. To live honestly by her own labour, what mercy from heaven! The taste for work had really returned to her. She bought a looking-glass, took pleasure in surveying in it her youth, her beautiful hair, her fine teeth; she forgot many things; she thought only of Cosette and of the possible future, and was almost happy. She hired a little room and furnished on credit on the strength of her future work—a lingering trace of her <strong>improvident</strong> ways. As she was not able to say that she was married she took good care, as we have seen, not to mention her little girl.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At first, as the reader has seen, she paid the Thénardiers promptly. As she only knew how to sign her name, she was obliged to write through a public letter-writer.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She wrote often, and this was noticed. It began to be said in an undertone, in the women’s workroom, that Fantine “wrote letters” and that “she had ways about her.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There is no one for spying on people’s actions like those who are not concerned in them. Why does that gentleman never come except at nightfall? Why does Mr. So-and-So never hang his key on its nail on Tuesday? Why does he always take the narrow streets? Why does Madame always descend from her hackney-coach before reaching her house? Why does she send out to purchase six sheets of note paper, when she has a “whole stationer’s shop full of it?” etc. There exist beings who, for the sake of obtaining the key to these enigmas, which are, moreover, of no consequence whatever to them, spend more money, waste more time, take more trouble, than would be required for ten good actions, and that gratuitously, for their own pleasure, without receiving any other payment for their curiosity than curiosity. They will follow up such and such a man or woman for whole days; they will do sentry duty for hours at a time on the corners of the streets, under alley-way doors at night, in cold and rain; they will bribe errand-porters, they will make the drivers of hackney-coaches and lackeys tipsy, buy a waiting-maid, suborn a porter. Why? For no reason. A pure passion for seeing, knowing, and penetrating into things. A pure itch for talking. And often these secrets once known, these mysteries made public, these enigmas illuminated by the light of day, bring on catastrophes, duels, failures, the ruin of families, and broken lives, to the great joy of those who have “found out everything,” without any interest in the matter, and by pure instinct. A sad thing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Certain persons are malicious solely through a necessity for talking. Their conversation, the chat of the drawing-room, gossip of the anteroom, is like those chimneys which consume wood rapidly; they need a great amount of combustibles; and their combustibles are furnished by their neighbours.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;So Fantine was watched.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, many a one was jealous of her golden hair and of her white teeth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was remarked that in the workroom she often turned aside, in the midst of the rest, to wipe away a tear. These were the moments when she was thinking of her child; perhaps, also, of the man whom she had loved.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Breaking the gloomy bonds of the past is a mournful task.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was observed that she wrote twice a month at least, and that she paid the carriage on the letter. They managed to obtain the address:<em>&nbsp;Monsieur, Monsieur Thénardier, inn-keeper at Montfermeil</em>. The public writer, a good old man who could not fill his stomach with red wine without emptying his pocket of secrets, was made to talk in the wine-shop. In short, it was discovered that Fantine had a child. “She must be a pretty sort of a woman.” An old gossip was found, who made the trip to Montfermeil, talked to the Thénardiers, and said on her return: “For my five and thirty francs I have freed my mind. I have seen the child.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The gossip who did this thing was a gorgon named Madame Victurnien, the guardian and door-keeper of every one’s virtue. Madame Victurnien was fifty-six, and re-enforced the mask of ugliness with the mask of age. A quavering voice, a whimsical mind. This old dame had once been young—astonishing fact! In her youth, in ‘93, she had married a monk who had fled from his cloister in a red cap, and passed from the Bernardines to the Jacobins. She was dry, rough, peevish, sharp, captious, almost venomous; all this in memory of her monk, whose widow she was, and who had ruled over her masterfully and bent her to his will. She was a nettle in which the rustle of the cassock was visible. At the Restoration she had turned bigot, and that with so much energy that the priests had forgiven her her monk. She had a small property, which she <strong>bequeathed</strong> with much ostentation to a religious community. She was in high favor at the episcopal palace of Arras. So this Madame Victurnien went to Montfermeil, and returned with the remark, “I have seen the child.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;All this took time. Fantine had been at the factory for more than a year, when, one morning, the superintendent of the workroom handed her fifty francs from the mayor, told her that she was no longer employed in the shop, and requested her, in the mayor’s name, to leave the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This was the very month when the Thénardiers, after having demanded twelve francs instead of six, had just exacted fifteen francs instead of twelve.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Fantine was overwhelmed. She could not leave the neighborhood; she was in debt for her rent and furniture. Fifty francs was not sufficient to cancel this debt. She stammered a few supplicating words. The superintendent ordered her to leave the shop on the instant. Besides, Fantine was only a moderately good workwoman. Overcome with shame, even more than with despair, she quitted the shop, and returned to her room. So her fault was now known to every one.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She no longer felt strong enough to say a word. She was advised to see the mayor; she did not dare. The mayor had given her fifty francs because he was good, and had dismissed her because he was just. She bowed before the decision.</p>

        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; When Fantine saw that she was making her living, she felt joyful for a moment. To live honestly by her own labour, what mercy from heaven! The taste for work had really returned to her. She bought a looking-glass, took pleasure in surveying in it her youth, her beautiful hair, her fine teeth; she forgot many things; she thought only of Cosette and of the possible future, and was almost happy. She hired a little room and furnished on credit on the strength of her future work—a lingering trace of her <strong>improvident</strong> ways. As she was not able to say that she was married she took good care, as we have seen, not to mention her little girl.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At first, as the reader has seen, she paid the Thénardiers promptly. As she only knew how to sign her name, she was obliged to write through a public letter-writer.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She wrote often, and this was noticed. It began to be said in an undertone, in the women’s workroom, that Fantine “wrote letters” and that “she had ways about her.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There is no one for spying on people’s actions like those who are not concerned in them. Why does that gentleman never come except at nightfall? Why does Mr. So-and-So never hang his key on its nail on Tuesday? Why does he always take the narrow streets? Why does Madame always descend from her hackney-coach before reaching her house? Why does she send out to purchase six sheets of note paper, when she has a “whole stationer’s shop full of it?” etc. There exist beings who, for the sake of obtaining the key to these enigmas, which are, moreover, of no consequence whatever to them, spend more money, waste more time, take more trouble, than would be required for ten good actions, and that gratuitously, for their own pleasure, without receiving any other payment for their curiosity than curiosity. They will follow up such and such a man or woman for whole days; they will do sentry duty for hours at a time on the corners of the streets, under alley-way doors at night, in cold and rain; they will bribe errand-porters, they will make the drivers of hackney-coaches and lackeys tipsy, buy a waiting-maid, suborn a porter. Why? For no reason. A pure passion for seeing, knowing, and penetrating into things. A pure itch for talking. And often these secrets once known, these mysteries made public, these enigmas illuminated by the light of day, bring on catastrophes, duels, failures, the ruin of families, and broken lives, to the great joy of those who have “found out everything,” without any interest in the matter, and by pure instinct. A sad thing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Certain persons are malicious solely through a necessity for talking. Their conversation, the chat of the drawing-room, gossip of the anteroom, is like those chimneys which consume wood rapidly; they need a great amount of combustibles; and their combustibles are furnished by their neighbours.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;So Fantine was watched.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, many a one was jealous of her golden hair and of her white teeth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was remarked that in the workroom she often turned aside, in the midst of the rest, to wipe away a tear. These were the moments when she was thinking of her child; perhaps, also, of the man whom she had loved.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Breaking the gloomy bonds of the past is a mournful task.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was observed that she wrote twice a month at least, and that she paid the carriage on the letter. They managed to obtain the address:<em>&nbsp;Monsieur, Monsieur Thénardier, inn-keeper at Montfermeil</em>. The public writer, a good old man who could not fill his stomach with red wine without emptying his pocket of secrets, was made to talk in the wine-shop. In short, it was discovered that Fantine had a child. “She must be a pretty sort of a woman.” An old gossip was found, who made the trip to Montfermeil, talked to the Thénardiers, and said on her return: “For my five and thirty francs I have freed my mind. I have seen the child.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The gossip who did this thing was a gorgon named Madame Victurnien, the guardian and door-keeper of every one’s virtue. Madame Victurnien was fifty-six, and re-enforced the mask of ugliness with the mask of age. A quavering voice, a whimsical mind. This old dame had once been young—astonishing fact! In her youth, in ‘93, she had married a monk who had fled from his cloister in a red cap, and passed from the Bernardines to the Jacobins. She was dry, rough, peevish, sharp, captious, almost venomous; all this in memory of her monk, whose widow she was, and who had ruled over her masterfully and bent her to his will. She was a nettle in which the rustle of the cassock was visible. At the Restoration she had turned bigot, and that with so much energy that the priests had forgiven her her monk. She had a small property, which she <strong>bequeathed</strong> with much ostentation to a religious community. She was in high favor at the episcopal palace of Arras. So this Madame Victurnien went to Montfermeil, and returned with the remark, “I have seen the child.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;All this took time. Fantine had been at the factory for more than a year, when, one morning, the superintendent of the workroom handed her fifty francs from the mayor, told her that she was no longer employed in the shop, and requested her, in the mayor’s name, to leave the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This was the very month when the Thénardiers, after having demanded twelve francs instead of six, had just exacted fifteen francs instead of twelve.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Fantine was overwhelmed. She could not leave the neighborhood; she was in debt for her rent and furniture. Fifty francs was not sufficient to cancel this debt. She stammered a few supplicating words. The superintendent ordered her to leave the shop on the instant. Besides, Fantine was only a moderately good workwoman. Overcome with shame, even more than with despair, she quitted the shop, and returned to her room. So her fault was now known to every one.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She no longer felt strong enough to say a word. She was advised to see the mayor; she did not dare. The mayor had given her fifty francs because he was good, and had dismissed her because he was just. She bowed before the decision.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; When Fantine saw that she was making her living, she felt joyful for a moment. To live honestly by her own labour, what mercy from heaven! The taste for work had really returned to her. She bought a looking-glass, took pleasure in surveying in it her youth, her beautiful hair, her fine teeth; she forgot many things; she thought only of Cosette and of the possible future, and was almost happy. She hired a little room and furnished on credit on the strength of her future work—a lingering trace of her <strong>improvident</strong> ways. As she was not able to say that she was married she took good care, as we have seen, not to mention her little girl.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At first, as the reader has seen, she paid the Thénardiers promptly. As she only knew how to sign her name, she was obliged to write through a public letter-writer.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She wrote often, and this was noticed. It began to be said in an undertone, in the women’s workroom, that Fantine “wrote letters” and that “she had ways about her.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There is no one for spying on people’s actions like those who are not concerned in them. Why does that gentleman never come except at nightfall? Why does Mr. So-and-So never hang his key on its nail on Tuesday? Why does he always take the narrow streets? Why does Madame always descend from her hackney-coach before reaching her house? Why does she send out to purchase six sheets of note paper, when she has a “whole stationer’s shop full of it?” etc. There exist beings who, for the sake of obtaining the key to these enigmas, which are, moreover, of no consequence whatever to them, spend more money, waste more time, take more trouble, than would be required for ten good actions, and that gratuitously, for their own pleasure, without receiving any other payment for their curiosity than curiosity. They will follow up such and such a man or woman for whole days; they will do sentry duty for hours at a time on the corners of the streets, under alley-way doors at night, in cold and rain; they will bribe errand-porters, they will make the drivers of hackney-coaches and lackeys tipsy, buy a waiting-maid, suborn a porter. Why? For no reason. A pure passion for seeing, knowing, and penetrating into things. A pure itch for talking. And often these secrets once known, these mysteries made public, these enigmas illuminated by the light of day, bring on catastrophes, duels, failures, the ruin of families, and broken lives, to the great joy of those who have “found out everything,” without any interest in the matter, and by pure instinct. A sad thing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Certain persons are malicious solely through a necessity for talking. Their conversation, the chat of the drawing-room, gossip of the anteroom, is like those chimneys which consume wood rapidly; they need a great amount of combustibles; and their combustibles are furnished by their neighbours.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;So Fantine was watched.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, many a one was jealous of her golden hair and of her white teeth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was remarked that in the workroom she often turned aside, in the midst of the rest, to wipe away a tear. These were the moments when she was thinking of her child; perhaps, also, of the man whom she had loved.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Breaking the gloomy bonds of the past is a mournful task.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was observed that she wrote twice a month at least, and that she paid the carriage on the letter. They managed to obtain the address:<em>&nbsp;Monsieur, Monsieur Thénardier, inn-keeper at Montfermeil</em>. The public writer, a good old man who could not fill his stomach with red wine without emptying his pocket of secrets, was made to talk in the wine-shop. In short, it was discovered that Fantine had a child. “She must be a pretty sort of a woman.” An old gossip was found, who made the trip to Montfermeil, talked to the Thénardiers, and said on her return: “For my five and thirty francs I have freed my mind. I have seen the child.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The gossip who did this thing was a gorgon named Madame Victurnien, the guardian and door-keeper of every one’s virtue. Madame Victurnien was fifty-six, and re-enforced the mask of ugliness with the mask of age. A quavering voice, a whimsical mind. This old dame had once been young—astonishing fact! In her youth, in ‘93, she had married a monk who had fled from his cloister in a red cap, and passed from the Bernardines to the Jacobins. She was dry, rough, peevish, sharp, captious, almost venomous; all this in memory of her monk, whose widow she was, and who had ruled over her masterfully and bent her to his will. She was a nettle in which the rustle of the cassock was visible. At the Restoration she had turned bigot, and that with so much energy that the priests had forgiven her her monk. She had a small property, which she <strong>bequeathed</strong> with much ostentation to a religious community. She was in high favor at the episcopal palace of Arras.

          <strong>Les Miserable</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <em>By Victor Hugo</em>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; When Fantine saw that she was making her living, she felt joyful for a moment. To live honestly by her own labour, what mercy from heaven! The taste for work had really returned to her. She bought a looking-glass, took pleasure in surveying in it her youth, her beautiful hair, her fine teeth; she forgot many things; she thought only of Cosette and of the possible future, and was almost happy. She hired a little room and furnished on credit on the strength of her future work—a lingering trace of her <strong>improvident</strong> ways. As she was not able to say that she was married she took good care, as we have seen, not to mention her little girl.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At first, as the reader has seen, she paid the Thénardiers promptly. As she only knew how to sign her name, she was obliged to write through a public letter-writer.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She wrote often, and this was noticed. It began to be said in an undertone, in the women’s workroom, that Fantine “wrote letters” and that “she had ways about her.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There is no one for spying on people’s actions like those who are not concerned in them. Why does that gentleman never come except at nightfall? Why does Mr. So-and-So never hang his key on its nail on Tuesday? Why does he always take the narrow streets? Why does Madame always descend from her hackney-coach before reaching her house? Why does she send out to purchase six sheets of note paper, when she has a “whole stationer’s shop full of it?” etc. There exist beings who, for the sake of obtaining the key to these enigmas, which are, moreover, of no consequence whatever to them, spend more money, waste more time, take more trouble, than would be required for ten good actions, and that gratuitously, for their own pleasure, without receiving any other payment for their curiosity than curiosity. They will follow up such and such a man or woman for whole days; they will do sentry duty for hours at a time on the corners of the streets, under alley-way doors at night, in cold and rain; they will bribe errand-porters, they will make the drivers of hackney-coaches and lackeys tipsy, buy a waiting-maid, suborn a porter. Why? For no reason. A pure passion for seeing, knowing, and penetrating into things. A pure itch for talking. And often these secrets once known, these mysteries made public, these enigmas illuminated by the light of day, bring on catastrophes, duels, failures, the ruin of families, and broken lives, to the great joy of those who have “found out everything,” without any interest in the matter, and by pure instinct. A sad thing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Certain persons are malicious solely through a necessity for talking. Their conversation, the chat of the drawing-room, gossip of the anteroom, is like those chimneys which consume wood rapidly; they need a great amount of combustibles; and their combustibles are furnished by their neighbours.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;So Fantine was watched.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, many a one was jealous of her golden hair and of her white teeth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was remarked that in the workroom she often turned aside, in the midst of the rest, to wipe away a tear. These were the moments when she was thinking of her child; perhaps, also, of the man whom she had loved.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Breaking the gloomy bonds of the past is a mournful task.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was observed that she wrote twice a month at least, and that she paid the carriage on the letter. They managed to obtain the address:<em>&nbsp;Monsieur, Monsieur Thénardier, inn-keeper at Montfermeil</em>. The public writer, a good old man who could not fill his stomach with red wine without emptying his pocket of secrets, was made to talk in the wine-shop. In short, it was discovered that Fantine had a child. “She must be a pretty sort of a woman.” An old gossip was found, who made the trip to Montfermeil, talked to the Thénardiers, and said on her return: “For my five and thirty francs I have freed my mind. I have seen the child.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The gossip who did this thing was a gorgon named Madame Victurnien, the guardian and door-keeper of every one’s virtue. Madame Victurnien was fifty-six, and re-enforced the mask of ugliness with the mask of age. A quavering voice, a whimsical mind. This old dame had once been young—astonishing fact! In her youth, in ‘93, she had married a monk who had fled from his cloister in a red cap, and passed from the Bernardines to the Jacobins. She was dry, rough, peevish, sharp, captious, almost venomous; all this in memory of her monk, whose widow she was, and who had ruled over her masterfully and bent her to his will. She was a nettle in which the rustle of the cassock was visible. At the Restoration she had turned bigot, and that with so much energy that the priests had forgiven her her monk. She had a small property, which she <strong>bequeathed</strong> with much ostentation to a religious community. She was in high favor at the episcopal palace of Arras. So this Madame Victurnien went to Montfermeil, and returned with the remark, “I have seen the child.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;All this took time. Fantine had been at the factory for more than a year, when, one morning, the superintendent of the workroom handed her fifty francs from the mayor, told her that she was no longer employed in the shop, and requested her, in the mayor’s name, to leave the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This was the very month when the Thénardiers, after having demanded twelve francs instead of six, had just exacted fifteen francs instead of twelve.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Fantine was overwhelmed. She could not leave the neighborhood; she was in debt for her rent and furniture. Fifty francs was not sufficient to cancel this debt. She stammered a few supplicating words. The superintendent ordered her to leave the shop on the instant. Besides, Fantine was only a moderately good workwoman. Overcome with shame, even more than with despair, she quitted the shop, and returned to her room. So her fault was now known to every one.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She no longer felt strong enough to say a word. She was advised to see the mayor; she did not dare. The mayor had given her fifty francs because he was good, and had dismissed her because he was just. She bowed before the decision.</p>

The taste for work had really returned to her. She bought a looking-glass, took pleasure in surveying in it her youth, her beautiful hair, her fine teeth; she forgot many things; she thought only of Cosette and of the possible future, and was almost happy.

They will follow up such and such a man or woman for whole days; they will do sentry duty for hours at a time on the corners of the streets, under alley-way doors at night, in cold and rain; they will bribe errand-porters, they will make the drivers of hackney-coaches and lackeys tipsy, buy a waiting-maid, suborn a porter.

          <strong>Les Miserable</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <em>By Victor Hugo</em>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; When Fantine saw that she was making her living, she felt joyful for a moment. To live honestly by her own labour, what mercy from heaven! The taste for work had really returned to her. She bought a looking-glass, took pleasure in surveying in it her youth, her beautiful hair, her fine teeth; she forgot many things; she thought only of Cosette and of the possible future, and was almost happy. She hired a little room and furnished on credit on the strength of her future work—a lingering trace of her <strong>improvident</strong> ways. As she was not able to say that she was married she took good care, as we have seen, not to mention her little girl.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At first, as the reader has seen, she paid the Thénardiers promptly. As she only knew how to sign her name, she was obliged to write through a public letter-writer.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She wrote often, and this was noticed. It began to be said in an undertone, in the women’s workroom, that Fantine “wrote letters” and that “she had ways about her.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There is no one for spying on people’s actions like those who are not concerned in them. Why does that gentleman never come except at nightfall? Why does Mr. So-and-So never hang his key on its nail on Tuesday? Why does he always take the narrow streets? Why does Madame always descend from her hackney-coach before reaching her house? Why does she send out to purchase six sheets of note paper, when she has a “whole stationer’s shop full of it?” etc. There exist beings who, for the sake of obtaining the key to these enigmas, which are, moreover, of no consequence whatever to them, spend more money, waste more time, take more trouble, than would be required for ten good actions, and that gratuitously, for their own pleasure, without receiving any other payment for their curiosity than curiosity. They will follow up such and such a man or woman for whole days; they will do sentry duty for hours at a time on the corners of the streets, under alley-way doors at night, in cold and rain; they will bribe errand-porters, they will make the drivers of hackney-coaches and lackeys tipsy, buy a waiting-maid, suborn a porter. Why? For no reason. A pure passion for seeing, knowing, and penetrating into things. A pure itch for talking. And often these secrets once known, these mysteries made public, these enigmas illuminated by the light of day, bring on catastrophes, duels, failures, the ruin of families, and broken lives, to the great joy of those who have “found out everything,” without any interest in the matter, and by pure instinct. A sad thing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Certain persons are malicious solely through a necessity for talking. Their conversation, the chat of the drawing-room, gossip of the anteroom, is like those chimneys which consume wood rapidly; they need a great amount of combustibles; and their combustibles are furnished by their neighbours.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;So Fantine was watched.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, many a one was jealous of her golden hair and of her white teeth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was remarked that in the workroom she often turned aside, in the midst of the rest, to wipe away a tear. These were the moments when she was thinking of her child; perhaps, also, of the man whom she had loved.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Breaking the gloomy bonds of the past is a mournful task.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was observed that she wrote twice a month at least, and that she paid the carriage on the letter. They managed to obtain the address:<em>&nbsp;Monsieur, Monsieur Thénardier, inn-keeper at Montfermeil</em>. The public writer, a good old man who could not fill his stomach with red wine without emptying his pocket of secrets, was made to talk in the wine-shop. In short, it was discovered that Fantine had a child. “She must be a pretty sort of a woman.” An old gossip was found, who made the trip to Montfermeil, talked to the Thénardiers, and said on her return: “For my five and thirty francs I have freed my mind. I have seen the child.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The gossip who did this thing was a gorgon named Madame Victurnien, the guardian and door-keeper of every one’s virtue. Madame Victurnien was fifty-six, and re-enforced the mask of ugliness with the mask of age. A quavering voice, a whimsical mind. This old dame had once been young—astonishing fact! In her youth, in ‘93, she had married a monk who had fled from his cloister in a red cap, and passed from the Bernardines to the Jacobins. She was dry, rough, peevish, sharp, captious, almost venomous; all this in memory of her monk, whose widow she was, and who had ruled over her masterfully and bent her to his will. She was a nettle in which the rustle of the cassock was visible. At the Restoration she had turned bigot, and that with so much energy that the priests had forgiven her her monk. She had a small property, which she <strong>bequeathed</strong> with much ostentation to a religious community. She was in high favor at the episcopal palace of Arras. So this Madame Victurnien went to Montfermeil, and returned with the remark, “I have seen the child.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;All this took time. Fantine had been at the factory for more than a year, when, one morning, the superintendent of the workroom handed her fifty francs from the mayor, told her that she was no longer employed in the shop, and requested her, in the mayor’s name, to leave the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This was the very month when the Thénardiers, after having demanded twelve francs instead of six, had just exacted fifteen francs instead of twelve.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Fantine was overwhelmed. She could not leave the neighborhood; she was in debt for her rent and furniture. Fifty francs was not sufficient to cancel this debt. She stammered a few supplicating words. The superintendent ordered her to leave the shop on the instant. Besides, Fantine was only a moderately good workwoman. Overcome with shame, even more than with despair, she quitted the shop, and returned to her room. So her fault was now known to every one.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She no longer felt strong enough to say a word. She was advised to see the mayor; she did not dare. The mayor had given her fifty francs because he was good, and had dismissed her because he was just. She bowed before the decision.</p>

Fully clothed, still streaming with water<br>
Half comforting, half angry.<br>

Marble and granite parting<br>

We have the wholeness of this day<br>
To share as we will between us.<br>

This morning I saw in your garden<br>
Fine pumpkins grown on a trellis<br>
So it seemed that the vines were rising<br>
To flourish the fruits of earth<br>
Above their humble station<br>

That we walked among day-bright flowers<br>
To a bench in the Brisbane gardens<br>
With a pitcher of water between us,<br>

At your side among the graves<br>

I laughed at a hollowed pumpkin<br>
With candle flame for eyesight,<br>
And when I am seized at last<br>
And rolled in one grinding race<br>
Of dreams, pain and memories, love and grief,<br>
From which no hand will save me,<br>
The peace of this day will shine<br>
Like light on the face of the waters<br>
That bear me away for ever.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">They told me that when I was taken<br>
To the sea’s edge, for the first time,<br>
I leapt from my father’s arms<br>
And was caught by a wave and rolled<br>
Like a doll among rattling shells;<br>
And I seem to remember my father<br>
Fully clothed, still streaming with water<br>
Half comforting, half angry.<br>
And indeed I remember believing<br>
As a child, I could walk on water –<br>
The next wave, the next wave –<br>
It was only a matter of balance.<br>
<br>
On what floor are they borne,<br>
These memories of early childhood<br>
<strong>Iridescent</strong>, fugitive<br>
As light in a sea-wet shell,<br>
While we stand, two friends of middle ages,<br>
By your parents’ grave in silence<br>
Among avenues of the dead<br>
With their cadences of trees,<br>
Marble and granite parting<br>
The quick of autumn grasses.<br>
We have the wholeness of this day<br>
To share as we will between us.<br>
<br>
This morning I saw in your garden<br>
Fine pumpkins grown on a trellis<br>
So it seemed that the vines were rising<br>
To flourish the fruits of earth<br>
Above their humble station<br>
In airy defiance of nature<br>
- a parable of myself,<br>
a skinful of elements climbing<br>
from earth to the fastness of light;<br>
now come to that time of life<br>
when our bones begin to wear us,<br>
to settle our flesh in final shape<br>
<br>
as the drying face of land<br>
rose out of earth’s seamless waters<br>
I dreamed once, long ago,<br>
That we walked among day-bright flowers<br>
To a bench in the Brisbane gardens<br>
With a pitcher of water between us,<br>
And stayed for a whole day<br>
Talking, and drinking the water.<br>
Then, as night fell, you said<br>
“There is still some water left over.”<br>
We have one day, only one,<br>
But more than enough to refresh us.<br>
<br>
At your side among the graves<br>
I think of death no more<br>
Than when, secure in my father’s arms,<br>
I laughed at a hollowed pumpkin<br>
With candle flame for eyesight,<br>
And when I am seized at last<br>
And rolled in one grinding race<br>
Of dreams, pain and memories, love and grief,<br>
From which no hand will save me,<br>
The peace of this day will shine<br>
Like light on the face of the waters<br>
That bear me away for ever.</p>

        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">They told me that when I was taken<br>
To the sea’s edge, for the first time,<br>
I leapt from my father’s arms<br>
And was caught by a wave and rolled<br>
Like a doll among rattling shells;<br>
And I seem to remember my father<br>
Fully clothed, still streaming with water<br>
Half comforting, half angry.<br>
And indeed I remember believing<br>
As a child, I could walk on water –<br>
The next wave, the next wave –<br>
It was only a matter of balance.<br>
<br>
On what floor are they borne,<br>
These memories of early childhood<br>
<strong>Iridescent</strong>, fugitive<br>
As light in a sea-wet shell,<br>
While we stand, two friends of middle ages,<br>
By your parents’ grave in silence<br>
Among avenues of the dead<br>
With their cadences of trees,<br>
Marble and granite parting<br>
The quick of autumn grasses.<br>
We have the wholeness of this day<br>
To share as we will between us.<br>
<br>
This morning I saw in your garden<br>
Fine pumpkins grown on a trellis<br>
So it seemed that the vines were rising<br>
To flourish the fruits of earth<br>
Above their humble station<br>
In airy defiance of nature<br>
- a parable of myself,<br>
a skinful of elements climbing<br>
from earth to the fastness of light;<br>
now come to that time of life<br>
when our bones begin to wear us,<br>
to settle our flesh in final shape<br>
<br>
as the drying face of land<br>
rose out of earth’s seamless waters<br>
I dreamed once, long ago,<br>
That we walked among day-bright flowers<br>
To a bench in the Brisbane gardens<br>
With a pitcher of water between us,<br>
And stayed for a whole day<br>
Talking, and drinking the water.<br>
Then, as night fell, you said<br>
“There is still some water left over.”<br>
We have one day, only one,<br>
But more than enough to refresh us.<br>
<br>
At your side among the graves<br>
I think of death no more<br>
Than when, secure in my father’s arms,<br>
I laughed at a hollowed pumpkin<br>
With candle flame for eyesight,<br>
And when I am seized at last<br>
And rolled in one grinding race<br>
Of dreams, pain and memories, love and grief,<br>
From which no hand will save me,<br>
The peace of this day will shine<br>
Like light on the face of the waters<br>
That bear me away for ever.</p>
