          <em>Read the extract from the novel written by E. Nesbit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p><br><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Book of Dragons</strong><br><br>
But the next day he wanted another look, so he took the book out into the garden, and when he undid the clasps with the rubies and turquoises, the book opened all by itself at the picture with "Dragon" underneath, and the sun shone full on the page. And then, quite suddenly, a great Red Dragon came out of the book and spread vast scarlet wings and flew away across the garden to the far hills, and Lionel was left with the empty page before him, for the page was quite empty except for the green palm tree and the yellow desert, and the little streaks of red where the paintbrush had gone outside the pencil outline of the Red Dragon.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
And then Lionel felt that he had indeed done it. He had not been King twenty-four hours, and already he had let loose a Red Dragon to worry his faithful subjects' lives out. And they had been saving up so long to buy him a crown, and everything!<br>
<br>
Lionel began to cry. The Chancellor and the Prime Minister and the Nurse all came running to see what the matter was. And when they saw the book they understood, and the Chancellor said: "You naughty little King! Put him to bed, Nurse, and let him think over what he's done."&nbsp;<br>
<br>
"Perhaps, my Lord," said the Prime Minister, "we'd better first find out just exactly what he has done."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Then Lionel, in floods of tears, said: "It's a Red Dragon, and it's gone flying away to the hills, and I am so sorry, and, oh, do forgive me!"<br>
<br>
But the Prime Minister and the Chancellor had other things to think of than forgiving Lionel. They hurried off to consult the police and see what could be done. Everyone did what they could. They sat on committees and stood on guard, and lay in wait for the Dragon, but he stayed up in the hills, and there was nothing more to be done. The faithful Nurse, meanwhile, did not neglect her duty. Perhaps she did more than anyone else, for she put the King to bed without his tea and when it got dark, she would not give him a candle to read by.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
"You are a naughty little King," she said, "and nobody will love you.”<br>
<br>
Next day the Dragon was still quiet, though the more poetic of Lionel's subjects could see the redness of the Dragon shining through the green trees quite plainly. So, Lionel put on his crown and sat on his throne and said he wanted to make some laws.<br>
<br>
And I need hardly say that though the Prime Minister and the Chancellor and the Nurse might have the very poorest opinion of Lionel's private judgement, and might even send him to bed, the minute he got on his throne and set his crown on his head, he became infallible—which means that everything he said was right, and that he couldn't possibly make a mistake. So, when he said: "There is to be a law forbidding people to open books in schools or elsewhere"—he had the support of at least half of his subjects, and the other half—the grown-up half—pretended to think he was quite right.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Then he made a law that everyone should always have enough to eat. And this pleased everyone except the ones who had always had too much.<br>
<br>
And when several other nice new laws were made and written down, he went home and made mud-houses and was very happy. And he said to his Nurse: "People will love me now. I've made such a lot of pretty new laws for them."&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But Nurse said: "Don't count your chickens. You haven't seen the last of that Dragon yet."<br>
<br>
Now, the next day was Saturday. And in the afternoon the Dragon suddenly swooped down upon the common in all his hideous redness, and carried off the Soccer Players, umpires, goal-posts, ball and all.<br>
<br>
Then the people were very angry indeed, and they said: "We might as well be a Republic. After saving up all these years to get his crown and everything!"<br>
<br>
And wise people shook their heads and foretold a decline in the National Love of Sport. And, indeed, soccer was not at all popular for some time afterward.<br>
<br>
Lionel did his best to be a good King during the week, and the people were beginning to forgive him for letting the Dragon out of the book. "After all," they said, "soccer is a dangerous game, and perhaps it is wise to discourage it."&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Popular opinion held that the Soccer Players, being tough and hard, had disagreed with the Dragon so much that he had gone away to some place where they only play cats' cradle and games that do not make you hard and tough.<br>
<br>
So, Parliament met on the Saturday afternoon, a convenient time as the Members would be free to attend, to consider the Dragon problem. But unfortunately, the Dragon, who had only been asleep, woke up because it was Saturday, and he considered the Parliament problem, and after that there were no Members left, so they tried to make a new Parliament, but being a member of Parliament had somehow grown as unpopular as soccer playing, and no one would consent to be elected, so they had to do without a Parliament. When the next Saturday came around everyone was a little nervous, but the Red Dragon was pretty quiet that day and only ate an Orphanage.</p>

Considered that their mutual fence<br>

Thus, day by day, in their unease &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15<br>

Darkened one in neglected plot<br>
Until the ground so overcast<br>
Became a rank and weedy waste &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20<br>
Now in their obsession, they uprear<br>
Jealous and proud, and full of fear<br>
And lest they halt for lack of stone<br>

Which buries them beneath its fall &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30</p>

Thus, day by day, in their unease &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15<br>
They built their <span class="txt-underline"><strong>battlements of peace</strong></span><br>
Whose shadows like a gathering blot<br>
Darkened one in neglected plot<br>
Until the ground so overcast<br>
Became a rank and weedy waste &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20<br>
Now in their obsession, they uprear<br>
Jealous and proud, and full of fear<br>
And lest they halt for lack of stone<br>
They pull their dwelling houses down<br>
At last by their <span class="txt-underline"><strong>insane excess</strong></span>, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25<br>
Their rampart guard a wilderness<br>
And hate arousing out of shame<br>
Flares up into a wondrous flame<br>
They curse they strike, they break the wall,<br>
Which buries them beneath its fall &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30</p>

Considered that their mutual fence<br>

If each about his home and garden &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5<br>

Quickly they cleared away the fence<br>
To build a wall at great expense<br>
And soon their little plots of ground<br>

          <em>Read the poem below by William Soutar then answer the questions.</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; THE PARABLE</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Two neighbours who were rather <span class="txt-underline"><strong>dense</strong></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br>
Considered that their mutual fence<br>
Were more symbolic of their peace<br>
(Which they maintained should never cease)<br>
If each about his home and garden &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5<br>
Set up a more substantial warden<br>
Quickly they cleared away the fence<br>
To build a wall at great expense<br>
And soon their little plots of ground<br>
Were barricaded all around &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10<br>
Yet still they added stone to stone<br>
As if they would never be done<br>
For when one neighbour seemed to tire<br>
The other shouted; Higher! Higher!<br>
Thus, day by day, in their unease &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15<br>
They built their <span class="txt-underline"><strong>battlements of peace</strong></span><br>
Whose shadows like a gathering blot<br>
Darkened one in neglected plot<br>
Until the ground so overcast<br>
Became a rank and weedy waste &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20<br>
Now in their obsession, they uprear<br>
Jealous and proud, and full of fear<br>
And lest they halt for lack of stone<br>
They pull their dwelling houses down<br>
At last by their <span class="txt-underline"><strong>insane excess</strong></span>, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25<br>
Their rampart guard a wilderness<br>
And hate arousing out of shame<br>
Flares up into a wondrous flame<br>
They curse they strike, they break the wall,<br>
Which buries them beneath its fall &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30</p>
