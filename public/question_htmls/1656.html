The revolutionary discoveries that Dr. Jane Goodall made through her field work with chimpanzees in Africa are a wonder of the scientific world. Her findings suggest that many behaviours once thought to be exclusively human may have been inherited from common ancestors that we shared with chimpanzees millions of years ago. Jane Goodall suggests that the more we discover about these kindred beings, the deeper our insight into what it means to be human.<br>

Tarzan of the Apes (1912) is a classic novel by American author Edgar Rice Burroughs. The novel tells the story of the boy Tarzan being raised by apes in the African jungle. The novel is the first in a series of two dozen books about Tarzan. As a man, he encounters humans again when an expedition of white men comes into the jungle. In 1888, John Clayton II and his wife Alice get marooned in a jungle on the coast of West Africa. After a mutiny on the ship, they put ashore with all their possessions, along with some food and tools. The young English couple hold the title of Lord and Lady Greystoke. In September of 1889, their son John Clayton III is born. When the baby boy turns one, he loses both his parents. First, his mother dies. Next, his father gets killed by Kerchak, the king of the apes. A female ape named Kala adopts the infant boy and raises him as her son.<br>

Humans and monkeys are both primates. But humans are not descended from monkeys or any other primate living today. We do share a common ape ancestor with chimpanzees. This ancestor lived between 8 and 6 million years ago. But humans and chimpanzees evolved differently from that same ancestor. All apes and monkeys share a more distant relative, which lived about 25 million years ago.<br>

The 2005 ‘King Kong’ film is a thrilling epic adventure about a legendary gorilla captured on a treacherous island and brought to civilisation, where he faces the ultimate fight for survival. There are also great chunks of ‘King Kong’ that are extraordinary to watch; thrilling, exciting and compelling, especially when Jackson returns to the horror director he once was, unleashing giant creepy crawlies on his poor little human characters. The real star of the show however is the great ape himself, 'King Kong', and thankfully much of the film is devoted to him and his struggle. He is a beautifully realised, totally believable, sad monster of nature, the ultimate sacrifice to man's quest to be king of the jungle.<br>

There are some who would like to see social media banned, especially for children. There is an age requirement for social media, however, there are ways around that and many children view images of filtered photographs and fake lifestyles. This can lead to body image issues and feelings of inadequacy. Thus, it is important to educate children on the inconsistencies and manipulation of photos and reality that are online. There needs to be some sort of intervention otherwise we may have a generation of people who cannot bear to look at themselves in the mirror because they look nothing like their filtered photos.</div>
