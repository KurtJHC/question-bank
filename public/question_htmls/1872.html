There are probably as many stories about the Olympic Village as there are athletes who stay there. The accommodations, which house the competitors at the Summer and Winter Games, historically include a bank, a salon, a post office, a massive cafeteria and — yes — a McDonald’s.<br>
It’s part dormitory, part dining hall, part lounge; a place to prepare for the defining moment in any athlete’s life and a place to unwind or people-watch before or between competitions. Despite its sprawl, the village remains off-limits to basically everyone in the world, making it the persistent object of fascination from Olympic spectators every two years. What really happens when you take a few thousand of the world’s top competitors and put them all in the same space? Ask swimmer Natalie Coughlin about the biggest misconception people might have about the Olympic Village and she’ll tell you: “I think they think it’s a lot more glamorous than it is. It’s really pretty boring.”<br>
“It’s like a giant college campus — except that everyone is getting ready for the biggest event of their life so they’re incredibly stressed,” the three-time Olympian and 12-time medalist, including three golds, told PEOPLE.<br>

The Olympic Village was an assault on the senses. From the calm and quiet of Portugal, we were plunged into this swirling mass of noise and colour. From the enormous dining hall to the armed police, it was daunting and overwhelming. We went to check our rooms. They were basic but fine, and I was sharing an apartment with a great bunch…Sometimes it is easy to stay in your bubble and forget what everyone else is going through, but I felt so sorry for Goldie, one on the nicest people you could wish to meet. She had been in great form…However, she had also suffered a serious injury in London. She said she could throw but then the pain was excruciating. She had to give it a go, but she was a victim of the worst possible timing. I was gutted for her.<br>

Once the Olympic Games are over, host cities around the globe face exorbitant bills for venues and housing units that are no longer needed. So it makes sense that they would attempt to re-purpose the Olympic Villages. After the 2012 Games, London converted the East Village housing units used for athletes into 3,000 new homes. Venues were transformed into shops, restaurants, and schools. According to Forbes, today, “two-bedroom flats in the former Athletes’ Village are on sale for upwards of $1 million.”
<p>Brazil wasn’t as fortunate. Host of the 2016 Olympic Games, Rio de Janeiro was home to a $700 million complex. When the games were over, the Village was renovated into luxury condos. In recent years, the units have stood vacant. The housing used for Olympic athletes during the 2014 Sochi Winter Games is now high-end resorts. Other villages in places like Munich and Atlanta have become student housing units to accommodate local university students.<br>

TOKYO, July 20 - The isolation bubble system that Olympic organisers have set up at the Tokyo Games village to control COVID-19 is already broken, and there is a risk that infections could spread more widely from inside it, a prominent public health expert said on Tuesday. Games officials on Sunday reported the first coronavirus case among competitors in the village in Tokyo where 11,000 athletes are expected to stay. There have been 67 cases detected among those accredited for the Games since July 1, organisers said on Tuesday.<br>
International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach said last week that testing and quarantine protocols would leave “zero” risk of Games participants infecting residents in Japan. Kenji Shibuya, the former director of the Institute for Population Health at King’s College London, said such declarations only served to confuse and anger people as actual conditions on the ground were “totally opposite”.<br>

There are probably as many stories about the Olympic Village as there are athletes who stay there. The accommodations, which house the competitors at the Summer and Winter Games, historically include a bank, a salon, a post office, a massive cafeteria and — yes — a McDonald’s.<br>
It’s part dormitory, part dining hall, part lounge; a place to prepare for the defining moment in any athlete’s life and a place to unwind or people-watch before or between competitions. Despite its sprawl, the village remains off-limits to basically everyone in the world, making it the persistent object of fascination from Olympic spectators every two years. What really happens when you take a few thousand of the world’s top competitors and put them all in the same space? Ask swimmer Natalie Coughlin about the biggest misconception people might have about the Olympic Village and she’ll tell you: “I think they think it’s a lot more glamorous than it is. It’s really pretty boring.”<br>
“It’s like a giant college campus — except that everyone is getting ready for the biggest event of their life so they’re incredibly stressed,” the three-time Olympian and 12-time medalist, including three golds, told PEOPLE.<br>

The Olympic Village was an assault on the senses. From the calm and quiet of Portugal, we were plunged into this swirling mass of noise and colour. From the enormous dining hall to the armed police, it was daunting and overwhelming. We went to check our rooms. They were basic but fine, and I was sharing an apartment with a great bunch…Sometimes it is easy to stay in your bubble and forget what everyone else is going through, but I felt so sorry for Goldie, one on the nicest people you could wish to meet. She had been in great form…However, she had also suffered a serious injury in London. She said she could throw but then the pain was excruciating. She had to give it a go, but she was a victim of the worst possible timing. I was gutted for her.<br>

Once the Olympic Games are over, host cities around the globe face exorbitant bills for venues and housing units that are no longer needed. So it makes sense that they would attempt to re-purpose the Olympic Villages. After the 2012 Games, London converted the East Village housing units used for athletes into 3,000 new homes. Venues were transformed into shops, restaurants, and schools. According to Forbes, today, “two-bedroom flats in the former Athletes’ Village are on sale for upwards of $1 million.”
<p>Brazil wasn’t as fortunate. Host of the 2016 Olympic Games, Rio de Janeiro was home to a $700 million complex. When the games were over, the Village was renovated into luxury condos. In recent years, the units have stood vacant. The housing used for Olympic athletes during the 2014 Sochi Winter Games is now high-end resorts. Other villages in places like Munich and Atlanta have become student housing units to accommodate local university students.<br>

TOKYO, July 20 - The isolation bubble system that Olympic organisers have set up at the Tokyo Games village to control COVID-19 is already broken, and there is a risk that infections could spread more widely from inside it, a prominent public health expert said on Tuesday. Games officials on Sunday reported the first coronavirus case among competitors in the village in Tokyo where 11,000 athletes are expected to stay. There have been 67 cases detected among those accredited for the Games since July 1, organisers said on Tuesday.<br>
International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach said last week that testing and quarantine protocols would leave “zero” risk of Games participants infecting residents in Japan. Kenji Shibuya, the former director of the Institute for Population Health at King’s College London, said such declarations only served to confuse and anger people as actual conditions on the ground were “totally opposite”.<br>

          <strong>Space Demons</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Gillian Rubinstein</em>
        </p>
        <p>Andrew reached into the back of the Volvo and took out his schoolbag. ‘See you, Mum,’ he said to Marjorie.</p>
        <p>‘I’ll pick you up after school, it might be raining,’ she said.</p>
        <p>‘Okay.’ He could tell by her tone of voice that she was in a good mood. It was worth a try. ‘Can I have some money?’</p>
        <p>‘What happened to your allowance?’</p>
        <p>“It all went on Saturday,’ he said cheerfully.</p>
        <p>‘I haven’t got any change,’ Majorie said. ‘If I give you five dollars, you’ll have to make it last.’</p>
        <p>‘Five dollars will be fine! Thanks, Mum!’ Andrew swaggered into the school yard. Five dollars in his pocket made him feel as though he owned the whole school. He went to look for Ben. Ben’s parents were both teachers and he was usually at school early, hanging round the entrance waiting for Andrew, who was usually late. This morning there was no sign of him, which was annoying, because Andrew was longing to tell him about the game his father had brought from Japan. ‘I wonder if Ben’ll be able to work out Space Demons,’ he thought. ‘I won’t tell him what I’ve found out so far. I’ll see if he can get it.’</p>
        <p>He tracked Ben down at last, among a group of children outside the Year 7 classroom. They were watching a red-headed girl whom Andrew had never seen before, walking on her hands on the grass oval.</p>
        <p>‘Hey, what’s going on?’ Andrew asked. Ben turned round and gave him a grin, but it was John Ferrone, standing next to him, who answered. ‘It’s the new girl, Elaine Taylor. She used to be in a circus.’</p>
        <p>‘What was she, the trained chimpanzee?’ Andrew snorted. He felt vaguely irritated that anyone else should be the centre of attention. Linda Schulz heard him and laughed. She came over and stood next to him. ‘What a show off!’ she said. ‘Her first morning at school and look at her!’</p>
        <p>Ignoring Linda, Andrew pulled Ben aside. He was busy telling him about Space Demons when the siren went, and the children ran to line up.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Elaine turned herself the right way up. She was furious with herself. She hadn’t meant to show off, but somehow it always happened. The more nervous and out of place she felt, the more she seemed to have to draw attention to herself. Linda had been so stuck up and nasty as she showed her round the school that when they got back to the oval Elaine hadn’t been able to resist the urge to show what she could do. So, while Linda was in mid-sentence, she had suddenly done a forward somersault in the air, without us-ing her hands, and then a series of back flips. Other children had gathered around to watch, and she had found she couldn’t stop. Now her hands were muddy from the wet grass, and she had managed to get a smear of mud on her face.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mr Russell came up to his classroom and cast his eye over the waiting boys and girls, frowning slightly when he saw Elaine. He was pleased with the way things were going in his class: he felt that he and the children understood and respected each other, and that they had a good relationship. He very much hoped this new girl was not going to disrupt that.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘You look rather muddy Elaine.’ He said. ‘Linda, show Elaine where to wash her hands, please.’</p>
        <p>‘He likes us to look neat,’ Linda said, as they walked towards the toilets. On their way back she said, ‘Andrew said you looked like a chimpanzee.’</p>
        <p>‘Oh, did he?’ Elaine said. ‘He sounds like a pain in the neck.’</p>
        <p>‘I wonder which one he is,’ she thought as they walked in through the door. The rest of the class were turning to page 88 in Mathematics and Real Life, while Mr Russell was writing on the blackboard. Most of the children stared at Elaine, and a boy in the back row made a monkey face at her by putting his tongue down behind his bottom lip and crossing his eyes. She could feel Linda next to her trying not to laugh. ‘Aha,’ thought Elaine, ‘that must be the famous Andrew. Very funny!’</p>
        <p>Mr Russell turned round. ‘I’d like you to meet our new class member,’ he said. ‘This is Elaine Taylor. I hope you’ll make her feel at home at Kingsgate.’</p>
        <p>Elaine felt herself going pink. She wiggled her ears. Truly, she didn’t mean to, it just sometimes happened when she was embarrassed. She hoped Mr Russell hadn’t noticed. But half the class had. They stared at her in fascination wondering if she would do it again.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘You can sit down now, Elaine,’ Mr Russell said. His voice sounded rather cool.</p>

          <strong>Space Demons</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Gillian Rubinstein</em>
        </p>
        <p>Andrew reached into the back of the Volvo and took out his schoolbag. ‘See you, Mum,’ he said to Marjorie.</p>
        <p>‘I’ll pick you up after school, it might be raining,’ she said.</p>
        <p>‘Okay.’ He could tell by her tone of voice that she was in a good mood. It was worth a try. ‘Can I have some money?’</p>
        <p>‘What happened to your allowance?’</p>
        <p>“It all went on Saturday,’ he said cheerfully.</p>
        <p>‘I haven’t got any change,’ Majorie said. ‘If I give you five dollars, you’ll have to make it last.’</p>
        <p>‘Five dollars will be fine! Thanks, Mum!’ Andrew swaggered into the school yard. Five dollars in his pocket made him feel as though he owned the whole school. He went to look for Ben. Ben’s parents were both teachers and he was usually at school early, hanging round the entrance waiting for Andrew, who was usually late. This morning there was no sign of him, which was annoying, because Andrew was longing to tell him about the game his father had brought from Japan. ‘I wonder if Ben’ll be able to work out Space Demons,’ he thought. ‘I won’t tell him what I’ve found out so far. I’ll see if he can get it.’</p>
        <p>He tracked Ben down at last, among a group of children outside the Year 7 classroom. They were watching a red-headed girl whom Andrew had never seen before, walking on her hands on the grass oval.</p>
        <p>‘Hey, what’s going on?’ Andrew asked. Ben turned round and gave him a grin, but it was John Ferrone, standing next to him, who answered. ‘It’s the new girl, Elaine Taylor. She used to be in a circus.’</p>
        <p>‘What was she, the trained chimpanzee?’ Andrew snorted. He felt vaguely irritated that anyone else should be the centre of attention. Linda Schulz heard him and laughed. She came over and stood next to him. ‘What a show off!’ she said. ‘Her first morning at school and look at her!’</p>
        <p>Ignoring Linda, Andrew pulled Ben aside. He was busy telling him about Space Demons when the siren went, and the children ran to line up.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Elaine turned herself the right way up. She was furious with herself. She hadn’t meant to show off, but somehow it always happened. The more nervous and out of place she felt, the more she seemed to have to draw attention to herself. Linda had been so stuck up and nasty as she showed her round the school that when they got back to the oval Elaine hadn’t been able to resist the urge to show what she could do. So, while Linda was in mid-sentence, she had suddenly done a forward somersault in the air, without us-ing her hands, and then a series of back flips. Other children had gathered around to watch, and she had found she couldn’t stop. Now her hands were muddy from the wet grass, and she had managed to get a smear of mud on her face.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mr Russell came up to his classroom and cast his eye over the waiting boys and girls, frowning slightly when he saw Elaine. He was pleased with the way things were going in his class: he felt that he and the children understood and respected each other, and that they had a good relationship.&nbsp;He&nbsp;very much hoped this new girl was not going to disrupt that.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘You look rather muddy Elaine.’ He said. ‘Linda, show Elaine where to wash her hands, please.’</p>
        <p>‘He likes us to look neat,’ Linda said, as they walked towards the toilets. On their way back she said, ‘Andrew said you looked like a chimpanzee.’</p>
        <p>‘Oh, did he?’ Elaine said. ‘He sounds like a pain in the neck.’</p>
        <p>‘I wonder which one he is,’ she thought as they walked in through the door. The rest of the class were turning to page 88 in Mathematics and Real Life, while Mr Russell was writing on the blackboard. Most of the children stared at Elaine, and a boy in the back row made a monkey face at her by putting his tongue down behind his bottom lip and crossing his eyes. She could feel Linda next to her trying not to laugh. ‘Aha,’ thought Elaine, ‘that must be the famous Andrew. Very funny!’</p>
        <p>Mr Russell turned round. ‘I’d like you to meet our new class member,’ he said. ‘This is Elaine Taylor. I hope you’ll make her feel at home at Kingsgate.’</p>
        <p>Elaine felt herself going pink. She wiggled her ears. Truly, she didn’t mean to, it just sometimes happened when she was embarrassed. She hoped Mr Russell hadn’t noticed. But half the class had. They stared at her in fascination wondering if she would do it again.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘You can sit down now, Elaine,’ Mr Russell said. His voice sounded rather cool.</p>

          <strong>Space Demons</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Gillian Rubinstein</em>
        </p>
        <p>Andrew reached into the back of the Volvo and took out his schoolbag. ‘See you, Mum,’ he said to Marjorie.</p>
        <p>‘I’ll pick you up after school, it might be raining,’ she said.</p>
        <p>‘Okay.’ He could tell by her tone of voice that she was in a good mood. It was worth a try. ‘Can I have some money?’</p>
        <p>‘What happened to your allowance?’</p>
        <p>“It all went on Saturday,’ he said cheerfully.</p>
        <p>‘I haven’t got any change,’ Majorie said. ‘If I give you five dollars, you’ll have to make it last.’</p>
        <p>‘Five dollars will be fine! Thanks, Mum!’ Andrew swaggered into the school yard. Five dollars in his pocket made him feel as though he owned the whole school. He went to look for Ben. Ben’s parents were both teachers and he was usually at school early, hanging round the entrance waiting for Andrew, who was usually late. This morning there was no sign of him, which was annoying, because Andrew was longing to tell him about the game his father had brought from Japan. ‘I wonder if Ben’ll be able to work out Space Demons,’ he thought. ‘I won’t tell him what I’ve found out so far. I’ll see if he can get it.’</p>
        <p>He tracked Ben down at last, among a group of children outside the Year 7 classroom. They were watching a red-headed girl whom Andrew had never seen before, walking on her hands on the grass oval.</p>
        <p>‘Hey, what’s going on?’ Andrew asked. Ben turned round and gave him a grin, but it was John Ferrone, standing next to him, who answered. ‘It’s the new girl, Elaine Taylor. She used to be in a circus.’</p>
        <p>‘What was she, the trained chimpanzee?’ Andrew snorted. He felt vaguely irritated that anyone else should be the centre of attention. Linda Schulz heard him and laughed. She came over and stood next to him. ‘What a show off!’ she said. ‘Her first morning at school and look at her!’</p>
        <p>Ignoring Linda, Andrew pulled Ben aside. He was busy telling him about Space Demons when the siren went, and the children ran to line up.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Elaine turned herself the right way up. She was furious with herself. She hadn’t meant to show off, but somehow it always happened. The more nervous and out of place she felt, the more she seemed to have to draw attention to herself. Linda had been so stuck up and nasty as she showed her round the school that when they got back to the oval Elaine hadn’t been able to resist the urge to show what she could do. So, while Linda was in mid-sentence, she had suddenly done a forward somersault in the air, without us-ing her hands, and then a series of back flips. Other children had gathered around to watch, and she had found she couldn’t stop. Now her hands were muddy from the wet grass, and she had managed to get a smear of mud on her face.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mr Russell came up to his classroom and cast his eye over the waiting boys and girls, frowning slightly when he saw Elaine. He was pleased with the way things were going in his class: he felt that he and the children understood and respected each other, and that they had a good relationship.&nbsp;He&nbsp;very much hoped this new girl was not going to disrupt that.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘You look rather muddy Elaine.’ He said. ‘Linda, show Elaine where to wash her hands, please.’</p>
        <p>‘He likes us to look neat,’ Linda said, as they walked towards the toilets. On their way back she said, ‘Andrew said you looked like a chimpanzee.’</p>
        <p>‘Oh, did he?’ Elaine said. ‘He sounds like a pain in the neck.’</p>
        <p>‘I wonder which one he is,’ she thought as they walked in through the door. The rest of the class were turning to page 88 in Mathematics and Real Life, while Mr Russell was writing on the blackboard. Most of the children stared at Elaine, and a boy in the back row made a monkey face at her by putting his tongue down behind his bottom lip and crossing his eyes. She could feel Linda next to her trying not to laugh. ‘Aha,’ thought Elaine, ‘that must be the famous Andrew. Very funny!’</p>
        <p>Mr Russell turned round. ‘I’d like you to meet our new class member,’ he said. ‘This is Elaine Taylor. I hope you’ll make her feel at home at Kingsgate.’</p>
        <p>Elaine felt herself going pink. She wiggled her ears. Truly, she didn’t mean to, it just sometimes happened when she was embarrassed. She hoped Mr Russell hadn’t noticed. But half the class had. They stared at her in fascination wondering if she would do it again.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘You can sit down now, Elaine,’ Mr Russell said. His voice sounded rather cool.</p>

        <p>‘Five dollars will be fine! Thanks, Mum!’ Andrew swaggered into the school yard. Five dollars in his pocket made him feel as though he owned the whole school. He went to look for Ben. Ben’s parents were both teachers and he was usually at school early, hanging round the entrance waiting for Andrew, who was usually late. This morning there was no sign of him, which was annoying, because Andrew was longing to tell him about the game his father had brought from Japan. ‘I wonder if Ben’ll be able to work out Space Demons,’ he thought. ‘I won’t tell him what I’ve found out so far. I’ll see if he can get it.’</p>
        <p>He tracked Ben down at last, among a group of children outside the Year 7 classroom. They were watching a red-headed girl whom Andrew had never seen before, walking on her hands on the grass oval.</p>
        <p>‘Hey, what’s going on?’ Andrew asked. Ben turned round and gave him a grin, but it was John Ferrone, standing next to him, who answered. ‘It’s the new girl, Elaine Taylor. She used to be in a circus.’</p>
        <p>‘What was she, the trained chimpanzee?’ Andrew snorted. He felt vaguely irritated that anyone else should be the centre of attention. Linda Schulz heard him and laughed. She came over and stood next to him. ‘What a show off!’ she said. ‘Her first morning at school and look at her!’</p>
        <p>Ignoring Linda, Andrew pulled Ben aside. He was busy telling him about Space Demons when the siren went, and the children ran to line up.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Elaine turned herself the right way up. She was furious with herself. She hadn’t meant to show off, but somehow it always happened. The more nervous and out of place she felt, the more she seemed to have to draw attention to herself. Linda had been so stuck up and nasty as she showed her round the school that when they got back to the oval Elaine hadn’t been able to resist the urge to show what she could do. So, while Linda was in mid-sentence, she had suddenly done a forward somersault in the air, without us-ing her hands, and then a series of back flips. Other children had gathered around to watch, and she had found she couldn’t stop. Now her hands were muddy from the wet grass, and she had managed to get a smear of mud on her face.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Mr Russell came up to his classroom and cast his eye over the waiting boys and girls, frowning slightly when he saw Elaine. He was pleased with the way things were going in his class: he felt that he and the children understood and respected each other, and that they had a good relationship.&nbsp;He&nbsp;very much hoped this new girl was not going to disrupt that.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘You look rather muddy Elaine.’ He said. ‘Linda, show Elaine where to wash her hands, please.’</p>
        <p>‘He likes us to look neat,’ Linda said, as they walked towards the toilets. On their way back she said, ‘Andrew said you looked like a chimpanzee.’</p>
        <p>‘Oh, did he?’ Elaine said. ‘He sounds like a pain in the neck.’</p>
        <p>‘I wonder which one he is,’ she thought as they walked in through the door. The rest of the class were turning to page 88 in Mathematics and Real Life, while Mr Russell was writing on the blackboard. Most of the children stared at Elaine, and a boy in the back row made a monkey face at her by putting his tongue down behind his bottom lip and crossing his eyes. She could feel Linda next to her trying not to laugh. ‘Aha,’ thought Elaine, ‘that must be the famous Andrew. Very funny!’</p>
        <p>Mr Russell turned round. ‘I’d like you to meet our new class member,’ he said. ‘This is Elaine Taylor. I hope you’ll make her feel at home at Kingsgate.’</p>
        <p>Elaine felt herself going pink. She wiggled her ears. Truly, she didn’t mean to, it just sometimes happened when she was embarrassed. She hoped Mr Russell hadn’t noticed. But half the class had. They stared at her in fascination wondering if she would do it again.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘You can sit down now, Elaine,’ Mr Russell said. His voice sounded rather cool.</p>

<p><strong>The Dream of the Cabbage Caterpillars</strong><br><em>By Libby Houston</em></p>

<p>There was no magic spell:<br>
all of us, sleeping,<br>
dreamed the same dream – a dream<br>
that’s ours for the keeping.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In sunbeam or dripping rain,<br>
sister by brother<br>
we once roamed with glee<br>
the leaves that our mother</p>

<p>laid us and left us on,<br>
browsing our fill<br>
of green cabbage, fresh cabbage,<br>
thick cabbage until</p>

<p>in the hammocks we hung<br>
from the garden wall<br>
came sleep, and the dream<br>
that changed us all –&nbsp;</p>

<p>we had left our soft bodies,<br>
the munching, the crawling,<br>
to skim through the air<br>
like white petals falling!</p>

<p>Just so, so we woke –&nbsp;<br>
so to skip high as towers,<br>
and dip now to sweet fuel<br>
from trembling bright flowers.</p>

<p><strong>The Dream of the Cabbage Caterpillars</strong><br><em>By Libby Houston</em></p>

<p>There was no magic spell:<br>
all of us, sleeping,<br>
dreamed the same dream – a dream<br>
that’s ours for the keeping.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In sunbeam or dripping rain,<br>
sister by brother<br>
we once roamed with glee<br>
the leaves that our mother</p>

<p>laid us and left us on,<br>
browsing our fill<br>
of green cabbage, fresh cabbage,<br>
thick cabbage until</p>

<p>in the hammocks we hung<br>
from the garden wall<br>
came sleep, and the dream<br>
that changed us all –&nbsp;</p>

<p>we had left our soft bodies,<br>
the munching, the crawling,<br>
to skim through the air<br>
like white petals falling!</p>

<p>Just so, so we woke –&nbsp;<br>
so to skip high as towers,<br>
and dip now to sweet fuel<br>
from trembling bright flowers.</p>

          <strong>Gandhi</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Mohandas Gandhi was a leader of India’s independence movement. When India was a colony of Great Britain, Gandhi used nonviolent methods to protest against British rule. His efforts earned him the title Mahatma. Mahatma means “great soul.”</p>
        <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India. Dur-ing his years at school, Gandhi was considered an average student. <strong>1</strong> ............&nbsp; He then moved to England to study law. He returned to India in 1891. He tried to start a law ca-reer, but he was unsuccessful.</p>
        <p>In 1893 Gandhi took a job in a British colony in South Africa. There he saw Europeans mistreating Indian settlers. <strong>2</strong> ............ .</p>
        <p>Gandhi first used his method of nonviolent protest in 1906. He told Indians that they should not obey British laws that they thought were wrong. <strong>3</strong> ............ . This new meth-od of protest became known as satyagraha, or “devotion to truth.”</p>
        <p>Gandhi returned to India in 1915. Within a few years he became India’s most powerful political leader. <strong>4</strong> ............ . Gandhi’s followers stopped using British goods. They re-fused to enter British courts and schools. In 1930 Gandhi led a protest against a British tax on salt. He led Indians on a march to the sea, known as ‘The Salt March,’ to collect their own salt.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>5</strong> ............ . He was imprisoned for two years during World War II. He and other Indian leaders had demanded immediate independence as India’s price for aiding Britain in the war. After he was released, Gandhi continued to work for independence.</p>
        <p>India finally won its independence in 1947. It was a great victory for Gandhi. <strong>6</strong> ............ Before and after India’s division, the country was torn by clashes be-tween Hindus and Muslims. Gandhi tried to make peace. On January 30, 1948, in the city of Delhi, he was shot and killed by a Hindu man.</p>
        <p>Gandhi was one of the greatest political and social leaders in the 20th century. His use of nonviolent protest eventually led to his country’s independence. Within his country, he supported the rights of both Hindus and Muslims. He also sought better treatment for groups everyone else looked down upon.</p>

          <strong>Gandhi</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Mohandas Gandhi was a leader of India’s independence movement. When India was a colony of Great Britain, Gandhi used nonviolent methods to protest against British rule. His efforts earned him the title Mahatma. Mahatma means “great soul.”</p>
        <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India. Dur-ing his years at school, Gandhi was considered an average student. <strong>1</strong> ............&nbsp; He then moved to England to study law. He returned to India in 1891. He tried to start a law ca-reer, but he was unsuccessful.</p>
        <p>In 1893 Gandhi took a job in a British colony in South Africa. There he saw Europeans mistreating Indian settlers. <strong>2</strong> ............ .</p>
        <p>Gandhi first used his method of nonviolent protest in 1906. He told Indians that they should not obey British laws that they thought were wrong. <strong>3</strong> ............ . This new meth-od of protest became known as satyagraha, or “devotion to truth.”</p>
        <p>Gandhi returned to India in 1915. Within a few years he became India’s most powerful political leader. <strong>4</strong> ............ . Gandhi’s followers stopped using British goods. They re-fused to enter British courts and schools. In 1930 Gandhi led a protest against a British tax on salt. He led Indians on a march to the sea, known as ‘The Salt March,’ to collect their own salt.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>5</strong> ............ . He was imprisoned for two years during World War II. He and other Indian leaders had demanded immediate independence as India’s price for aiding Britain in the war. After he was released, Gandhi continued to work for independence.</p>
        <p>India finally won its independence in 1947. It was a great victory for Gandhi. <strong>6</strong> ............ Before and after India’s division, the country was torn by clashes be-tween Hindus and Muslims. Gandhi tried to make peace. On January 30, 1948, in the city of Delhi, he was shot and killed by a Hindu man.</p>
        <p>Gandhi was one of the greatest political and social leaders in the 20th century. His use of nonviolent protest eventually led to his country’s independence. Within his country, he supported the rights of both Hindus and Muslims. He also sought better treatment for groups everyone else looked down upon.</p>

          <br>
          <strong>Gandhi</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Mohandas Gandhi was a leader of India’s independence movement. When India was a colony of Great Britain, Gandhi used nonviolent methods to protest against British rule. His efforts earned him the title Mahatma. Mahatma means “great soul.”</p>
        <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India. Dur-ing his years at school, Gandhi was considered an average student. <strong>1</strong> ............&nbsp; He then moved to England to study law. He returned to India in 1891. He tried to start a law ca-reer, but he was unsuccessful.</p>
        <p>In 1893 Gandhi took a job in a British colony in South Africa. There he saw Europeans mistreating Indian settlers. <strong>2</strong> ............ .</p>
        <p>Gandhi first used his method of nonviolent protest in 1906. He told Indians that they should not obey British laws that they thought were wrong. <strong>3</strong> ............ . This new meth-od of protest became known as satyagraha, or “devotion to truth.”</p>
        <p>Gandhi returned to India in 1915. Within a few years he became India’s most powerful political leader. <strong>4</strong> ............ . Gandhi’s followers stopped using British goods. They re-fused to enter British courts and schools. In 1930 Gandhi led a protest against a British tax on salt. He led Indians on a march to the sea, known as ‘The Salt March,’ to collect their own salt.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>5</strong> ............ . He was imprisoned for two years during World War II. He and other Indian leaders had demanded immediate independence as India’s price for aiding Britain in the war. After he was released, Gandhi continued to work for independence.</p>
        <p>India finally won its independence in 1947. It was a great victory for Gandhi. <strong>6</strong> ............ Before and after India’s division, the country was torn by clashes be-tween Hindus and Muslims. Gandhi tried to make peace. On January 30, 1948, in the city of Delhi, he was shot and killed by a Hindu man.</p>
        <p>Gandhi was one of the greatest political and social leaders in the 20th century. His use of nonviolent protest eventually led to his country’s independence. Within his country, he supported the rights of both Hindus and Muslims. He also sought better treatment for groups everyone else looked down upon.</p>

Ballet originated in the Italian Renaissance courts of the 15th century. Noblemen and women were treated to lavish events, especially wedding celebrations, where dancing and music created an elaborate spectacle. Dancing masters taught the steps to the no-bility, and the court participated in the performances. In the 16th century, Catherine de Medici — an Italian noblewoman, wife of King Henry II of France and a great patron of the arts — began to fund ballet in the French court. Her elaborate festivals encouraged the growth of ballet de cour, a program that included&nbsp; dance, decor, costume, song, mu-sic and poetry. A century later, King Louis XIV helped to popularize and standardize the art form. A passionate dancer, he performed many roles himself, including that of the Sun King in Ballet de la nuit. His love of ballet fostered its elevation from a past time for amateurs to an endeavor requiring professional training.<br>

Linda Mae Brewer was born in Adelaide, South Australia. In 1974 she became Tap Champion of South Australia and went on to dance with the South Australia Ballet Com-pany. At the age of sixteen she was awarded a Royal Academy of Dancing Scholarship and came to London to pursue both studies and career. In the same year she danced in the Prix de Lausanne and received a choreographic award.<br>
<br>
Linda’s stage appearances include dancing with the Ballet Metropolis and The Jazz The-atre. She worked with Tom Jobe in City at The Riverside Studios and performed con-temporary works for Dance Umbrella.<br>
<br>
Linda’s West End shows include Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Song and Dance as the Wild Punk Tap Dancer; Flow the Crow in the Abba/Tim Rice musical Abbacadabra; Maisie in Sandy Wilson’s The Boyfriend; Wayne Sleep’s Dash and The Hot Shoe Show and she has just finished appearing in Time at the Dominion.<br>
<br>
Linda’s television appearances include six episodes of the BBC’s Hot Shoe Show. She played the lead role of Amy in the BBC Play for Today Bodies Don’t Lie; Fiona McPher-son in Bullman for Granada TV and most recently the part of Pam in the drama se-ries Gems for Thames TV. She has also danced and choreographed for Pictures, a se-ries for ATV and the children’s programmes Rainbow and No. 73. She appeared in the feature film Who Dares Wins.<br>

You can’t be serious. I looked around at the class and they were all like poles – slender, athletic bodies that made me feel like an elephant. I’ve always known that ballerinas were light and supple, but this was next level. I shuffled nervously to the bar and began pointing my toes and lifting my leg, as instructed. ‘And lift, and down, and lift and down…’ the teachers voice droned on monotonously. I looked at the girl in front of me. She had a scar that snaked along the top of her back. In the mirror I saw another girl, closer now. Her face and back had been hijacked by acne. I wouldn’t wish that on any-one, but I have to admit it made me feel better and realise – perhaps everyone else isn’t as perfect as I thought.

2022 Season. A NEW ERA. The season you’ve been waiting for.<br>
<br>
The Australian Ballet’s long-awaited productions of Anna Karenina and Romeo and Juli-et showcase the power of storytelling through the beauty of dance, moving us in ways that only ballet can.<br>
<br>
In keeping with the company’s vision of bringing the best contemporary works to Austral-ia, 2022 will also feature a feast of contemporary work, including the epic Kunstkamer. Created at Nederlands Dans Theater by four of today’s most in-demand choreographers, this vast work has never been staged by any other dance company in the world. It will show The Australian Ballet’s dancers in exciting new territory, exploring this ‘cabinet of curiosities’.<br>
<br>
The triple bill for 2022, Instruments of Dance, is an electrifying collaboration of 21st-century composers and dancemakers, with landmark new works by the resident chore-ographers of<br>
The Royal Ballet and New York City Ballet alongside a new commission from The Australian Ballet’s own resident choreographer, Alice Topp.<br>

Ballet originated in the Italian Renaissance courts of the 15th century. Noblemen and women were treated to lavish events, especially wedding celebrations, where dancing and music created an elaborate spectacle. Dancing masters taught the steps to the no-bility, and the court participated in the performances. In the 16th century, Catherine de Medici — an Italian noblewoman, wife of King Henry II of France and a great patron of the arts — began to fund ballet in the French court. Her elaborate festivals encouraged the growth of ballet de cour, a program that included&nbsp; dance, decor, costume, song, mu-sic and poetry. A century later, King Louis XIV helped to popularize and standardize the art form. A passionate dancer, he performed many roles himself, including that of the Sun King in Ballet de la nuit. His love of ballet fostered its elevation from a past time for amateurs to an endeavor requiring professional training.<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
You can’t be serious. I looked around at the class and they were all like poles – slender, athletic bodies that made me feel like an elephant. I’ve always known that ballerinas were light and supple, but this was next level. I shuffled nervously to the bar and began pointing my toes and lifting my leg, as instructed. ‘And lift, and down, and lift and down…’ the teachers voice droned on monotonously. I looked at the girl in front of me. She had a scar that snaked along the top of her back. In the mirror I saw another girl, closer now. Her face and back had been hijacked by acne. I wouldn’t wish that on any-one, but I have to admit it made me feel better and realise – perhaps everyone else isn’t as perfect as I thought.

2022 Season. A NEW ERA. The season you’ve been waiting for.<br>
<br>
The Australian Ballet’s long-awaited productions of Anna Karenina and Romeo and Juli-et showcase the power of storytelling through the beauty of dance, moving us in ways that only ballet can.<br>
