        <p>{^<strong>&nbsp;Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
What makes a good kids’ movie? Well, for me, a good kids’ movie has to appeal to people of all ages, and not just kids. Yes, you need an interesting story and characters, but you can say that about every film project.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The special kids’ / family films have heart and most of them also have an important message to teach. Need examples? How about the early animated Disney films? Were Snow White and Pinocchio and Bambi kids’ films? I would say yes. But, of course, they were much more than that. Everything about these movies is memorable – scenes, characters, dialogue. And while they were thought to be only for kids, as they were cartoons, parents and other adults loved them just as much as the youngsters back when they were first released, and still do today.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Currently, Pixar is the leading studio when it comes to great kids’ movies. ‘Toy Story’, ‘Ratatouille’ and ‘Up’ are among the Pixar films that work for both adults and kids. And, once again, it’s because of their interesting stories and characters.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
DreamWorks and Blue Sky are two other studios who have figured this out, while others continue to try and fail. Hollywood produces so many bad kids’ comedies each year, and most of them have the same things in common: too much slapstick and bathroom humour; silly plots; and unlikeable and unbelievable characters. All of these elements are clearly present in the latest bad kids’ film – ‘Furry Vengeance’ – but you can also find them in ‘Diary of a Wimpy Kid’, ‘Shorts’ and other recent live-action family comedies.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Disney's Africa-set family classic, ‘The Lion King’ has been voted the best animated film of all time - as if that will come as any surprise to you, as it's a stone-cold classic. Yep, now Simba's not only the king of Pride Rock, he's also top dog (or cat) of the animated movie world, having been awarded the number one spot by voters on Ranker.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
"The best animated films of all time are an assortment of animated movies that rank among the best movies of all time," the site says. "While the characters might be brightly coloured and possess abilities most real people could only wish to ever have, the stories and imagery speak to everyone and have set these movies up to become the best animated films ever." The film was followed in the runner-up spots by 1995's Toy Story and 2003's Finding Nemo in second and third place, respectively.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Popular Hollywood kids’ movies traditionally follow a three-act formula. Consider the beginning of Ratatouille, when Remy the rat, lost in the Parisian underground, sniffs his way into the kitchen of legendary restaurant Gusteau’s. In this first act, we uncover the furry protagonist’s central conflict: he yearns to cook, but being a rodent makes it tricky!<br>
<br>
Films can break the three-act structure. James Bonnet, a film writing instructor, says if a movie simply focuses on two elements – the action creating the problem, and the action resolving it – it will still work. Regardless of how many acts a movie has, it must have events that advance the plot, or main story – which screenplay consultant Michael Hauge calls turning points – as well as a likable but complex protagonist, or primary character, who has a problem to solve.<br>

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
What makes a good kids’ movie? Well, for me, a good kids’ movie has to appeal to people of all ages, and not just kids. Yes, you need an interesting story and characters, but you can say that about every film project.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The special kids’ / family films have heart and most of them also have an important message to teach. Need examples? How about the early animated Disney films? Were Snow White and Pinocchio and Bambi kids’ films? I would say yes. But, of course, they were much more than that. Everything about these movies is memorable – scenes, characters, dialogue. And while they were thought to be only for kids, as they were cartoons, parents and other adults loved them just as much as the youngsters back when they were first released, and still do today.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Currently, Pixar is the leading studio when it comes to great kids’ movies. ‘Toy Story’, ‘Ratatouille’ and ‘Up’ are among the Pixar films that work for both adults and kids. And, once again, it’s because of their interesting stories and characters.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
DreamWorks and Blue Sky are two other studios who have figured this out, while others continue to try and fail. Hollywood produces so many bad kids’ comedies each year, and most of them have the same things in common: too much slapstick and bathroom humour; silly plots; and unlikeable and unbelievable characters. All of these elements are clearly present in the latest bad kids’ film – ‘Furry Vengeance’ – but you can also find them in ‘Diary of a Wimpy Kid’, ‘Shorts’ and other recent live-action family comedies.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Disney's Africa-set family classic, ‘The Lion King’ has been voted the best animated film of all time - as if that will come as any surprise to you, as it's a stone-cold classic. Yep, now Simba's not only the king of Pride Rock, he's also top dog (or cat) of the animated movie world, having been awarded the number one spot by voters on Ranker.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
"The best animated films of all time are an assortment of animated movies that rank among the best movies of all time," the site says. "While the characters might be brightly coloured and possess abilities most real people could only wish to ever have, the stories and imagery speak to everyone and have set these movies up to become the best animated films ever." The film was followed in the runner-up spots by 1995's Toy Story and 2003's Finding Nemo in second and third place, respectively.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Popular Hollywood kids’ movies traditionally follow a three-act formula. Consider the beginning of Ratatouille, when Remy the rat, lost in the Parisian underground, sniffs his way into the kitchen of legendary restaurant Gusteau’s. In this first act, we uncover the furry protagonist’s central conflict: he yearns to cook, but being a rodent makes it tricky!<br>
<br>
Films can break the three-act structure. James Bonnet, a film writing instructor, says if a movie simply focuses on two elements – the action creating the problem, and the action resolving it – it will still work. Regardless of how many acts a movie has, it must have events that advance the plot, or main story – which screenplay consultant Michael Hauge calls turning points – as well as a likable but complex protagonist, or primary character, who has a problem to solve.<br>
