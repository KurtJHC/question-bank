Over the last 70 years, our rapidly evolving understanding of DNA has catapulted medical knowledge and treatments and even transformed the way we solve crimes. Since James Watson and Francis Crick’s discovery of the double helix structure of DNA in 1953, the scientific community has split in many different directions to investigate the building blocks of life to understand what makes us who we are. Without the discovery of DNA, we wouldn’t have all the ground-breaking studies going on right now in genome mapping and sequencing, so for that reason, DNA has to be my number one scientific discovery of all time.<br>

Penicillin was first discovered in 1928 and is now the most widely used antibiotic in the world. This year marks the 94th anniversary of the discovery of penicillin, the first naturally occurring antibiotic drug discovered and used therapeutically. It all started with a mould that developed on a staphylococcus culture plate when Fleming was experimenting with the influenza virus. Since then, the discovery of penicillin changed the course of medicine and has enabled physicians to treat formerly severe and life threatening illnesses such as bacterial endocarditis, meningitis, pneumococcal pneumonia, gonorrhoea and syphilis.<br>
<br>
Fleming was recorded as saying: “One sometimes finds what one is not looking for. When I woke up just after dawn on Sept. 28, 1928, I certainly didn’t plan to revolutionise all medicine by discovering the world’s first antibiotic, or bacteria killer. But some argue that that was exactly what I did.”<br>

Captain James Cook never claimed that he discovered Australia. Cook named the land he encountered New South Wales in an effort to counter&nbsp; any Dutch interest in what they had long called New Holland. The name Australia was popularised by Matthew Flinders following his circumnavigation of the continent in 1803. Not only did Cook not claim he had discovered Australia, he wrote at the time that he knew he was destined for New Holland.<br>
<br>
The main reason for his first voyage to the Pacific was to observe Venus moving across the face of the Sun from Tahiti. "It was part of a European effort to work out the size of the solar system," Dr Blyth said. It was in Tahiti that he was to open an envelope with secret orders to search for an unknown continent. "Which was for him to try and discover the existence of Terra Australis Incognita — in other words, the 'great unknown southern land'," Dr Blyth said.<br>

Albert Einstein, a man whose name is practically synonymous with genius, is one of history's greatest thinkers. As a physicist and mathematician, Einstein wasn't an inventor in the vein of Thomas Edison or Alexander Graham Bell, but his theories of relativity led to new ways of looking at time, space, matter, energy and gravity. His work led to important advances including the control of atomic energy, space exploration, and applications of light.<br>

Over the last 70 years, our rapidly evolving understanding of DNA has catapulted medical knowledge and treatments and even transformed the way we solve crimes. Since James Watson and Francis Crick’s discovery of the double helix structure of DNA in 1953, the scientific community has split in many different directions to investigate the building blocks of life to understand what makes us who we are. Without the discovery of DNA, we wouldn’t have all the ground-breaking studies going on right now in genome mapping and sequencing, so for that reason, DNA has to be my number one scientific discovery of all time.<br>
<br>

Penicillin was first discovered in 1928 and is now the most widely used antibiotic in the world. This year marks the 94th anniversary of the discovery of penicillin, the first naturally occurring antibiotic drug discovered and used therapeutically. It all started with a mould that developed on a staphylococcus culture plate when Fleming was experimenting with the influenza virus. Since then, the discovery of penicillin changed the course of medicine and has enabled physicians to treat formerly severe and life threatening illnesses such as bacterial endocarditis, meningitis, pneumococcal pneumonia, gonorrhoea and syphilis.<br>
<br>
Fleming was recorded as saying: “One sometimes finds what one is not looking for. When I woke up just after dawn on Sept. 28, 1928, I certainly didn’t plan to revolutionise all medicine by discovering the world’s first antibiotic, or bacteria killer. But some argue that that was exactly what I did.”<br>
<br>
{^ <strong>Extract C</strong> ^}<br>
Captain James Cook never claimed that he discovered Australia. Cook named the land he encountered New South Wales in an effort to counter&nbsp; any Dutch interest in what they had long called New Holland. The name Australia was popularised by Matthew Flinders following his circumnavigation of the continent in 1803. Not only did Cook not claim he had discovered Australia, he wrote at the time that he knew he was destined for New Holland.<br>
<br>
The main reason for his first voyage to the Pacific was to observe Venus moving across the face of the Sun from Tahiti. "It was part of a European effort to work out the size of the solar system," Dr Blyth said. It was in Tahiti that he was to open an envelope with secret orders to search for an unknown continent. "Which was for him to try and discover the existence of Terra Australis Incognita — in other words, the 'great unknown southern land'," Dr Blyth said.<br>
<br>
{^ <strong>Extract D </strong>^}<br>
Albert Einstein, a man whose name is practically synonymous with genius, is one of history's greatest thinkers. As a physicist and mathematician, Einstein wasn't an inventor in the vein of Thomas Edison or Alexander Graham Bell, but his theories of relativity led to new ways of looking at time, space, matter, energy and gravity. His work led to important advances including the control of atomic energy, space exploration, and applications of light.<br>
