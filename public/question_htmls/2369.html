        <p><strong>The Wolf at My Window</strong><br><em>by Diane L. Burns<br>
drawing by Sal Catalano</em><br><br>
Wolf! Hank thought. The boy stared out the cabin window at the lone creature. It was sitting a stone’s throw away in the moonlight. The wolf howled; Hank shivered. For the first time, he felt truly alone in these Idaho mountains.</p>
        <p>It had felt so good to be allowed to come along with Dad. Dad was a scientist who studied wild animals. Together, Hank and Dad had followed the tracks of mountain sheep, goats, and cougars. Through binoculars, they’d studied coyotes and mule deer. And they’d carefully recorded all the information in Dad’s logbook every night in their tent. Dad planned to share the information with other wildlife scientists.</p>
        <p>Then, two days ago, they had moved into an empty cabin. Here, Dad would write a report about what he had found. But they discovered that dozens and dozens of mice had taken over the cabin. The little rodents scurried in and out through lots of tiny holes in the walls… Worst of all, the mice had gotten into the supplies of dried food and ruined almost everything.</p>
        <p>Now, because most of the food was gone, Dad had left overnight to get new supplies from town. Hank had insisted on staying behind.</p>
        <p>* * *</p>
        <p>The Wolf. Its howl sounded again. Hank opened the logbook to write about it, but his hand shook. Dad had never mentioned having any trouble with wolves. But Hank’s friend Jill had once told him of a shopkeeper in Montana who’d faced a whole pack of wolves during a hard winter long ago. He’d been alone in his cabin, Jill had said.</p>
        <p>Like I am now, Hank thought with a nervous gulp. The wolves had chewed right through a solid door, Jill had said, to get a smoked ham hanging from the ceiling.</p>
        <p>But . . . Hank took a deep breath and forced down his fright. How could such a story be true? Dad had told him many times that wolves were smart but shy, staying many miles away from people. The big, bad wolf was just a fairy tale, Hank thought. A 13-year-old boy was too old for such things.</p>
        <p>Hank closed the logbook and put it on the table. Quickly he looked around for something he could use as a weapon—just in case. He grabbed a poker from the fireplace, went to the door, and took a deep breath. Then he opened the door, waved the poker, and yelled with all his might: “Go away, wolf! Go away!”</p>
        <p>Startled, the wolf sprang up—and started trotting away. Hank closed the door and leaned back with a gasp. When he’d caught his breath, he turned back to the window. Oh, no! There was the wolf, sitting right where it had sat before.</p>
        <p>Hank stared at the wolf. The wolf stared right back at him. Hank was staring into the eyes of a hunter. He knew, like all creatures, the wolf needed to eat. Hank’s dad had said wolves play their part in the environment by eating deer, elk, rabbits, and other animals. But maybe, like the hungry mice that were frisking about Hank’s feet, wolves go for any food they can find.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, the wolf sprang! Hank ducked, expecting to hear the window glass shattering above him. Instead, he heard a muffled snuffling along the ground outside. The wolf wanted a way in! Hank shuddered. His heart pounded. If only Dad were here!</p>
        <p>Now came a scratching sound—the sound of pawing at the cabin walls. And then, over the hammering of his heart, Hank heard a high-pitched, tiny . . . SQUEAK!</p>
        <p>Squeak? Holding his breath, Hank raised his head to see. The wolf was below the window, holding on to a small something. Then it lay in the grass and gulped down its prize—a mouse!</p>
        <p>The wolf stood up to pounce, stiff-legged, on another. Hank’s breath rushed out. The wolf was hungry all right. But just for the kind of food it should eat, as Dad had said.</p>
        <p>* * *</p>
        <p>As the wolf pounced again, Hank opened the logbook. He began to write, neatly and carefully, every detail of his evening with the wolf. The story would be waiting for Dad when he returned in the morning—long after the smart, shy wolf had moved on in search of bigger animals to eat.</p>

        <p><strong>The Beagle Brigade</strong><br><em>by Kathiann M. Kowalski</em><br><br>
Return to the United States from a trip abroad, and your luggage will get inspected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Beagle Brigade. Working with human canine officer partners, the beagles sniff out potential threats to American agriculture.</p>
        <p>An orange or apple, for example, might harbor a Mediterranean fruit fly. Ham could carry a disease such as hog cholera. These and other pests could devastate farmers’ crops and livestock. “Once we introduce something that is not part of the environment, there may not be any controls for it in the environment,” notes USDA’s Lisa Davis at the National Dog Detector Training Center in Orlando, Florida. “The best thing for us to do is to prevent it from coming across the border and becoming established.”</p>
        <p>When a beagle sniffs specific food odors, it signals its partner by sitting. The human officer then investigates. When the dog is right—which happens 90 percent of the time—it gets an edible treat.</p>
        <p>“The dog is not out there working,” explains Davis. “It’s out there playing. It’s a game to the dog.” The handlers give the beagles plenty of food and loving. They make sure they get first-class medical attention, too. When the dogs finally retire after 9 to 11 years, the USDA finds caring homes for them. It’s a dog’s life indeed!</p>
        <p>Their people partners work and study somewhat harder. As specialized quarantine officers, most hold degrees in the biological sciences or related sciences.</p>
        <p>How well does the Beagle Brigade do its job? “On the average,” notes Davis, “each year our 54 teams intercept around 75,000 prohibited, restricted items.” Since even one infested item could cause widespread destruction, that’s a great result for America’s agricultural environment.

        <p><strong>The Beagle Brigade</strong><br><em>by Kathiann M. Kowalski</em><br><br>
Return to the United States from a trip abroad, and your luggage will get inspected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Beagle Brigade. Working with human canine officer partners, the beagles sniff out potential threats to American agriculture.</p>
        <p>An orange or apple, for example, might harbor a Mediterranean fruit fly. Ham could carry a disease such as hog cholera. These and other pests could devastate farmers’ crops and livestock. “Once we introduce something that is not part of the environment, there may not be any controls for it in the environment,” notes USDA’s Lisa Davis at the National Dog Detector Training Center in Orlando, Florida. “The best thing for us to do is to prevent it from coming across the border and becoming established.”</p>
        <p>When a beagle sniffs specific food odors, it signals its partner by sitting. The human officer then investigates. When the dog is right—which happens 90 percent of the time—it gets an edible treat.</p>
        <p>“The dog is not out there working,” explains Davis. “It’s out there playing. It’s a game to the dog.” The handlers give the beagles plenty of food and loving. They make sure they get first-class medical attention, too. When the dogs finally retire after 9 to 11 years, the USDA finds caring homes for them. It’s a dog’s life indeed!</p>
        <p>Their people partners work and study somewhat harder. As specialized quarantine officers, most hold degrees in the biological sciences or related sciences.</p>
        <p>How well does the Beagle Brigade do its job? “On the average,” notes Davis, “each year our 54 teams intercept around 75,000 prohibited, restricted items.” Since even one infested item could cause widespread destruction, that’s a great result for America’s agricultural environment. Let’s hear it for Snoopy!</p>

        <p><strong>The Beagle Brigade</strong><br><em>by Kathiann M. Kowalski</em><br><br>
Return to the United States from a trip abroad, and your luggage will get inspected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Beagle Brigade. Working with human canine officer partners, the beagles sniff out potential threats to American agriculture.</p>
        <p>An orange or apple, for example, might harbor a Mediterranean fruit fly. Ham could carry a disease such as hog cholera. These and other pests could devastate farmers’ crops and livestock. “Once we introduce something that is not part of the environment, there may not be any controls for it in the environment,” notes USDA’s Lisa Davis at the National Dog Detector Training Center in Orlando, Florida. “The best thing for us to do is to prevent it from coming across the border and becoming established.”</p>
        <p>When a beagle sniffs specific food odors, it signals its partner by sitting. The human officer then investigates. When the dog is right—which happens 90 percent of the time—it gets an edible treat.</p>
        <p>“The dog is not out there working,” explains Davis. “It’s out there playing. It’s a game to the dog.” The handlers give the beagles plenty of food and loving. They make sure they get first-class medical attention, too. When the dogs finally retire after 9 to 11 years, the USDA finds caring homes for them. It’s a dog’s life indeed!</p>
        <p>Their people partners work and study somewhat harder. As specialized quarantine officers, most hold degrees in the biological sciences or related sciences.</p>
        <p>How well does the Beagle Brigade do its job? “On the average,” notes Davis, “each year our 54 teams intercept around 75,000 prohibited, restricted items.” Since even one infested item could cause widespread destruction, that’s a great result for America’s agricultural environment. Let’s hear it for Snoopy!</p>

Well, son, I'll tell you:<br>
Life for me ain't been no crystal stair.<br>
It's had tacks in it,<br>
And splinters,<br>
And boards torn up,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br>
And places with no carpet on the floor—<br>
Bare.<br>
But all the time<br>
I'se been a-climbin' on,<br>
And reachin' landin's,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br>
And turnin' corners,"<br>
And sometimes goin' in the dark<br>
Where there ain't been no light.<br>
So, boy, don't you turn back.<br>
Don't you set down on the steps.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15<br>
'Cause you finds it's kinder hard.<br>
Don't you fall now—<br>
For I'se still goin', honey,<br>
I'se still climbin',<br>
And life for me ain't been no crystal stair.&nbsp; &nbsp;20<br>

Well, son, I'll tell you:<br>
Life for me ain't been no crystal stair.<br>
It's had tacks in it,<br>
And splinters,<br>
And boards torn up,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br>
And places with no carpet on the floor—<br>
Bare.<br>
But all the time<br>
I'se been a-climbin' on,<br>
And reachin' landin's,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br>
And turnin' corners,"<br>
And sometimes goin' in the dark<br>
Where there ain't been no light.<br>
So, boy, don't you turn back.<br>
Don't you set down on the steps.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15<br>
'Cause you finds it's kinder hard.<br>
Don't you fall now—<br>
For I'se still goin', honey,<br>
I'se still climbin',<br>
And life for me ain't been no crystal stair.&nbsp; &nbsp;20<br>

        <p><strong>Mother to Son</strong><br><br>
Well, son, I'll tell you:<br>
Life for me ain't been no crystal stair.<br>
It's had tacks in it,<br>
And splinters,<br>
And boards torn up,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br>
And places with no carpet on the floor—<br>
Bare.<br>
But all the time<br>
I'se been a-climbin' on,<br>
And reachin' landin's,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10<br>
And turnin' corners,"<br>
And sometimes goin' in the dark<br>
Where there ain't been no light.<br>
So, boy, don't you turn back.<br>
Don't you set down on the steps.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15<br>
'Cause you finds it's kinder hard.<br>
Don't you fall now—<br>
For I'se still goin', honey,<br>
I'se still climbin',<br>
And life for me ain't been no crystal stair.&nbsp; &nbsp;20<br>
