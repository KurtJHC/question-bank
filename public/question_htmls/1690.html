In Unlikely Heroes, Ms. Holland uncovers and celebrates yet another side of animals that we often think belongs primarily to people—heroism, that indefinable quality of going above and beyond, often for altruistic reasons, often at great personal risk. These 37 inspiring true tales show animals whose quick acts have saved lives, like the pod of dolphins who protected swimmers in New Zealand from a great white shark by forming a screen around them. There are stories of animals who simply and unselfishly give, like Rojo the llama, who shines his very special light of loving kindness on the elderly patients in an Oregon rehab centre.<br>
<br>
And there are compelling stories of heroic resilience: like Naki’o, the abandoned puppy who lost all four paws to frostbite but found the grit not only to overcome that terrible hardship but to reclaim the joy of life—that’s him, smiling on the cover of the book. In her heartwarming New York Times bestsellers Unlikely Friendships and 2013’s Unlikely Loves, Jennifer Holland revealed the surprising emotional bonds that exist between animals of different species. Her books spent dozens of weeks on bestseller lists and caught the attention of major media from CBS This Morning to USA Today. Why? Because she opened our eyes to the rich inner lives of animals, showing us that the power of love and friendship is not for humans only.<br>

When a humpback whale began pushing and guiding scientist Nan Hauser in the water, she didn’t know what to think. At first, she was scared and confused, until she realised the whale noticed something she didn’t – a large tiger shark swimming nearby. Upon seeing the shark, Nan understood that the whale was trying to protect her and guide her back to her boat. Nan, who has dedicated her life to protecting whales, had never experienced anything like that before, though she knew that whales sometimes displayed a similar behaviour when protecting seals from killer whales. Though she doesn’t know exactly what goes through the minds of these whales, she knows that they have this altruistic desire to help animals of other species.<br>

"There's something wrong, sir," said John, and he sprang out of the dog-cart and came to my head and looked all about. He tried to lead me forward. "Come on, Beauty, what's the matter?" Of course I could not tell him, but I knew very well that the bridge was not safe. Just then the man at the toll-gate on the other side ran out of the house, tossing a torch about like one mad.<br>
"Hoy, hoy, hoy! halloo! stop!" he cried.<br>
"What's the matter?" shouted my master.<br>
"The bridge is broken in the middle, and part of it is carried away; if you come on you'll be into the river." "Thank God!" said my master. "You Beauty!" said John, and took the bridle and gently turned me round to the right-hand road by the river side. The sun had set some time; the wind seemed to have lulled off after that furious blast which tore up the tree. It grew darker and darker, stiller and stiller. I trotted quietly along, the wheels hardly making a sound on the soft road. For a good while neither master nor John spoke, and then master began in a serious voice. I could not understand much of what they said, but I found they thought, if I had gone on as the master wanted me, most likely the bridge would have given way under us, and horse, chaise, master, and man would have fallen into the river; and as the current was flowing very strongly, and there was no light and no help at hand, it was more than likely we should all have been drowned. Master said, God had given men reason, by which they could find out things for themselves; but he had given animals knowledge which did not depend on reason, and which was much more prompt and perfect in its way, and by which they had often saved the lives of men.<br>

Have you heard of the potbellied pig who saved her owner’s life by playing dead in the middle of the road? LuLu is that heroic pig and after performing her brave and selfless act she was catapulted to celebrity status.<br>
<br>
Her human, Jo Ann Altsman, suffered a heart attack while vacationing in the North Woods of Presque Isle, Pennsylvania back in 1998. Jo Ann was struck down in her camping mobile home and desperately needed help.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, Jo Ann’s husband, Jack, was on a fishing trip and the only other soul around was LuLu. After Jo Ann unsuccessfully tried calling for help, LuLu realised the danger her mom was in and sprung into action. LuLu squeezed through the pet door, somehow managed to get the gate open and ran into&nbsp; the street and laid down in front of traffic. Several cars just drove by her, but one man got out to see what the matter was. LuLu instantly got up and started toward the mobile home where Jo Ann was.<br>
<br>
The man, who had seen some cuts on LuLu (which she got in her efforts), yelled out, “Your pig’s in distress.” That’s when he heard Jo Ann holler back, “I’m in distress, too. I’m having a heart attack. Please call an ambulance.” She was rushed to the hospital and into emergency surgery. Luckily, she pulled through, all thanks to LuLu’s ingenuity and action!<br>
