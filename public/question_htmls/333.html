        <p><em>1</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The check bounced. “Insufficient funds,” says the little note attached. Well, I’m sure it’s just a mistake. Probably the people didn’t make a transfer in time or something. “No big deal,” I keep saying to myself, standing at the mailbox.</p>
        <p><em>2</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the check bounced! Isn’t that strange? I mean, is there a message here? The check was payment to us for the sale of Cricket, our ex-horse, and Sassy, our ex-mule. A sale, truth be told, I’ve been regretting. And now the check has bounced. Is it a sign?</p>
        <p><em>3</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; No, of course not. Probably just a clerical error.</p>
        <p><em>4</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, as I take the long walk back home, I get a picture in my head. I imagine that somehow Cricket and Sassy understand that the check bounced, that they understand the legal ramifications of this, that technically the deal is null and void, and in one burst of horse energy they leap over the buyer’s fence and come bounding in slow motion, as if in a shampoo commercial, up our driveway, toward me, kicking and snorting with glee, and I run toward them and we hug and live happily ever after. Together. As it was meant to be.</p>
        <p><em>5</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I get home I snap out of it. No, we did the right thing, selling Cricket and Sassy. They’re in a better place now. Cricket will be a brood mare. A mom!</p>
        <p><em>6</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; And Sassy, her friend, will be at her side. It’s better for them. Better for us. Cricket, a registered American saddlebred, is too much horse for novices like us. And Sassy is too short for an adult to ride. And we have another horse and mule that we do ride. So this really is the best thing for all concerned. And what did I tell myself ? Yes, some friendships are meant to end. That’s it. Never mind that Cricket was our love-horse, the horse that walked up our driveway on our wedding day. And Sassy was our love-mule, the mule that walked up our driveway beside her. They had flowers in their hair. Never mind! Because some friendships are just meant to end. And I am a mature person with a logical head who understands this.</p>
        <p><em>7</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; So I call Cricket and Sassy’s new owners. “The check bounced,” I say.</p>
        <p><em>8</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; “Oh, that’s our stupid bank,” the woman says. Then she gives me her bank’s stupid phone number, should I want to call for proof that her account is in good standing, which I don’t really, but I write the number down anyway. “Just resubmit the check, okay?” she says. I ask her how Cricket and Sassy are doing, and she says, “Great!” Nothing more. I wish she had said more.</p>
        <p><em>9</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Meantime, all this horse thinking gets my mind on Billy. Because not all fading friendships are meant to end. Billy is the neighbor who sold Cricket and Sassy to us. He’s the one who rode Sassy up the driveway on our wedding day, his feet dragging on the ground. Tom, his son, rode Cricket. They’re the ones who put the flowers in their hair. Billy and I used to see each other more. I don’t know why we’ve drifted. There never seems to be a real reason for friendships to fade. Friendships take work. Maybe that’s all there is to it.</p>
        <p><em>10&nbsp;</em>&nbsp; I call Billy just to say hi. He seems happy to hear from me. “We got a donkey!” he says. “She’s so goofy. You’d love her.” I tell him the news about Cricket and Sassy, and when I mention the buyers he seems concerned: “Did you happen to insist on a certified check?”</p>
        <p><em>11&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Oh.</p>
        <p><em>12&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Sure enough, a few days later, I’m at the mailbox. “Insufficient funds.” I can’t believe it. What do they think, I’m an idiot or something? I stomp into the house. What about that bank phone number? I’ll call that bank, I’ll get to the bottom of this. What did I do with that number? I must have thrown it out. I start picking through the trash.</p>
        <p><em>13&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Here it is! But the paper is wet and the number is blurred.</p>
        <p><em>14&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Isn’t that strange? I mean, is there a message here? It’s hard not to think of disappearing ink as a message from above. I start getting shampoo commercials in my head again. Oh, dear.</p>
        <p><em>15&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Why am I putting myself through all of this? Why can’t I just admit that I made a mistake? Not just the part about selling my beloved pets to, well, some questionable buyers. But selling them at all. And, anyway, why can’t we breed Cricket? A lot of work, perhaps. But wouldn’t that be an amazing experience?</p>
        <p><em>16&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>I imagine Cricket back in our barn. I imagine brushing her, telling her everything I’ve learned. “Well, Cricket, friendships take work,” I’ll say. “That’s all there is to it.”</p>
        <p><em>17&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>So I call the woman, sound very businesslike. “The check bounced again,” I say calmly. “The deal is off.” Strangely, she doesn’t sound surprised. I get the distinct sense she and her husband have been through this before.</p>
        <p><em>18&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>I call Billy. “Would you be able to go pick up Cricket and Sassy in your horse trailer and bring them back home?” I ask. He says of course. No questions asked. And I think that’s what friends are for. And I say yeah, I’d love to stop over and meet his new donkey.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em>1</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The check bounced. “Insufficient funds,” says the little note attached. Well, I’m sure it’s just a mistake. Probably the people didn’t make a transfer in time or something. “No big deal,” I keep saying to myself, standing at the mailbox.</p>
        <p><em>2</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the check bounced! Isn’t that strange? I mean, is there a message here? The check was payment to us for the sale of Cricket, our ex-horse, and Sassy, our ex-mule. A sale, truth be told, I’ve been regretting. And now the check has bounced. Is it a sign?</p>
        <p><em>3</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; No, of course not. Probably just a clerical error.</p>
        <p><em>4</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, as I take the long walk back home, I get a picture in my head. I imagine that somehow Cricket and Sassy understand that the check bounced, that they understand the legal ramifications of this, that technically the deal is null and void, and in one burst of horse energy they leap over the buyer’s fence and come bounding in slow motion, as if in a shampoo commercial, up our driveway, toward me, kicking and snorting with glee, and I run toward them and we hug and live happily ever after. Together. As it was meant to be.</p>
        <p><em>5</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I get home I snap out of it. No, we did the right thing, selling Cricket and Sassy. They’re in a better place now. Cricket will be a brood mare. A mom!</p>
        <p><em>6</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; And Sassy, her friend, will be at her side. It’s better for them. Better for us. Cricket, a registered American saddlebred, is too much horse for novices like us. And Sassy is too short for an adult to ride. And we have another horse and mule that we do ride. So this really is the best thing for all concerned. And what did I tell myself ? Yes, some friendships are meant to end. That’s it. Never mind that Cricket was our love-horse, the horse that walked up our driveway on our wedding day. And Sassy was our love-mule, the mule that walked up our driveway beside her. They had flowers in their hair. Never mind! Because some friendships are just meant to end. And I am a mature person with a logical head who understands this.</p>
        <p><em>7</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; So I call Cricket and Sassy’s new owners. “The check bounced,” I say.</p>
        <p><em>8</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; “Oh, that’s our stupid bank,” the woman says. Then she gives me her bank’s stupid phone number, should I want to call for proof that her account is in good standing, which I don’t really, but I write the number down anyway. “Just resubmit the check, okay?” she says. I ask her how Cricket and Sassy are doing, and she says, “Great!” Nothing more. I wish she had said more.</p>
        <p><em>9</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Meantime, all this horse thinking gets my mind on Billy. Because not all fading friendships are meant to end. Billy is the neighbor who sold Cricket and Sassy to us. He’s the one who rode Sassy up the driveway on our wedding day, his feet dragging on the ground. Tom, his son, rode Cricket. They’re the ones who put the flowers in their hair. Billy and I used to see each other more. I don’t know why we’ve drifted. There never seems to be a real reason for friendships to fade. Friendships take work. Maybe that’s all there is to it.</p>
        <p><em>10&nbsp;</em>&nbsp; I call Billy just to say hi. He seems happy to hear from me. “We got a donkey!” he says. “She’s so goofy. You’d love her.” I tell him the news about Cricket and Sassy, and when I mention the buyers he seems concerned: “Did you happen to insist on a certified check?”</p>
        <p><em>11&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Oh.</p>
        <p><em>12&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Sure enough, a few days later, I’m at the mailbox. “Insufficient funds.” I can’t believe it. What do they think, I’m an idiot or something? I stomp into the house. What about that bank phone number? I’ll call that bank, I’ll get to the bottom of this. What did I do with that number? I must have thrown it out. I start picking through the trash.</p>
        <p><em>13&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Here it is! But the paper is wet and the number is blurred.</p>
        <p><em>14&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Isn’t that strange? I mean, is there a message here? It’s hard not to think of disappearing ink as a message from above. I start getting shampoo commercials in my head again. Oh, dear.</p>
        <p><em>15&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Why am I putting myself through all of this? Why can’t I just admit that I made a mistake? Not just the part about selling my beloved pets to, well, some questionable buyers. But selling them at all. And, anyway, why can’t we breed Cricket? A lot of work, perhaps. But wouldn’t that be an amazing experience?</p>
        <p><em>16&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>I imagine Cricket back in our barn. I imagine brushing her, telling her everything I’ve learned. “Well, Cricket, friendships take work,” I’ll say. “That’s all there is to it.”</p>
        <p><em>17&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>So I call the woman, sound very businesslike. “The check bounced again,” I say calmly. “The deal is off.” Strangely, she doesn’t sound surprised. I get the distinct sense she and her husband have been through this before.</p>
        <p><em>18&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>I call Billy. “Would you be able to go pick up Cricket and Sassy in your horse trailer and bring them back home?” I ask. He says of course. No questions asked. And I think that’s what friends are for. And I say yeah, I’d love to stop over and meet his new donkey.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em>1</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The check bounced. “Insufficient funds,” says the little note attached. Well, I’m sure it’s just a mistake. Probably the people didn’t make a transfer in time or something. “No big deal,” I keep saying to myself, standing at the mailbox.</p>
        <p><em>2</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the check bounced! Isn’t that strange? I mean, is there a message here? The check was payment to us for the sale of Cricket, our ex-horse, and Sassy, our ex-mule. A sale, truth be told, I’ve been regretting. And now the check has bounced. Is it a sign?</p>
        <p><em>3</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; No, of course not. Probably just a clerical error.</p>
        <p><em>4</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, as I take the long walk back home, I get a picture in my head. I imagine that somehow Cricket and Sassy understand that the check bounced, that they understand the legal ramifications of this, that technically the deal is null and void, and in one burst of horse energy they leap over the buyer’s fence and come bounding in slow motion, as if in a shampoo commercial, up our driveway, toward me, kicking and snorting with glee, and I run toward them and we hug and live happily ever after. Together. As it was meant to be.</p>
        <p><em>5</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I get home I snap out of it. No, we did the right thing, selling Cricket and Sassy. They’re in a better place now. Cricket will be a brood mare. A mom!</p>
        <p><em>6</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; And Sassy, her friend, will be at her side. It’s better for them. Better for us. Cricket, a registered American saddlebred, is too much horse for novices like us. And Sassy is too short for an adult to ride. And we have another horse and mule that we do ride. So this really is the best thing for all concerned. And what did I tell myself ? Yes, some friendships are meant to end. That’s it. Never mind that Cricket was our love-horse, the horse that walked up our driveway on our wedding day. And Sassy was our love-mule, the mule that walked up our driveway beside her. They had flowers in their hair. Never mind! Because some friendships are just meant to end. And I am a mature person with a logical head who understands this.</p>
        <p><em>7</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; So I call Cricket and Sassy’s new owners. “The check bounced,” I say.</p>
        <p><em>8</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; “Oh, that’s our stupid bank,” the woman says. Then she gives me her bank’s stupid phone number, should I want to call for proof that her account is in good standing, which I don’t really, but I write the number down anyway. “Just resubmit the check, okay?” she says. I ask her how Cricket and Sassy are doing, and she says, “Great!” Nothing more. I wish she had said more.</p>
        <p><em>9</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Meantime, all this horse thinking gets my mind on Billy. Because not all fading friendships are meant to end. Billy is the neighbor who sold Cricket and Sassy to us. He’s the one who rode Sassy up the driveway on our wedding day, his feet dragging on the ground. Tom, his son, rode Cricket. They’re the ones who put the flowers in their hair. Billy and I used to see each other more. I don’t know why we’ve drifted. There never seems to be a real reason for friendships to fade. Friendships take work. Maybe that’s all there is to it.</p>
        <p><em>10&nbsp;</em>&nbsp; I call Billy just to say hi. He seems happy to hear from me. “We got a donkey!” he says. “She’s so goofy. You’d love her.” I tell him the news about Cricket and Sassy, and when I mention the buyers he seems concerned: “Did you happen to insist on a certified check?”</p>
        <p><em>11&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Oh.</p>
        <p><em>12&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Sure enough, a few days later, I’m at the mailbox. “Insufficient funds.” I can’t believe it. What do they think, I’m an idiot or something? I stomp into the house. What about that bank phone number? I’ll call that bank, I’ll get to the bottom of this. What did I do with that number? I must have thrown it out. I start picking through the trash.</p>
        <p><em>13&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Here it is! But the paper is wet and the number is blurred.</p>
        <p><em>14&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Isn’t that strange? I mean, is there a message here? It’s hard not to think of disappearing ink as a message from above. I start getting shampoo commercials in my head again. Oh, dear.</p>
        <p><em>15&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Why am I putting myself through all of this? Why can’t I just admit that I made a mistake? Not just the part about selling my beloved pets to, well, some questionable buyers. But selling them at all. And, anyway, why can’t we breed Cricket? A lot of work, perhaps. But wouldn’t that be an amazing experience?</p>
        <p><em>16&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>I imagine Cricket back in our barn. I imagine brushing her, telling her everything I’ve learned. “Well, Cricket, friendships take work,” I’ll say. “That’s all there is to it.”</p>
        <p><em>17&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>So I call the woman, sound very businesslike. “The check bounced again,” I say calmly. “The deal is off.” Strangely, she doesn’t sound surprised. I get the distinct sense she and her husband have been through this before.</p>
        <p><em>18&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>I call Billy. “Would you be able to go pick up Cricket and Sassy in your horse trailer and bring them back home?” I ask. He says of course. No questions asked. And I think that’s what friends are for. And I say yeah, I’d love to stop over and meet his new donkey.</p>

        <p><em>1</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The check bounced. “Insufficient funds,” says the little note attached. Well, I’m sure it’s just a mistake. Probably the people didn’t make a transfer in time or something. “No big deal,” I keep saying to myself, standing at the mailbox.</p>
        <p><em>2</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the check bounced! Isn’t that strange? I mean, is there a message here? The check was payment to us for the sale of Cricket, our ex-horse, and Sassy, our ex-mule. A sale, truth be told, I’ve been regretting. And now the check has bounced. Is it a sign?</p>
        <p><em>3</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; No, of course not. Probably just a clerical error.</p>
        <p><em>4</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, as I take the long walk back home, I get a picture in my head. I imagine that somehow Cricket and Sassy understand that the check bounced, that they understand the legal ramifications of this, that technically the deal is null and void, and in one burst of horse energy they leap over the buyer’s fence and come bounding in slow motion, as if in a shampoo commercial, up our driveway, toward me, kicking and snorting with glee, and I run toward them and we hug and live happily ever after. Together. As it was meant to be.</p>
        <p><em>5</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I get home I snap out of it. No, we did the right thing, selling Cricket and Sassy. They’re in a better place now. Cricket will be a brood mare. A mom!</p>
        <p><em>6</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; And Sassy, her friend, will be at her side. It’s better for them. Better for us. Cricket, a registered American saddlebred, is too much horse for novices like us. And Sassy is too short for an adult to ride. And we have another horse and mule that we do ride. So this really is the best thing for all concerned. And what did I tell myself ? Yes, some friendships are meant to end. That’s it. Never mind that Cricket was our love-horse, the horse that walked up our driveway on our wedding day. And Sassy was our love-mule, the mule that walked up our driveway beside her. They had flowers in their hair. Never mind! Because some friendships are just meant to end. And I am a mature person with a logical head who understands this.</p>
        <p><em>7</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; So I call Cricket and Sassy’s new owners. “The check bounced,” I say.</p>
        <p><em>8</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; “Oh, that’s our stupid bank,” the woman says. Then she gives me her bank’s stupid phone number, should I want to call for proof that her account is in good standing, which I don’t really, but I write the number down anyway. “Just resubmit the check, okay?” she says. I ask her how Cricket and Sassy are doing, and she says, “Great!” Nothing more. I wish she had said more.</p>
        <p><em>9</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Meantime, all this horse thinking gets my mind on Billy. Because not all fading friendships are meant to end. Billy is the neighbor who sold Cricket and Sassy to us. He’s the one who rode Sassy up the driveway on our wedding day, his feet dragging on the ground. Tom, his son, rode Cricket. They’re the ones who put the flowers in their hair. Billy and I used to see each other more. I don’t know why we’ve drifted. There never seems to be a real reason for friendships to fade. Friendships take work. Maybe that’s all there is to it.</p>
        <p><em>10&nbsp;</em>&nbsp; I call Billy just to say hi. He seems happy to hear from me. “We got a donkey!” he says. “She’s so goofy. You’d love her.” I tell him the news about Cricket and Sassy, and when I mention the buyers he seems concerned: “Did you happen to insist on a certified check?”</p>
        <p><em>11&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Oh.</p>
        <p><em>12&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Sure enough, a few days later, I’m at the mailbox. “Insufficient funds.” I can’t believe it. What do they think, I’m an idiot or something? I stomp into the house. What about that bank phone number? I’ll call that bank, I’ll get to the bottom of this. What did I do with that number? I must have thrown it out. I start picking through the trash.</p>
        <p><em>13&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Here it is! But the paper is wet and the number is blurred.</p>
        <p><em>14&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Isn’t that strange? I mean, is there a message here? It’s hard not to think of disappearing ink as a message from above. I start getting shampoo commercials in my head again. Oh, dear.</p>
        <p><em>15&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Why am I putting myself through all of this? Why can’t I just admit that I made a mistake? Not just the part about selling my beloved pets to, well, some questionable buyers. But selling them at all. And, anyway, why can’t we breed Cricket? A lot of work, perhaps. But wouldn’t that be an amazing experience?</p>
        <p><em>16&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>I imagine Cricket back in our barn. I imagine brushing her, telling her everything I’ve learned. “Well, Cricket, friendships take work,” I’ll say. “That’s all there is to it.”</p>
        <p><em>17&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>So I call the woman, sound very businesslike. “The check bounced again,” I say calmly. “The deal is off.” Strangely, she doesn’t sound surprised. I get the distinct sense she and her husband have been through this before.</p>
        <p><em>18&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>I call Billy. “Would you be able to go pick up Cricket and Sassy in your horse trailer and bring them back home?” I ask. He says of course. No questions asked. And I think that’s what friends are for. And I say yeah, I’d love to stop over and meet his new donkey.</p>

        <p><em>1</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The check bounced. “Insufficient funds,” says the little note attached. Well, I’m sure it’s just a mistake. Probably the people didn’t make a transfer in time or something. “No big deal,” I keep saying to myself, standing at the mailbox.</p>
        <p><em>2</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the check bounced! Isn’t that strange? I mean, is there a message here? The check was payment to us for the sale of Cricket, our ex-horse, and Sassy, our ex-mule. A sale, truth be told, I’ve been regretting. And now the check has bounced. Is it a sign?</p>
        <p><em>3</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; No, of course not. Probably just a clerical error.</p>
        <p><em>4</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, as I take the long walk back home, I get a picture in my head. I imagine that somehow Cricket and Sassy understand that the check bounced, that they understand the legal ramifications of this, that technically the deal is null and void, and in one burst of horse energy they leap over the buyer’s fence and come bounding in slow motion, as if in a shampoo commercial, up our driveway, toward me, kicking and snorting with glee, and I run toward them and we hug and live happily ever after. Together. As it was meant to be.</p>
        <p><em>5</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I get home I snap out of it. No, we did the right thing, selling Cricket and Sassy. They’re in a better place now. Cricket will be a brood mare. A mom!</p>
        <p><em>6</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; And Sassy, her friend, will be at her side. It’s better for them. Better for us. Cricket, a registered American saddlebred, is too much horse for novices like us. And Sassy is too short for an adult to ride. And we have another horse and mule that we do ride. So this really is the best thing for all concerned. And what did I tell myself ? Yes, some friendships are meant to end. That’s it. Never mind that Cricket was our love-horse, the horse that walked up our driveway on our wedding day. And Sassy was our love-mule, the mule that walked up our driveway beside her. They had flowers in their hair. Never mind! Because some friendships are just meant to end. And I am a mature person with a logical head who understands this.</p>
        <p><em>7</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; So I call Cricket and Sassy’s new owners. “The check bounced,” I say.</p>
        <p><em>8</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; “Oh, that’s our stupid bank,” the woman says. Then she gives me her bank’s stupid phone number, should I want to call for proof that her account is in good standing, which I don’t really, but I write the number down anyway. “Just resubmit the check, okay?” she says. I ask her how Cricket and Sassy are doing, and she says, “Great!” Nothing more. I wish she had said more.</p>
        <p><em>9</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Meantime, all this horse thinking gets my mind on Billy. Because not all fading friendships are meant to end. Billy is the neighbor who sold Cricket and Sassy to us. He’s the one who rode Sassy up the driveway on our wedding day, his feet dragging on the ground. Tom, his son, rode Cricket. They’re the ones who put the flowers in their hair. Billy and I used to see each other more. I don’t know why we’ve drifted. There never seems to be a real reason for friendships to fade. Friendships take work. Maybe that’s all there is to it.</p>
        <p><em>10&nbsp;</em>&nbsp; I call Billy just to say hi. He seems happy to hear from me. “We got a donkey!” he says. “She’s so goofy. You’d love her.” I tell him the news about Cricket and Sassy, and when I mention the buyers he seems concerned: “Did you happen to insist on a certified check?”</p>
        <p><em>11&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Oh.</p>
        <p><em>12&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Sure enough, a few days later, I’m at the mailbox. “Insufficient funds.” I can’t believe it. What do they think, I’m an idiot or something? I stomp into the house. What about that bank phone number? I’ll call that bank, I’ll get to the bottom of this. What did I do with that number? I must have thrown it out. I start picking through the trash.</p>
        <p><em>13&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Here it is! But the paper is wet and the number is blurred.</p>
        <p><em>14&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Isn’t that strange? I mean, is there a message here? It’s hard not to think of disappearing ink as a message from above. I start getting shampoo commercials in my head again. Oh, dear.</p>
        <p><em>15&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Why am I putting myself through all of this? Why can’t I just admit that I made a mistake? Not just the part about selling my beloved pets to, well, some questionable buyers. But selling them at all. And, anyway, why can’t we breed Cricket? A lot of work, perhaps. But wouldn’t that be an amazing experience?</p>
        <p><em>16&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>I imagine Cricket back in our barn. I imagine brushing her, telling her everything I’ve learned. “Well, Cricket, friendships take work,” I’ll say. “That’s all there is to it.”</p>
        <p><em>17&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>So I call the woman, sound very businesslike. “The check bounced again,” I say calmly. “The deal is off.” Strangely, she doesn’t sound surprised. I get the distinct sense she and her husband have been through this before.</p>
        <p><em>18&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>I call Billy. “Would you be able to go pick up Cricket and Sassy in your horse trailer and bring them back home?” I ask. He says of course. No questions asked. And I think that’s what friends are for. And I say yeah, I’d love to stop over and meet his new donkey.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em>1</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; The check bounced. “Insufficient funds,” says the little note attached. Well, I’m sure it’s just a mistake. Probably the people didn’t make a transfer in time or something. “No big deal,” I keep saying to myself, standing at the mailbox.</p>
        <p><em>2</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the check bounced! Isn’t that strange? I mean, is there a message here? The check was payment to us for the sale of Cricket, our ex-horse, and Sassy, our ex-mule. A sale, truth be told, I’ve been regretting. And now the check has bounced. Is it a sign?</p>
        <p><em>3</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; No, of course not. Probably just a clerical error.</p>
        <p><em>4</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, as I take the long walk back home, I get a picture in my head. I imagine that somehow Cricket and Sassy understand that the check bounced, that they understand the legal ramifications of this, that technically the deal is null and void, and in one burst of horse energy they leap over the buyer’s fence and come bounding in slow motion, as if in a shampoo commercial, up our driveway, toward me, kicking and snorting with glee, and I run toward them and we hug and live happily ever after. Together. As it was meant to be.</p>
        <p><em>5</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I get home I snap out of it. No, we did the right thing, selling Cricket and Sassy. They’re in a better place now. Cricket will be a brood mare. A mom!</p>
        <p><em>6</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; And Sassy, her friend, will be at her side. It’s better for them. Better for us. Cricket, a registered American saddlebred, is too much horse for novices like us. And Sassy is too short for an adult to ride. And we have another horse and mule that we do ride. So this really is the best thing for all concerned. And what did I tell myself ? Yes, some friendships are meant to end. That’s it. Never mind that Cricket was our love-horse, the horse that walked up our driveway on our wedding day. And Sassy was our love-mule, the mule that walked up our driveway beside her. They had flowers in their hair. Never mind! Because some friendships are just meant to end. And I am a mature person with a logical head who understands this.</p>
        <p><em>7</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; So I call Cricket and Sassy’s new owners. “The check bounced,” I say.</p>
        <p><em>8</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; “Oh, that’s our stupid bank,” the woman says. Then she gives me her bank’s stupid phone number, should I want to call for proof that her account is in good standing, which I don’t really, but I write the number down anyway. “Just resubmit the check, okay?” she says. I ask her how Cricket and Sassy are doing, and she says, “Great!” Nothing more. I wish she had said more.</p>
        <p><em>9</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Meantime, all this horse thinking gets my mind on Billy. Because not all fading friendships are meant to end. Billy is the neighbor who sold Cricket and Sassy to us. He’s the one who rode Sassy up the driveway on our wedding day, his feet dragging on the ground. Tom, his son, rode Cricket. They’re the ones who put the flowers in their hair. Billy and I used to see each other more. I don’t know why we’ve drifted. There never seems to be a real reason for friendships to fade. Friendships take work. Maybe that’s all there is to it.</p>
        <p><em>10&nbsp;</em>&nbsp; I call Billy just to say hi. He seems happy to hear from me. “We got a donkey!” he says. “She’s so goofy. You’d love her.” I tell him the news about Cricket and Sassy, and when I mention the buyers he seems concerned: “Did you happen to insist on a certified check?”</p>
        <p><em>11&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Oh.</p>
        <p><em>12&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Sure enough, a few days later, I’m at the mailbox. “Insufficient funds.” I can’t believe it. What do they think, I’m an idiot or something? I stomp into the house. What about that bank phone number? I’ll call that bank, I’ll get to the bottom of this. What did I do with that number? I must have thrown it out. I start picking through the trash.</p>
        <p><em>13&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Here it is! But the paper is wet and the number is blurred.</p>
        <p><em>14&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Isn’t that strange? I mean, is there a message here? It’s hard not to think of disappearing ink as a message from above. I start getting shampoo commercials in my head again. Oh, dear.</p>
        <p><em>15&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Why am I putting myself through all of this? Why can’t I just admit that I made a mistake? Not just the part about selling my beloved pets to, well, some questionable buyers. But selling them at all. And, anyway, why can’t we breed Cricket? A lot of work, perhaps. But wouldn’t that be an amazing experience?</p>
        <p><em>16&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>I imagine Cricket back in our barn. I imagine brushing her, telling her everything I’ve learned. “Well, Cricket, friendships take work,” I’ll say. “That’s all there is to it.”</p>
        <p><em>17&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>So I call the woman, sound very businesslike. “The check bounced again,” I say calmly. “The deal is off.” Strangely, she doesn’t sound surprised. I get the distinct sense she and her husband have been through this before.</p>
        <p><em>18&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>I call Billy. “Would you be able to go pick up Cricket and Sassy in your horse trailer and bring them back home?” I ask. He says of course. No questions asked. And I think that’s what friends are for. And I say yeah, I’d love to stop over and meet his new donkey.</p>

          <strong>Text One: How does an X-ray machine work? Answered by Discovery Channel</strong>
        </p>
        <p>The main components of an X-ray machine is a vacuum tube with a cathode, or filament, and an anode, which is typically made of tungsten. Electric current passes through the filament, bringing it up to an extremely high temperature. Once it reaches a certain level of energy, the filament begins emitting negatively charged electrons from its surface. The positively charged tungsten anode attracts these electrons with great force, drawing them through the vacuum tube at a high speed. When an electron collides with a tungsten atom, an electron in one of the atom’s lower orbitals gets knocked away. An electron from a higher orbital takes the place of the dislodged electron, releasing energy as an X-ray photon during its descent. The X-ray machine is encased in thick, protective lead shielding, which prevents these X-ray photons from escaping. A small window in the shield allows some X-ray photons to exit as a narrow beam is directed toward the patient. When X-rays hit the patient’s body, some pass through and some are blocked. Typically, bone blocks the X-rays, while soft tissue allows them to proceed. An X-ray camera captures the X-rays that pass through the patient, forming an image on a piece of film.</p>
        <p>This standard procedure creates excellent images of bone matter and other hard solids, allowing doctors to diagnose broken bones, foreign bodies and other conditions. However, most soft body tissues aren’t very clear in X-ray pictures. A doctor who needs to examine an organ or blood vessel must introduce special liquids called contrast media into the body. These liquids absorb Xrays better than the surrounding tissues. To focus on digestive and endocrine organs, for instance, the patient must swallow a contrast media - usually a barium compound. To focus on blood vessels, doctors inject the contrast media directly into the bloodstream. Doctors frequently use contrast media in fluoroscopy, which is when a live X-ray image is used for tracing the movement of contrast media within the body.</p>

          <strong>Text One: How does an X-ray machine work? Answered by Discovery Channel</strong>
        </p>
        <p>The main components of an X-ray machine is a vacuum tube with a cathode, or filament, and an anode, which is typically made of tungsten. Electric current passes through the filament, bringing it up to an extremely high temperature. Once it reaches a certain level of energy, the filament begins emitting negatively charged electrons from its surface. The positively charged tungsten anode attracts these electrons with great force, drawing them through the vacuum tube at a high speed. When an electron collides with a tungsten atom, an electron in one of the atom’s lower orbitals gets knocked away. An electron from a higher orbital takes the place of the dislodged electron, releasing energy as an X-ray photon during its descent. The X-ray machine is encased in thick, protective lead shielding, which prevents these X-ray photons from escaping. A small window in the shield allows some X-ray photons to exit as a narrow beam is directed toward the patient. When X-rays hit the patient’s body, some pass through and some are blocked. Typically, bone blocks the X-rays, while soft tissue allows them to proceed. An X-ray camera captures the X-rays that pass through the patient, forming an image on a piece of film.</p>
        <p>This standard procedure creates excellent images of bone matter and other hard solids, allowing doctors to diagnose broken bones, foreign bodies and other conditions. However, most soft body tissues aren’t very clear in X-ray pictures. A doctor who needs to examine an organ or blood vessel must introduce special liquids called contrast media into the body. These liquids absorb Xrays better than the surrounding tissues. To focus on digestive and endocrine organs, for instance, the patient must swallow a contrast media - usually a barium compound. To focus on blood vessels, doctors inject the contrast media directly into the bloodstream. Doctors frequently use contrast media in fluoroscopy, which is when a live X-ray image is used for tracing the movement of contrast media within the body.</p>

            <strong>Text Two:</strong>
          </em>
          <strong>How Planes Fly (adapted from Malcolm, Emjayem)</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Two primary principles contribute to the creation of lift, which is what makes flight possible. Those two principles are Bernoulli's Principle and Newton's Third Law. Let's break it down and look at each principle individually.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Bernoulli's Principle</strong>
        </p>
        <p>By definition, Bernoulli's Principle states:</p>
        <p>
          <strong>For an <span class="txt-underline">inviscid</span> flow, an increase in the speed of the fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>From a practical standpoint, this basically means that as a fluid (air, water, etc) moves faster, its internal pressure decreases.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But how does this help an airplane create lift? Picture an airplane's wing - but cut in half so we can see the shape of it (referred to as an <em>airfoil</em>). The top of the wing is more curved than that of the bottom of the wing. The reasoning behind this is that the increased curvature on top of the wing will take advantage of something called <strong>magnus </strong>effect. To explain the magnus effect, close your eyes and envision a baseball game. The pitcher can curve the direction of the ball's flight left, right, down, or even up if desired. But how? Magnus effect states that a rotating ball or cylinder moving through a fluid (air, water, etc) will create faster moving fluid in the direction of rotation, thus lowering pressure and "pulling" the ball or cylinder in that direction. This force is not created when the object is stationary, which is why a baseball pitcher puts a "spin" on the ball when he or she wants a curveball.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So back to our discussion on the wing. So we know the top of the wing is more curved than the bottom. Basically, the shaping of the wing "fools" the air around it into thinking it is a long rotation cylinder, and forces the air to travel faster over the top of the wing than that of the bottom. And according to Bernoulli's Principle, faster moving air = lower pressure. If we have lower pressure on top of the wing than we do on the bottom of the wing, we now have an inequality of pressures acting on the wing. There is more pressure pushing up on the bottom of the wing than there is on the top pushing down, which means we now have a total net force pushing UP. And voila... we have LIFT.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With real airplanes and airplane models, Bernoulli's Principle (related to the curvature of the wing) and the magnus effect have very little to do with "flying". If what the author says were true - real airplanes could not fly upside down.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Almost all of the lift created on the underside of a wing is created as (A) the underside of the wing is blasted by the air rushing past the wing -- because the airplane engine is pulling the airplane very fast through the air and (B) the plane's geometrical configuration is holding the wing at an angle such that the front edge of the wing is a little higher in the direction of flight than the back edge of the wing. A &amp; B, together mean the air pressure on the bottom of the wing is higher than the pressure on the top of the wing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Large gliders, in general, can't fly upside down because they do not have engines. They get lift from surrounding air currents which force the plane upward by either (a) rising warm air -- called "thermals" or (b) air that is being directed upward by a hill. Gliders can take off at one height and land at a higher elevation if they are near thermals and air moving over hills or mountains.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Newton's 3rd Law</strong>
        </p>
        <p>This one is much less complicated than Bernoulli's Principle.</p>
        <p>Newton's 3rd Law is defined as: <strong>To every action there is always an equal and opposite reaction.</strong></p>
        <p>Airplane wings are fixed onto the airframe of the plane at a slight angle. It may not be easy to see for the untrained eye, but upon a close examination of an wing's attachment point to the body of a plane, one will see a slight angle.</p>
        <p>This angle creates a deflection of air downward. As air hits the underside of the wing, even in straightand- level cruise flight, it is forced downward. And according to Newton's 3rd Law, the forcing of the air downward causes an equal and opposite upward force on the wing, thus contributing to the creation of lift.</p>
        <p>As air is hitting the airframe and control surfaces of the plane, it is being forced downward at a great rate, creating an opposing force - LIFT - in the opposite direction.</p>

            <strong>Text Two:</strong>
          </em>
          <strong>How Planes Fly (adapted from Malcolm, Emjayem)</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Two primary principles contribute to the creation of lift, which is what makes flight possible. Those two principles are Bernoulli's Principle and Newton's Third Law. Let's break it down and look at each principle individually.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Bernoulli's Principle</strong>
        </p>
        <p>By definition, Bernoulli's Principle states:</p>
        <p>
          <strong>For an <span class="txt-underline">inviscid</span> flow, an increase in the speed of the fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>From a practical standpoint, this basically means that as a fluid (air, water, etc) moves faster, its internal pressure decreases.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But how does this help an airplane create lift? Picture an airplane's wing - but cut in half so we can see the shape of it (referred to as an <em>airfoil</em>). The top of the wing is more curved than that of the bottom of the wing. The reasoning behind this is that the increased curvature on top of the wing will take advantage of something called <strong>magnus </strong>effect. To explain the magnus effect, close your eyes and envision a baseball game. The pitcher can curve the direction of the ball's flight left, right, down, or even up if desired. But how? Magnus effect states that a rotating ball or cylinder moving through a fluid (air, water, etc) will create faster moving fluid in the direction of rotation, thus lowering pressure and "pulling" the ball or cylinder in that direction. This force is not created when the object is stationary, which is why a baseball pitcher puts a "spin" on the ball when he or she wants a curveball.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So back to our discussion on the wing. So we know the top of the wing is more curved than the bottom. Basically, the shaping of the wing "fools" the air around it into thinking it is a long rotation cylinder, and forces the air to travel faster over the top of the wing than that of the bottom. And according to Bernoulli's Principle, faster moving air = lower pressure. If we have lower pressure on top of the wing than we do on the bottom of the wing, we now have an inequality of pressures acting on the wing. There is more pressure pushing up on the bottom of the wing than there is on the top pushing down, which means we now have a total net force pushing UP. And voila... we have LIFT.</p>

A &amp; B, together mean the air pressure on the bottom of the wing is higher than the pressure on the top of the wing.</p>
