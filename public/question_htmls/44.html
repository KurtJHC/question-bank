</p><p>Doris Lessing, author of The Golden Notebook and this year's&nbsp;winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature,&nbsp;had her Nobel lecture delivered in Stockholm on 7 December. Entitled&nbsp;"On Not Winning the Nobel Prize", Ms Lessing's singular voice comes through&nbsp;in her observations on how we read, and why we should.</p><p><span class="txt-underline"><strong>ON NOT WINNING THE NOBEL PRIZE</strong></span></p><p>I am standing in a doorway looking through clouds of blowing dust to where I am told there is still uncut forest. Yesterday I drove through miles of stumps, and charred remains of fires where, in ‘56, there was the most wonderful forest I have ever seen, all now destroyed. People have to eat. They have to get fuel for fires.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
This is north-west Zimbabwe in the early eighties, and I am visiting a friend who was a teacher in a school in London. He is here “to help Africa”, as we put it. He is a gently <strong>idealistic</strong> soul and what he found in this school shocked him into a depression, from which it was hard to recover. This school is like every other built after Independence. It consists of four large brick rooms side by side, put straight into the dust, one two three four, with a half room at one end, which is&nbsp;

<p>the library. In these classrooms are blackboards, but my friend keeps the chalks in his pocket, as otherwise they would be stolen. There is no atlas or globe in the school, no textbooks, no exercise books, or biros. In the library there are no books of the kind the pupils would like to read, but only <strong>tomes</strong> from American universities, hard even to lift, rejects from white libraries, detective stories, or novels with titles like<em> Weekend in Paris and Felicity Finds Love</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is a goat trying to find sustenance in some aged grass. The headmaster has <strong>embezzled</strong> the school funds and is suspended, arousing the question familiar to all of us but usually in more <strong>august</strong> contexts: How is it these people behave like this when they must know everyone is watching them?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>My friend doesn’t have any money because everyone, pupils and teachers, borrow from him when he is paid and will probably never pay him back. The pupils range from six to twenty-six, because some who did not get schooling as children are here to make it up. Some pupils walk many miles every morning, rain or shine and across rivers. They cannot do homework because there is no electricity in the villages, and you can’t study easily by the light of a burning log. The girls have to fetch water and cook before they set off for school and when they get back.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As I sit with my friend in his room, people drop in shyly, and everyone begs for books. “Please send us books when you get back to London,” one man says. “They taught us to read but we have no books.” Everybody I met, everyone, begged for books.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was there some days. The dust blew. The pumps had broken and the women were having to fetch water from the river. Another idealistic teacher from England was rather ill after seeing what this “school” was like.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the last day they slaughtered the goat. They cut it into bits and cooked it in a great tin. This was the much anticipated end-of-term feast: boiled goat and porridge. I drove away while it was still going on, back through the charred remains and stumps of the forest.</p>

<p>I do not think many of the pupils of this school will get prizes.</p>

This is north-west Zimbabwe in the early eighties, and I am visiting a friend who was a teacher in a school in London. He is here “to help Africa”, as we put it. He is a gently <strong>idealistic</strong> soul and what he found in this school shocked him into a depression, from which it was hard to recover. This school is like every other built after Independence. It consists of four large brick rooms side by side, put straight into the dust, one two three four, with a half room at one end, which is&nbsp;

<p>the library. In these classrooms are blackboards, but my friend keeps the chalks in his pocket, as otherwise they would be stolen. There is no atlas or globe in the school, no textbooks, no exercise books, or biros. In the library there are no books of the kind the pupils would like to read, but only <strong>tomes</strong> from American universities, hard even to lift, rejects from white libraries, detective stories, or novels with titles like<em> Weekend in Paris and Felicity Finds Love</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is a goat trying to find sustenance in some aged grass. The headmaster has <strong>embezzled</strong> the school funds and is suspended, arousing the question familiar to all of us but usually in more <strong>august</strong> contexts: How is it these people behave like this when they must know everyone is watching them?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>My friend doesn’t have any money because everyone, pupils and teachers, borrow from him when he is paid and will probably never pay him back. The pupils range from six to twenty-six, because some who did not get schooling as children are here to make it up. Some pupils walk many miles every morning, rain or shine and across rivers. They cannot do homework because there is no electricity in the villages, and you can’t study easily by the light of a burning log. The girls have to fetch water and cook before they set off for school and when they get back.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As I sit with my friend in his room, people drop in shyly, and everyone begs for books. “Please send us books when you get back to London,” one man says. “They taught us to read but we have no books.” Everybody I met, everyone, begged for books.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was there some days. The dust blew. The pumps had broken and the women were having to fetch water from the river. Another idealistic teacher from England was rather ill after seeing what this “school” was like.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the last day they slaughtered the goat. They cut it into bits and cooked it in a great tin. This was the much anticipated end-of-term feast: boiled goat and porridge. I drove away while it was still going on, back through the charred remains and stumps of the forest.</p>

<p>I do not think many of the pupils of this school will get prizes.</p>

          <strong>Being Bee</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Catherine Bateson</em><br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>Review One</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was informative and had a writing style that I really liked. It was based on a young girl named Beatrice (or Bee for short) whose mother died when she was young. For years she had been living with her father and had a happy life. But when her father gets a girlfriend, Jazzi, everything changes. Bee feels left out and very pushed around. Bee tries her best to get along with Jazzi but has big difficulties. Her father asks her to be as nice as she can but Bee just cannot deal with Jazzi. So Bee writes a letter to her guinea pigs and mysteriously the guinea pigs reply. Bee uses her guinea pigs as someone to talk to and someone to help her with her problems.</p>
        <p>When Jazzi picks Bee up from school Bee’s feelings towards Jazzi change. Jazzi tells Bee that she has an autistic brother called Harley. Jazzi always visits Harley at least once a week and she is a bit embarrassed by him, but from the moment that Bee meets Harley he likes her. Jazzi and Bee start to warm to each other and become friends and when Jazzi is allowed to have the spare bedroom as a craft room she clears it out with permission from Bee’s dad. However Jazzi didn’t notice that there was a box of Bee’s things from when Bee’s mother was alive. Bee gets very upset and then runs away, and then things get complicated.</p>
        <p>This book is very detailed and I would recommend it for anyone aged 12. It was very interesting.</p>

            <strong>Review Two</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>Being Bee is the sad story of a young girl whose mother died and since it has been just her and her father, when Jazzi came along it sends her world upside down. Abandoned by her few friends, Bee only has one person to turn to, her nanna and her two guinea-pigs; even her dad is too distant to reach.</p>
        <p>But through the love of guinea-pigs and some new friends Bee adjusts to her new life and her new step-mum seems to be better then she thought…</p>
        <p>This book has a few heart-wrenching moments and tear-jerking scenes. It really is a good read. Follow through Bee’s life and see what happens and how things make sense to her. I’d definitely recommend this book and I’d say it’s best for females but maybe boys too- for ages 10 to 15. I’d give this 3 and a half out of 5.</p>
        <p>I enjoyed reading this book. It was definitely enjoyable and I think you should read it if you like the sound of it.</p>

Jazzi and Bee start to warm to each other and become friends and when Jazzi is allowed to have the spare bedroom as a craft room she clears it out with permission from Bee’s dad. However Jazzi didn’t notice that there was a box of Bee’s things from when Bee’s mother was alive. Bee gets very upset and then runs away, and then things get complicated.</p>
        <p>This book is very detailed and I would recommend it for anyone aged 12. It was very interesting.</p>

        <p>Being Bee is the sad story of a young girl whose mother died and since it has been just her and her father, when Jazzi came along it sends her world upside down. Abandoned by her few friends, Bee only has one person to turn to, her nanna and her two guinea-pigs; even her dad is too distant to reach.</p>
        <p>But through the love of guinea-pigs and some new friends Bee adjusts to her new life and her new step-mum seems to be better then she thought…</p>
        <p>This book has a few heart-wrenching moments and tear-jerking scenes. It really is a good read. Follow through Bee’s life and see what happens and how things make sense to her. I’d definitely recommend this book and I’d say it’s best for females but maybe boys too- for ages 10 to 15. I’d give this 3 and a half out of 5.</p>
        <p>I enjoyed reading this book. It was definitely enjoyable and I think you should read it if you like the sound of it.</p>

        <p>I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was informative and had a writing style that I really liked. It was based on a young girl named Beatrice (or Bee for short) whose mother died when she was young. For years she had been living with her father and had a happy life. But when her father gets a girlfriend, Jazzi, everything changes. Bee feels left out and very pushed around. Bee tries her best to get along with Jazzi but has big difficulties. Her father asks her to be as nice as she can but Bee just cannot deal with Jazzi. So Bee writes a letter to her guinea pigs and mysteriously the guinea pigs reply. Bee uses her guinea pigs as someone to talk to and someone to help her with her problems.</p>
        <p>When Jazzi picks Bee up from school Bee’s feelings towards Jazzi change. Jazzi tells Bee that she has an autistic brother called Harley. Jazzi always visits Harley at least once a week and she is a bit embarrassed by him, but from the moment that Bee meets Harley he likes her. Jazzi and Bee start to warm to each other and become friends and when Jazzi is allowed to have the spare bedroom as a craft room she clears it out with permission from Bee’s dad. However Jazzi didn’t notice that there was a box of Bee’s things from when Bee’s mother was alive. Bee gets very upset and then runs away, and then things get complicated.</p>
        <p>This book is very detailed and I would recommend it for anyone aged 12. It was very interesting.</p>

          <strong>Being Bee</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Catherine Bateson</em><br>

            <strong>Review One</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was informative and had a writing style that I really liked. It was based on a young girl named Beatrice (or Bee for short) whose mother died when she was young. For years she had been living with her father and had a happy life. But when her father gets a girlfriend, Jazzi, everything changes. Bee feels left out and very pushed around. Bee tries her best to get along with Jazzi but has big difficulties. Her father asks her to be as nice as she can but Bee just cannot deal with Jazzi. So Bee writes a letter to her guinea pigs and mysteriously the guinea pigs reply. Bee uses her guinea pigs as someone to talk to and someone to help her with her problems.</p>
        <p>When Jazzi picks Bee up from school Bee’s feelings towards Jazzi change. Jazzi tells Bee that she has an autistic brother called Harley. Jazzi always visits Harley at least once a week and she is a bit embarrassed by him, but from the moment that Bee meets Harley he likes her. Jazzi and Bee start to warm to each other and become friends and when Jazzi is allowed to have the spare bedroom as a craft room she clears it out with permission from Bee’s dad. However Jazzi didn’t notice that there was a box of Bee’s things from when Bee’s mother was alive. Bee gets very upset and then runs away, and then things get complicated.</p>
        <p>This book is very detailed and I would recommend it for anyone aged 12. It was very interesting.</p>

            <strong>Review Two</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>Being Bee is the sad story of a young girl whose mother died and since it has been just her and her father, when Jazzi came along it sends her world upside down. Abandoned by her few friends, Bee only has one person to turn to, her nanna and her two guinea-pigs; even her dad is too distant to reach.</p>
        <p>But through the love of guinea-pigs and some new friends Bee adjusts to her new life and her new step-mum seems to be better then she thought…</p>
        <p>This book has a few heart-wrenching moments and tear-jerking scenes. It really is a good read. Follow through Bee’s life and see what happens and how things make sense to her. I’d definitely recommend this book and I’d say it’s best for females but maybe boys too- for ages 10 to 15. I’d give this 3 and a half out of 5.</p>
        <p>I enjoyed reading this book. It was definitely enjoyable and I think you should read it if you like the sound of it.</p>

          <strong>The Hidden Monastery</strong>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>Bubble of Life</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>A shiny black orb, bigger than a pea, slipped through a hole in the sky. A tiny bubble of life – a star seed. Who knows where it came from?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The little creature inside the orb had been sleeping comfortably, his nose buried under his tail, humming to the purr of his own heartbeat. Pat di pat, pat di pat, pat di pat. It was a song he knew well. But now the soft outer shell felt tight against his skin. As if he didn't belong inside it any more. He wriggled his body and arched his back.</p>
        <p>Peng . . . Peng . . . <strong>The soothing voice of the wind sang his name, vibrating the membrane like a drum</strong>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The creature stopped wriggling. <strong>His eyes shone like green emeralds.</strong></p>
        <p>It is time, the wind sang. Reach out to me.</p>
        <p>Peng obeyed, extending his two front legs as far as they could go. Little by little, the membrane began to stretch and stretch until it was almost invisible. Then, with a small flick of his claws, he pierced the outer shell. The orb split in two.</p>
        <p>As a sudden rush of cool air washed over Peng's body, he felt a wondrous sense of freedom. But this feeling lasted only a few seconds, for then he began to fall. Peng tumbled over and over. The sky and sea became one spinning whirl around him. In desperation, he kicked his legs and flapped his tail. But he was still too young to fly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Soaring high above, <strong>the keen eyes of a hawk</strong> spotted the small creature falling through the sky. She had never seen anything like it in her territory before. But she could sense the flesh on its bones. A tasty treat for my two young'uns, she thought.</p>
        <p>The hawk set Peng in her sights and sped towards him, her tawny wings outstretched, her tail feathers spread like a fan behind her. Closer and closer she came. Steady. . . steady. . . the talons of one foot flexed, ready to catch the creature in mid-flight.</p>
        <p>But Peng had seen the menacing shadow pass overhead. Instinctively he thrashed his legs and lashed out with his tail. The lacy mane that ran down his back lifted, and for a moment he began to fly. The hawk missed her mark, talons closing around thin air. She tried again, hovering, adjusting her position, focussing her vision. But the wind was also watching. With invisible fingers, it lifted Peng high on its shoulders. The hawk could only watch as the little creature was carried far away on an upward spiral of wind.</p>

        </p>
        <p>A shiny black orb, bigger than a pea, slipped through a hole in the sky. A tiny bubble of life – a star seed. Who knows where it came from?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The little creature inside the orb had been sleeping comfortably, his nose buried under his tail, humming to the purr of his own heartbeat. Pat di pat, pat di pat, pat di pat. It was a song he knew well. But now the soft outer shell felt tight against his skin. As if he didn't belong inside it any more. He wriggled his body and arched his back.</p>
        <p>Peng . . . Peng . . . <strong>The soothing voice of the wind sang his name, vibrating the membrane like a drum</strong>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The creature stopped wriggling. <strong>His eyes shone like green emeralds.</strong></p>

          <strong>The Hidden Monastery</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Brielle Wang</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>Bubble of Life</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>A shiny black orb, bigger than a pea, slipped through a hole in the sky. A tiny bubble of life – a star seed. Who knows where it came from?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The little creature inside the orb had been sleeping comfortably, his nose buried under his tail, humming to the purr of his own heartbeat. Pat di pat, pat di pat, pat di pat. It was a song he knew well. But now the soft outer shell felt tight against his skin. As if he didn't belong inside it any more. He wriggled his body and arched his back.</p>
        <p>Peng . . . Peng . . . <strong>The soothing voice of the wind sang his name, vibrating the membrane like a drum</strong>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The creature stopped wriggling. <strong>His eyes shone like green emeralds.</strong></p>
        <p>It is time, the wind sang. Reach out to me.</p>
        <p>Peng obeyed, extending his two front legs as far as they could go. Little by little, the membrane began to stretch and stretch until it was almost invisible. Then, with a small flick of his claws, he pierced the outer shell. The orb split in two.</p>
        <p>As a sudden rush of cool air washed over Peng's body, he felt a wondrous sense of freedom. But this feeling lasted only a few seconds, for then he began to fall. Peng tumbled over and over. The sky and sea became one spinning whirl around him. In desperation, he kicked his legs and flapped his tail. But he was still too young to fly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Soaring high above, <strong>the keen eyes of a hawk</strong> spotted the small creature falling through the sky. She had never seen anything like it in her territory before. But she could sense the flesh on its bones. A tasty treat for my two young'uns, she thought.</p>
        <p>The hawk set Peng in her sights and sped towards him, her tawny wings outstretched, her tail feathers spread like a fan behind her. Closer and closer she came. Steady. . . steady. . . the talons of one foot flexed, ready to catch the creature in mid-flight.</p>
        <p>But Peng had seen the menacing shadow pass overhead. Instinctively he thrashed his legs and lashed out with his tail. The lacy mane that ran down his back lifted, and for a moment he began to fly. The hawk missed her mark, talons closing around thin air. She tried again, hovering, adjusting her position, focussing her vision. But the wind was also watching. With invisible fingers, it lifted Peng high on its shoulders. The hawk could only watch as the little creature was carried far away on an upward spiral of wind.</p>

        <p>A shiny black orb, bigger than a pea, slipped through a hole in the sky. A tiny bubble of life – a star seed. Who knows where it came from?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The little creature inside the orb had been sleeping comfortably, his nose buried under his tail, humming to the purr of his own heartbeat. Pat di pat, pat di pat, pat di pat. It was a song he knew well. But now the soft outer shell felt tight against his skin. As if he didn't belong inside it any more. He wriggled his body and arched his back.</p>
        <p>Peng . . . Peng . . . <strong>The soothing voice of the wind sang his name, vibrating the membrane like a drum</strong>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The creature stopped wriggling. <strong>His eyes shone like green emeralds.</strong></p>
        <p>It is time, the wind sang. Reach out to me.</p>
        <p>Peng obeyed, extending his two front legs as far as they could go. Little by little, the membrane began to stretch and stretch until it was almost invisible. Then, with a small flick of his claws, he pierced the outer shell. The orb split in two.</p>
        <p>As a sudden rush of cool air washed over Peng's body, he felt a wondrous sense of freedom. But this feeling lasted only a few seconds, for then he began to fall. Peng tumbled over and over. The sky and sea became one spinning whirl around him. In desperation, he kicked his legs and flapped his tail. But he was still too young to fly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Soaring high above, <strong>the keen eyes of a hawk</strong> spotted the small creature falling through the sky. She had never seen anything like it in her territory before. But she could sense the flesh on its bones. A tasty treat for my two young'uns, she thought.</p>
        <p>The hawk set Peng in her sights and sped towards him, her tawny wings outstretched, her tail feathers spread like a fan behind her. Closer and closer she came. Steady. . . steady. . . the talons of one foot flexed, ready to catch the creature in mid-flight.</p>
        <p>But Peng had seen the menacing shadow pass overhead. Instinctively he thrashed his legs and lashed out with his tail. The lacy mane that ran down his back lifted, and for a moment he began to fly. The hawk missed her mark, talons closing around thin air. She tried again, hovering, adjusting her position, focussing her vision. But the wind was also watching. With invisible fingers, it lifted Peng high on its shoulders. The hawk could only watch as the little creature was carried far away on an upward spiral of wind.</p>

It’s somewhere near the town of Angelus, a place that will be familiar to readers of his 2005 short-story collection, The Turning, and his 1984 novel, Shallows.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It’s where two boys, Pikelet and Loonie, bond over the art of holding one’s breath underwater.</p><p>The boys surf ‘to fool death’, but their passion is about more than a simply physical thrill. In Sawyer, adults do ‘solid, practical things ... there wasn’t much room for beauty in the lives of our men’.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Winton’s previous book, the 2002 Booker short-listed Dirt Music, was a long, sprawling work. Breath is a much slimmer, rather conventionally structured novel. Where Dirt Music ended optimistically with a sharing of oxygen, a ‘kiss of life’, the characters in this novel seek to assert control over their physical selves by withholding breath. Their rebellion against ‘the monotony of drawing breath’ derives from some sort of elemental rage against the indignity of man’s ‘endless capitulation to biological routine’.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
Breath does allow for the possibility of healing. The human body might be limiting, but it is also capable of a redemptive beauty. For Pikelet, this beauty, which he finds in the aesthetics of surfing, is something potentially meaningful but quite unrelated to death. It is ‘the outlaw feeling of doing something graceful, as if dancing on water was the best and bravest thing a man could do’. It may save him. With Breath, Winton has written an absorbing, powerful and deeply beautiful novel, a meditation on surfing which becomes a rumination about the very stuff of existence.</div>

It’s somewhere near the town of Angelus, a place that will be familiar to readers of his 2005 short-story collection, The Turning, and his 1984 novel, Shallows.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It’s where two boys, Pikelet and Loonie, bond over the art of holding one’s breath underwater.</p><p>The boys surf ‘to fool death’, but their passion is about more than a simply physical thrill. In Sawyer, adults do ‘solid, practical things ... there wasn’t much room for beauty in the lives of our men’.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Winton’s previous book, the 2002 Booker short-listed Dirt Music, was a long, sprawling work. Breath is a much slimmer, rather conventionally structured novel. Where Dirt Music ended optimistically with a sharing of oxygen, a ‘kiss of life’, the characters in this novel seek to assert control over their physical selves by withholding breath. Their rebellion against ‘the monotony of drawing breath’ derives from some sort of elemental rage against the indignity of man’s ‘endless capitulation to biological routine’.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
Breath does allow for the possibility of healing. The human body might be limiting, but it is also capable of a redemptive beauty. For Pikelet, this beauty, which he finds in the aesthetics of surfing, is something potentially meaningful but quite unrelated to death. It is ‘the outlaw feeling of doing something graceful, as if dancing on water was the best and bravest thing a man could do’. It may save him. With Breath, Winton has written an absorbing, powerful and deeply beautiful novel, a meditation on surfing which becomes a rumination about the very stuff of existence.</div>

It’s somewhere near the town of Angelus, a place that will be familiar to readers of his 2005 short-story collection, The Turning, and his 1984 novel, Shallows.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It’s where two boys, Pikelet and Loonie, bond over the art of holding one’s breath underwater.</p><p>The boys surf ‘to fool death’, but their passion is about more than a simply physical thrill. In Sawyer, adults do ‘solid, practical things ... there wasn’t much room for beauty in the lives of our men’.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Winton’s previous book, the 2002 Booker short-listed Dirt Music, was a long, sprawling work. Breath is a much slimmer, rather conventionally structured novel. Where Dirt Music ended optimistically with a sharing of oxygen, a ‘kiss of life’, the characters in this novel seek to assert control over their physical selves by withholding breath. Their rebellion against ‘the monotony of drawing breath’ derives from some sort of elemental rage against the indignity of man’s ‘endless capitulation to biological routine’.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
Breath does allow for the possibility of healing. The human body might be limiting, but it is also capable of a redemptive beauty. For Pikelet, this beauty, which he finds in the aesthetics of surfing, is something potentially meaningful but quite unrelated to death. It is ‘the outlaw feeling of doing something graceful, as if dancing on water was the best and bravest thing a man could do’. It may save him. With Breath, Winton has written an absorbing, powerful and deeply beautiful novel, a meditation on surfing which becomes a rumination about the very stuff of existence.</div>
