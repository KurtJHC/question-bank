His eyes, so long accustomed to the dimness, squinted against the bright sunlight that poured into the clearing from the open sky above. The roof of vines had been torn through,</p>
        <p>and leaves and stems still pattered down like rain. Where he and Gorl had stood together only minutes before lay the reason for the damage—a great fallen branch. And beneath the branch was a mass of crushed golden armour.</p>
        <p>Lief stared, unable to believe what had happened so suddenly. The Belt grew hot against his skin. He looked down and saw Gorl's sword, lying right in front of him. Almost absent-mindedly, he picked it up. The topaz in the hilt shone clear gold. So, he thought dreamily, the first gem to be found was the topaz—the symbol of faithfulness.</p>
        <p>Suddenly his mind cleared. His eyes searched for, and then found, the still, pale figure of Barda, lying at the edge of the clearing. He jumped up and ran to him, kneeling down beside him, calling his name.</p>
        <p>Barda did not stir. He still breathed, but very weakly. The terrible wound in his chest was still bleeding. Lief opened the jacket and shirt, tried to clean the wound, tried to stop the</p>
        <p>blood with his cloak. He had to do something. But he knew it was useless. It was too late.</p>
        <p>He barely looked up as Jasmine leapt lightly down beside him. "Barda is dying," he said drearily. There was a terrible pain in his chest. A terrible sense of loss and loneliness and</p>
        <p>waste.</p>
        <p>"Lief!" he heard Jasmine gasp. But still he did not move.</p>
        <p>"Lief! Look!"</p>
        <p>She was pulling at his arm. Reluctantly he raised his head.</p>
        <p>Jasmine was staring at the center of the clearing. Her face was filled with awe. Lief spun around to see what she was looking at.</p>
        <p>The Lilies of Life were blooming. The golden arrows that were their buds had opened in the sunlight so long denied them. Now they were golden trumpets, their petals spread</p>
        <p>joyously, drinking in the light. And from the centre of the trumpets a rich gold nectar was welling, overflowing, pouring in a sweet-smelling stream down to the black mud.</p>
        <p>With a cry, Lief threw down the sword and leapt up. He ran to the patch of mud and thrust his cupped hands under the nectar flow. When they were full to the brim he ran back to Barda, pouring the nectar onto the wound in his chest, smearing what was left on his pale lips.</p>
        <p>"Barda!" Lief begged. "Come back! Come back!"</p>
        <p>The big man's eyelids fluttered. His eyes opened. They were dazed, as though he had been dreaming. "What is it?" he mumbled. As color began to steal back into his cheeks, his hand fumbled towards the wound on his chest. He licked his lips. "Hurts," he said.</p>
        <p>"Barda! You are well!" he shouted.</p>
        <p>"Of course I am!" With a grunt, Barda sat up, running his hands through his tangled hair. He stared around, astounded, but quite himself again. "What happened?" he demanded,</p>
        <p>climbing to his feet. "Did I faint? Where is Gorl?"</p>
        <p>Lief pointed wordlessly at the crumpled armour beneath the fallen branch.</p>

He put his strong hand on Lief’s shoulder and turned to Jasmine. “I did not want Lief with me when we began — I confess it," he said cheerfully. "But if he had stayed at home, as</p>
        <p>I wished, I would by now be dead, and the quest lost. I will not make the mistake a second time. If Fate has decreed that we are to be three, so be it."</p>
        <p>The Belt burned around Lief's waist. He unfastened it, laying it on the ground before him. He crouched over it and fitted the topaz into the first medallion. It slid into place and glowed there, as pure and golden as the nectar of the Lilies of Life, as warm and golden as the sun.</p>
        <p>Jasmine stared curiously at the Belt. "There are seven medallions," she pointed out. "Six are still empty."</p>
        <p>"But one is filled," said Lief with satisfaction.</p>
        <p>"The longest journey begins with the first step," said Barda. "And the first step we have taken. Whatever the next may bring, we have cause to celebrate now."</p>
        <p>"I am going to celebrate by beginning to rid the trees of these accursed vines," Lief said, putting his hand to his sword.</p>
        <p>But Jasmine smiled. "There is no need," she said. "The word has spread that The Dark is no more."</p>
        <p>She pointed upward and, to his amazement, Lief saw that the vine-shrouded trees were thick with birds. He had not heard them because they were too busy to call or sing. They were gladly tearing at the vines with their beaks and claws, working furiously. And more birds were coming every moment—birds of every kind.</p>
        <p>"The beasts are on their way," Jasmine murmured. "The little gnawing creatures that like roots and stems. They will be here within the hour and they, too, will relish the vines. In a day or two the trees will be free."</p>
        <p>The three stood for a moment, watching the amazing scene above them. Already some branches were clear of vines.</p>
        <p>No longer bound and weighed down, they were stretching gladly towards the sky.</p>
        <p>"This must have been a beautiful place, once," Lief said softly.</p>
        <p>"And will be again," Jasmine murmured. "Because of you. It was fortunate that you came here."</p>
        <p>Barda grinned. "I must confess that for a while I doubted it," he said. "But all has ended well. Very well." He stretched his great arms wearily. "We should stay a day or two, I think.</p>
        <p>To rest, and eat, and watch the freeing of the trees."</p>
        <p>"And then?" Jasmine asked. "What then?"</p>
        <p>"And then," Barda said simply, "we will go on."</p>
        <p>Lief slowly clipped the Belt around his waist once more. His heart was very full. He felt wonder and a kind of triumph when he thought of what had just passed. He felt excitement, eagerness, and a thrill of fear at the thought of what was ahead.</p>
        <p>But most of all he felt relief, and a deep, deep happiness.</p>
        <p>The first gem had been found.</p>
        <p>The quest to save Deltora had truly begun.</p>

He put his strong hand on Lief’s shoulder and turned to Jasmine. “I did not want Lief with me when we began — I confess it," he said cheerfully. "But if he had stayed at home, as</p>
        <p>I wished, I would by now be dead, and the quest lost. I will not make the mistake a second time. If Fate has decreed that we are to be three, so be it."</p>
        <p>The Belt burned around Lief's waist. He unfastened it, laying it on the ground before him. He crouched over it and fitted the topaz into the first medallion. It slid into place and glowed there, as pure and golden as the nectar of the Lilies of Life, as warm and golden as the sun.</p>
        <p>Jasmine stared curiously at the Belt. "There are seven medallions," she pointed out. "Six are still empty."</p>
        <p>"But one is filled," said Lief with satisfaction.</p>
        <p>"The longest journey begins with the first step," said Barda. "And the first step we have taken. Whatever the next may bring, we have cause to celebrate now."</p>
        <p>"I am going to celebrate by beginning to rid the trees of these accursed vines," Lief said, putting his hand to his sword.</p>
        <p>But Jasmine smiled. "There is no need," she said. "The word has spread that The Dark is no more."</p>
        <p>She pointed upward and, to his amazement, Lief saw that the vine-shrouded trees were thick with birds. He had not heard them because they were too busy to call or sing. They were gladly tearing at the vines with their beaks and claws, working furiously. And more birds were coming every moment—birds of every kind.</p>
        <p>"The beasts are on their way," Jasmine murmured. "The little gnawing creatures that like roots and stems. They will be here within the hour and they, too, will relish the vines. In a day or two the trees will be free."</p>
        <p>The three stood for a moment, watching the amazing scene above them. Already some branches were clear of vines.</p>
        <p>No longer bound and weighed down, they were stretching gladly towards the sky.</p>
        <p>"This must have been a beautiful place, once," Lief said softly.</p>
        <p>"And will be again," Jasmine murmured. "Because of you. It was fortunate that you came here."</p>
        <p>Barda grinned. "I must confess that for a while I doubted it," he said. "But all has ended well. Very well." He stretched his great arms wearily. "We should stay a day or two, I think.</p>
        <p>To rest, and eat, and watch the freeing of the trees."</p>
        <p>"And then?" Jasmine asked. "What then?"</p>
        <p>"And then," Barda said simply, "we will go on."</p>
        <p>Lief slowly clipped the Belt around his waist once more. His heart was very full. He felt wonder and a kind of triumph when he thought of what had just passed. He felt excitement, eagerness, and a thrill of fear at the thought of what was ahead.</p>

He put his strong hand on Lief’s shoulder and turned to Jasmine. “I did not want Lief with me when we began — I confess it," he said cheerfully. "But if he had stayed at home, as</p>
        <p>I wished, I would by now be dead, and the quest lost. I will not make the mistake a second time. If Fate has decreed that we are to be three, so be it."</p>
        <p>The Belt burned around Lief's waist. He unfastened it, laying it on the ground before him. He crouched over it and fitted the topaz into the first medallion. It slid into place and glowed there, as pure and golden as the nectar of the Lilies of Life, as warm and golden as the sun.</p>
        <p>Jasmine stared curiously at the Belt. "There are seven medallions," she pointed out. "Six are still empty."</p>
        <p>"But one is filled," said Lief with satisfaction.</p>
        <p>"The longest journey begins with the first step," said Barda. "And the first step we have taken. Whatever the next may bring, we have cause to celebrate now."</p>
        <p>"I am going to celebrate by beginning to rid the trees of these accursed vines," Lief said, putting his hand to his sword.</p>
        <p>But Jasmine smiled. "There is no need," she said. "The word has spread that The Dark is no more."</p>
        <p>She pointed upward and, to his amazement, Lief saw that the vine-shrouded trees were thick with birds. He had not heard them because they were too busy to call or sing. They were gladly tearing at the vines with their beaks and claws, working furiously. And more birds were coming every moment—birds of every kind.</p>
        <p>"The beasts are on their way," Jasmine murmured. "The little gnawing creatures that like roots and stems. They will be here within the hour and they, too, will relish the vines. In a day or two the trees will be free."</p>
        <p>The three stood for a moment, watching the amazing scene above them. Already some branches were clear of vines.</p>
        <p>No longer bound and weighed down, they were stretching gladly towards the sky.</p>
        <p>"This must have been a beautiful place, once," Lief said softly.</p>
        <p>"And will be again," Jasmine murmured. "Because of you. It was fortunate that you came here."</p>
        <p>Barda grinned. "I must confess that for a while I doubted it," he said. "But all has ended well. Very well." He stretched his great arms wearily. "We should stay a day or two, I think.</p>
        <p>To rest, and eat, and watch the freeing of the trees."</p>
        <p>"And then?" Jasmine asked. "What then?"</p>
        <p>"And then," Barda said simply, "we will go on."</p>
        <p>Lief slowly clipped the Belt around his waist once more. His heart was very full. He felt wonder and a kind of triumph when he thought of what had just passed. He felt excitement, eagerness, and a thrill of fear at the thought of what was ahead.</p>
        <p>But most of all he felt relief, and a deep, deep happiness.</p>
        <p>The first gem had been found.</p>
        <p>The quest to save Deltora had truly begun.</p>

“What?”</p>
        <p>“Well, like she’s just doing it because she’s sorry for us. We’ve been kind to her, and she wouldn’t want to hurt our feelings, so she just puts up with us. Like she’s too polite to run unless we tell her to go . . .”</p>
        <p>“Ah, now, no dog can be full of things like that—like human things . . .”</p>
        <p>“Nay, my Herself is, Dan. Ye don’t know that dog. Dan!”</p>
        <p>“Well?”</p>
        <p>The old woman’s voice dropped.</p>
        <p>“Ye see, I know aboot this dog. I know something.”</p>
        <p>“What?”</p>
        <p>“Dan, she’s going somewhere. She’s on her way.”</p>
        <p>“Ah, now, woman, and what fancies are ye building in your mind!”</p>
        <p>“I don’t care, Dan. I know—me and Herself, we both know. She was on her way, Dan, and she got tired on the way, and she’s just stopped here like it was a hospital—or a wayside inn in a story. And now she’s better, she wants to be on her way. But she’s so polite and understanding, she doesn’t want to hurt us. But in her heart, she’s for being away.</p>
        <p>She’s not happy here.”</p>
        <p>The old man did not answer. He tapped out his clay pipe in the palm of his hand and looked steadily at the dog. Finally, he spoke.</p>
        <p>“Aye,” he said. “All right, Dally. All right.”</p>
        <p>There are people whose hearts are so full of ugly fear that when they see a thirsty animal pass with a fleck of saliva on its parched jowl, they must run in terror shouting, “Mad dog!” There are others to whom every passing creature is an enemy, to be harried on its way with a flung stone. But, and for this the canine world must be thankful, there are others with affection and deep understanding in their lives who bring dignity and honour to the relationship between man and dog.</p>
        <p>Such was the old couple, who on the next afternoon sat watching the dog. When the time neared four o’clock, and Lassie rose, their eyes followed her.</p>
        <p>And when Lassie whined at the door and then paced to the window, they both sighed.</p>
        <p>“Well,” the old man said.</p>
        <p>That was all. They both got up. The woman opened the door. Side by side, the old man and his wife followed Lassie out to the road.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There for a moment, the dog stood, as if unable to realize that at last her great urge could be fulfilled.</p>
        <p>She looked back at the woman whose hands had patted and fondled her and fed her.</p>
        <p>For a second, the old woman wished to call—to call the dog back to her and try again to wean its mind from old memories. But she was too honest. She lifted her head, and her aged voice came clearly.</p>
        <p>“It’s all richt, then, dog. If ye must go—awa’ wi’ ye.”</p>
        <p>In that sentence, Lassie caught the word “go.” It was what she wanted.</p>
        <p>She turned, looked back once as in a glance of farewell, and then started—not up the road to the east, nor down it to the west, but straight across the field. She was going south again.</p>

        <p>The old woman’s voice dropped.</p>
        <p>“Ye see, I know aboot this dog. I know something.”</p>
        <p>“What?”</p>
        <p>“Dan, she’s going somewhere. She’s on her way.”</p>
        <p>“Ah, now, woman, and what fancies are ye building in your mind!”</p>
        <p>“I don’t care, Dan. I know—me and Herself, we both know. She was on her way, Dan, and she got tired on the way, and she’s just stopped here like it was a hospital—or a wayside inn in a story. And now she’s better, she wants to be on her way. But she’s so polite and understanding, she doesn’t want to hurt us. But in her heart, she’s for being away.</p>
        <p>She’s not happy here.”</p>
        <p>The old man did not answer. He tapped out his clay pipe in the palm of his hand and looked steadily at the dog. Finally, he spoke.</p>
        <p>“Aye,” he said. “All right, Dally. All right.”</p>
        <p>There are people whose hearts are so full of ugly fear that when they see a thirsty animal pass with a fleck of saliva on its parched jowl, they must run in terror shouting, “Mad dog!” There are others to whom every passing creature is an enemy, to be harried on its way with a flung stone. But, and for this the canine world must be thankful, there are others with affection and deep understanding in their lives who bring dignity and honour to the relationship between man and dog.</p>
        <p>Such was the old couple, who on the next afternoon sat watching the dog. When the time neared four o’clock, and Lassie rose, their eyes followed her.</p>
        <p>And when Lassie whined at the door and then paced to the window, they both sighed.</p>
        <p>“Well,” the old man said.</p>
        <p>That was all. They both got up. The woman opened the door. Side by side, the old man and his wife followed Lassie out to the road.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There for a moment, the dog stood, as if unable to realize that at last her great urge could be fulfilled.</p>
        <p>She looked back at the woman whose hands had patted and fondled her and fed her.</p>
        <p>For a second, the old woman wished to call—to call the dog back to her and try again to wean its mind from old memories. But she was too honest. She lifted her head, and her aged voice came clearly.</p>
        <p>“It’s all richt, then, dog. If ye must go—awa’ wi’ ye.”</p>
        <p>In that sentence, Lassie caught the word “go.” It was what she wanted.</p>
        <p>She turned, looked back once as in a glance of farewell, and then started—not up the road to the east, nor down it to the west, but straight across the field. She was going south again.</p>

“What?”</p>

“What?”</p>
        <p>“Well, like she’s just doing it because she’s sorry for us. We’ve been kind to her, and she wouldn’t want to hurt our feelings, so she just puts up with us. Like she’s too polite to run unless we tell her to go . . .”</p>
        <p>“Ah, now, no dog can be full of things like that—like human things . . .”</p>
        <p>“Nay, my Herself is, Dan. Ye don’t know that dog. Dan!”</p>
        <p>“Well?”</p>
        <p>The old woman’s voice dropped.</p>
        <p>“Ye see, I know aboot this dog. I know something.”</p>
        <p>“What?”</p>
        <p>“Dan, she’s going somewhere. She’s on her way.”</p>
        <p>“Ah, now, woman, and what fancies are ye building in your mind!”</p>
        <p>“I don’t care, Dan. I know—me and Herself, we both know. She was on her way, Dan, and she got tired on the way, and she’s just stopped here like it was a hospital—or a wayside inn in a story. And now she’s better, she wants to be on her way. But she’s so polite and understanding, she doesn’t want to hurt us. But in her heart, she’s for being away.</p>
        <p>She’s not happy here.”</p>
        <p>The old man did not answer. He tapped out his clay pipe in the palm of his hand and looked steadily at the dog. Finally, he spoke.</p>
        <p>“Aye,” he said. “All right, Dally. All right.”</p>
        <p>There are people whose hearts are so full of ugly fear that when they see a thirsty animal pass with a fleck of saliva on its parched jowl, they must run in terror shouting, “Mad dog!” There are others to whom every passing creature is an enemy, to be harried on its way with a flung stone. But, and for this the canine world must be thankful, there are others with affection and deep understanding in their lives who bring dignity and honour to the relationship between man and dog.</p>
        <p>Such was the old couple, who on the next afternoon sat watching the dog. When the time neared four o’clock, and Lassie rose, their eyes followed her.</p>
        <p>And when Lassie whined at the door and then paced to the window, they both sighed.</p>
        <p>“Well,” the old man said.</p>
        <p>That was all. They both got up. The woman opened the door. Side by side, the old man and his wife followed Lassie out to the road.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There for a moment, the dog stood, as if unable to realize that at last her great urge could be fulfilled.</p>
        <p>She looked back at the woman whose hands had patted and fondled her and fed her.</p>
        <p>For a second, the old woman wished to call—to call the dog back to her and try again to wean its mind from old memories. But she was too honest. She lifted her head, and her aged voice came clearly.</p>
        <p>“It’s all richt, then, dog. If ye must go—awa’ wi’ ye.”</p>
        <p>In that sentence, Lassie caught the word “go.” It was what she wanted.</p>
        <p>She turned, looked back once as in a glance of farewell, and then started—not up the road to the east, nor down it to the west, but straight across the field. She was going south again.</p>

“What?”</p>
        <p>“Well, like she’s just doing it because she’s sorry for us. We’ve been kind to her, and she wouldn’t want to hurt our feelings, so she just puts up with us. Like she’s too polite to run unless we tell her to go . . .”</p>
        <p>“Ah, now, no dog can be full of things like that—like human things . . .”</p>
        <p>“Nay, my Herself is, Dan. Ye don’t know that dog. Dan!”</p>
        <p>“Well?”</p>
        <p>The old woman’s voice dropped.</p>
        <p>“Ye see, I know aboot this dog. I know something.”</p>
        <p>“What?”</p>
        <p>“Dan, she’s going somewhere. She’s on her way.”</p>
        <p>“Ah, now, woman, and what fancies are ye building in your mind!”</p>
        <p>“I don’t care, Dan. I know—me and Herself, we both know. She was on her way, Dan, and she got tired on the way, and she’s just stopped here like it was a hospital—or a wayside inn in a story. And now she’s better, she wants to be on her way. But she’s so polite and understanding, she doesn’t want to hurt us. But in her heart, she’s for being away.</p>
        <p>She’s not happy here.”</p>
        <p>The old man did not answer. He tapped out his clay pipe in the palm of his hand and looked steadily at the dog. Finally, he spoke.</p>
        <p>“Aye,” he said. “All right, Dally. All right.”</p>
        <p>There are people whose hearts are so full of ugly fear that when they see a thirsty animal pass with a fleck of saliva on its parched jowl, they must run in terror shouting, “Mad dog!” There are others to whom every passing creature is an enemy, to be harried on its way with a flung stone. But, and for this the canine world must be thankful, there are others with affection and deep understanding in their lives who bring dignity and honour to the relationship between man and dog.</p>
        <p>Such was the old couple, who on the next afternoon sat watching the dog. When the time neared four o’clock, and Lassie rose, their eyes followed her.</p>
        <p>And when Lassie whined at the door and then paced to the window, they both sighed.</p>
        <p>“Well,” the old man said.</p>
        <p>That was all. They both got up. The woman opened the door. Side by side, the old man and his wife followed Lassie out to the road.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There for a moment, the dog stood, as if unable to realize that at last her great urge could be fulfilled.</p>
        <p>She looked back at the woman whose hands had patted and fondled her and fed her.</p>
        <p>For a second, the old woman wished to call—to call the dog back to her and try again to wean its mind from old memories. But she was too honest. She lifted her head, and her aged voice came clearly.</p>
        <p>“It’s all richt, then, dog. If ye must go—awa’ wi’ ye.”</p>
        <p>In that sentence, Lassie caught the word “go.” It was what she wanted.</p>
        <p>She turned, looked back once as in a glance of farewell, and then started—not up the road to the east, nor down it to the west, but straight across the field. She was going south again.</p>

<br>
Simpson and His Donkey</strong>
        </p>
        <p>John Simpson Kirkpatrick, known simply as Simpson, became an Australian war hero during World War I for his extraordinary bravery as a stretcher-bearer in the Gallipoli campaign. He famously used a donkey to rescue hundreds of wounded soldiers under enemy fire, embodying courage, sacrifice, and kindness. <strong>(A)&nbsp;</strong>................. Hoping to see his mother in England, he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) in 1914 and landed at Anzac Cove in April 1915. Recognising the inefficiency of traditional stretchers, he ingeniously used a donkey to transport the injured more quickly and made numerous perilous trips daily.</p>
        <p>Simpson’s remarkable bravery was widely acknowledged by his fellow soldiers. He calmly navigated enemy fire, often whistling to soothe his donkey, while rescuing an estimated 300 soldiers. &nbsp;<strong>(B)</strong>&nbsp;................. Tragically, on 19 May 1915, at the young age of 22, Simpson was killed by enemy fire while continuing his selfless rescue missions. His donkey survived and continued its service.</p>
        <p>Despite never receiving the Victoria Cross, Simpson’s story became legendary after his death, and he is remembered as one of Australia’s greatest war heroes. His bravery is commemorated in schools, books, and war memorials across the nation, his tale forming a significant part of Anzac history, symbolising selflessness and heroism.<strong>&nbsp;(C)&nbsp;</strong>................. Additionally, the donkey itself has become a potent symbol of endurance, loyalty, and compassion, deeply intertwined with Simpson’s legacy.</p>
        <p>Simpson’s actions at Gallipoli significantly shaped Australian national identity, embodying valued traits like courage, selflessness, and resilience, particularly during Australia’s early nationhood. His story is a central part of the Anzac legend, recounted on Anzac Day and taught in schools, reinforcing values of mateship and determination. <strong>(D)&nbsp;</strong>................. This omission has sparked considerable debate, with many arguing his actions warranted the highest military honour.</p>
        <p>Simpson’s dedication to saving wounded soldiers underscored the vital role of medical personnel in war, highlighting their bravery in perilous conditions. His legacy has also inspired humanitarian efforts globally, reminding people of the impact of compassion in conflict zones. <strong>(E)&nbsp;</strong>................. His story has been retold in various artistic and literary forms, solidifying his place in Australian cultural memory and exploring themes of heroism and sacrifice.</p>
        <p>More than a century after his death, Simpson’s legacy remains profoundly relevant, frequently referenced in discussions about heroism and the human cost of war. <strong>(F)</strong>&nbsp;................. His unwavering commitment to helping others, even at the ultimate cost, serves as a powerful reminder of true heroism and continues to inspire generations worldwide.</p>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of climate change. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, primarily caused by human activities. The burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas releases greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat, leading to global warming. According to NASA, Earth’s average surface temperature has risen by about 1.1°C since the late 19th century. The consequences of this warming are already evident: melting glaciers, rising sea levels, more frequent heatwaves, and extreme weather events such as hurricanes and droughts. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns that if global temperatures rise more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, the damage could become irreversible. Governments and organizations worldwide are promoting renewable energy sources, sustainable agriculture, and conservation efforts to reduce emissions and mitigate climate change. However, the window for effective action is narrowing, making it vital that we address this crisis urgently.<br>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of climate change. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
I’ve been farming this land for over thirty years. My father farmed it before me, and his father before him. We used to know the seasons like the back of our hand — when to plant, when to harvest, when the rains would come. But that certainty is gone now. In the last decade, the weather’s become unpredictable. Some years, the rain doesn’t come at all until it’s too late. Other times, it floods and wipes out weeks of work in a single afternoon. Last summer, we lost nearly half our crop to a heatwave that scorched the fields. I watched my corn wilt in soil that cracked like broken clay. It’s not just the crops. The bees are fewer. The soil takes longer to recover. We’ve had to switch to drought-resistant seeds, dig deeper wells, and even cut back on livestock because we can’t count on enough water. Climate change isn’t a theory to me. It’s not a debate. It’s what I face every morning when I look at the sky and wonder if the clouds will bless us or betray us. But I haven’t given up. I’m working with other farmers to try new methods — crop rotation, water conservation, solar-powered irrigation. We’re adapting, because we have to. This land feeds people. And I’ll keep fighting for it, one season at a time.<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of climate change. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
The year is 2074. What was once the Arctic is now navigable ocean for most of the year. Entire nations have shifted borders inland, retreating from coastlines swallowed by rising seas. Cities like Amsterdam, Bangkok, and Miami are remembered in history lessons, alongside maps of their sunken remains. Artificial intelligence now runs much of the planet’s resource management, including global carbon regulation systems, powered by fusion energy. The atmosphere is slowly stabilizing thanks to decades of drastic action — carbon drawdown satellites, global reforestation drones, and a ban on fossil fuels. But the scars are deep. Climate refugees now form the largest migratory population in history. Generations have grown up in climate-adapted arcologies — enclosed, self-sufficient cities that withstand extreme weather. Children learn about coral reefs and polar bears as extinct wonders, like dinosaurs. The world didn’t end, but it transformed. Climate change became the great equaliser, and ultimately, the great teacher.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of climate change. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Greta Thunberg was just 15 years old when she began her solo climate strike outside the Swedish Parliament in 2018, holding a handmade sign that read “Skolstrejk för klimatet” (“School strike for climate”). What started as one girl skipping school to demand action quickly became a global movement. Greta’s message was simple but powerful: world leaders were failing to act on the climate crisis, and the younger generation would bear the consequences. Her quiet protest sparked a worldwide youth movement, “Fridays for Future,” inspiring millions of students across the globe to strike for climate justice. Greta’s speeches at the United Nations, the European Parliament, and climate summits have been sharp, emotional, and unflinching. She famously told world leaders: “You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words... How dare you?”<br>
<br>
Despite criticism and resistance, Greta remains undeterred. She refuses to be silenced or softened, reminding the world that the science is clear — and that inaction is a betrayal of future generations. She has become a symbol of youth resistance, a reminder that one voice, when honest and persistent, can echo around the world.<br>

“What?”</p>
        <p>“Well, like she’s just doing it because she’s sorry for us. We’ve been kind to her, and she wouldn’t want to hurt our feelings, so she just puts up with us. Like she’s too polite to run unless we tell her to go . . .”</p>
        <p>“Ah, now, no dog can be full of things like that—like human things . . .”</p>
        <p>“Nay, my Herself is, Dan. Ye don’t know that dog. Dan!”</p>
        <p>“Well?”</p>
        <p>The old woman’s voice dropped.</p>
        <p>“Ye see, I know aboot this dog. I know something.”</p>
        <p>“What?”</p>
        <p>“Dan, she’s going somewhere. She’s on her way.”</p>
        <p>“Ah, now, woman, and what fancies are ye building in your mind!”</p>
        <p>“I don’t care, Dan. I know—me and Herself, we both know. She was on her way, Dan, and she got tired on the way, and she’s just stopped here like it was a hospital—or a wayside inn in a story. And now she’s better, she wants to be on her way. But she’s so polite and understanding, she doesn’t want to hurt us. But in her heart, she’s for being away.</p>
        <p>She’s not happy here.”</p>
        <p>The old man did not answer. He tapped out his clay pipe in the palm of his hand and looked steadily at the dog. Finally, he spoke.</p>
        <p>“Aye,” he said. “All right, Dally. All right.”</p>
        <p>There are people whose hearts are so full of ugly fear that when they see a thirsty animal pass with a fleck of saliva on its parched jowl, they must run in terror shouting, “Mad dog!” There are others to whom every passing creature is an enemy, to be harried on its way with a flung stone. But, and for this the canine world must be thankful, there are others with affection and deep understanding in their lives who bring dignity and honour to the relationship between man and dog.</p>
        <p>Such was the old couple, who on the next afternoon sat watching the dog. When the time neared four o’clock, and Lassie rose, their eyes followed her.</p>
        <p>And when Lassie whined at the door and then paced to the window, they both sighed.</p>
        <p>“Well,” the old man said.</p>
        <p>That was all. They both got up. The woman opened the door. Side by side, the old man and his wife followed Lassie out to the road.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There for a moment, the dog stood, as if unable to realize that at last her great urge could be fulfilled.</p>
        <p>She looked back at the woman whose hands had patted and fondled her and fed her.</p>
        <p>For a second, the old woman wished to call—to call the dog back to her and try again to wean its mind from old memories. But she was too honest. She lifted her head, and her aged voice came clearly.</p>
        <p>“It’s all richt, then, dog. If ye must go—awa’ wi’ ye.”</p>
        <p>In that sentence, Lassie caught the word “go.” It was what she wanted.</p>
        <p>She turned, looked back once as in a glance of farewell, and then started—not up the road to the east, nor down it to the west, but straight across the field. She was going south again.</p>

“What?”</p>
        <p>“Well, like she’s just doing it because she’s sorry for us. We’ve been kind to her, and she wouldn’t want to hurt our feelings, so she just puts up with us. Like she’s too polite to run unless we tell her to go . . .”</p>
        <p>“Ah, now, no dog can be full of things like that—like human things . . .”</p>
        <p>“Nay, my Herself is, Dan. Ye don’t know that dog. Dan!”</p>
        <p>“Well?”</p>
        <p>The old woman’s voice dropped.</p>
        <p>“Ye see, I know aboot this dog. I know something.”</p>
        <p>“What?”</p>
        <p>“Dan, she’s going somewhere. She’s on her way.”</p>
        <p>“Ah, now, woman, and what fancies are ye building in your mind!”</p>
        <p>“I don’t care, Dan. I know—me and Herself, we both know. She was on her way, Dan, and she got tired on the way, and she’s just stopped here like it was a hospital—or a wayside inn in a story. And now she’s better, she wants to be on her way. But she’s so polite and understanding, she doesn’t want to hurt us. But in her heart, she’s for being away.</p>
        <p>She’s not happy here.”</p>
        <p>The old man did not answer. He tapped out his clay pipe in the palm of his hand and looked steadily at the dog. Finally, he spoke.</p>
        <p>“Aye,” he said. “All right, Dally. All right.”</p>
        <p>There are people whose hearts are so full of ugly fear that when they see a thirsty animal pass with a fleck of saliva on its parched jowl, they must run in terror shouting, “Mad dog!” There are others to whom every passing creature is an enemy, to be harried on its way with a flung stone. But, and for this the canine world must be thankful, there are others with affection and deep understanding in their lives who bring dignity and honour to the relationship between man and dog.</p>
        <p>Such was the old couple, who on the next afternoon sat watching the dog. When the time neared four o’clock, and Lassie rose, their eyes followed her.</p>
        <p>And when Lassie whined at the door and then paced to the window, they both sighed.</p>
        <p>“Well,” the old man said.</p>
        <p>That was all. They both got up. The woman opened the door. Side by side, the old man and his wife followed Lassie out to the road.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There for a moment, the dog stood, as if unable to realize that at last her great urge could be fulfilled.</p>
        <p>She looked back at the woman whose hands had patted and fondled her and fed her.</p>
        <p>For a second, the old woman wished to call—to call the dog back to her and try again to wean its mind from old memories. But she was too honest. She lifted her head, and her aged voice came clearly.</p>
        <p>“It’s all richt, then, dog. If ye must go—awa’ wi’ ye.”</p>
        <p>In that sentence, Lassie caught the word “go.” It was what she wanted.</p>
        <p>She turned, looked back once as in a glance of farewell, and then started—not up the road to the east, nor down it to the west, but straight across the field. She was going south again.</p>
