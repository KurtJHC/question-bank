        <p><em>Read the extract below then answer the questions.</em><br><br>
There was a party of four; a noisy, blustering man with a lady, a little boy and a young girl, and a great deal of luggage. The lady and the boy got into the cab, and while the man ordered about the luggage the young girl came and looked at me.</p>
        <p>“Papa,” she said, “I am sure this poor horse cannot take us and all our luggage so far, he is so very weak and worn up. Do look at him.”</p>
        <p>“Oh! he’s all right, miss,” said my driver, “he’s strong enough.”</p>
        <p>The porter, who was pulling about some heavy boxes, suggested to the gentleman, as there was so much luggage, whether he would not take a second cab.</p>
        <p>“Can your horse do it, or can’t he?” said the blustering man.</p>
        <p>“Oh! he can do it all right, sir; send up the boxes, porter; he could take more than that;” and he helped to haul up a box so heavy that I could feel the springs go down.</p>
        <p>“Papa, papa, do take a second cab,” said the young girl in a beseeching tone. “I am sure we are wrong, I am sure it is very cruel.”</p>
        <p>“Nonsense, Grace, get in at once, and don’t make all this fuss; a pretty thing it would be if a man of business had to examine every cab-horse before he hired it—the man knows his own business of course; there, get in and hold your tongue!”</p>
        <p>My gentle friend had to obey, and box after box was dragged up and lodged on the top of the cab or settled by the side of the driver. At last all was ready, and with his usual jerk at the rein and slash of the whip he drove out of the station.</p>
        <p>The load was very heavy and I had had neither food nor rest since morning; but I did my best, as I always had done, in spite of cruelty and injustice.</p>
        <p>I got along fairly till we came to Ludgate Hill; but there the heavy load and my own exhaustion were too much. I was struggling to keep on, goaded by constant chucks of the rein and use of the whip, when in a single moment—I cannot tell how—my feet slipped from under me, and I fell heavily to the ground on my side; the suddenness and the force with which I fell seemed to beat all the breath out of my body.</p>
        <p>I lay perfectly still; indeed, I had no power to move, and I thought now I was going to die. I heard a sort of confusion round me, loud, angry voices, and the getting down of the luggage, but it was all like a dream. I thought I heard that sweet, pitiful voice saying, “Oh! that poor horse! it is all our fault.” Some one came and loosened the throat strap of my bridle, and undid the traces which kept the collar so tight upon me. Someone said, “He’s dead, he’ll never get up again.” Then I could hear a policeman giving orders, but I did not even open my eyes; I could only draw a gasping breath now and then. Some cold water was thrown over my head, and some cordial was poured into my mouth, and something was covered over me.</p>
        <p>I cannot tell how long I lay there, but I found my life coming back, and a kind-voiced man was patting me and encouraging me to rise. After some more cordial had been given me, and after one or two attempts, I staggered to my feet, and was gently led to some stables which were close by. Here I was put into a well-littered stall, and some warm gruel was brought to me, which I drank thankfully.</p>
        <p>In the evening I was sufficiently recovered to be led back to Skinner’s stables, where I think they did the best for me they could. In the morning Skinner came with a farrier to look at me. He examined me very closely and said:</p>
        <p>“This is a case of overwork more than disease, and if you could give him a run off for six months he would be able to work again; but now there is not an ounce of strength left in him.”</p>
        <p>“Then he must just go to the dogs,” said Skinner. “I have no meadows to nurse sick horses in—he might get well or he might not; that sort of thing don’t suit my business; my plan is to work ‘em as long as they’ll go, and then sell ‘em for what they’ll fetch, at the knacker’s or elsewhere.”</p>
        <p>“If he was broken-winded,” said the farrier, “you had better have him killed out of hand, but he is not; there is a sale of horses coming off in about ten days; if you rest him and feed him up he may pick up, and you may get more than his skin is worth, at any rate.”</p>
        <p>Upon this advice Skinner, rather unwillingly, I think, gave orders that I should be well fed and cared for, and the stable man, happily for me, carried out the orders with a much better will than his master had in giving them. Ten days of perfect rest, plenty of good oats, hay, bran mashes, with boiled linseed mixed in them, did more to get up my condition than anything else could have done; those linseed mashes were delicious, and I began to think, after all, it might be better to live than go to the dogs.</p>

          <strong>In Your Studio</strong>
        </p>
        <p>I’m on your lap<br>
in a photo I no longer have—<br>
a toddler with a borrowed brush,<br>
my hand caught mid-daub<br>
on your canvas.<br>
It was staged, of course—<br>
your painting for a calendar<br>
on the easel in front of us<br>
like the month you gave me<br>
a tool of your craft<br>
and I mistook it<br>
for permission—<br>
but my brush didn’t<br>
paint like yours.<br>
Sometimes I wonder<br>
if you saw it,<br>
the difference—<br>
or if you just liked<br>
how I held the brush,<br>
intent on nothing more<br>
than becoming you.<br>
I no longer try<br>
to paint like you.<br>
I paint like me—<br>
and I think you’d smile<br>
to see what I’ve done,<br>
though my brush still doesn’t<br>
paint like yours.<br>

          <strong>Obesity Epidemic in Australia</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
                  <img width="75%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766037293/xguaauskz8qkj41ob5xi.png" alt="HD_T4_L5_RS_U10_15 20">


        </p>
        <p>Obesity and overweight have become one of the most pressing health issues in modern Australia. Overweight and obesity are now the second leading risk factor for preventable chronic diseases after tobacco use, contributing to heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers. <strong>(A)</strong>…………. Compared to 1995, when only 56% of adults were classified as overweight, this marks a significant rise. Internationally, Australia ranks tenth among 21 OECD nations for obesity prevalence, above the OECD average.</p>
        <p>The burden of obesity is not evenly spread. Adults in regional and remote areas and those from lower socioeconomic groups report higher rates than those in major cities or wealthier communities. First Nations people also experience disproportionately high levels of overweight and obesity, with 74% of adults affected in 2018–19. <strong>(B)</strong>…………. The health consequences are severe. Obesity is associated with more than 30 conditions, from cardiovascular disease and cancer to musculoskeletal problems. This burden extends beyond individuals, placing strain on families and the healthcare system.</p>
        <p><strong>(C)</strong>…………. Eating more kilojoules than are used, reduced physical activity, and sedentary behaviours all contribute. Early life experiences can set patterns that influence lifelong health. Factors like maternal smoking, low or high birth weight, and being formula-fed instead of breastfed also increase the likelihood of obesity in adulthood. Social and economic factors, the easy availability of processed foods, and modern sedentary lifestyles all intensify the challenge. <strong>(D)</strong>………….</p>
        <p>Governments have recognised the urgency of the issue. The National Preventive Health Strategy (2021–2030) and the National Obesity Strategy (2022–2032) aim to reduce obesity through healthier environments, food systems and more physical activity. These frameworks provide a comprehensive approach, empowering Australians to make healthier choices across their lives. <strong>(E)</strong>…………. Ambition 1 focuses on changing the systems, environments and commercial determinants that affect Australians’ opportunities to live active and healthy lives, including fostering a strong and equitable physical activity system. Another key component is the second ambition: to empower and skill all Australians to be as healthy as they can be. This involves building health and food literacy for healthier lifestyles, while recognising that a comprehensive approach is required. <strong>(F)</strong>…………. These initiatives reflect that obesity is not just a personal matter but a national and systemic challenge.</p>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of Extreme Sport. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Extreme sports are activities that push the boundaries of physical skill and human courage. They include skydiving, base jumping, surfing giant waves, snowboarding, and many more. Supporters claim these sports offer unparalleled adrenaline, sharpen focus, and give participants a sense of freedom and accomplishment. Critics, however, point out their dangers: injuries are common, accidents can be fatal, and the costs of equipment and training are high. Some argue that emergency services are unfairly burdened when people deliberately put themselves in risky situations. Others believe the personal growth, resilience, and self-discovery outweigh the risks. Extreme sports can be both thrilling and divisive, representing either reckless endangerment or the ultimate celebration of human daring, depending on who you ask.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of Extreme Sport. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
One of the most famous figures in extreme sports is Felix Baumgartner, the Austrian skydiver who jumped from the stratosphere in 2012. Wearing a special pressurised suit, he leapt from a capsule attached to a high-altitude balloon nearly 39 kilometres above Earth. For a few minutes, he became the fastest man in free fall, breaking the sound barrier before opening his parachute. His jump was not only a record-breaking feat but also a scientific experiment that contributed to aerospace safety research. Baumgartner described the experience as both terrifying and exhilarating, explaining that the view of the Earth’s curve below him was breathtaking. His daring leap captured the world’s attention, illustrating how extreme sports can transcend entertainment and achieve historical significance.<br>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of Extreme Sport. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
The rise of extreme sports has also sparked cultural debate. Enthusiasts describe them as empowering, modern outlets for creativity and individuality. They argue that activities such as parkour or freestyle BMX are not merely dangerous stunts but expressive forms of art and movement. Opponents, however, suggest that young people are drawn in by social media videos that glamourise risk without showing the consequences. They worry that extreme sports foster reckless behaviour and contribute to rising hospital admissions. Governments and councils must balance public enthusiasm for urban skate parks, climbing walls, and adventure festivals against safety concerns. The debate reflects a wider tension: should society encourage fearless exploration or prioritise caution and control?<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of Extreme Sport. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
I will never forget my first attempt at bungee jumping. As I stood on the edge of the platform, my legs trembled, and my mind screamed at me to step back. But the countdown left no time for hesitation. When I finally leapt, fear turned instantly to exhilaration. The sensation of falling, followed by the recoil of the cord, was unlike anything I had ever known. Afterwards, I felt an overwhelming sense of accomplishment, as though I had conquered not just the jump but my own doubts. Friends teased me for screaming on the way down, but they also admitted they admired my courage. That single leap changed my perspective: I realised extreme sports are as much about mastering fear as they are about thrill-seeking.<br>

          <strong>In Your Studio</strong>
        </p>
        <p>I’m on your lap<br>
in a photo I no longer have—<br>
a toddler with a borrowed brush,<br>
my hand caught mid-daub<br>
on your canvas.<br>
It was staged, of course—<br>
your painting for a calendar<br>
on the easel in front of us<br>
like the month you gave me<br>
a tool of your craft<br>
and I mistook it<br>
for permission—<br>
but my brush didn’t<br>
paint like yours.<br>
Sometimes I wonder<br>
if you saw it,<br>
the difference—<br>
or if you just liked<br>
how I held the brush,<br>
intent on nothing more<br>
than becoming you.<br>
I no longer try<br>
to paint like you.<br>
I paint like me—<br>
and I think you’d smile<br>
to see what I’ve done,<br>
though my brush still doesn’t<br>
paint like yours.<br>
