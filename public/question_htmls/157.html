        <p>The summer of 1863 was a frightening time for the Hershey family and others in southern Pennsylvania where they lived. The Civil War was raging; for three long days soldiers fought a fierce battle near the town of Gettysburg. Milton Hershey was only 5 years old at the time. He, his younger sister, Sarena, and their parents could hear cannons booming nearby. People were terrified that the fighting would come even closer, so many buried their valuables in their yards. Milton did too. He’d earned pennies for doing errands. Like most children, he loved candy, and he’d been saving his coins to buy some.</p>
        <p>After the deadly battle finally ended and the Confederate Army had retreated, Milton went to dig up his coins. But he couldn’t remember where he’d hidden them. He dug up half the garden before finding his own buried treasure.</p>
        <p>Milton was born on September 13, 1857, in Hockersville, Pennsylvania. His parents were poor, and they moved frequently. During his childhood Milton attended seven different schools. Some were cold and badly equipped. He was a poor student and left school after receiving a fourth-grade education.</p>
        <p>Tragedy struck the family when Milton was 9 years old. Sarena died of scarlet fever, a serious disease that was common among children at that time. The loss was sad for Milton, and it devastated his parents. After Sarena died, Milton’s father moved away from home. He remained involved in Milton’s life, though.</p>
        <p>It was common at the time for teens to apprentice, or learn a trade by working at a shop or factory. At age 14, Milton apprenticed at a confectionary, or candy-maker’s shop. He mixed ingredients for candies, cakes, and ice cream. He especially liked to make candy. But he also made mistakes. One night after roasting peanuts for fudge, he went to the theatre next door to attend a performance. During the show he began to smell burning peanuts. All of a sudden he realised that he’d forgotten to take the peanuts off the stove. Rushing back to the confectionary, he saw peanuts everywhere! They had flown all over the shop.</p>
        <p>Milton spent four years working there before he moved to Philadelphia and opened a candy shop. It took many years and a series of unsuccessful shops before Milton gained sweet success with his own chocolate company.</p>

The rest is sweet history.</strong>

        </p>
        <p>The summer of 1863 was a frightening time for the Hershey family and others in southern Pennsylvania where they lived. The Civil War was raging; for three long days soldiers fought a fierce battle near the town of Gettysburg. Milton Hershey was only 5 years old at the time. He, his younger sister, Sarena, and their parents could hear cannons booming nearby. People were terrified that the fighting would come even closer, so many buried their valuables in their yards. Milton did too. He’d earned pennies for doing errands. Like most children, he loved candy, and he’d been saving his coins to buy some.</p>
        <p>After the deadly battle finally ended and the Confederate Army had retreated, Milton went to dig up his coins. But he couldn’t remember where he’d hidden them. He dug up half the garden before finding his own buried treasure.</p>
        <p>Milton was born on September 13, 1857, in Hockersville, Pennsylvania. His parents were poor, and they moved frequently. During his childhood Milton attended seven different schools. Some were cold and badly equipped. He was a poor student and left school after receiving a fourth-grade education.</p>
        <p>Tragedy struck the family when Milton was 9 years old. Sarena died of scarlet fever, a serious disease that was common among children at that time. The loss was sad for Milton, and it devastated his parents. After Sarena died, Milton’s father moved away from home. He remained involved in Milton’s life, though.</p>
        <p>It was common at the time for teens to apprentice, or learn a trade by working at a shop or factory. At age 14, Milton apprenticed at a confectionary, or candy-maker’s shop. He mixed ingredients for candies, cakes, and ice cream. He especially liked to make candy. But he also made mistakes. One night after roasting peanuts for fudge, he went to the theatre next door to attend a performance. During the show he began to smell burning peanuts. All of a sudden he realised that he’d forgotten to take the peanuts off the stove. Rushing back to the confectionary, he saw peanuts everywhere! They had flown all over the shop.</p>
        <p>Milton spent four years working there before he moved to Philadelphia and opened a candy shop. It took many years and a series of unsuccessful shops before Milton gained sweet success with his own chocolate company.</p>

          <strong>To Sir, With Love</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by E. R. Braithwaite</em>
        </p>
        <p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Next morning I had an idea. It was nothing clear cut, merely speculative, but I considered it all the way to school. Then, after assembly, as soon as they were quiet I waded<br>
in. This might be a bit rough, I thought, but here goes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I am your teacher, and I think it right and proper that I should let you know something of my plans for this class.” I tried to pitch my voice into its most informally pleasant register. “We’re going to talk, you and I, but we’ll be reasonable with each other. I would like you to listen to me without interrupting in any way, and when I’m through any one of you may say your piece without interruption from me.” I was making it up as I went along and watching them; at the least sign that it wouldn’t work I’d drop it, fast.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They were interested, in spite of themselves; even the husky blasé Denham was leaning forward on his desk watching me.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“My business here is to teach you, and I shall do my best to make my teaching as interesting as possible. If at any time I say anything which you do not understand or with which you do not agree, I would be pleased if you would let me know. Most of you will be leaving school within six months or so; that means that in a short while you will be embarking on the very adult business of earning a living. Bearing that in mind, I have decided that from now on you will be treated, not as children, but as young men and women, by me and by each other. When we move out of the state of childhood certain higher standards of conduct are expected of us . . .”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At this moment the door was flung open and Pamela Dare rushed in, somewhat breathlessly, to take her seat. She was very late.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“For instance,” I continued, there are really two ways in which a person may enter a room; one is in a controlled, dignified manner, the other is as if someone had just planted a heavy foot in your backside. Miss Dare has just shown us the second way; I’m quite sure she will now give us a demonstration of the first.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To this day I do not know what made me say it, but there it was. I was annoyed with the way in which she had just barged her way in, insolently, carelessly late.</p>

          <strong>To Sir, With Love</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by E. R. Braithwaite</em>
        </p>
        <p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Next morning I had an idea. It was nothing clear cut, merely speculative, but I considered it all the way to school. Then, after assembly, as soon as they were quiet I waded<br>
in. This might be a bit rough, I thought, but here goes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I am your teacher, and I think it right and proper that I should let you know something of my plans for this class.” I tried to pitch my voice into its most informally pleasant register. “We’re going to talk, you and I, but we’ll be reasonable with each other. I would like you to listen to me without interrupting in any way, and when I’m through any one of you may say your piece without interruption from me.” I was making it up as I went along and watching them; at the least sign that it wouldn’t work I’d drop it, fast.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They were interested, in spite of themselves; even the husky blasé Denham was leaning forward on his desk watching me.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“My business here is to teach you, and I shall do my best to make my teaching as interesting as possible. If at any time I say anything which you do not understand or with which you do not agree, I would be pleased if you would let me know. Most of you will be leaving school within six months or so; that means that in a short while you will be embarking on the very adult business of earning a living. Bearing that in mind, I have decided that from now on you will be treated, not as children, but as young men and women, by me and by each other. When we move out of the state of childhood certain higher standards of conduct are expected of us . . .”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At this moment the door was flung open and Pamela Dare rushed in, somewhat breathlessly, to take her seat. She was very late.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“For instance,” I continued, there are really two ways in which a person may enter a room; one is in a controlled, dignified manner, the other is as if someone had just planted a heavy foot in your backside. Miss Dare has just shown us the second way; I’m quite sure she will now give us a demonstration of the first.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To this day I do not know what made me say it, but there it was. I was annoyed with the way in which she had just barged her way in, insolently, carelessly late.</p>
