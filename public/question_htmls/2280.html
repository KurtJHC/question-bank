        <p>“I have little more to say. I merely repeat, remember always your duty of enmity towards Man and all his ways. Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend. And remember also that in fighting against Man, we must not come to resemble him. Even when you have conquered him, do not adopt his vices. No animal must ever live in a house, or sleep in a bed, or wear clothes, or drink alcohol, or smoke tobacco, or touch money, or engage in trade. All the habits of Man are evil. And, above all, no animal must ever tyrannise over his own kind. Weak or strong, clever or simple, we are all brothers. No animal must ever kill any other animal. All animals are equal.</p>
        <p>“And now, comrades, I will tell you about my dream of last night. I cannot describe that dream to you. It was a dream of the earth as it will be when Man has vanished. But it reminded me of something that I had long forgotten. Many years ago, when I was a little pig, my mother and the other sows used to sing an old song of which they knew only the tune and the first three words. I had known that tune in my infancy, but it had long since passed out of my mind. Last night, however, it came back to me in my dream. And what is more, the words of the song also came back – words, I am certain, which were sung by the animals of long ago and have been lost to memory for generations. I will sing you that song now, comrades. I am old and my voice is hoarse, but when I have taught you the tune, you can sing it better for yourselves. It is called, ‘Beasts of England.’”</p>
        <p>Old Major cleared his throat and began to sing. As he had said, his voice was hoarse, but he sang well enough, and it was a stirring tune, something between ‘Clementine’ and ‘La Cucaracha.’</p>

&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I have little more to say. I merely repeat, remember always your duty of enmity towards Man and all his ways. Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend. And remember also that in fighting against Man, we must not come to resemble him. Even when you have conquered him, do not adopt his vices. No animal must ever live in a house, or sleep in a bed, or wear clothes, or drink alcohol, or smoke tobacco, or touch money, or engage in trade. All the habits of Man are evil. And, above all, no animal must ever tyrannise over his own kind. Weak or strong, clever or simple, we are all brothers. No animal must ever kill any other animal. All animals are equal.</p>
        <p>“And now, comrades, I will tell you about my dream of last night. I cannot describe that dream to you. It was a dream of the earth as it will be when Man has vanished. But it reminded me of something that I had long forgotten. Many years ago, when I was a little pig, my mother and the other sows used to sing an old song of which they knew only the tune and the first three words. I had known that tune in my infancy, but it had long since passed out of my mind. Last night, however, it came back to me in my dream. And what is more, the words of the song also came back – words, I am certain, which were sung by the animals of long ago and have been lost to memory for generations. I will sing you that song now, comrades. I am old and my voice is hoarse, but when I have taught you the tune, you can sing it better for yourselves. It is called, ‘Beasts of England.’”</p>
        <p>Old Major cleared his throat and began to sing. As he had said, his voice was hoarse, but he sang well enough, and it was a stirring tune, something between ‘Clementine’ and ‘La Cucaracha.’</p>

          <strong>Composed on Westminster Bridge, September 3, 1802</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>By William Wordsworth</em><br><br>
Earth has not anything to show more fair:<br>
Dull would he be of soul who could pass by<br>
A sight so touching in its majesty:<br>
This City now doth, like a garment, wear<br>
The beauty of the morning; silent, bare,<br>
Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie<br>
Open unto the fields, and to the sky;<br>
All bright and glittering in the smokeless air.<br>
<br>
Never did sun more beautifully steep<br>
In his first splendour, valley, rock, or hill;<br>
Ne'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!<br>
The river glideth at his own sweet will:<br>
Dear God! the very houses seem asleep;<br>
And all that mighty heart is lying still!</p>

          <strong>Composed on Westminster Bridge, September 3, 1802</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>By William Wordsworth</em><br><br>
Earth has not anything to show more fair:<br>
Dull would he be of soul who could pass by<br>
A sight so touching in its majesty:<br>
This City now doth, like a garment, wear<br>
The beauty of the morning; silent, bare,<br>
Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie<br>
Open unto the fields, and to the sky;<br>
All bright and glittering in the smokeless air.<br>
<br>
Never did sun more beautifully steep<br>
In his first splendour, valley, rock, or hill;<br>
Ne'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!<br>
The river glideth at his own sweet will:<br>
Dear God! the very houses seem asleep;<br>
And all that mighty heart is lying still!</p>

          <strong>Composed on Westminster Bridge, September 3, 1802</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>By William Wordsworth</em><br><br>
Earth has not anything to show more fair:<br>
Dull would he be of soul who could pass by<br>
A sight so touching in its majesty:<br>
This City now doth, like a garment, wear<br>
The beauty of the morning; silent, bare,<br>
Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie<br>
Open unto the fields, and to the sky;<br>
All bright and glittering in the smokeless air.<br>
<br>
Never did sun more beautifully steep<br>
In his first splendour, valley, rock, or hill;<br>
Ne'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!<br>
The river glideth at his own sweet will:<br>
Dear God! the very houses seem asleep;<br>
And all that mighty heart is lying still!</p>

Nanobots are a promising new technology that has several potential uses. However, most of the applications that we have so far considered have revolved around medicine. One such case is in the field of haematology, which is the science of blood and blood diseases.</p>
        <p>One main application of nanobots is to emulate red blood cells. In the 1990s, futurist Robert Freitas Jr proposed the design of respirocytes – hypothetical artificial red blood cells that can be used as oxygen and carbon dioxide in the bloodstream.</p>
        <p>The total size of the respirocyte would be about one micron or 1000 nanometers; making it six times smaller than a normal red blood cell. This design would allow the robots to pass into the smallest capilleries and ensure much more efficient delivery of oxygen to tissue than is possible with organic red cells. It’s also designed to carry 236 times more oxygen and carbon dioxide than a normal blood cell.</p>
        <p>The medical benefits of working respirocytes would be enormous. For starters, the device will help scientists to create efficient and long-lasting artificial blood replacement fluids, for use in blood transfusions and first aid scenarios. Its ability to wriggle through blood vessels and carry more oxygen to the brain can bring a new lifeline for patients suffering from cardiovascular disease.</p>

Nanobots are a promising new technology that has several potential uses. However, most of the applications that we have so far considered have revolved around medicine. One such case is in the field of haematology, which is the science of blood and blood diseases.</p>
        <p>One main application of nanobots is to emulate red blood cells. In the 1990s, futurist Robert Freitas Jr proposed the design of respirocytes – hypothetical artificial red blood cells that can be used as oxygen and carbon dioxide in the bloodstream.</p>

This design would allow the robots to pass into the smallest capilleries and ensure much more efficient delivery of oxygen to tissue than is possible with organic red cells. It’s also designed to carry 236 times more oxygen and carbon dioxide than a normal blood cell.</p>
        <p>The medical benefits of working respirocytes would be enormous. For starters, the device will help scientists to create efficient and long-lasting artificial blood replacement fluids, for use in blood transfusions and first aid scenarios. Its ability to wriggle through blood vessels and carry more oxygen to the brain can bring a new lifeline for patients suffering from cardiovascular disease.</p>
