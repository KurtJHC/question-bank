        <p>Read the extract below then answer the questions.<br>
<br>
But Spitz, cold and calculating even in his supreme moods, left the pack and cut across a narrow neck of land where the creek made a long bend around. Buck did not know of this, and as he rounded the bend, the frost wraith of a rabbit still flitting before him, he saw another and larger frost wraith leap from the overhanging bank into the immediate path of the rabbit. It was Spitz. The rabbit could not turn, and as the white teeth broke its back in mid air it shrieked as loudly as a stricken man may shriek. At sound of this, the cry of Life plunging down from Life’s apex in the grip of Death, the fall pack at Buck’s heels raised a hell’s chorus of delight.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Buck did not cry out. He did not check himself, but drove in upon Spitz, shoulder to shoulder, so hard that he missed the throat. They rolled over and over in the powdery snow. Spitz gained his feet almost as though he had not been overthrown, slashing Buck down the shoulder and leaping clear. Twice his teeth clipped together, like the steel jaws of a trap, as he backed away for better footing, with lean and lifting lips that writhed and snarled.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In a flash Buck knew it. The time had come. It was to the death. As they circled about, snarling, ears laid back, keenly watchful for the advantage, the scene came to Buck with a sense of familiarity. He seemed to remember it all,—the white woods, and earth, and moonlight, and the thrill of battle. Over the whiteness and silence brooded a ghostly calm. There was not the faintest whisper of air—nothing moved, not a leaf quivered, the visible breaths of the dogs rising slowly and lingering in the frosty air. They had made short work of the snowshoe rabbit, these dogs that were illtamed wolves; and they were now drawn up in an expectant circle. They, too, were silent, their eyes only gleaming and their breaths drifting slowly upward. To Buck it was nothing new or strange, this scene of old time. It was <span class="txt-underline"><strong>as though it had always been, the wonted way of things</strong></span>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Spitz was a practised fighter. From Spitzbergen through the Arctic, and across Canada and the Barrens, he had held his own with all manner of dogs and achieved to mastery over them. Bitter rage was his, but never blind rage. In passion to rend and destroy, he never forgot that his enemy was in like passion to rend and destroy. He never rushed till he was prepared to receive a rush; never attacked till he had first defended that attack.</p>
        <p>In vain Buck strove to sink his teeth in the neck of the big white dog. Wherever his fangs struck for the softer flesh, they were countered by the fangs of Spitz. Fang clashed fang, and lips were cut and bleeding, but Buck could not penetrate his enemy’s guard. Then he warmed up and enveloped Spitz in a whirlwind of rushes. Time and time again he tried for the snow-white throat, where life bubbled near to the surface, and each time and every time Spitz slashed him&nbsp;&nbsp;and got away. Then Buck took to rushing, as though for the throat, when, suddenly drawing back his head and curving in from the side, he would drive his shoulder at the shoulder of Spitz, as a ram by which to overthrow him. But instead, Buck’s shoulder was slashed down each time as Spitz leaped lightly away.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Spitz was untouched, while Buck was streaming with blood and panting hard. The fight was growing desperate. And all the while the silent and wolfish circle waited to finish off whichever dog went down. As Buck grew winded, Spitz took to rushing, and he kept him staggering for footing. Once Buck went over, and the whole circle of sixty dogs started up; but he recovered himself, almost in mid air, and the circle sank down again and waited.</p>
        <p>But Buck possessed a quality that made for greatness— imagination. He fought by instinct, but he could fight by head as well. He rushed, as though attempting the old shoulder trick, but at the last instant swept low to the snow and in. His teeth closed on Spitz’s left fore leg. There was a crunch of breaking bone, and the white dog faced him on three legs. Thrice he tried to knock him over, then repeated the trick and broke the right fore leg. Despite the pain and helplessness, Spitz struggled madly to keep up. He saw the silent circle, with gleaming eyes, lolling tongues, and silvery breaths drifting upward, closing in upon him as he had seen similar circles close in upon beaten antagonists in the past. Only this time he was the one who was beaten.</p>

        <p>Spitz was a practised fighter. From Spitzbergen through the Arctic, and across Canada and the Barrens, he had held his own with all manner of dogs and achieved to mastery over them. Bitter rage was his, but never blind rage. In passion to rend and destroy, he never forgot that his enemy was in like passion to rend and destroy. He never rushed till he was prepared to receive a rush; never attacked till he had first defended that attack.</p>
        <p>In vain Buck strove to sink his teeth in the neck of the big white dog. Wherever his fangs struck for the softer flesh, they were countered by the fangs of Spitz. Fang clashed fang, and lips were cut and bleeding, but Buck could not penetrate his enemy’s guard. Then he warmed up and enveloped Spitz in a whirlwind of rushes. Time and time again he tried for the snow-white throat, where life bubbled near to the surface, and each time and every time Spitz slashed him&nbsp;&nbsp;and got away. Then Buck took to rushing, as though for the throat, when, suddenly drawing back his head and curving in from the side, he would drive his shoulder at the shoulder of Spitz, as a ram by which to overthrow him. But instead, Buck’s shoulder was slashed down each time as Spitz leaped lightly away.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Spitz was untouched, while Buck was streaming with blood and panting hard. The fight was growing desperate. And all the while the silent and wolfish circle waited to finish off whichever dog went down. As Buck grew winded, Spitz took to rushing, and he kept him staggering for footing. Once Buck went over, and the whole circle of sixty dogs started up; but he recovered himself, almost in mid air, and the circle sank down again and waited.</p>
        <p>But Buck possessed a quality that made for greatness— imagination. He fought by instinct, but he could fight by head as well. He rushed, as though attempting the old shoulder trick, but at the last instant swept low to the snow and in. His teeth closed on Spitz’s left fore leg. There was a crunch of breaking bone, and the white dog faced him on three legs. Thrice he tried to knock him over, then repeated the trick and broke the right fore leg. Despite the pain and helplessness, Spitz struggled madly to keep up. He saw the silent circle, with gleaming eyes, lolling tongues, and silvery breaths drifting upward, closing in upon him as he had seen similar circles close in upon beaten antagonists in the past. Only this time he was the one who was beaten.</p>

<br>
But Spitz, cold and calculating even in his supreme moods, left the pack and cut across a narrow neck of land where the creek made a long bend around. Buck did not know of this, and as he rounded the bend, the frost wraith of a rabbit still flitting before him, he saw another and larger frost wraith leap from the overhanging bank into the immediate path of the rabbit. It was Spitz. The rabbit could not turn, and as the white teeth broke its back in mid air it shrieked as loudly as a stricken man may shriek. At sound of this, the cry of Life plunging down from Life’s apex in the grip of Death, the fall pack at Buck’s heels raised a hell’s chorus of delight.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Buck did not cry out. He did not check himself, but drove in upon Spitz, shoulder to shoulder, so hard that he missed the throat. They rolled over and over in the powdery snow. Spitz gained his feet almost as though he had not been overthrown, slashing Buck down the shoulder and leaping clear. Twice his teeth clipped together, like the steel jaws of a trap, as he backed away for better footing, with lean and lifting lips that writhed and snarled.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In a flash Buck knew it. The time had come. It was to the death. As they circled about, snarling, ears laid back, keenly watchful for the advantage, the scene came to Buck with a sense of familiarity. He seemed to remember it all,—the white woods, and earth, and moonlight, and the thrill of battle. Over the whiteness and silence brooded a ghostly calm. There was not the faintest whisper of air—nothing moved, not a leaf quivered, the visible breaths of the dogs rising slowly and lingering in the frosty air. They had made short work of the snowshoe rabbit, these dogs that were illtamed wolves; and they were now drawn up in an expectant circle. They, too, were silent, their eyes only gleaming and their breaths drifting slowly upward. To Buck it was nothing new or strange, this scene of old time. It was <span class="txt-underline"><strong>as though it had always been, the wonted way of things</strong></span>.&nbsp;</p>

<br>
But Spitz, cold and calculating even in his supreme moods, left the pack and cut across a narrow neck of land where the creek made a long bend around. Buck did not know of this, and as he rounded the bend, the frost wraith of a rabbit still flitting before him, he saw another and larger frost wraith leap from the overhanging bank into the immediate path of the rabbit. It was Spitz. The rabbit could not turn, and as the white teeth broke its back in mid air it shrieked as loudly as a stricken man may shriek. At sound of this, the cry of Life plunging down from Life’s apex in the grip of Death, the fall pack at Buck’s heels raised a hell’s chorus of delight.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Buck did not cry out. He did not check himself, but drove in upon Spitz, shoulder to shoulder, so hard that he missed the throat. They rolled over and over in the powdery snow. Spitz gained his feet almost as though he had not been overthrown, slashing Buck down the shoulder and leaping clear. Twice his teeth clipped together, like the steel jaws of a trap, as he backed away for better footing, with lean and lifting lips that writhed and snarled.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In a flash Buck knew it. The time had come. It was to the death. As they circled about, snarling, ears laid back, keenly watchful for the advantage, the scene came to Buck with a sense of familiarity. He seemed to remember it all,—the white woods, and earth, and moonlight, and the thrill of battle. Over the whiteness and silence brooded a ghostly calm. There was not the faintest whisper of air—nothing moved, not a leaf quivered, the visible breaths of the dogs rising slowly and lingering in the frosty air. They had made short work of the snowshoe rabbit, these dogs that were illtamed wolves; and they were now drawn up in an expectant circle. They, too, were silent, their eyes only gleaming and their breaths drifting slowly upward. To Buck it was nothing new or strange, this scene of old time. It was <span class="txt-underline"><strong>as though it had always been, the wonted way of things</strong></span>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Spitz was a practised fighter. From Spitzbergen through the Arctic, and across Canada and the Barrens, he had held his own with all manner of dogs and achieved to mastery over them. Bitter rage was his, but never blind rage. In passion to rend and destroy, he never forgot that his enemy was in like passion to rend and destroy. He never rushed till he was prepared to receive a rush; never attacked till he had first defended that attack.</p>
        <p>In vain Buck strove to sink his teeth in the neck of the big white dog. Wherever his fangs struck for the softer flesh, they were countered by the fangs of Spitz. Fang clashed fang, and lips were cut and bleeding, but Buck could not penetrate his enemy’s guard. Then he warmed up and enveloped Spitz in a whirlwind of rushes. Time and time again he tried for the snow-white throat, where life bubbled near to the surface, and each time and every time Spitz slashed him&nbsp;&nbsp;and got away. Then Buck took to rushing, as though for the throat, when, suddenly drawing back his head and curving in from the side, he would drive his shoulder at the shoulder of Spitz, as a ram by which to overthrow him. But instead, Buck’s shoulder was slashed down each time as Spitz leaped lightly away.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Spitz was untouched, while Buck was streaming with blood and panting hard. The fight was growing desperate. And all the while the silent and wolfish circle waited to finish off whichever dog went down. As Buck grew winded, Spitz took to rushing, and he kept him staggering for footing. Once Buck went over, and the whole circle of sixty dogs started up; but he recovered himself, almost in mid air, and the circle sank down again and waited.</p>
        <p>But Buck possessed a quality that made for greatness— imagination. He fought by instinct, but he could fight by head as well. He rushed, as though attempting the old shoulder trick, but at the last instant swept low to the snow and in. His teeth closed on Spitz’s left fore leg. There was a crunch of breaking bone, and the white dog faced him on three legs. Thrice he tried to knock him over, then repeated the trick and broke the right fore leg. Despite the pain and helplessness, Spitz struggled madly to keep up. He saw the silent circle, with gleaming eyes, lolling tongues, and silvery breaths drifting upward, closing in upon him as he had seen similar circles close in upon beaten antagonists in the past. Only this time he was the one who was beaten.</p>

        <p>Read the extract below then answer the questions.<br>
<br>
But Spitz, cold and calculating even in his supreme moods, left the pack and cut across a narrow neck of land where the creek made a long bend around. Buck did not know of this, and as he rounded the bend, the frost wraith of a rabbit still flitting before him, he saw another and larger frost wraith leap from the overhanging bank into the immediate path of the rabbit. It was Spitz. The rabbit could not turn, and as the white teeth broke its back in mid air it shrieked as loudly as a stricken man may shriek. At sound of this, the cry of Life plunging down from Life’s apex in the grip of Death, the fall pack at Buck’s heels raised a hell’s chorus of delight.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Buck did not cry out. He did not check himself, but drove in upon Spitz, shoulder to shoulder, so hard that he missed the throat. They rolled over and over in the powdery snow. Spitz gained his feet almost as though he had not been overthrown, slashing Buck down the shoulder and leaping clear. Twice his teeth clipped together, like the steel jaws of a trap, as he backed away for better footing, with lean and lifting lips that writhed and snarled.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In a flash Buck knew it. The time had come. It was to the death. As they circled about, snarling, ears laid back, keenly watchful for the advantage, the scene came to Buck with a sense of familiarity. He seemed to remember it all,—the white woods, and earth, and moonlight, and the thrill of battle. Over the whiteness and silence brooded a ghostly calm. There was not the faintest whisper of air—nothing moved, not a leaf quivered, the visible breaths of the dogs rising slowly and lingering in the frosty air. They had made short work of the snowshoe rabbit, these dogs that were illtamed wolves; and they were now drawn up in an expectant circle. They, too, were silent, their eyes only gleaming and their breaths drifting slowly upward. To Buck it was nothing new or strange, this scene of old time. It was <span class="txt-underline"><strong>as though it had always been, the wonted way of things</strong></span>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Spitz was a practised fighter. From Spitzbergen through the Arctic, and across Canada and the Barrens, he had held his own with all manner of dogs and achieved to mastery over them. Bitter rage was his, but never blind rage. In passion to rend and destroy, he never forgot that his enemy was in like passion to rend and destroy. He never rushed till he was prepared to receive a rush; never attacked till he had first defended that attack.</p>
        <p>In vain Buck strove to sink his teeth in the neck of the big white dog. Wherever his fangs struck for the softer flesh, they were countered by the fangs of Spitz. Fang clashed fang, and lips were cut and bleeding, but Buck could not penetrate his enemy’s guard. Then he warmed up and enveloped Spitz in a whirlwind of rushes. Time and time again he tried for the snow-white throat, where life bubbled near to the surface, and each time and every time Spitz slashed him&nbsp;&nbsp;and got away. Then Buck took to rushing, as though for the throat, when, suddenly drawing back his head and curving in from the side, he would drive his shoulder at the shoulder of Spitz, as a ram by which to overthrow him. But instead, Buck’s shoulder was slashed down each time as Spitz leaped lightly away.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Spitz was untouched, while Buck was streaming with blood and panting hard. The fight was growing desperate. And all the while the silent and wolfish circle waited to finish off whichever dog went down. As Buck grew winded, Spitz took to rushing, and he kept him staggering for footing. Once Buck went over, and the whole circle of sixty dogs started up; but he recovered himself, almost in mid air, and the circle sank down again and waited.</p>
        <p>But Buck possessed a quality that made for greatness— imagination. He fought by instinct, but he could fight by head as well. He rushed, as though attempting the old shoulder trick, but at the last instant swept low to the snow and in. His teeth closed on Spitz’s left fore leg. There was a crunch of breaking bone, and the white dog faced him on three legs. Thrice he tried to knock him over, then repeated the trick and broke the right fore leg. Despite the pain and helplessness, Spitz struggled madly to keep up. He saw the silent circle, with gleaming eyes, lolling tongues, and silvery breaths drifting upward, closing in upon him as he had seen similar circles close in upon beaten antagonists in the past. Only this time he was the one who was beaten.</p>

‘Is there anybody there?’ said the Traveller,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Knocking on the moonlit door;<br>
And his horse in the silence champed the grasses<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;Of the forest’s ferny floor:<br>
And a bird flew up out of the turret,<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;Above the Traveller’s head:<br>
And he smote upon the door again a second time;<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;‘Is there anybody there?’ he said.<br>
But no one descended to the Traveller;<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;No head from the leaf-fringed sill<br>
Leaned over and looked into his grey eyes,<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;Where he stood perplexed and still.<br>
But only a host of phantom listeners<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;That dwelt in the lone house then<br>
Stood listening in the quiet of the moonlight<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;To that voice from the world of men:<br>
Stood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair,<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;That goes down to the empty hall,<br>
Hearkening in an air stirred and shaken<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;By the lonely Traveller’s call.<br>
And he felt in his heart their strangeness,<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;Their stillness answering his cry,<br>
While his horse moved, cropping the dark turf,<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;’Neath the starred and leafy sky;<br>
For he suddenly smote on the door, even<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;Louder, and lifted his head:—<br>
‘Tell them I came, and no one answered,<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;That I kept my word,’ he said.<br>
Never the least stir made the listeners,<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;Though every word he spake<br>
Fell echoing through the shadowiness of the still house<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;From the one man left awake:<br>
Ay, they heard his foot upon the stirrup,<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;And the sound of iron on stone,<br>
And how the silence surged softly backward,<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;When the plunging hoofs were gone.</p>

‘Is there anybody there?’ said the Traveller,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Knocking on the moonlit door;<br>
And his horse in the silence champed the grasses<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;Of the forest’s ferny floor:<br>
And a bird flew up out of the turret,<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;Above the Traveller’s head:<br>
And he smote upon the door again a second time;<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;‘Is there anybody there?’ he said.<br>
But no one descended to the Traveller;<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;No head from the leaf-fringed sill<br>
Leaned over and looked into his grey eyes,<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;Where he stood perplexed and still.<br>
But only a host of phantom listeners<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;That dwelt in the lone house then<br>
Stood listening in the quiet of the moonlight<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;To that voice from the world of men:<br>
Stood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair,<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;That goes down to the empty hall,<br>
Hearkening in an air stirred and shaken<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;By the lonely Traveller’s call.<br>
And he felt in his heart their strangeness,<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;Their stillness answering his cry,<br>
While his horse moved, cropping the dark turf,<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;’Neath the starred and leafy sky;<br>
For he suddenly smote on the door, even<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;Louder, and lifted his head:—<br>
‘Tell them I came, and no one answered,<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;That I kept my word,’ he said.<br>
Never the least stir made the listeners,<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;Though every word he spake<br>
Fell echoing through the shadowiness of the still house<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;From the one man left awake:<br>
Ay, they heard his foot upon the stirrup,<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;And the sound of iron on stone,<br>
And how the silence surged softly backward,<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;When the plunging hoofs were gone.</p>

        <p><em>Read the poem below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>The Listeners</strong><br><br>
‘Is there anybody there?’ said the Traveller,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Knocking on the moonlit door;<br>
And his horse in the silence champed the grasses<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;Of the forest’s ferny floor:<br>
And a bird flew up out of the turret,<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;Above the Traveller’s head:<br>
And he smote upon the door again a second time;<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;‘Is there anybody there?’ he said.<br>
But no one descended to the Traveller;<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;No head from the leaf-fringed sill<br>
Leaned over and looked into his grey eyes,<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;Where he stood perplexed and still.<br>
But only a host of phantom listeners<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;That dwelt in the lone house then<br>
Stood listening in the quiet of the moonlight<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;To that voice from the world of men:<br>
Stood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair,<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;That goes down to the empty hall,<br>
Hearkening in an air stirred and shaken<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;By the lonely Traveller’s call.<br>
And he felt in his heart their strangeness,<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;Their stillness answering his cry,<br>
While his horse moved, cropping the dark turf,<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;’Neath the starred and leafy sky;<br>
For he suddenly smote on the door, even<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;Louder, and lifted his head:—<br>
‘Tell them I came, and no one answered,<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;That I kept my word,’ he said.<br>
Never the least stir made the listeners,<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;Though every word he spake<br>
Fell echoing through the shadowiness of the still house<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;From the one man left awake:<br>
Ay, they heard his foot upon the stirrup,<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;And the sound of iron on stone,<br>
And how the silence surged softly backward,<br>
​&nbsp; &nbsp;When the plunging hoofs were gone.</p>

        <p><strong>Read the text below. Six sentences&nbsp;have been removed from this text so that there are six gaps.</strong><br><br><strong>Volcanoes</strong><br><br>
A volcano is an opening on a planet’s surface that allows molten material, known as magma, to escape from its interior. This process leads to an eruption, which can either be explosive, sending material high into the sky, or calmer, with slower, but equally deadly flows of lava. <strong>(A)</strong> …………… Volcanoes are categorized into three types: active, dormant, and extinct. Active volcanoes have had recent eruptions or are expected to erupt soon. Dormant volcanoes have not erupted recently but could potentially erupt in the future. Extinct volcanoes are those that are unlikely to erupt again.</p>
        <p>Volcanoes form when magma, which is lighter than surrounding rocks, rises through the Earth’s crust. <strong>(B)</strong> …………… These movements create various types of volcanoes, including those with steep slopes (cone volcanoes), broad, dome-like shapes (shield volcanoes), or flat tops with central craters (calderas). The characteristics of an eruption depend on the magma’s viscosity and gas content. Runny, low-gas magma leads to gentle eruptions of slow moving lava, while sticky, gas-rich magma can cause explosive eruptions, producing ash clouds and pyroclastic flows.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The explosiveness of an eruption is influenced by the magma’s properties. For instance, magma with low viscosity and gas content, like that in Hawaii, results in slow-moving lava flows and shield volcanoes. In contrast, magma that is viscous and gas-rich can cause violent eruptions, as seen with the Fuego volcano in Guatemala. <strong>(C)</strong> …………… These eruptions can also produce pyroclastic flows, which are fast-moving, hot clouds of ash, gas, and rocks that devastate everything in their path.</p>
        <p><strong>(D)</strong> ………….. Volcanic ash enriches the soil, making it fertile for agriculture. Additionally, the geothermal energy from volcanoes is harnessed to generate electricity, powering homes and industries. The diversity of volcanoes is remarkable, ranging from the largest mountains on Earth to small hills. They can erupt multiple times over millennia or have single, dramatic events. While some volcanoes primarily consist of volcanic ash, others are formed from lava flows, and some have complex structures with a mix of pyroclastic deposits, lava domes, and landslides.</p>
        <p>Volcanoes are not unique to Earth; they are found throughout the solar system. Mars and&nbsp;&nbsp;Venus have numerous extinct volcanoes, and moons of Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune exhibit active volcanic activity. <strong>(E)</strong> …………… This has been evidenced by images from NASA’s Voyager 1 spacecraft. This discovery of active extraterrestrial volcanoes has expanded our understanding of geological processes beyond our planet, revealing that volcanic activity is a common phenomenon in the solar system.</p>
        <p>Studying volcanoes offers insights into Earth’s interior and the immense power of nature, though it can be perilous. Over the past 60 years, 31 volcanologists have died while researching volcanoes. The most tragic periods include the 1991 Mount Unzen eruption in Japan, which killed Maurice and Katia Krafft, and the 1993 Galeras eruption in Colombia, which claimed six lives during a United Nations conference. <strong>(F)</strong> …………… With around 1500 active volcanoes worldwide and weekly eruptions, understanding and respecting these natural phenomena remain crucial for minimizing risks and harnessing their benefits.</p>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of change. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Is change inevitable? Change is a fundamental aspect of life. Everything around us is subject to change, from the weather to the seasons, from technology to society. Change is the only constant in life. No matter how much we try to resist it, change is inevitable. The first reason why change is inevitable is that the world is constantly evolving. New discoveries are being made, and new technologies are being developed. Secondly, change is inevitable because of the cyclical nature of life. Thirdly, change is inevitable due to external factors beyond our control. Lastly, change is inevitable because of our personal growth and development. As we learn and grow, we change our perspectives and beliefs.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of change. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Social movements play a crucial role in driving social change by mobilising individuals around shared grievances and goals. These movements often emerge in response to perceived injustices or inequalities within society, seeking to challenge the status quo. Through collective action, advocacy, and public awareness campaigns, social movements can influence public opinion, policy decisions, and even cultural norms. There are many historical examples of successful social movements, such as the civil rights movement and the feminist movement, illustrating how grassroots efforts can lead to significant societal transformations.<br>

Technology is a significant driver of social change, reshaping how individuals interact, communicate, and organise themselves. The advent of the internet and social media has transformed the landscape of social movements, allowing for rapid dissemination of information and the ability to mobilise support across vast distances. Additionally, technological advancements can lead to shifts in economic structures, labour markets, and even cultural practices. While technology can facilitate positive change, it can also exacerbate inequalities and create new challenges, highlighting the dual-edged nature of technological influence on society. An example of this is the modern internet and mobile phones. Most young people today probably cannot imagine life without this technology. The social benefits are immense, but they are also harming personal lives.<br>

‘Future Shock’ is a book by American futurist Alvin Toffler, published in 1970, in which the author defines the term “future shock” as a certain psychological state of individuals and entire societies and a personal perception of “too much change in too short a period of time”. Alvin Toffler argues that society is undergoing an enormous structural change: a revolution from an industrial society to a “super-industrial society”. This change, he suggests, overwhelms people. He argues that the accelerated rate of technological and social change leaves people disconnected, suffering from “shattering stress and disorientation” – future shock. Toffler states that the majority of social problems are symptoms of future shock.<br>

The characteristics of an eruption depend on the magma’s viscosity and gas content.

Some argue that it is unfair for wealthy people to have access to better transportation simply because they can afford to pay for it. However, the whole purpose of money is to help people improve their own lives and those of their families. If money did not provide such advantages, it would not encourage people to work harder or develop their skills. Since people have the right to use their money to improve their own lives, there is no reason to object to private transportation.</div>
