        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He opened the new bag of coffee beans and inhaled, relishing the toasted aroma that his favourite brand of arabica gave off. Tipping the contents into the grinder’s basket, he enjoyed the satisfying clatter of the oily rubble, awaiting the revolution of the burrs that would allow them to perform the alchemy that hot water and their grinds could achieve.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This was a ritual for DCI Jack Hawksworth. Ever since his last trip to Australia to see his sister and her family, now living in Melbourne, coffee had taken on a new dimension for him. No longer did he swallow the muddy slurry from vending machines for something warming; now well-brewed caffeine had become a passion. Having tasted the delicious version of a piccolo in the Italian quarter of Melbourne – where unshaven men stood behind hissing, steaming machines twisting buttons and pressing levers that ultimately delivered a shot like liquid liquorice, topped by a layer of caramel-coloured crema – he now prided himself on attaining a similar magic at home.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He sat back now at the small breakfast table, satisfied with this morning’s brew. His laptop was open to read the news but he ignored the screen and instead stared out of the window and across the concrete complex of his temporary home. He’d worried this place might turn him melancholy but contemplated instead that life was looking up. Moving into this apartment while he decided where to live had been wise. And while its architecture seemed to contradict everything he might normally respond to, he enjoyed its convenience and ease. These last few weeks had been coloured by a watershed sense of arriving at peace. Two relationships in a row with intelligent women, both characterised by bright personalities and beauty, had ended horribly. How could one person have such poor luck as to have two lovers who were enmeshed in crime? Anne McEvoy turned to a life of crime after a difficult childhood; and this, Jack struggled to accept, forcing himself to move on, even though he’d never stopped loving her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then along came Lily. The sensitive florist had entered his world by chance and a sense of hope had begun to simmer. He had liked Lily enormously, although they both knew the&nbsp;relationship was doomed. Her Chinese parents had arranged a suitable marriage to a surgeon, but that was not the pain in his heart. The hurt that would never leave was that Lily never got to live her life. It had been snapped out by the sinister fiancé, and Jack had spent a year now trying to regain his faith; he felt he had failed both these women.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He sipped the coffee, allowing its richness to fill his senses and move him away from the past. Tapping the space bar, he watched the screen brighten and he read the headlines and their articles. Most disturbing was the report that a three-year-old child called Madeleine had gone missing during a family holiday in Portugal; he couldn’t imagine a more terrifying scenario for a parent. He wondered how the Europe Desk that he headed up at Scotland Yard might be drawn into the case. There would be a media circus to contend with, and Jack began to imagine the emotional energy building within police from both countries, which would be about to explode. Moving on, he scanned the usual depressing facts: Manchester United had won yet another Premier League final, and Britain had come joint second to last in the Eurovision Song Contest. He sighed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jack shifted to the newspaper; if technology continued the way it was, he imagined that one day he might read the news via his phone – now what a crazy world that would be. He shook his head, feeling old, and kept turning the pages; he was now simply scanning, thinking about a second coffee, knowing he should probably get to work. He’d only had the briefest of sleeps, having left the Europe Desk in the small hours and not been able to drift off happily, so he’d been up by five for a run. He checked his watch; it was nearing eight. He was about to close the paper and start his day when a brief caught his attention.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jack’s forehead knitted with disgust, the good buzz of just moments ago beginning to ebb away as he read that Rupert Brownlow had been released a week earlier; that he was not giving interviews, had done his time and now just wanted to get on with his life.</p>

        <p>He sipped the coffee, allowing its richness to fill his senses and move him away from the past. Tapping the space bar, he watched the screen brighten and he read the headlines and their articles. Most disturbing was the report that a three-year-old child called Madeleine had gone missing during a family holiday in Portugal; he couldn’t imagine a more terrifying scenario for a parent. He wondered how the Europe Desk that he headed up at Scotland Yard might be drawn into the case. There would be a media circus to contend with, and Jack began to imagine the emotional energy building within police from both countries, which would be about to explode. Moving on, he scanned the usual depressing facts: Manchester United had won yet another Premier League final, and Britain had come joint second to last in the Eurovision Song Contest. He sighed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jack shifted to the newspaper; if technology continued the way it was, he imagined that one day he might read the news via his phone – now what a crazy world that would be. He shook his head, feeling old, and kept turning the pages; he was now simply scanning, thinking about a second coffee, knowing he should probably get to work. He’d only had the briefest of sleeps, having left the Europe Desk in the small hours and not been able to drift off happily, so he’d been up by five for a run. He checked his watch; it was nearing eight. He was about to close the paper and start his day when a brief caught his attention.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jack’s forehead knitted with disgust, the good buzz of just moments ago beginning to ebb away as he read that Rupert Brownlow had been released a week earlier; that he was not giving interviews, had done his time and now just wanted to get on with his life.</p>

        <p>He opened the new bag of coffee beans and inhaled, relishing the toasted aroma that his favourite brand of arabica gave off. Tipping the contents into the grinder’s basket, he enjoyed the satisfying clatter of the oily rubble, awaiting the revolution of the burrs that would allow them to perform the alchemy that hot water and their grinds could achieve.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This was a ritual for DCI Jack Hawksworth. Ever since his last trip to Australia to see his sister and her family, now living in Melbourne, coffee had taken on a new dimension for him. No longer did he swallow the muddy slurry from vending machines for something warming; now well-brewed caffeine had become a passion. Having tasted the delicious version of a piccolo in the Italian quarter of Melbourne – where unshaven men stood behind hissing, steaming machines twisting buttons and pressing levers that ultimately delivered a shot like liquid liquorice, topped by a layer of caramel-coloured crema – he now prided himself on attaining a similar magic at home.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He sat back now at the small breakfast table, satisfied with this morning’s brew. His laptop was open to read the news but he ignored the screen and instead stared out of the window and across the concrete complex of his temporary home. He’d worried this place might turn him melancholy but contemplated instead that life was looking up. Moving into this apartment while he decided where to live had been wise. And while its architecture seemed to contradict everything he might normally respond to, he enjoyed its convenience and ease. These last few weeks had been coloured by a watershed sense of arriving at peace. Two relationships in a row with intelligent women, both characterised by bright personalities and beauty, had ended horribly. How could one person have such poor luck as to have two lovers who were enmeshed in crime? Anne McEvoy turned to a life of crime after a difficult childhood; and this, Jack struggled to accept, forcing himself to move on, even though he’d never stopped loving her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then along came Lily. The sensitive florist had entered his world by chance and a sense of hope had begun to simmer. He had liked Lily enormously, although they both knew the&nbsp;relationship was doomed. Her Chinese parents had arranged a suitable marriage to a surgeon, but that was not the pain in his heart. The hurt that would never leave was that Lily never got to live her life. It had been snapped out by the sinister fiancé, and Jack had spent a year now trying to regain his faith; he felt he had failed both these women.</p>

        <p class="txt-ctr"><strong>Mirror Man&nbsp;</strong><em>by Fiona McIntosh</em>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He opened the new bag of coffee beans and inhaled, relishing the toasted aroma that his favourite brand of arabica gave off. Tipping the contents into the grinder’s basket, he enjoyed the satisfying clatter of the oily rubble, awaiting the revolution of the burrs that would allow them to perform the alchemy that hot water and their grinds could achieve.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This was a ritual for DCI Jack Hawksworth. Ever since his last trip to Australia to see his sister and her family, now living in Melbourne, coffee had taken on a new dimension for him. No longer did he swallow the muddy slurry from vending machines for something warming; now well-brewed caffeine had become a passion. Having tasted the delicious version of a piccolo in the Italian quarter of Melbourne – where unshaven men stood behind hissing, steaming machines twisting buttons and pressing levers that ultimately delivered a shot like liquid liquorice, topped by a layer of caramel-coloured crema – he now prided himself on attaining a similar magic at home.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He sat back now at the small breakfast table, satisfied with this morning’s brew. His laptop was open to read the news but he ignored the screen and instead stared out of the window and across the concrete complex of his temporary home. He’d worried this place might turn him melancholy but contemplated instead that life was looking up. Moving into this apartment while he decided where to live had been wise. And while its architecture seemed to contradict everything he might normally respond to, he enjoyed its convenience and ease. These last few weeks had been coloured by a watershed sense of arriving at peace. Two relationships in a row with intelligent women, both characterised by bright personalities and beauty, had ended horribly. How could one person have such poor luck as to have two lovers who were enmeshed in crime? Anne McEvoy turned to a life of crime after a difficult childhood; and this, Jack struggled to accept, forcing himself to move on, even though he’d never stopped loving her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then along came Lily. The sensitive florist had entered his world by chance and a sense of hope had begun to simmer. He had liked Lily enormously, although they both knew the&nbsp;relationship was doomed. Her Chinese parents had arranged a suitable marriage to a surgeon, but that was not the pain in his heart. The hurt that would never leave was that Lily never got to live her life. It had been snapped out by the sinister fiancé, and Jack had spent a year now trying to regain his faith; he felt he had failed both these women.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He sipped the coffee, allowing its richness to fill his senses and move him away from the past. Tapping the space bar, he watched the screen brighten and he read the headlines and their articles. Most disturbing was the report that a three-year-old child called Madeleine had gone missing during a family holiday in Portugal; he couldn’t imagine a more terrifying scenario for a parent. He wondered how the Europe Desk that he headed up at Scotland Yard might be drawn into the case. There would be a media circus to contend with, and Jack began to imagine the emotional energy building within police from both countries, which would be about to explode. Moving on, he scanned the usual depressing facts: Manchester United had won yet another Premier League final, and Britain had come joint second to last in the Eurovision Song Contest. He sighed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jack shifted to the newspaper; if technology continued the way it was, he imagined that one day he might read the news via his phone – now what a crazy world that would be. He shook his head, feeling old, and kept turning the pages; he was now simply scanning, thinking about a second coffee, knowing he should probably get to work. He’d only had the briefest of sleeps, having left the Europe Desk in the small hours and not been able to drift off happily, so he’d been up by five for a run. He checked his watch; it was nearing eight. He was about to close the paper and start his day when a brief caught his attention.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jack’s forehead knitted with disgust, the good buzz of just moments ago beginning to ebb away as he read that Rupert Brownlow had been released a week earlier; that he was not giving interviews, had done his time and now just wanted to get on with his life.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Children living in poverty often lack access to quality education. Sometimes it’s because there are not enough quality schools, their parents cannot afford school fees, or because impoverished families need their children to work. Without a quality education, children grow up being unable to provide for their own children — thus the generational cycle of poverty.</p>
            <p>Living in poverty also means not being able to afford a doctor or medical treatment. It means no electricity, limited shelter, and often little to no food on the table. For young children, improper nutrition can mean stunting and wasting that permanently impact their development. In impoverished countries where many people lack access to clean water and sanitation, poverty means the spread of preventable diseases and the unnecessary death of children.</p>

            <p>Absolute poverty is when a person cannot afford the minimum nutrition, clothing, or shelter needs in their country.</p>
            <p>Relative poverty is a household income below a certain percentage, typically 50% or 60%, of the median income of that country. This measurement takes into consideration the subjective cost of participating in everyday life. For example, plumbing is a necessity in some places; without plumbing, a person could be considered impoverished. But, in other places plumbing is a luxury. Relative poverty is useful for considering income inequality within a country.</p>

            <p>Multidimensional poverty acknowledges that poverty isn’t always about income. Sometimes a person’s income might be above the poverty line, but their family has no electricity, no access to a proper toilet, no clean drinking water, and no one in the family has completed six years of school.</p>
            <p>Within the categories of health, education, and living standards, there are 10 key indicators of multidimensional poverty that include nutrition, child mortality, years of schooling, school attendance, cooking fuel, sanitation, drinking water, electricity, housing, and assets. If a person is experiencing deprivation in three or more of these standards, then he or she is multidimensionally poor.</p>

            <p>A poverty line, also called a poverty threshold, is the line below which it is difficult, if not impossible, to afford basic needs. The poverty line is determined in each country by adding up the cost of meeting minimum needs, such as food and shelter. Household incomes that are too low to afford minimum needs, such as food and shelter, are below the poverty line.</p>
            <p>The income necessary to afford meeting minimum needs typically sets the poverty line for a country. Poverty lines can then be compared between countries. The international poverty line is the standard poverty line for measuring poverty globally. However, relatively new measures such as the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index include measurements of health, education, and living standards, all as signs of poverty.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Children living in poverty often lack access to quality education. Sometimes it’s because there are not enough quality schools, their parents cannot afford school fees, or because impoverished families need their children to work. Without a quality education, children grow up being unable to provide for their own children — thus the generational cycle of poverty.</p>
            <p>Living in poverty also means not being able to afford a doctor or medical treatment. It means no electricity, limited shelter, and often little to no food on the table. For young children, improper nutrition can mean stunting and wasting that permanently impact their development. In impoverished countries where many people lack access to clean water and sanitation, poverty means the spread of preventable diseases and the unnecessary death of children.</p>

            <p>Absolute poverty is when a person cannot afford the minimum nutrition, clothing, or shelter needs in their country.</p>
            <p>Relative poverty is a household income below a certain percentage, typically 50% or 60%, of the median income of that country. This measurement takes into consideration the subjective cost of participating in everyday life. For example, plumbing is a necessity in some places; without plumbing, a person could be considered impoverished. But, in other places plumbing is a luxury. Relative poverty is useful for considering income inequality within a country.</p>

            <p>Multidimensional poverty acknowledges that poverty isn’t always about income. Sometimes a person’s income might be above the poverty line, but their family has no electricity, no access to a proper toilet, no clean drinking water, and no one in the family has completed six years of school.</p>
            <p>Within the categories of health, education, and living standards, there are 10 key indicators of multidimensional poverty that include nutrition, child mortality, years of schooling, school attendance, cooking fuel, sanitation, drinking water, electricity, housing, and assets. If a person is experiencing deprivation in three or more of these standards, then he or she is multidimensionally poor.</p>

            <p>A poverty line, also called a poverty threshold, is the line below which it is difficult, if not impossible, to afford basic needs. The poverty line is determined in each country by adding up the cost of meeting minimum needs, such as food and shelter. Household incomes that are too low to afford minimum needs, such as food and shelter, are below the poverty line.</p>
            <p>The income necessary to afford meeting minimum needs typically sets the poverty line for a country. Poverty lines can then be compared between countries. The international poverty line is the standard poverty line for measuring poverty globally. However, relatively new measures such as the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index include measurements of health, education, and living standards, all as signs of poverty.</p>

            <p>Multidimensional poverty acknowledges that poverty isn’t always about income. Sometimes a person’s income might be above the poverty line, but their family has no electricity, no access to a proper toilet, no clean drinking water, and no one in the family has completed six years of school.</p>
            <p>Within the categories of health, education, and living standards, there are 10 key indicators of multidimensional poverty that include nutrition, child mortality, years of schooling, school attendance, cooking fuel, sanitation, drinking water, electricity, housing, and assets. If a person is experiencing deprivation in three or more of these standards, then he or she is multidimensionally poor.</p>

            <p>A poverty line, also called a poverty threshold, is the line below which it is difficult, if not impossible, to afford basic needs. The poverty line is determined in each country by adding up the cost of meeting minimum needs, such as food and shelter. Household incomes that are too low to afford minimum needs, such as food and shelter, are below the poverty line.</p>
            <p>The income necessary to afford meeting minimum needs typically sets the poverty line for a country. Poverty lines can then be compared between countries. The international poverty line is the standard poverty line for measuring poverty globally. However, relatively new measures such as the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index include measurements of health, education, and living standards, all as signs of poverty.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Children living in poverty often lack access to quality education. Sometimes it’s because there are not enough quality schools, their parents cannot afford school fees, or because impoverished families need their children to work. Without a quality education, children grow up being unable to provide for their own children — thus the generational cycle of poverty.</p>
            <p>Living in poverty also means not being able to afford a doctor or medical treatment. It means no electricity, limited shelter, and often little to no food on the table. For young children, improper nutrition can mean stunting and wasting that permanently impact their development. In impoverished countries where many people lack access to clean water and sanitation, poverty means the spread of preventable diseases and the unnecessary death of children.</p>

            <p>Absolute poverty is when a person cannot afford the minimum nutrition, clothing, or shelter needs in their country.</p>
            <p>Relative poverty is a household income below a certain percentage, typically 50% or 60%, of the median income of that country. This measurement takes into consideration the subjective cost of participating in everyday life. For example, plumbing is a necessity in some places; without plumbing, a person could be considered impoverished. But, in other places plumbing is a luxury. Relative poverty is useful for considering income inequality within a country.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Children living in poverty often lack access to quality education. Sometimes it’s because there are not enough quality schools, their parents cannot afford school fees, or because impoverished families need their children to work. Without a quality education, children grow up being unable to provide for their own children — thus the generational cycle of poverty.</p>
            <p>Living in poverty also means not being able to afford a doctor or medical treatment. It means no electricity, limited shelter, and often little to no food on the table. For young children, improper nutrition can mean stunting and wasting that permanently impact their development. In impoverished countries where many people lack access to clean water and sanitation, poverty means the spread of preventable diseases and the unnecessary death of children.</p>

            <p>Absolute poverty is when a person cannot afford the minimum nutrition, clothing, or shelter needs in their country.</p>
            <p>Relative poverty is a household income below a certain percentage, typically 50% or 60%, of the median income of that country. This measurement takes into consideration the subjective cost of participating in everyday life. For example, plumbing is a necessity in some places; without plumbing, a person could be considered impoverished. But, in other places plumbing is a luxury. Relative poverty is useful for considering income inequality within a country.</p>

            <p>Multidimensional poverty acknowledges that poverty isn’t always about income. Sometimes a person’s income might be above the poverty line, but their family has no electricity, no access to a proper toilet, no clean drinking water, and no one in the family has completed six years of school.</p>
            <p>Within the categories of health, education, and living standards, there are 10 key indicators of multidimensional poverty that include nutrition, child mortality, years of schooling, school attendance, cooking fuel, sanitation, drinking water, electricity, housing, and assets. If a person is experiencing deprivation in three or more of these standards, then he or she is multidimensionally poor.</p>

            <p>A poverty line, also called a poverty threshold, is the line below which it is difficult, if not impossible, to afford basic needs. The poverty line is determined in each country by adding up the cost of meeting minimum needs, such as food and shelter. Household incomes that are too low to afford minimum needs, such as food and shelter, are below the poverty line.</p>
            <p>The income necessary to afford meeting minimum needs typically sets the poverty line for a country. Poverty lines can then be compared between countries. The international poverty line is the standard poverty line for measuring poverty globally. However, relatively new measures such as the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index include measurements of health, education, and living standards, all as signs of poverty.</p>

This measurement takes into consideration the subjective cost of participating in everyday life. For example, plumbing is a necessity in some places; without plumbing, a person could be considered impoverished. But, in other places plumbing is a luxury. Relative poverty is useful for considering income inequality within a country.</p>

            <p>Multidimensional poverty acknowledges that poverty isn’t always about income. Sometimes a person’s income might be above the poverty line, but their family has no electricity, no access to a proper toilet, no clean drinking water, and no one in the family has completed six years of school.</p>
            <p>Within the categories of health, education, and living standards, there are 10 key indicators of multidimensional poverty that include nutrition, child mortality, years of schooling, school attendance, cooking fuel, sanitation, drinking water, electricity, housing, and assets. If a person is experiencing deprivation in three or more of these standards, then he or she is multidimensionally poor.</p>

            <p>A poverty line, also called a poverty threshold, is the line below which it is difficult, if not impossible, to afford basic needs. The poverty line is determined in each country by adding up the cost of meeting minimum needs, such as food and shelter. Household incomes that are too low to afford minimum needs, such as food and shelter, are below the poverty line.</p>
            <p>The income necessary to afford meeting minimum needs typically sets the poverty line for a country. Poverty lines can then be compared between countries. The international poverty line is the standard poverty line for measuring poverty globally. However, relatively new measures such as the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index include measurements of health, education, and living standards, all as signs of poverty.</p>

            <p>Children living in poverty often lack access to quality education. Sometimes it’s because there are not enough quality schools, their parents cannot afford school fees, or because impoverished families need their children to work. Without a quality education, children grow up being unable to provide for their own children — thus the generational cycle of poverty.</p>
            <p>Living in poverty also means not being able to afford a doctor or medical treatment. It means no electricity, limited shelter, and often little to no food on the table. For young children, improper nutrition can mean stunting and wasting that permanently impact their development. In impoverished countries where many people lack access to clean water and sanitation, poverty means the spread of preventable diseases and the unnecessary death of children.</p>

            <p>Children living in poverty often lack access to quality education. Sometimes it’s because there are not enough quality schools, their parents cannot afford school fees, or because impoverished families need their children to work. Without a quality education, children grow up being unable to provide for their own children — thus the generational cycle of poverty.</p>
            <p>Living in poverty also means not being able to afford a doctor or medical treatment. It means no electricity, limited shelter, and often little to no food on the table. For young children, improper nutrition can mean stunting and wasting that permanently impact their development. In impoverished countries where many people lack access to clean water and sanitation, poverty means the spread of preventable diseases and the unnecessary death of children.</p>

            <p>Absolute poverty is when a person cannot afford the minimum nutrition, clothing, or shelter needs in their country.</p>
            <p>Relative poverty is a household income below a certain percentage, typically 50% or 60%, of the median income of that country. This measurement takes into consideration the subjective cost of participating in everyday life. For example, plumbing is a necessity in some places; without plumbing, a person could be considered impoverished. But, in other places plumbing is a luxury. Relative poverty is useful for considering income inequality within a country.</p>

            <p>Multidimensional poverty acknowledges that poverty isn’t always about income. Sometimes a person’s income might be above the poverty line, but their family has no electricity, no access to a proper toilet, no clean drinking water, and no one in the family has completed six years of school.</p>
            <p>Within the categories of health, education, and living standards, there are 10 key indicators of multidimensional poverty that include nutrition, child mortality, years of schooling, school attendance, cooking fuel, sanitation, drinking water, electricity, housing, and assets. If a person is experiencing deprivation in three or more of these standards, then he or she is multidimensionally poor.</p>

            <p>A poverty line, also called a poverty threshold, is the line below which it is difficult, if not impossible, to afford basic needs. The poverty line is determined in each country by adding up the cost of meeting minimum needs, such as food and shelter. Household incomes that are too low to afford minimum needs, such as food and shelter, are below the poverty line.</p>
            <p>The income necessary to afford meeting minimum needs typically sets the poverty line for a country. Poverty lines can then be compared between countries. The international poverty line is the standard poverty line for measuring poverty globally. However, relatively new measures such as the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index include measurements of health, education, and living standards, all as signs of poverty.</p>

For young children, improper nutrition can mean stunting and wasting that permanently impact their development. In impoverished countries where many people lack access to clean water and sanitation, poverty means the spread of preventable diseases and the unnecessary death of children.</p>

            <p>Absolute poverty is when a person cannot afford the minimum nutrition, clothing, or shelter needs in their country.</p>
            <p>Relative poverty is a household income below a certain percentage, typically 50% or 60%, of the median income of that country. This measurement takes into consideration the subjective cost of participating in everyday life. For example, plumbing is a necessity in some places; without plumbing, a person could be considered impoverished. But, in other places plumbing is a luxury. Relative poverty is useful for considering income inequality within a country.</p>

            <p>Multidimensional poverty acknowledges that poverty isn’t always about income. Sometimes a person’s income might be above the poverty line, but their family has no electricity, no access to a proper toilet, no clean drinking water, and no one in the family has completed six years of school.</p>
            <p>Within the categories of health, education, and living standards, there are 10 key indicators of multidimensional poverty that include nutrition, child mortality, years of schooling, school attendance, cooking fuel, sanitation, drinking water, electricity, housing, and assets. If a person is experiencing deprivation in three or more of these standards, then he or she is multidimensionally poor.</p>

            <p>A poverty line, also called a poverty threshold, is the line below which it is difficult, if not impossible, to afford basic needs. The poverty line is determined in each country by adding up the cost of meeting minimum needs, such as food and shelter. Household incomes that are too low to afford minimum needs, such as food and shelter, are below the poverty line.</p>
            <p>The income necessary to afford meeting minimum needs typically sets the poverty line for a country. Poverty lines can then be compared between countries. The international poverty line is the standard poverty line for measuring poverty globally. However, relatively new measures such as the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index include measurements of health, education, and living standards, all as signs of poverty.</p>
