        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; ST. CLAIR—Barely a teenager, a stranger in a strange land, learning a foreign language, adapting to a new family dynamic . . . you could excuse Addis Habtewold if he chose to run and hide.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;Well, Habtewold is running, but in clear view—at the head of the field in every cross-country race he enters.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;Not quite three years since he left his native Ethiopia, Habtewold is the talk of the running community.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;After Thursday’s Marysville Invitational, Habtewold, a 15-year-old sophomore at St. Clair High School, has won all 10 races in which he had competed, setting eight course records in the process.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;“A coach is lucky to have a kid like Addis come around once in a lifetime,” St. Clair coach Jon Davidson said. “Any coach would be shocked to see the type of results Addis has produced.”</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;Area coaches who have seen him rave about his unlimited potential. But his work ethic and personality most impress his coach and teammates.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;“He’s one of the fastest guys in the state, [but] he’s not arrogant in the least,” Davidson said. “He’s very humble, works hard and wants to be the best.”</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;Habtewold, who is 5-foot-4 and 115 pounds, has lofty goals.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;He wants to be a state champion in his first year in the sport—his best time, a school-record 15 minutes, 35 seconds, is second in the state to Landon Peacock of&nbsp;Cedar Springs (15:11). Habtewold also wants to run in college and become an Olympic gold medalist, like his native countryman, Haile Gebrselassie.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;It’s a tall order, but Habtewold is used to accomplishing much in a hurry. Since moving to the United States, he has learned English well enough to earn As and Bs. And, in less than a year, he has developed into an elite high school athlete.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;“I love running,” Habtewold said. “I feel like I’m missing something if I miss a day.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;“I’m surprised I’ve done this well. I’m breaking records. I want to thank my coach, friends, teammates and parents.Without their support, I’d never been able to accomplish what I have so far.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Coming to America</strong>
        </p>
        <p>13<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Habtewold had little interest in running when he was younger. He played soccer in Ethiopia. The only time he ran, he says, was when he was late to school.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;“Addis, his older sister, Miti (21), and younger brother, Eyob (14), were orphaned and living with my mother,” said Jerusalem Lothschutz, who, with her husband, Jim Lothschutz, eventually adopted them and brought them to the United States. “His mother was my sister. They grew up in the capital city of Addis Ababa where I grew up and went to school.”</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;Jim Lothschutz, a vice principal at Hamtramck High School, was a teacher at International School in Ethiopia when he met Jerusalem, who worked in the computer lab. They married in 1997 and adopted Addis, Miti and Eyob. They have two other children, Gabbi, 6, and Sammy, 4. Miti lives in Grand<br>
Haven and attends Grand Rapids Community College. Eyob is a freshman on the varsity soccer team at St. Clair and plans to run track in the spring.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;Jerusalem and Jim moved to the United States in 1998. But it took four years for the adoption to be recognized by the American government, and Addis, Miti and Eyob didn’t touch American soil until December 2002 in Godwin Heights near Grand Rapids. They moved to St. Clair last year.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp;Moving to America was obviously a tough transition for Addis and his siblings. His parents let them settle in before they studied English.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp;“Nine months after they settled in, they had to focus on English,” Jim Lothschutz said. “I gave them a tape player and language tapes and they had to listen to them two hours a day.”</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp;Jerusalem, who speaks fluent English, is proud of her children’s progress.</p>

        </p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;“They adapted much faster than I did,” she said. “They made friends and were involved in sports.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Fast Start</strong>
        </p>
        <p>21&nbsp; &nbsp;Habtewold was a starter on St. Clair’s soccer team as a freshman and a teammate of Davidson’s son, Colin.</p>
        <p>22&nbsp; &nbsp;The team ran two miles for conditioning<br>
before practice each day. Habtewold’s running impressed Colin, who told his father.</p>
        <p>23&nbsp; &nbsp;“Colin said, ‘You’ve got to see Addis run.’ I watched him and then recruited him from the soccer team,” Davidson said.</p>
        <p>24&nbsp; &nbsp;“We talked Addis into running with us after cross-country season. We had a big group, including a number of seniors, Addis and me, and we ran for six to eight miles.”</p>
        <p>25&nbsp; &nbsp;Jeff Standfest, now a cross-country runner at Oakland University, was part of that initial group.</p>
        <p>26&nbsp; &nbsp;“We got him to go out running with us one day in November,” Standfest said. “We ran six to eight miles, 6:20-minute miles, and Addis was running right with us, chewing gum and breathing through his nose. It was incredible.”</p>
        <p>27&nbsp; &nbsp;Habtewold recalls that first day, saying: “I ran eight miles and I was kind of sore the next day. It was a lot of fun. I ran the next day and pretty much every day after.”</p>
        <p>28&nbsp; &nbsp;Habtewold finished seventh in the 3,200-meter run at the Division 2 state meet. His success spiked his interest in cross country. During the summer, he trained by running hundreds of miles.</p>
        <p>29&nbsp; &nbsp;He has dominated the competition, his time of 15:54 topping a field of more than 1,000 runners at the Holly Invitational on Sept. 17.</p>
        <p>30&nbsp; &nbsp;Often, he says, he gets bored from running alone.</p>
        <p>31&nbsp; &nbsp;“My goals are to win and get my time down,” Habtewold said, “but sometimes I feel like quitting halfway through the race because I’m tired and running alone. Coach says I have to just suck it up and run through it.”</p>
        <p>32&nbsp; &nbsp;St. Clair junior Ben Holt said the team follows Habtewold’s lead.</p>
        <p>33&nbsp; &nbsp;“He’s not a captain, but he’s a leader by how he leads by example,” Holt said. “He makes sure we get our mileage in. He’s addicted to running.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Fitting In</strong><br>
34&nbsp; &nbsp;Addis has attacked his classes in the same manner in which he trains.</p>
        <p>35&nbsp; &nbsp;“Not being able to speak English was the most difficult thing for me,” Addis said.&nbsp;“My mom and dad really helped me with my reading and speaking. I still have some trouble with my reading. Life is good here. Everything is way different. The school enforces rules more than they did in Ethiopia, and I like that. People have been friendly to me. I have more opportunities to do sports, too.</p>
        <p>36&nbsp; &nbsp;“I write to my friends back home. Everyone from my country talks about how nice my mom and dad are to us. Back in Ethiopia, it’s a big thing to come to America. We’re very fortunate.”</p>
        <p>37&nbsp; &nbsp;Patty McCormick works with Addis every day.</p>
        <p>38&nbsp; &nbsp;“Think about how difficult it would be for us to go to a foreign country and study in their language,” McCormick said. “Addis is very respectful and does what I ask of him. The difference from last year to this has been remarkable. He expresses his ideas more fluidly and has a better grasp of our language.</p>
        <p>39&nbsp; &nbsp;“We go through his daily planner every day. He’s taking physics, math, English literature and history. He needs help with his grammar and spelling. I brainstorm with him, but he develops his ideas and I help him write it down and transcribe it. He types it out. He’s a great kid.”</p>
        <p>40&nbsp; &nbsp;Habtewold dreams of being famous one day.</p>
        <p>41&nbsp; &nbsp;“I know I’ll have the chance if I keep my grades up and continue to work hard,” he said. “I have a great opportunity here.”</p>

        <p>36&nbsp; &nbsp;“I write to my friends back home. Everyone from my country talks about how nice my mom and dad are to us. Back in Ethiopia, it’s a big thing to come to America. We’re very fortunate.”</p>
        <p>37&nbsp; &nbsp;Patty McCormick works with Addis every day.</p>
        <p>38&nbsp; &nbsp;“Think about how difficult it would be for us to go to a foreign country and study in their language,” McCormick said. “Addis is very respectful and does what I ask of him. The difference from last year to this has been remarkable. He expresses his ideas more fluidly and has a better grasp of our language.</p>
        <p>39&nbsp; &nbsp;“We go through his daily planner every day. He’s taking physics, math, English literature and history. He needs help with his grammar and spelling. I brainstorm with him, but he develops his ideas and I help him write it down and transcribe it. He types it out. He’s a great kid.”</p>
        <p>40&nbsp; &nbsp;Habtewold dreams of being famous one day.</p>
        <p>41&nbsp; &nbsp;“I know I’ll have the chance if I keep my grades up and continue to work hard,” he said. “I have a great opportunity here.”</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; ST. CLAIR—Barely a teenager, a stranger in a strange land, learning a foreign language, adapting to a new family dynamic . . . you could excuse Addis Habtewold if he chose to run and hide.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;Well, Habtewold is running, but in clear view—at the head of the field in every cross-country race he enters.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;Not quite three years since he left his native Ethiopia, Habtewold is the talk of the running community.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;After Thursday’s Marysville Invitational, Habtewold, a 15-year-old sophomore at St. Clair High School, has won all 10 races in which he had competed, setting eight course records in the process.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;“A coach is lucky to have a kid like Addis come around once in a lifetime,” St. Clair coach Jon Davidson said. “Any coach would be shocked to see the type of results Addis has produced.”</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;Area coaches who have seen him rave about his unlimited potential. But his work ethic and personality most impress his coach and teammates.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;“He’s one of the fastest guys in the state, [but] he’s not arrogant in the least,” Davidson said. “He’s very humble, works hard and wants to be the best.”</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;Habtewold, who is 5-foot-4 and 115 pounds, has lofty goals.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;He wants to be a state champion in his first year in the sport—his best time, a school-record 15 minutes, 35 seconds, is second in the state to Landon Peacock of&nbsp;Cedar Springs (15:11). Habtewold also wants to run in college and become an Olympic gold medalist, like his native countryman, Haile Gebrselassie.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;It’s a tall order, but Habtewold is used to accomplishing much in a hurry. Since moving to the United States, he has learned English well enough to earn As and Bs. And, in less than a year, he has developed into an elite high school athlete.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;“I love running,” Habtewold said. “I feel like I’m missing something if I miss a day.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;“I’m surprised I’ve done this well. I’m breaking records. I want to thank my coach, friends, teammates and parents.Without their support, I’d never been able to accomplish what I have so far.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Coming to America</strong>
        </p>
        <p>13<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Habtewold had little interest in running when he was younger. He played soccer in Ethiopia. The only time he ran, he says, was when he was late to school.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;“Addis, his older sister, Miti (21), and younger brother, Eyob (14), were orphaned and living with my mother,” said Jerusalem Lothschutz, who, with her husband, Jim Lothschutz, eventually adopted them and brought them to the United States. “His mother was my sister. They grew up in the capital city of Addis Ababa where I grew up and went to school.”</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;Jim Lothschutz, a vice principal at Hamtramck High School, was a teacher at International School in Ethiopia when he met Jerusalem, who worked in the computer lab. They married in 1997 and adopted Addis, Miti and Eyob. They have two other children, Gabbi, 6, and Sammy, 4. Miti lives in Grand<br>
Haven and attends Grand Rapids Community College. Eyob is a freshman on the varsity soccer team at St. Clair and plans to run track in the spring.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;Jerusalem and Jim moved to the United States in 1998. But it took four years for the adoption to be recognized by the American government, and Addis, Miti and Eyob didn’t touch American soil until December 2002 in Godwin Heights near Grand Rapids. They moved to St. Clair last year.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp;Moving to America was obviously a tough transition for Addis and his siblings. His parents let them settle in before they studied English.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp;“Nine months after they settled in, they had to focus on English,” Jim Lothschutz said. “I gave them a tape player and language tapes and they had to listen to them two hours a day.”</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp;Jerusalem, who speaks fluent English, is proud of her children’s progress.</p>

        </p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;“They adapted much faster than I did,” she said. “They made friends and were involved in sports.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Fast Start</strong>
        </p>
        <p>21&nbsp; &nbsp;Habtewold was a starter on St. Clair’s soccer team as a freshman and a teammate of Davidson’s son, Colin.</p>
        <p>22&nbsp; &nbsp;The team ran two miles for conditioning<br>
before practice each day. Habtewold’s running impressed Colin, who told his father.</p>
        <p>23&nbsp; &nbsp;“Colin said, ‘You’ve got to see Addis run.’ I watched him and then recruited him from the soccer team,” Davidson said.</p>
        <p>24&nbsp; &nbsp;“We talked Addis into running with us after cross-country season. We had a big group, including a number of seniors, Addis and me, and we ran for six to eight miles.”</p>
        <p>25&nbsp; &nbsp;Jeff Standfest, now a cross-country runner at Oakland University, was part of that initial group.</p>
        <p>26&nbsp; &nbsp;“We got him to go out running with us one day in November,” Standfest said. “We ran six to eight miles, 6:20-minute miles, and Addis was running right with us, chewing gum and breathing through his nose. It was incredible.”</p>
        <p>27&nbsp; &nbsp;Habtewold recalls that first day, saying: “I ran eight miles and I was kind of sore the next day. It was a lot of fun. I ran the next day and pretty much every day after.”</p>
        <p>28&nbsp; &nbsp;Habtewold finished seventh in the 3,200-meter run at the Division 2 state meet. His success spiked his interest in cross country. During the summer, he trained by running hundreds of miles.</p>
        <p>29&nbsp; &nbsp;He has dominated the competition, his time of 15:54 topping a field of more than 1,000 runners at the Holly Invitational on Sept. 17.</p>
        <p>30&nbsp; &nbsp;Often, he says, he gets bored from running alone.</p>
        <p>31&nbsp; &nbsp;“My goals are to win and get my time down,” Habtewold said, “but sometimes I feel like quitting halfway through the race because I’m tired and running alone. Coach says I have to just suck it up and run through it.”</p>
        <p>32&nbsp; &nbsp;St. Clair junior Ben Holt said the team follows Habtewold’s lead.</p>
        <p>33&nbsp; &nbsp;“He’s not a captain, but he’s a leader by how he leads by example,” Holt said. “He makes sure we get our mileage in. He’s addicted to running.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Fitting In</strong><br>
34&nbsp; &nbsp;Addis has attacked his classes in the same manner in which he trains.</p>
        <p>35&nbsp; &nbsp;“Not being able to speak English was the most difficult thing for me,” Addis said.&nbsp;“My mom and dad really helped me with my reading and speaking. I still have some trouble with my reading. Life is good here. Everything is way different. The school enforces rules more than they did in Ethiopia, and I like that. People have been friendly to me. I have more opportunities to do sports, too.</p>
        <p>36&nbsp; &nbsp;“I write to my friends back home. Everyone from my country talks about how nice my mom and dad are to us. Back in Ethiopia, it’s a big thing to come to America. We’re very fortunate.”</p>
        <p>37&nbsp; &nbsp;Patty McCormick works with Addis every day.</p>
        <p>38&nbsp; &nbsp;“Think about how difficult it would be for us to go to a foreign country and study in their language,” McCormick said. “Addis is very respectful and does what I ask of him. The difference from last year to this has been remarkable. He expresses his ideas more fluidly and has a better grasp of our language.</p>
        <p>39&nbsp; &nbsp;“We go through his daily planner every day. He’s taking physics, math, English literature and history. He needs help with his grammar and spelling. I brainstorm with him, but he develops his ideas and I help him write it down and transcribe it. He types it out. He’s a great kid.”</p>
        <p>40&nbsp; &nbsp;Habtewold dreams of being famous one day.</p>
        <p>41&nbsp; &nbsp;“I know I’ll have the chance if I keep my grades up and continue to work hard,” he said. “I have a great opportunity here.”</p>

        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; ST. CLAIR—Barely a teenager, a stranger in a strange land, learning a foreign language, adapting to a new family dynamic . . . you could excuse Addis Habtewold if he chose to run and hide.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;Well, Habtewold is running, but in clear view—at the head of the field in every cross-country race he enters.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;Not quite three years since he left his native Ethiopia, Habtewold is the talk of the running community.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;After Thursday’s Marysville Invitational, Habtewold, a 15-year-old sophomore at St. Clair High School, has won all 10 races in which he had competed, setting eight course records in the process.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;“A coach is lucky to have a kid like Addis come around once in a lifetime,” St. Clair coach Jon Davidson said. “Any coach would be shocked to see the type of results Addis has produced.”</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;Area coaches who have seen him rave about his unlimited potential. But his work ethic and personality most impress his coach and teammates.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;“He’s one of the fastest guys in the state, [but] he’s not arrogant in the least,” Davidson said. “He’s very humble, works hard and wants to be the best.”</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;Habtewold, who is 5-foot-4 and 115 pounds, has lofty goals.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;He wants to be a state champion in his first year in the sport—his best time, a school-record 15 minutes, 35 seconds, is second in the state to Landon Peacock of&nbsp;Cedar Springs (15:11). Habtewold also wants to run in college and become an Olympic gold medalist, like his native countryman, Haile Gebrselassie.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;It’s a tall order, but Habtewold is used to accomplishing much in a hurry. Since moving to the United States, he has learned English well enough to earn As and Bs. And, in less than a year, he has developed into an elite high school athlete.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;“I love running,” Habtewold said. “I feel like I’m missing something if I miss a day.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;“I’m surprised I’ve done this well. I’m breaking records. I want to thank my coach, friends, teammates and parents.Without their support, I’d never been able to accomplish what I have so far.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Coming to America</strong>
        </p>
        <p>13<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Habtewold had little interest in running when he was younger. He played soccer in Ethiopia. The only time he ran, he says, was when he was late to school.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;“Addis, his older sister, Miti (21), and younger brother, Eyob (14), were orphaned and living with my mother,” said Jerusalem Lothschutz, who, with her husband, Jim Lothschutz, eventually adopted them and brought them to the United States. “His mother was my sister. They grew up in the capital city of Addis Ababa where I grew up and went to school.”</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;Jim Lothschutz, a vice principal at Hamtramck High School, was a teacher at International School in Ethiopia when he met Jerusalem, who worked in the computer lab. They married in 1997 and adopted Addis, Miti and Eyob. They have two other children, Gabbi, 6, and Sammy, 4. Miti lives in Grand<br>
Haven and attends Grand Rapids Community College. Eyob is a freshman on the varsity soccer team at St. Clair and plans to run track in the spring.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;Jerusalem and Jim moved to the United States in 1998. But it took four years for the adoption to be recognized by the American government, and Addis, Miti and Eyob didn’t touch American soil until December 2002 in Godwin Heights near Grand Rapids. They moved to St. Clair last year.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp;Moving to America was obviously a tough transition for Addis and his siblings. His parents let them settle in before they studied English.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp;“Nine months after they settled in, they had to focus on English,” Jim Lothschutz said. “I gave them a tape player and language tapes and they had to listen to them two hours a day.”</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp;Jerusalem, who speaks fluent English, is proud of her children’s progress.</p>

        </p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;“They adapted much faster than I did,” she said. “They made friends and were involved in sports.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Fast Start</strong>
        </p>
        <p>21&nbsp; &nbsp;Habtewold was a starter on St. Clair’s soccer team as a freshman and a teammate of Davidson’s son, Colin.</p>
        <p>22&nbsp; &nbsp;The team ran two miles for conditioning<br>
before practice each day. Habtewold’s running impressed Colin, who told his father.</p>
        <p>23&nbsp; &nbsp;“Colin said, ‘You’ve got to see Addis run.’ I watched him and then recruited him from the soccer team,” Davidson said.</p>
        <p>24&nbsp; &nbsp;“We talked Addis into running with us after cross-country season. We had a big group, including a number of seniors, Addis and me, and we ran for six to eight miles.”</p>
        <p>25&nbsp; &nbsp;Jeff Standfest, now a cross-country runner at Oakland University, was part of that initial group.</p>
        <p>26&nbsp; &nbsp;“We got him to go out running with us one day in November,” Standfest said. “We ran six to eight miles, 6:20-minute miles, and Addis was running right with us, chewing gum and breathing through his nose. It was incredible.”</p>
        <p>27&nbsp; &nbsp;Habtewold recalls that first day, saying: “I ran eight miles and I was kind of sore the next day. It was a lot of fun. I ran the next day and pretty much every day after.”</p>
        <p>28&nbsp; &nbsp;Habtewold finished seventh in the 3,200-meter run at the Division 2 state meet. His success spiked his interest in cross country. During the summer, he trained by running hundreds of miles.</p>
        <p>29&nbsp; &nbsp;He has dominated the competition, his time of 15:54 topping a field of more than 1,000 runners at the Holly Invitational on Sept. 17.</p>
        <p>30&nbsp; &nbsp;Often, he says, he gets bored from running alone.</p>
        <p>31&nbsp; &nbsp;“My goals are to win and get my time down,” Habtewold said, “but sometimes I feel like quitting halfway through the race because I’m tired and running alone. Coach says I have to just suck it up and run through it.”</p>
        <p>32&nbsp; &nbsp;St. Clair junior Ben Holt said the team follows Habtewold’s lead.</p>
        <p>33&nbsp; &nbsp;“He’s not a captain, but he’s a leader by how he leads by example,” Holt said. “He makes sure we get our mileage in. He’s addicted to running.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Fitting In</strong><br>
34&nbsp; &nbsp;Addis has attacked his classes in the same manner in which he trains.</p>
        <p>35&nbsp; &nbsp;“Not being able to speak English was the most difficult thing for me,” Addis said.&nbsp;“My mom and dad really helped me with my reading and speaking. I still have some trouble with my reading. Life is good here. Everything is way different. The school enforces rules more than they did in Ethiopia, and I like that. People have been friendly to me. I have more opportunities to do sports, too.</p>
        <p>36&nbsp; &nbsp;“I write to my friends back home. Everyone from my country talks about how nice my mom and dad are to us. Back in Ethiopia, it’s a big thing to come to America. We’re very fortunate.”</p>
        <p>37&nbsp; &nbsp;Patty McCormick works with Addis every day.</p>
        <p>38&nbsp; &nbsp;“Think about how difficult it would be for us to go to a foreign country and study in their language,” McCormick said. “Addis is very respectful and does what I ask of him. The difference from last year to this has been remarkable. He expresses his ideas more fluidly and has a better grasp of our language.</p>
        <p>39&nbsp; &nbsp;“We go through his daily planner every day. He’s taking physics, math, English literature and history. He needs help with his grammar and spelling. I brainstorm with him, but he develops his ideas and I help him write it down and transcribe it. He types it out. He’s a great kid.”</p>
        <p>40&nbsp; &nbsp;Habtewold dreams of being famous one day.</p>
        <p>41&nbsp; &nbsp;“I know I’ll have the chance if I keep my grades up and continue to work hard,” he said. “I have a great opportunity here.”</p>

        <p>38&nbsp; &nbsp;“Think about how difficult it would be for us to go to a foreign country and study in their language,” McCormick said. “Addis is very respectful and does what I ask of him. The difference from last year to this has been remarkable. He expresses his ideas more fluidly and has a better grasp of our language.</p>
        <p>39&nbsp; &nbsp;“We go through his daily planner every day. He’s taking physics, math, English literature and history. He needs help with his grammar and spelling. I brainstorm with him, but he develops his ideas and I help him write it down and transcribe it. He types it out. He’s a great kid.”</p>
        <p>40&nbsp; &nbsp;Habtewold dreams of being famous one day.</p>
        <p>41&nbsp; &nbsp;“I know I’ll have the chance if I keep my grades up and continue to work hard,” he said. “I have a great opportunity here.”</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; ST. CLAIR—Barely a teenager, a stranger in a strange land, learning a foreign language, adapting to a new family dynamic . . . you could excuse Addis Habtewold if he chose to run and hide.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;Well, Habtewold is running, but in clear view—at the head of the field in every cross-country race he enters.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;Not quite three years since he left his native Ethiopia, Habtewold is the talk of the running community.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;After Thursday’s Marysville Invitational, Habtewold, a 15-year-old sophomore at St. Clair High School, has won all 10 races in which he had competed, setting eight course records in the process.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;“A coach is lucky to have a kid like Addis come around once in a lifetime,” St. Clair coach Jon Davidson said. “Any coach would be shocked to see the type of results Addis has produced.”</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;Area coaches who have seen him rave about his unlimited potential. But his work ethic and personality most impress his coach and teammates.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;“He’s one of the fastest guys in the state, [but] he’s not arrogant in the least,” Davidson said. “He’s very humble, works hard and wants to be the best.”</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;Habtewold, who is 5-foot-4 and 115 pounds, has lofty goals.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;He wants to be a state champion in his first year in the sport—his best time, a school-record 15 minutes, 35 seconds, is second in the state to Landon Peacock of&nbsp;Cedar Springs (15:11). Habtewold also wants to run in college and become an Olympic gold medalist, like his native countryman, Haile Gebrselassie.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;It’s a tall order, but Habtewold is used to accomplishing much in a hurry. Since moving to the United States, he has learned English well enough to earn As and Bs. And, in less than a year, he has developed into an elite high school athlete.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;“I love running,” Habtewold said. “I feel like I’m missing something if I miss a day.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;“I’m surprised I’ve done this well. I’m breaking records. I want to thank my coach, friends, teammates and parents.Without their support, I’d never been able to accomplish what I have so far.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Coming to America</strong>
        </p>
        <p>13<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Habtewold had little interest in running when he was younger. He played soccer in Ethiopia. The only time he ran, he says, was when he was late to school.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;“Addis, his older sister, Miti (21), and younger brother, Eyob (14), were orphaned and living with my mother,” said Jerusalem Lothschutz, who, with her husband, Jim Lothschutz, eventually adopted them and brought them to the United States. “His mother was my sister. They grew up in the capital city of Addis Ababa where I grew up and went to school.”</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;Jim Lothschutz, a vice principal at Hamtramck High School, was a teacher at International School in Ethiopia when he met Jerusalem, who worked in the computer lab. They married in 1997 and adopted Addis, Miti and Eyob. They have two other children, Gabbi, 6, and Sammy, 4. Miti lives in Grand<br>
Haven and attends Grand Rapids Community College. Eyob is a freshman on the varsity soccer team at St. Clair and plans to run track in the spring.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;Jerusalem and Jim moved to the United States in 1998. But it took four years for the adoption to be recognized by the American government, and Addis, Miti and Eyob didn’t touch American soil until December 2002 in Godwin Heights near Grand Rapids. They moved to St. Clair last year.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp;Moving to America was obviously a tough transition for Addis and his siblings. His parents let them settle in before they studied English.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp;“Nine months after they settled in, they had to focus on English,” Jim Lothschutz said. “I gave them a tape player and language tapes and they had to listen to them two hours a day.”</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp;Jerusalem, who speaks fluent English, is proud of her children’s progress.</p>

        </p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;“They adapted much faster than I did,” she said. “They made friends and were involved in sports.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Fast Start</strong>
        </p>
        <p>21&nbsp; &nbsp;Habtewold was a starter on St. Clair’s soccer team as a freshman and a teammate of Davidson’s son, Colin.</p>
        <p>22&nbsp; &nbsp;The team ran two miles for conditioning<br>
before practice each day. Habtewold’s running impressed Colin, who told his father.</p>
        <p>23&nbsp; &nbsp;“Colin said, ‘You’ve got to see Addis run.’ I watched him and then recruited him from the soccer team,” Davidson said.</p>
        <p>24&nbsp; &nbsp;“We talked Addis into running with us after cross-country season. We had a big group, including a number of seniors, Addis and me, and we ran for six to eight miles.”</p>
        <p>25&nbsp; &nbsp;Jeff Standfest, now a cross-country runner at Oakland University, was part of that initial group.</p>
        <p>26&nbsp; &nbsp;“We got him to go out running with us one day in November,” Standfest said. “We ran six to eight miles, 6:20-minute miles, and Addis was running right with us, chewing gum and breathing through his nose. It was incredible.”</p>
        <p>27&nbsp; &nbsp;Habtewold recalls that first day, saying: “I ran eight miles and I was kind of sore the next day. It was a lot of fun. I ran the next day and pretty much every day after.”</p>
        <p>28&nbsp; &nbsp;Habtewold finished seventh in the 3,200-meter run at the Division 2 state meet. His success spiked his interest in cross country. During the summer, he trained by running hundreds of miles.</p>
        <p>29&nbsp; &nbsp;He has dominated the competition, his time of 15:54 topping a field of more than 1,000 runners at the Holly Invitational on Sept. 17.</p>
        <p>30&nbsp; &nbsp;Often, he says, he gets bored from running alone.</p>
        <p>31&nbsp; &nbsp;“My goals are to win and get my time down,” Habtewold said, “but sometimes I feel like quitting halfway through the race because I’m tired and running alone. Coach says I have to just suck it up and run through it.”</p>
        <p>32&nbsp; &nbsp;St. Clair junior Ben Holt said the team follows Habtewold’s lead.</p>
        <p>33&nbsp; &nbsp;“He’s not a captain, but he’s a leader by how he leads by example,” Holt said. “He makes sure we get our mileage in. He’s addicted to running.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Fitting In</strong><br>
34&nbsp; &nbsp;Addis has attacked his classes in the same manner in which he trains.</p>
        <p>35&nbsp; &nbsp;“Not being able to speak English was the most difficult thing for me,” Addis said.&nbsp;“My mom and dad really helped me with my reading and speaking. I still have some trouble with my reading. Life is good here. Everything is way different. The school enforces rules more than they did in Ethiopia, and I like that. People have been friendly to me. I have more opportunities to do sports, too.</p>
        <p>36&nbsp; &nbsp;“I write to my friends back home. Everyone from my country talks about how nice my mom and dad are to us. Back in Ethiopia, it’s a big thing to come to America. We’re very fortunate.”</p>
        <p>37&nbsp; &nbsp;Patty McCormick works with Addis every day.</p>
        <p>38&nbsp; &nbsp;“Think about how difficult it would be for us to go to a foreign country and study in their language,” McCormick said. “Addis is very respectful and does what I ask of him. The difference from last year to this has been remarkable. He expresses his ideas more fluidly and has a better grasp of our language.</p>
        <p>39&nbsp; &nbsp;“We go through his daily planner every day. He’s taking physics, math, English literature and history. He needs help with his grammar and spelling. I brainstorm with him, but he develops his ideas and I help him write it down and transcribe it. He types it out. He’s a great kid.”</p>
        <p>40&nbsp; &nbsp;Habtewold dreams of being famous one day.</p>
        <p>41&nbsp; &nbsp;“I know I’ll have the chance if I keep my grades up and continue to work hard,” he said. “I have a great opportunity here.”</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; ST. CLAIR—Barely a teenager, a stranger in a strange land, learning a foreign language, adapting to a new family dynamic . . . you could excuse Addis Habtewold if he chose to run and hide.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;Well, Habtewold is running, but in clear view—at the head of the field in every cross-country race he enters.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;Not quite three years since he left his native Ethiopia, Habtewold is the talk of the running community.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;After Thursday’s Marysville Invitational, Habtewold, a 15-year-old sophomore at St. Clair High School, has won all 10 races in which he had competed, setting eight course records in the process.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;“A coach is lucky to have a kid like Addis come around once in a lifetime,” St. Clair coach Jon Davidson said. “Any coach would be shocked to see the type of results Addis has produced.”</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;Area coaches who have seen him rave about his unlimited potential. But his work ethic and personality most impress his coach and teammates.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;“He’s one of the fastest guys in the state, [but] he’s not arrogant in the least,” Davidson said. “He’s very humble, works hard and wants to be the best.”</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;Habtewold, who is 5-foot-4 and 115 pounds, has lofty goals.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;He wants to be a state champion in his first year in the sport—his best time, a school-record 15 minutes, 35 seconds, is second in the state to Landon Peacock of&nbsp;Cedar Springs (15:11). Habtewold also wants to run in college and become an Olympic gold medalist, like his native countryman, Haile Gebrselassie.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;It’s a tall order, but Habtewold is used to accomplishing much in a hurry. Since moving to the United States, he has learned English well enough to earn As and Bs. And, in less than a year, he has developed into an elite high school athlete.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;“I love running,” Habtewold said. “I feel like I’m missing something if I miss a day.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;“I’m surprised I’ve done this well. I’m breaking records. I want to thank my coach, friends, teammates and parents.Without their support, I’d never been able to accomplish what I have so far.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Coming to America</strong>
        </p>
        <p>13<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Habtewold had little interest in running when he was younger. He played soccer in Ethiopia. The only time he ran, he says, was when he was late to school.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;“Addis, his older sister, Miti (21), and younger brother, Eyob (14), were orphaned and living with my mother,” said Jerusalem Lothschutz, who, with her husband, Jim Lothschutz, eventually adopted them and brought them to the United States. “His mother was my sister. They grew up in the capital city of Addis Ababa where I grew up and went to school.”</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;Jim Lothschutz, a vice principal at Hamtramck High School, was a teacher at International School in Ethiopia when he met Jerusalem, who worked in the computer lab. They married in 1997 and adopted Addis, Miti and Eyob. They have two other children, Gabbi, 6, and Sammy, 4. Miti lives in Grand<br>
Haven and attends Grand Rapids Community College. Eyob is a freshman on the varsity soccer team at St. Clair and plans to run track in the spring.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;Jerusalem and Jim moved to the United States in 1998. But it took four years for the adoption to be recognized by the American government, and Addis, Miti and Eyob didn’t touch American soil until December 2002 in Godwin Heights near Grand Rapids. They moved to St. Clair last year.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp;Moving to America was obviously a tough transition for Addis and his siblings. His parents let them settle in before they studied English.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp;“Nine months after they settled in, they had to focus on English,” Jim Lothschutz said. “I gave them a tape player and language tapes and they had to listen to them two hours a day.”</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp;Jerusalem, who speaks fluent English, is proud of her children’s progress.</p>

        </p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;“They adapted much faster than I did,” she said. “They made friends and were involved in sports.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Fast Start</strong>
        </p>
        <p>21&nbsp; &nbsp;Habtewold was a starter on St. Clair’s soccer team as a freshman and a teammate of Davidson’s son, Colin.</p>
        <p>22&nbsp; &nbsp;The team ran two miles for conditioning<br>
before practice each day. Habtewold’s running impressed Colin, who told his father.</p>
        <p>23&nbsp; &nbsp;“Colin said, ‘You’ve got to see Addis run.’ I watched him and then recruited him from the soccer team,” Davidson said.</p>
        <p>24&nbsp; &nbsp;“We talked Addis into running with us after cross-country season. We had a big group, including a number of seniors, Addis and me, and we ran for six to eight miles.”</p>
        <p>25&nbsp; &nbsp;Jeff Standfest, now a cross-country runner at Oakland University, was part of that initial group.</p>
        <p>26&nbsp; &nbsp;“We got him to go out running with us one day in November,” Standfest said. “We ran six to eight miles, 6:20-minute miles, and Addis was running right with us, chewing gum and breathing through his nose. It was incredible.”</p>
        <p>27&nbsp; &nbsp;Habtewold recalls that first day, saying: “I ran eight miles and I was kind of sore the next day. It was a lot of fun. I ran the next day and pretty much every day after.”</p>
        <p>28&nbsp; &nbsp;Habtewold finished seventh in the 3,200-meter run at the Division 2 state meet. His success spiked his interest in cross country. During the summer, he trained by running hundreds of miles.</p>
        <p>29&nbsp; &nbsp;He has dominated the competition, his time of 15:54 topping a field of more than 1,000 runners at the Holly Invitational on Sept. 17.</p>
        <p>30&nbsp; &nbsp;Often, he says, he gets bored from running alone.</p>
        <p>31&nbsp; &nbsp;“My goals are to win and get my time down,” Habtewold said, “but sometimes I feel like quitting halfway through the race because I’m tired and running alone. Coach says I have to just suck it up and run through it.”</p>
        <p>32&nbsp; &nbsp;St. Clair junior Ben Holt said the team follows Habtewold’s lead.</p>
        <p>33&nbsp; &nbsp;“He’s not a captain, but he’s a leader by how he leads by example,” Holt said. “He makes sure we get our mileage in. He’s addicted to running.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Fitting In</strong><br>
34&nbsp; &nbsp;Addis has attacked his classes in the same manner in which he trains.</p>
        <p>35&nbsp; &nbsp;“Not being able to speak English was the most difficult thing for me,” Addis said.&nbsp;“My mom and dad really helped me with my reading and speaking. I still have some trouble with my reading. Life is good here. Everything is way different. The school enforces rules more than they did in Ethiopia, and I like that. People have been friendly to me. I have more opportunities to do sports, too.</p>
        <p>36&nbsp; &nbsp;“I write to my friends back home. Everyone from my country talks about how nice my mom and dad are to us. Back in Ethiopia, it’s a big thing to come to America. We’re very fortunate.”</p>
        <p>37&nbsp; &nbsp;Patty McCormick works with Addis every day.</p>
        <p>38&nbsp; &nbsp;“Think about how difficult it would be for us to go to a foreign country and study in their language,” McCormick said. “Addis is very respectful and does what I ask of him. The difference from last year to this has been remarkable. He expresses his ideas more fluidly and has a better grasp of our language.</p>
        <p>39&nbsp; &nbsp;“We go through his daily planner every day. He’s taking physics, math, English literature and history. He needs help with his grammar and spelling. I brainstorm with him, but he develops his ideas and I help him write it down and transcribe it. He types it out. He’s a great kid.”</p>
        <p>40&nbsp; &nbsp;Habtewold dreams of being famous one day.</p>
        <p>41&nbsp; &nbsp;“I know I’ll have the chance if I keep my grades up and continue to work hard,” he said. “I have a great opportunity here.”</p>

The difference from last year to this has been remarkable. He expresses his ideas more fluidly and has a better grasp of our language.</p>
        <p>39&nbsp; &nbsp;“We go through his daily planner every day. He’s taking physics, math, English literature and history. He needs help with his grammar and spelling. I brainstorm with him, but he develops his ideas and I help him write it down and transcribe it. He types it out. He’s a great kid.”</p>
        <p>40&nbsp; &nbsp;Habtewold dreams of being famous one day.</p>
        <p>41&nbsp; &nbsp;“I know I’ll have the chance if I keep my grades up and continue to work hard,” he said. “I have a great opportunity here.”</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; ST. CLAIR—Barely a teenager, a stranger in a strange land, learning a foreign language, adapting to a new family dynamic . . . you could excuse Addis Habtewold if he chose to run and hide.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;Well, Habtewold is running, but in clear view—at the head of the field in every cross-country race he enters.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;Not quite three years since he left his native Ethiopia, Habtewold is the talk of the running community.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;After Thursday’s Marysville Invitational, Habtewold, a 15-year-old sophomore at St. Clair High School, has won all 10 races in which he had competed, setting eight course records in the process.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;“A coach is lucky to have a kid like Addis come around once in a lifetime,” St. Clair coach Jon Davidson said. “Any coach would be shocked to see the type of results Addis has produced.”</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;Area coaches who have seen him rave about his unlimited potential. But his work ethic and personality most impress his coach and teammates.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;“He’s one of the fastest guys in the state, [but] he’s not arrogant in the least,” Davidson said. “He’s very humble, works hard and wants to be the best.”</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;Habtewold, who is 5-foot-4 and 115 pounds, has lofty goals.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;He wants to be a state champion in his first year in the sport—his best time, a school-record 15 minutes, 35 seconds, is second in the state to Landon Peacock of&nbsp;Cedar Springs (15:11). Habtewold also wants to run in college and become an Olympic gold medalist, like his native countryman, Haile Gebrselassie.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;It’s a tall order, but Habtewold is used to accomplishing much in a hurry. Since moving to the United States, he has learned English well enough to earn As and Bs. And, in less than a year, he has developed into an elite high school athlete.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;“I love running,” Habtewold said. “I feel like I’m missing something if I miss a day.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;“I’m surprised I’ve done this well. I’m breaking records. I want to thank my coach, friends, teammates and parents.Without their support, I’d never been able to accomplish what I have so far.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Coming to America</strong>
        </p>
        <p>13<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Habtewold had little interest in running when he was younger. He played soccer in Ethiopia. The only time he ran, he says, was when he was late to school.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;“Addis, his older sister, Miti (21), and younger brother, Eyob (14), were orphaned and living with my mother,” said Jerusalem Lothschutz, who, with her husband, Jim Lothschutz, eventually adopted them and brought them to the United States. “His mother was my sister. They grew up in the capital city of Addis Ababa where I grew up and went to school.”</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;Jim Lothschutz, a vice principal at Hamtramck High School, was a teacher at International School in Ethiopia when he met Jerusalem, who worked in the computer lab. They married in 1997 and adopted Addis, Miti and Eyob. They have two other children, Gabbi, 6, and Sammy, 4. Miti lives in Grand<br>
Haven and attends Grand Rapids Community College. Eyob is a freshman on the varsity soccer team at St. Clair and plans to run track in the spring.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;Jerusalem and Jim moved to the United States in 1998. But it took four years for the adoption to be recognized by the American government, and Addis, Miti and Eyob didn’t touch American soil until December 2002 in Godwin Heights near Grand Rapids. They moved to St. Clair last year.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp;Moving to America was obviously a tough transition for Addis and his siblings. His parents let them settle in before they studied English.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp;“Nine months after they settled in, they had to focus on English,” Jim Lothschutz said. “I gave them a tape player and language tapes and they had to listen to them two hours a day.”</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp;Jerusalem, who speaks fluent English, is proud of her children’s progress.</p>

        </p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;“They adapted much faster than I did,” she said. “They made friends and were involved in sports.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Fast Start</strong>
        </p>
        <p>21&nbsp; &nbsp;Habtewold was a starter on St. Clair’s soccer team as a freshman and a teammate of Davidson’s son, Colin.</p>
        <p>22&nbsp; &nbsp;The team ran two miles for conditioning<br>
before practice each day. Habtewold’s running impressed Colin, who told his father.</p>
        <p>23&nbsp; &nbsp;“Colin said, ‘You’ve got to see Addis run.’ I watched him and then recruited him from the soccer team,” Davidson said.</p>
        <p>24&nbsp; &nbsp;“We talked Addis into running with us after cross-country season. We had a big group, including a number of seniors, Addis and me, and we ran for six to eight miles.”</p>
        <p>25&nbsp; &nbsp;Jeff Standfest, now a cross-country runner at Oakland University, was part of that initial group.</p>
        <p>26&nbsp; &nbsp;“We got him to go out running with us one day in November,” Standfest said. “We ran six to eight miles, 6:20-minute miles, and Addis was running right with us, chewing gum and breathing through his nose. It was incredible.”</p>
        <p>27&nbsp; &nbsp;Habtewold recalls that first day, saying: “I ran eight miles and I was kind of sore the next day. It was a lot of fun. I ran the next day and pretty much every day after.”</p>
        <p>28&nbsp; &nbsp;Habtewold finished seventh in the 3,200-meter run at the Division 2 state meet. His success spiked his interest in cross country. During the summer, he trained by running hundreds of miles.</p>
        <p>29&nbsp; &nbsp;He has dominated the competition, his time of 15:54 topping a field of more than 1,000 runners at the Holly Invitational on Sept. 17.</p>
        <p>30&nbsp; &nbsp;Often, he says, he gets bored from running alone.</p>
        <p>31&nbsp; &nbsp;“My goals are to win and get my time down,” Habtewold said, “but sometimes I feel like quitting halfway through the race because I’m tired and running alone. Coach says I have to just suck it up and run through it.”</p>
        <p>32&nbsp; &nbsp;St. Clair junior Ben Holt said the team follows Habtewold’s lead.</p>
        <p>33&nbsp; &nbsp;“He’s not a captain, but he’s a leader by how he leads by example,” Holt said. “He makes sure we get our mileage in. He’s addicted to running.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Fitting In</strong><br>
34&nbsp; &nbsp;Addis has attacked his classes in the same manner in which he trains.</p>
        <p>35&nbsp; &nbsp;“Not being able to speak English was the most difficult thing for me,” Addis said.&nbsp;“My mom and dad really helped me with my reading and speaking. I still have some trouble with my reading. Life is good here. Everything is way different. The school enforces rules more than they did in Ethiopia, and I like that. People have been friendly to me. I have more opportunities to do sports, too.</p>
        <p>36&nbsp; &nbsp;“I write to my friends back home. Everyone from my country talks about how nice my mom and dad are to us. Back in Ethiopia, it’s a big thing to come to America. We’re very fortunate.”</p>
        <p>37&nbsp; &nbsp;Patty McCormick works with Addis every day.</p>
        <p>38&nbsp; &nbsp;“Think about how difficult it would be for us to go to a foreign country and study in their language,” McCormick said. “Addis is very respectful and does what I ask of him. The difference from last year to this has been remarkable. He expresses his ideas more fluidly and has a better grasp of our language.</p>
        <p>39&nbsp; &nbsp;“We go through his daily planner every day. He’s taking physics, math, English literature and history. He needs help with his grammar and spelling. I brainstorm with him, but he develops his ideas and I help him write it down and transcribe it. He types it out. He’s a great kid.”</p>
        <p>40&nbsp; &nbsp;Habtewold dreams of being famous one day.</p>
        <p>41&nbsp; &nbsp;“I know I’ll have the chance if I keep my grades up and continue to work hard,” he said. “I have a great opportunity here.”</p>

        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; ST. CLAIR—Barely a teenager, a stranger in a strange land, learning a foreign language, adapting to a new family dynamic . . . you could excuse Addis Habtewold if he chose to run and hide.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;Well, Habtewold is running, but in clear view—at the head of the field in every cross-country race he enters.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;Not quite three years since he left his native Ethiopia, Habtewold is the talk of the running community.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;After Thursday’s Marysville Invitational, Habtewold, a 15-year-old sophomore at St. Clair High School, has won all 10 races in which he had competed, setting eight course records in the process.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;“A coach is lucky to have a kid like Addis come around once in a lifetime,” St. Clair coach Jon Davidson said. “Any coach would be shocked to see the type of results Addis has produced.”</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;Area coaches who have seen him rave about his unlimited potential. But his work ethic and personality most impress his coach and teammates.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;“He’s one of the fastest guys in the state, [but] he’s not arrogant in the least,” Davidson said. “He’s very humble, works hard and wants to be the best.”</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;Habtewold, who is 5-foot-4 and 115 pounds, has lofty goals.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;He wants to be a state champion in his first year in the sport—his best time, a school-record 15 minutes, 35 seconds, is second in the state to Landon Peacock of&nbsp;Cedar Springs (15:11). Habtewold also wants to run in college and become an Olympic gold medalist, like his native countryman, Haile Gebrselassie.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;It’s a tall order, but Habtewold is used to accomplishing much in a hurry. Since moving to the United States, he has learned English well enough to earn As and Bs. And, in less than a year, he has developed into an elite high school athlete.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;“I love running,” Habtewold said. “I feel like I’m missing something if I miss a day.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;“I’m surprised I’ve done this well. I’m breaking records. I want to thank my coach, friends, teammates and parents.Without their support, I’d never been able to accomplish what I have so far.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Coming to America</strong>
        </p>
        <p>13<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Habtewold had little interest in running when he was younger. He played soccer in Ethiopia. The only time he ran, he says, was when he was late to school.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;“Addis, his older sister, Miti (21), and younger brother, Eyob (14), were orphaned and living with my mother,” said Jerusalem Lothschutz, who, with her husband, Jim Lothschutz, eventually adopted them and brought them to the United States. “His mother was my sister. They grew up in the capital city of Addis Ababa where I grew up and went to school.”</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;Jim Lothschutz, a vice principal at Hamtramck High School, was a teacher at International School in Ethiopia when he met Jerusalem, who worked in the computer lab. They married in 1997 and adopted Addis, Miti and Eyob. They have two other children, Gabbi, 6, and Sammy, 4. Miti lives in Grand<br>
Haven and attends Grand Rapids Community College. Eyob is a freshman on the varsity soccer team at St. Clair and plans to run track in the spring.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;Jerusalem and Jim moved to the United States in 1998. But it took four years for the adoption to be recognized by the American government, and Addis, Miti and Eyob didn’t touch American soil until December 2002 in Godwin Heights near Grand Rapids. They moved to St. Clair last year.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp;Moving to America was obviously a tough transition for Addis and his siblings. His parents let them settle in before they studied English.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp;“Nine months after they settled in, they had to focus on English,” Jim Lothschutz said. “I gave them a tape player and language tapes and they had to listen to them two hours a day.”</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp;Jerusalem, who speaks fluent English, is proud of her children’s progress.</p>

        </p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;“They adapted much faster than I did,” she said. “They made friends and were involved in sports.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Fast Start</strong>
        </p>
        <p>21&nbsp; &nbsp;Habtewold was a starter on St. Clair’s soccer team as a freshman and a teammate of Davidson’s son, Colin.</p>
        <p>22&nbsp; &nbsp;The team ran two miles for conditioning<br>
before practice each day. Habtewold’s running impressed Colin, who told his father.</p>
        <p>23&nbsp; &nbsp;“Colin said, ‘You’ve got to see Addis run.’ I watched him and then recruited him from the soccer team,” Davidson said.</p>
        <p>24&nbsp; &nbsp;“We talked Addis into running with us after cross-country season. We had a big group, including a number of seniors, Addis and me, and we ran for six to eight miles.”</p>
        <p>25&nbsp; &nbsp;Jeff Standfest, now a cross-country runner at Oakland University, was part of that initial group.</p>
        <p>26&nbsp; &nbsp;“We got him to go out running with us one day in November,” Standfest said. “We ran six to eight miles, 6:20-minute miles, and Addis was running right with us, chewing gum and breathing through his nose. It was incredible.”</p>
        <p>27&nbsp; &nbsp;Habtewold recalls that first day, saying: “I ran eight miles and I was kind of sore the next day. It was a lot of fun. I ran the next day and pretty much every day after.”</p>
        <p>28&nbsp; &nbsp;Habtewold finished seventh in the 3,200-meter run at the Division 2 state meet. His success spiked his interest in cross country. During the summer, he trained by running hundreds of miles.</p>
        <p>29&nbsp; &nbsp;He has dominated the competition, his time of 15:54 topping a field of more than 1,000 runners at the Holly Invitational on Sept. 17.</p>
        <p>30&nbsp; &nbsp;Often, he says, he gets bored from running alone.</p>
        <p>31&nbsp; &nbsp;“My goals are to win and get my time down,” Habtewold said, “but sometimes I feel like quitting halfway through the race because I’m tired and running alone. Coach says I have to just suck it up and run through it.”</p>
        <p>32&nbsp; &nbsp;St. Clair junior Ben Holt said the team follows Habtewold’s lead.</p>
        <p>33&nbsp; &nbsp;“He’s not a captain, but he’s a leader by how he leads by example,” Holt said. “He makes sure we get our mileage in. He’s addicted to running.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Fitting In</strong><br>
34&nbsp; &nbsp;Addis has attacked his classes in the same manner in which he trains.</p>
        <p>35&nbsp; &nbsp;“Not being able to speak English was the most difficult thing for me,” Addis said.&nbsp;“My mom and dad really helped me with my reading and speaking. I still have some trouble with my reading. Life is good here. Everything is way different. The school enforces rules more than they did in Ethiopia, and I like that. People have been friendly to me. I have more opportunities to do sports, too.</p>
        <p>36&nbsp; &nbsp;“I write to my friends back home. Everyone from my country talks about how nice my mom and dad are to us. Back in Ethiopia, it’s a big thing to come to America. We’re very fortunate.”</p>
        <p>37&nbsp; &nbsp;Patty McCormick works with Addis every day.</p>
        <p>38&nbsp; &nbsp;“Think about how difficult it would be for us to go to a foreign country and study in their language,” McCormick said. “Addis is very respectful and does what I ask of him. The difference from last year to this has been remarkable. He expresses his ideas more fluidly and has a better grasp of our language.</p>
        <p>39&nbsp; &nbsp;“We go through his daily planner every day. He’s taking physics, math, English literature and history. He needs help with his grammar and spelling. I brainstorm with him, but he develops his ideas and I help him write it down and transcribe it. He types it out. He’s a great kid.”</p>
        <p>40&nbsp; &nbsp;Habtewold dreams of being famous one day.</p>
        <p>41&nbsp; &nbsp;“I know I’ll have the chance if I keep my grades up and continue to work hard,” he said. “I have a great opportunity here.”</p>
