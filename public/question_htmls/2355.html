        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br>
“What the hell,” I hear myself say, and the next thing I know, I’ve snatched Somyung’s pistol from the table and I’m leveling it at Hyang with a quaking hand. My vision closes in. I feel my pulse jumping in my right index finger. “What?” I say, my voice shot through with rage. “Genetically engineered clones? Cha Seol picks the winner?” I’m screaming now. “What is wrong with you people?” The tip of Somyung’s pistol dances wildly before Hyang’s face, but she isn’t fazed. “I have no answer for you,” she says miserably. “I only wish I didn’t know what depraved stock I come from.” “What stock?” Somyung says now, looking from me to Hyang, her voice caught low in her throat. “Who the hell are you?” “I am Cha Seol’s sister. Cha Guibahng’s granddaughter,” Hyang says sadly. “I only learned what they’d done a few years ago. That’s when I decided to leave Snowglobe for good. My sister wouldn’t accept my decision, though. She insisted that she needed me as a directing partner and as a best friend. Then our grandfather had the stroke that’s kept him in the hospital to this day.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I found out all the details then,” Hyang explains, tears coming to her eyes again. She confesses to her complicity, and the fear that allowed her to distance herself from her family instead of doing something to help us.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“You make me sick,” Somyung spits. “My mom almost died giving birth to someone else’s child.</p>
        <p>“Hell,” Somyung breathes, pressing her palms against her inflamed eyes.</p>
        <p>“Some of us just have all the luck.”</p>
        <p>Then she turns to me and smirks. “And look at you with the pistol in your hand. Do you even know how to use it?” She laughs. “So what’s your story?”</p>
        <p>I say nothing, all the strength leaving me. I drop the hand holding the pistol, and Somyung moves in to gently pry it away as Hyang volunteers a brief summary of my backstory, pausing occasionally to compose herself.</p>
        <p>“You’re kidding,” Somyung mutters under her breath as she inspects the pistol. “She didn’t even undo the safety.”<br>
Then, turning to Hyang, who’s drying her eyes with the backs of her hands, she says, “Can I call you Ajumma, too?”</p>
        <p>Hyang nods.</p>
        <p>“Ajumma,” Somyung says, “you’ve done nothing with what you knew about the Goh Haeri project. I’m not here to condemn you for your pathetic weakness, though. Heck, I can almost appreciate how conflicted you must have felt about standing up to your sister and grandfather.” She pauses for a moment before she continues, “What I want to know is, why now? Why do you stir the pot now, going through all the hassle of tracking me down and disturbing the peace?”</p>
        <p>Her eyes red and puffy, Hyang wets her parched lips. “This is embarrassing,” she says, “but I’ll tell you why.<br>
“My friend Miryu loathed her role as a serial killer. It was something she was conned into long before she was thrown out of Snowglobe when the show ran out of fresh murder ideas.</p>
        <p>“The assassination of my friend’s soul. That was the first murder I ever witnessed,” Hyang says, her voice faltering again.</p>
        <p>“Growing up in a family of directors, I’d been blind to the wrongs that were being committed in the name of ratings. I truly believed that editorial or directorial decisions, however incomprehensible, were consented to by the actors whose sole priority was to remain in Snowglobe. It was only after I saw what happened to Miryu that I understood what was really going on.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Alas. Never having stood up for anyone or anything my whole life, the only thing I knew how to do was run away.</p>
        <p>“Then Seol ratcheted up her effort to draw me back into the project. She did everything she could to trigger a sense of sibling loyalty. Each passing day was hell. I never said yes, but I also couldn’t say no. She was my big sister-she’d always been my hero.”</p>
        <p>Hyang sucks in a deep breath. “So I turned to alcohol,” she continues. “It was the only thing that could dull the edge of my agony. The moment I could feel my senses sharpening, I’d dull them again with more alcohol.</p>
        <p>“Eventually, I managed to flee to the retirees’ village, and I realized that I couldn’t stand the residents—they are all former directors. That’s when hopelessness took over completely and I closed myself off from the world. Time passed, and eventually Seol sent a letter informing me of Haeri’s suicide. “I was devastated and furious, so I began going through the documents I’d smuggled out of Snowglobe when I left. I was finally ready to use the evidence I had to bury my family for what they’d done, but I had no idea where to start.” Hyang pauses for a moment and looks at me. “That’s when Jeon Chobahm was shipped to me in an oversized package of apples. Chobahm told me about Miryu’s cursed existence back home, and of the girl who would rather fight to the death than surrender to injustice. This girl, who had come from nothing, had more attitude than she had any right to, and it gave me pause—made me reflect on my own attitude. I knew I couldn’t change the fact that I’d been a coward, but I hated the thought of continuing to live my life in shame.” The room falls into silence. Through my tears, I’m finally beginning to see this woman for what she is, another casualty with all the tragic scars her heart bears. Somyung gives a somber nod. “So what’s our plan?” she says.</p>

“Thank you,” I hear myself say then. “For everything.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Soft music begins flowing from the speakers. Hyang searches my face a long moment. “What’s up?” she says, concern creeping in her eyes. I take a big breath, unsure how to begin. But soon, I’m saying, “I think I’m done.” She gives me a blank look, processing this declaration. “So that’s why you’ve been living like there’s no tomorrow over the past few weeks?” She’s not wrong. I saw her five times in as many days. Once we strolled the streets together. Another time, we cooked ourselves a very nice dinner. On other days, we watched TV, read, or just enjoyed each other’s company, all within the one hour a day I allowed for myself to break away from the cameras without raising concern or suspicion. It was the best week of my life. “I’d have left a long time ago if I hadn’t met you,” I tell her. “I hate to sound like a director,” she says, working mock authority into her voice, “but coming and going is not up to you.” As if I didn’t know that already. The power to make that decision lies with the viewers. As long as the ratings indicate their wish for me to go on, I can’t quit. But the show seems to have peaked. I don’t need a crystal ball to see that it’s just a matter of time before I get the boot, so what’s wrong with staying ahead of the curve? “Tell me what’s bugging you. Let big sis take care of it,” Hyang says, drumming her fists on her chest like a gorilla. Her clowning makes me laugh, but sorrow soon swells back up in me. I push away from the sofa and move to the window. “Hey, Miryu,” Hyang calls, a sharp edge rising in her voice. “If you leave like this, we may never see each other again. Are you okay with that?” Her words plunge a knife into my back. I don’t say anything. I can’t. “Please,” she begins. The next thing I know, she’s standing behind me, turning me around to face her. “You know you can tell me any—” She stiffens at the tears streaming down my face. “What’s wrong, baby?” she asks, her own face twisting with grief. “Is it your show? Is something happening that you can’t handle?” Hyang has no idea what havoc I go around wreaking in my life, in my show. The only person in Snowglobe who has access to an actor’s internal life is the director, and since no actor would dare violate the anti-spoiler rule for Hyang, a working director herself, she is completely in the dark. Occasionally, people who recognize us from one place or another might murmur what they will behind our backs, but they clam up when Hyang wheels around to confront them. Might as well. I’d rather that she doesn’t know who I really am. “How about this?” Hyang says, clutching at my arms. An edge of desperation rises in her voice. “I’ll be your director. Transfer to my show. You can just be a licorice. A sweet essential.” If only. Slowly, I shake my head. “I can’t.” What I don’t tell her is that I won’t allow myself to enjoy such a life, a life of ordinary joy, even warmth, which I’ve denied so many. I can fill the rest of my life with guilt and bitter regrets, and still, it wouldn’t be enough. “Why? Why not?” she demands, tightening her grip around my arms. Off in the corner, the Christmas tree we decorated together twinkles with lights. “Promise that you’ll send me a Christmas card every year,” I say, my voice thickening again. “So I know you’re doing well.” Perhaps once a year, I can allow myself a day of joy. Or am I being selfish? “As long as you feel like it, that is,” I add, fighting back the tears that want to surge again. “So I’ll know that you’re over us when the card doesn’t come one year.” “Come on,” she pleads, burying her face in my shoulder. She is silent a long moment. Then she says, “You know I hate writing.” Classic Hyang. I let out a snort of laugh, welcoming the comic relief. But that’s when Hyang breaks down, raking my heart with her sobs. “I’m sorry,” she chokes out. “For wanting you to hang on here forever. I have no idea what kind of pain you’re in, or how much you’re struggling.” “I’ve hung on because I wanted to,” I tell her, which is true. But there was no hope in my hanging on. An actor and a director can never be together. Once a week, and no longer than thirty minutes, is the limit of an acceptable breakaway, beyond which she and I are guilty of breaking the law. Over the course of this doomed relationship, I committed five more murders. For two of them, I was detained by the authorities as a strong suspect, which in itself was a departure from the routine. I never leave evidence or witnesses, ever, and anyone who has followed the show knows that. This time, again, I was eventually released for lack of evidence. Surprise, surprise. Needless to say, all was just a cheesy editorial sleight of hand designed to provoke some tension and drama for the show, which had begun its decline. We hold each other in silence by the window. After a while, I hear myself say, “How many Christmas lights do you think are on right this moment?” Hyang responds by growing rigid, holding in her breath. Out in the open world right now, someone is sweating on the wheel that powers that tree. “This godforsaken world! To hell with it!” Hyang erupts all of a sudden. I press her tighter against me. “Right?” A small laugh. “To hell with it all. Snowglobe, the Yibonns, and everything else.” I look numbly out the window at the dazzling city skyline. Would someone please straighten out this crooked world? I’d be too happy to lend them a hand, should one stained with blood be acceptable.</p>

It was the best week of my life. “I’d have left a long time ago if I hadn’t met you,” I tell her. “I hate to sound like a director,” she says, working mock authority into her voice, “but coming and going is not up to you.” As if I didn’t know that already. The power to make that decision lies with the viewers. As long as the ratings indicate their wish for me to go on, I can’t quit. But the show seems to have peaked. I don’t need a crystal ball to see that it’s just a matter of time before I get the boot, so what’s wrong with staying ahead of the curve? “Tell me what’s bugging you. Let big sis take care of it,” Hyang says, drumming her fists on her chest like a gorilla. Her clowning makes me laugh, but sorrow soon swells back up in me. I push away from the sofa and move to the window. “Hey, Miryu,” Hyang calls, a sharp edge rising in her voice. “If you leave like this, we may never see each other again. Are you okay with that?” Her words plunge a knife into my back. I don’t say anything. I can’t. “Please,” she begins. The next thing I know, she’s standing behind me, turning me around to face her. “You know you can tell me any—” She stiffens at the tears streaming down my face. “What’s wrong, baby?” she asks, her own face twisting with grief. “Is it your show? Is something happening that you can’t handle?” Hyang has no idea what havoc I go around wreaking in my life, in my show. The only person in Snowglobe who has access to an actor’s internal life is the director, and since no actor would dare violate the anti-spoiler rule for Hyang, a working director herself, she is completely in the dark. Occasionally, people who recognize us from one place or another might murmur what they will behind our backs, but they clam up when Hyang wheels around to confront them. Might as well. I’d rather that she doesn’t know who I really am. “How about this?” Hyang says, clutching at my arms. An edge of desperation rises in her voice. “I’ll be your director. Transfer to my show. You can just be a licorice. A sweet essential.” If only. Slowly, I shake my head. “I can’t.” What I don’t tell her is that I won’t allow myself to enjoy such a life, a life of ordinary joy, even warmth, which I’ve denied so many. I can fill the rest of my life with guilt and bitter regrets, and still, it wouldn’t be enough. “Why? Why not?” she demands, tightening her grip around my arms. Off in the corner, the Christmas tree we decorated together twinkles with lights. “Promise that you’ll send me a Christmas card every year,” I say, my voice thickening again. “So I know you’re doing well.” Perhaps once a year, I can allow myself a day of joy. Or am I being selfish? “As long as you feel like it, that is,” I add, fighting back the tears that want to surge again. “So I’ll know that you’re over us when the card doesn’t come one year.” “Come on,” she pleads, burying her face in my shoulder. She is silent a long moment. Then she says, “You know I hate writing.” Classic Hyang. I let out a snort of laugh, welcoming the comic relief. But that’s when Hyang breaks down, raking my heart with her sobs. “I’m sorry,” she chokes out. “For wanting you to hang on here forever. I have no idea what kind of pain you’re in, or how much you’re struggling.” “I’ve hung on because I wanted to,” I tell her, which is true. But there was no hope in my hanging on. An actor and a director can never be together. Once a week, and no longer than thirty minutes, is the limit of an acceptable breakaway, beyond which she and I are guilty of breaking the law. Over the course of this doomed relationship, I committed five more murders. For two of them, I was detained by the authorities as a strong suspect, which in itself was a departure from the routine. I never leave evidence or witnesses, ever, and anyone who has followed the show knows that. This time, again, I was eventually released for lack of evidence. Surprise, surprise. Needless to say, all was just a cheesy editorial sleight of hand designed to provoke some tension and drama for the show, which had begun its decline. We hold each other in silence by the window. After a while, I hear myself say, “How many Christmas lights do you think are on right this moment?” Hyang responds by growing rigid, holding in her breath. Out in the open world right now, someone is sweating on the wheel that powers that tree. “This godforsaken world! To hell with it!” Hyang erupts all of a sudden. I press her tighter against me. “Right?” A small laugh. “To hell with it all. Snowglobe, the Yibonns, and everything else.” I look numbly out the window at the dazzling city skyline. Would someone please straighten out this crooked world? I’d be too happy to lend them a hand, should one stained with blood be acceptable.</p>

“Thank you,” I hear myself say then. “For everything.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Soft music begins flowing from the speakers. Hyang searches my face a long moment. “What’s up?” she says, concern creeping in her eyes. I take a big breath, unsure how to begin. But soon, I’m saying, “I think I’m done.” She gives me a blank look, processing this declaration. “So that’s why you’ve been living like there’s no tomorrow over the past few weeks?” She’s not wrong.

I’d rather that she doesn’t know who I really am. “How about this?” Hyang says, clutching at my arms. An edge of desperation rises in her voice. “I’ll be your director. Transfer to my show. You can just be a licorice. A sweet essential.” If only. Slowly, I shake my head. “I can’t.” What I don’t tell her is that I won’t allow myself to enjoy such a life, a life of ordinary joy, even warmth, which I’ve denied so many. I can fill the rest of my life with guilt and bitter regrets, and still, it wouldn’t be enough. “Why? Why not?” she demands, tightening her grip around my arms. Off in the corner, the Christmas tree we decorated together twinkles with lights. “Promise that you’ll send me a Christmas card every year,” I say, my voice thickening again. “So I know you’re doing well.” Perhaps once a year, I can allow myself a day of joy. Or am I being selfish? “As long as you feel like it, that is,” I add, fighting back the tears that want to surge again. “So I’ll know that you’re over us when the card doesn’t come one year.” “Come on,” she pleads, burying her face in my shoulder. She is silent a long moment. Then she says, “You know I hate writing.” Classic Hyang. I let out a snort of laugh, welcoming the comic relief. But that’s when Hyang breaks down, raking my heart with her sobs. “I’m sorry,” she chokes out. “For wanting you to hang on here forever. I have no idea what kind of pain you’re in, or how much you’re struggling.” “I’ve hung on because I wanted to,” I tell her, which is true. But there was no hope in my hanging on. An actor and a director can never be together. Once a week, and no longer than thirty minutes, is the limit of an acceptable breakaway, beyond which she and I are guilty of breaking the law. Over the course of this doomed relationship, I committed five more murders. For two of them, I was detained by the authorities as a strong suspect, which in itself was a departure from the routine. I never leave evidence or witnesses, ever, and anyone who has followed the show knows that. This time, again, I was eventually released for lack of evidence. Surprise, surprise. Needless to say, all was just a cheesy editorial sleight of hand designed to provoke some tension and drama for the show, which had begun its decline. We hold each other in silence by the window. After a while, I hear myself say, “How many Christmas lights do you think are on right this moment?” Hyang responds by growing rigid, holding in her breath. Out in the open world right now, someone is sweating on the wheel that powers that tree. “This godforsaken world! To hell with it!” Hyang erupts all of a sudden. I press her tighter against me. “Right?” A small laugh. “To hell with it all. Snowglobe, the Yibonns, and everything else.” I look numbly out the window at the dazzling city skyline. Would someone please straighten out this crooked world? I’d be too happy to lend them a hand, should one stained with blood be acceptable.</p>

“Thank you,” I hear myself say then. “For everything.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Soft music begins flowing from the speakers. Hyang searches my face a long moment. “What’s up?” she says, concern creeping in her eyes. I take a big breath, unsure how to begin. But soon, I’m saying, “I think I’m done.” She gives me a blank look, processing this declaration. “So that’s why you’ve been living like there’s no tomorrow over the past few weeks?” She’s not wrong. I saw her five times in as many days. Once we strolled the streets together. Another time, we cooked ourselves a very nice dinner. On other days, we watched TV, read, or just enjoyed each other’s company, all within the one hour a day I allowed for myself to break away from the cameras without raising concern or suspicion. It was the best week of my life. “I’d have left a long time ago if I hadn’t met you,” I tell her. “I hate to sound like a director,” she says, working mock authority into her voice, “but coming and going is not up to you.” As if I didn’t know that already. The power to make that decision lies with the viewers. As long as the ratings indicate their wish for me to go on, I can’t quit. But the show seems to have peaked. I don’t need a crystal ball to see that it’s just a matter of time before I get the boot, so what’s wrong with staying ahead of the curve? “Tell me what’s bugging you. Let big sis take care of it,” Hyang says, drumming her fists on her chest like a gorilla. Her clowning makes me laugh, but sorrow soon swells back up in me. I push away from the sofa and move to the window. “Hey, Miryu,” Hyang calls, a sharp edge rising in her voice. “If you leave like this, we may never see each other again. Are you okay with that?” Her words plunge a knife into my back. I don’t say anything. I can’t. “Please,” she begins. The next thing I know, she’s standing behind me, turning me around to face her. “You know you can tell me any—” She stiffens at the tears streaming down my face. “What’s wrong, baby?” she asks, her own face twisting with grief. “Is it your show? Is something happening that you can’t handle?” Hyang has no idea what havoc I go around wreaking in my life, in my show. The only person in Snowglobe who has access to an actor’s internal life is the director, and since no actor would dare violate the anti-spoiler rule for Hyang, a working director herself, she is completely in the dark.

Over the course of this doomed relationship, I committed five more murders. For two of them, I was detained by the authorities as a strong suspect, which in itself was a departure from the routine. I never leave evidence or witnesses, ever, and anyone who has followed the show knows that. This time, again, I was eventually released for lack of evidence. Surprise, surprise. Needless to say, all was just a cheesy editorial sleight of hand designed to provoke some tension and drama for the show, which had begun its decline. We hold each other in silence by the window. After a while, I hear myself say, “How many Christmas lights do you think are on right this moment?” Hyang responds by growing rigid, holding in her breath. Out in the open world right now, someone is sweating on the wheel that powers that tree. “This godforsaken world! To hell with it!” Hyang erupts all of a sudden. I press her tighter against me. “Right?” A small laugh. “To hell with it all. Snowglobe, the Yibonns, and everything else.” I look numbly out the window at the dazzling city skyline. Would someone please straighten out this crooked world? I’d be too happy to lend them a hand, should one stained with blood be acceptable.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br>
“Thank you,” I hear myself say then. “For everything.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Soft music begins flowing from the speakers. Hyang searches my face a long moment. “What’s up?” she says, concern creeping in her eyes. I take a big breath, unsure how to begin. But soon, I’m saying, “I think I’m done.” She gives me a blank look, processing this declaration. “So that’s why you’ve been living like there’s no tomorrow over the past few weeks?” She’s not wrong. I saw her five times in as many days. Once we strolled the streets together. Another time, we cooked ourselves a very nice dinner. On other days, we watched TV, read, or just enjoyed each other’s company, all within the one hour a day I allowed for myself to break away from the cameras without raising concern or suspicion. It was the best week of my life. “I’d have left a long time ago if I hadn’t met you,” I tell her. “I hate to sound like a director,” she says, working mock authority into her voice, “but coming and going is not up to you.” As if I didn’t know that already. The power to make that decision lies with the viewers. As long as the ratings indicate their wish for me to go on, I can’t quit. But the show seems to have peaked. I don’t need a crystal ball to see that it’s just a matter of time before I get the boot, so what’s wrong with staying ahead of the curve? “Tell me what’s bugging you. Let big sis take care of it,” Hyang says, drumming her fists on her chest like a gorilla. Her clowning makes me laugh, but sorrow soon swells back up in me. I push away from the sofa and move to the window. “Hey, Miryu,” Hyang calls, a sharp edge rising in her voice. “If you leave like this, we may never see each other again. Are you okay with that?” Her words plunge a knife into my back. I don’t say anything. I can’t. “Please,” she begins. The next thing I know, she’s standing behind me, turning me around to face her. “You know you can tell me any—” She stiffens at the tears streaming down my face. “What’s wrong, baby?” she asks, her own face twisting with grief. “Is it your show? Is something happening that you can’t handle?” Hyang has no idea what havoc I go around wreaking in my life, in my show. The only person in Snowglobe who has access to an actor’s internal life is the director, and since no actor would dare violate the anti-spoiler rule for Hyang, a working director herself, she is completely in the dark. Occasionally, people who recognize us from one place or another might murmur what they will behind our backs, but they clam up when Hyang wheels around to confront them. Might as well. I’d rather that she doesn’t know who I really am. “How about this?” Hyang says, clutching at my arms. An edge of desperation rises in her voice. “I’ll be your director. Transfer to my show. You can just be a licorice. A sweet essential.” If only. Slowly, I shake my head. “I can’t.” What I don’t tell her is that I won’t allow myself to enjoy such a life, a life of ordinary joy, even warmth, which I’ve denied so many. I can fill the rest of my life with guilt and bitter regrets, and still, it wouldn’t be enough. “Why? Why not?” she demands, tightening her grip around my arms. Off in the corner, the Christmas tree we decorated together twinkles with lights. “Promise that you’ll send me a Christmas card every year,” I say, my voice thickening again. “So I know you’re doing well.” Perhaps once a year, I can allow myself a day of joy. Or am I being selfish? “As long as you feel like it, that is,” I add, fighting back the tears that want to surge again. “So I’ll know that you’re over us when the card doesn’t come one year.” “Come on,” she pleads, burying her face in my shoulder. She is silent a long moment. Then she says, “You know I hate writing.” Classic Hyang. I let out a snort of laugh, welcoming the comic relief. But that’s when Hyang breaks down, raking my heart with her sobs. “I’m sorry,” she chokes out. “For wanting you to hang on here forever. I have no idea what kind of pain you’re in, or how much you’re struggling.” “I’ve hung on because I wanted to,” I tell her, which is true. But there was no hope in my hanging on. An actor and a director can never be together. Once a week, and no longer than thirty minutes, is the limit of an acceptable breakaway, beyond which she and I are guilty of breaking the law.

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br>
Each late afternoon they had a precious hour of free time.</p>
        <p>The only thing they were not allowed to do was to climb the high wall that surrounded he palace gardens or go through the gates to the city beyond. The prince of Deltora, like the king and queen, never mingled with the ordinary people. This was an important part of the Rule.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was a part that Jarred was sometimes tempted to break. But Endon, quiet, dutiful, and obedient, anxiously begged him not even to think of climbing the wall.<br>
“It is forbidden,” he would say. “And Prandine already fears that you are a bad influence on me, Jarred. He has told my father so. If you break the Rule, you will be sent away. And I do not want that.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jarred did not want it, either. He knew he would miss Endon sorely. And where would he go if he had to leave the palace? It was the only home he had ever known. So he tamed his curiosity, and the city beyond the wall remained as much a mystery to him as it was to the prince.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The sound of the crystal trumpets broke into Jarred’s thoughts. He turned, like everyone else, towards the back of the hall.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Endon was entering between two rows of royal guards in pale blue uniforms trimmed with gold.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Poor Endon, Jarred thought. He is grieving.</p>
        <p>He wished that he could be beside his friend, to comfort him. But he had not been summoned. Instead, Chief Advisor Prandine stalked at Endon’s right hand.</p>
        <p>Jarred looked at Prandine with dislike. The advisor looked even taller and thinner than usual. He wore a long purple robe and carried what looked like a box covered by a gold cloth. As he walked, his head poked forward so that he looked like a great bird of prey.</p>
        <p>Endon’s eyes were shadowed with sadness, and he looked very small and pale in his stiff silver jacket with its high, jewelled collar. But he held up his head bravely, as he had been taught to do.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All his life he had been trained for this moment. “When I die, you will be king, my son,” his father had told him so many times. “Do not fail in your duty.”</p>
        <p>“I will not fail, Father,” Endon would answer him obediently. “I will do what is right, when the time comes.”</p>
        <p>But neither Jarred nor Endon had thought the time would come so soon. The king was so strong and healthy that it had seemed that he would live forever.</p>
        <p>Endon had reached the front of the hall now and was mounting the steps to the platform. When he had reached the top, he turned and faced the sea of faces.<br>
“He is so young,” a woman near Jarred breathed to her neighbour.</p>
        <p>“Ssh,” the neighbour warned. “He is the rightful heir.” As she spoke, she glanced nervously in Jarred’s direction. Jarred did not recognize her face, but he realized that she knew him and feared he might tell Endon that her friend had been disloyal. He looked away quickly.</p>
        <p>But now the crystal trumpets were sounding again and a low, excited murmuring had begun in the crowd.<br>
Prandine had put his burden down on a small table beside the throne. He was sweeping the gold cloth aside to reveal a glass box. He was opening the box and taking out something that shone and glittered.</p>
        <p>The magic Belt of Deltora. The crowd gave a hissing sigh, and Jarred, too, caught his breath. He had heard about the Belt since his earliest childhood, but he had never seen it before.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And here it was, in all its beauty and mystery-the ancient object that for thousands of years had kept Deltora safe from invasion by the evil Shadow Lord who ruled beyond the Mountains.</p>
        <p>Hanging between Prandine’s bony fingers, the Belt seemed as delicate as lace, and the seven huge gems set along its length looked like beautiful decorations. But Jarred knewthat the Belt was made of the strongest steel, and that each of the gems played its own special part in the magic that protected Deltora.<br>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br>
Each late afternoon they had a precious hour of free time.</p>
        <p>The only thing they were not allowed to do was to climb the high wall that surrounded he palace gardens or go through the gates to the city beyond. The prince of Deltora, like the king and queen, never mingled with the ordinary people. This was an important part of the Rule.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was a part that Jarred was sometimes tempted to break. But Endon, quiet, dutiful, and obedient, anxiously begged him not even to think of climbing the wall.<br>
“It is forbidden,” he would say. “And Prandine already fears that you are a bad influence on me, Jarred. He has told my father so. If you break the Rule, you will be sent away. And I do not want that.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jarred did not want it, either. He knew he would miss Endon sorely. And where would he go if he had to leave the palace? It was the only home he had ever known. So he tamed his curiosity, and the city beyond the wall remained as much a mystery to him as it was to the prince.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The sound of the crystal trumpets broke into Jarred’s thoughts. He turned, like everyone else, towards the back of the hall.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Endon was entering between two rows of royal guards in pale blue uniforms trimmed with gold.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Poor Endon, Jarred thought. He is grieving.</p>
        <p>He wished that he could be beside his friend, to comfort him. But he had not been summoned. Instead, Chief Advisor Prandine stalked at Endon’s right hand.</p>
        <p>Jarred looked at Prandine with dislike. The advisor looked even taller and thinner than usual. He wore a long purple robe and carried what looked like a box covered by a gold cloth. As he walked, his head poked forward so that he looked like a great bird of prey.</p>
        <p>Endon’s eyes were shadowed with sadness, and he looked very small and pale in his stiff silver jacket with its high, jewelled collar. But he held up his head bravely, as he had been taught to do.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All his life he had been trained for this moment. “When I die, you will be king, my son,” his father had told him so many times. “Do not fail in your duty.”</p>
        <p>“I will not fail, Father,” Endon would answer him obediently. “I will do what is right, when the time comes.”</p>
        <p>But neither Jarred nor Endon had thought the time would come so soon. The king was so strong and healthy that it had seemed that he would live forever.</p>
        <p>Endon had reached the front of the hall now and was mounting the steps to the platform. When he had reached the top, he turned and faced the sea of faces.<br>
“He is so young,” a woman near Jarred breathed to her neighbour.</p>
        <p>“Ssh,” the neighbour warned. “He is the rightful heir.” As she spoke, she glanced nervously in Jarred’s direction. Jarred did not recognize her face, but he realized that she knew him and feared he might tell Endon that her friend had been disloyal. He looked away quickly.</p>
        <p>But now the crystal trumpets were sounding again and a low, excited murmuring had begun in the crowd.<br>
Prandine had put his burden down on a small table beside the throne. He was sweeping the gold cloth aside to reveal a glass box. He was opening the box and taking out something that shone and glittered.</p>
        <p>The magic Belt of Deltora. The crowd gave a hissing sigh, and Jarred, too, caught his breath. He had heard about the Belt since his earliest childhood, but he had never seen it before.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And here it was, in all its beauty and mystery-the ancient object that for thousands of years had kept Deltora safe from invasion by the evil Shadow Lord who ruled beyond the Mountains.</p>
        <p>Hanging between Prandine’s bony fingers, the Belt seemed as delicate as lace, and the seven huge gems set along its length looked like beautiful decorations. But Jarred knewthat the Belt was made of the strongest steel, and that each of the gems played its own special part in the magic that protected Deltora.<br>

        <p>It was a part that Jarred was sometimes tempted to break. But Endon, quiet, dutiful, and obedient, anxiously begged him not even to think of climbing the wall.<br>
“It is forbidden,” he would say. “And Prandine already fears that you are a bad influence on me, Jarred. He has told my father so. If you break the Rule, you will be sent away. And I do not want that.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Jarred did not want it, either. He knew he would miss Endon sorely. And where would he go if he had to leave the palace? It was the only home he had ever known. So he tamed his curiosity, and the city beyond the wall remained as much a mystery to him as it was to the prince.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The sound of the crystal trumpets broke into Jarred’s thoughts. He turned, like everyone else, towards the back of the hall.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Endon was entering between two rows of royal guards in pale blue uniforms trimmed with gold.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Poor Endon, Jarred thought. He is grieving.</p>
        <p>He wished that he could be beside his friend, to comfort him. But he had not been summoned. Instead, Chief Advisor Prandine stalked at Endon’s right hand.</p>
        <p>Jarred looked at Prandine with dislike. The advisor looked even taller and thinner than usual. He wore a long purple robe and carried what looked like a box covered by a gold cloth. As he walked, his head poked forward so that he looked like a great bird of prey.</p>
        <p>Endon’s eyes were shadowed with sadness, and he looked very small and pale in his stiff silver jacket with its high, jewelled collar. But he held up his head bravely, as he had been taught to do.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All his life he had been trained for this moment. “When I die, you will be king, my son,” his father had told him so many times. “Do not fail in your duty.”</p>
        <p>“I will not fail, Father,” Endon would answer him obediently. “I will do what is right, when the time comes.”</p>
        <p>But neither Jarred nor Endon had thought the time would come so soon. The king was so strong and healthy that it had seemed that he would live forever.</p>
        <p>Endon had reached the front of the hall now and was mounting the steps to the platform. When he had reached the top, he turned and faced the sea of faces.<br>
“He is so young,” a woman near Jarred breathed to her neighbour.</p>
        <p>“Ssh,” the neighbour warned. “He is the rightful heir.” As she spoke, she glanced nervously in Jarred’s direction. Jarred did not recognize her face, but he realized that she knew him and feared he might tell Endon that her friend had been disloyal. He looked away quickly.</p>
        <p>But now the crystal trumpets were sounding again and a low, excited murmuring had begun in the crowd.<br>
Prandine had put his burden down on a small table beside the throne. He was sweeping the gold cloth aside to reveal a glass box. He was opening the box and taking out something that shone and glittered.</p>
        <p>The magic Belt of Deltora. The crowd gave a hissing sigh, and Jarred, too, caught his breath. He had heard about the Belt since his earliest childhood, but he had never seen it before.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And here it was, in all its beauty and mystery-the ancient object that for thousands of years had kept Deltora safe from invasion by the evil Shadow Lord who ruled beyond the Mountains.</p>
        <p>Hanging between Prandine’s bony fingers, the Belt seemed as delicate as lace, and the seven huge gems set along its length looked like beautiful decorations. But Jarred knewthat the Belt was made of the strongest steel, and that each of the gems played its own special part in the magic that protected Deltora.<br>

          <em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em>
        </p>
        <p>Jarred plunged his hand into his shirt to get the book, to show it to Endon, prove to him that he had good reason for what he said.</p>
        <p>"Beware, your majesty! He has a knife!" shouted Prandine, leaping forward and sweeping Endon under his cloak as if to protect him. He raised his voice to a shriek. "Murderer! Traitor! Guards! Guards!"</p>
        <p>For a single moment Jarred stood frozen. Then he heard bells of warning ringing. He heard shouts of alarm and heavy feet thudding towards the chapel. He saw Prandine's mocking, triumphant smile. He realized that Prandine had been given the chance he had been waiting for-the chance to rid himself of Jarred for good.</p>
        <p>Jarred knew that if he valued his life he would have to flee. Pushing Prandine aside, he ran like the wind from the chapel, up the stairs and to the back of the palace. He plunged into the huge, dim kitchens, where the cooks were just beginning to light the fires in the great stoves. Behind him he could hear the shouts of the guards: "Traitor! Stop him! Stop him!"</p>
        <p>&nbsp; But the cooks did not try to stop Jarred. How could they think that he was the one the guards were pursuing? He was the young king's friend, and they had known him all his life.</p>
        <p>So they only watched as Jarred tore open the kitchen door and ran outside.</p>
        <p>The grounds were deserted, except for a ragged old man tipping food scraps into a horse-drawn cart. He took no notice as Jarred plunged under the cover of the thick bushes that grew against the palace walls.</p>
        <p>Afterwards, Jarred could barely remember scrambling from the ditch. He could not remember stumbling through the tangled weeds and thorny bushes beyond the road. He did not know what guided him to the blacksmith's forge, where at last he fell, fainting, to the ground.</p>
        <p>Perhaps he saw the glow of the fire. Perhaps he heard the hammer beating on the red-hot metal, and the sound reminded him of his lessons with Endon. Or perhaps the spirit of Adin was looking after him. For Crian the blacksmith, stubborn and fearless, was perhaps the only man in Del who would have taken him in.</p>
        <p>Crian roused him and helped him into the small house behind the forge. At Crian's call, a sweet-faced girl came running. Her eyes were full of questions, but she was silent as she helped Crian give Jarred water and bread and bathe his cuts and scratches. They took his filthy, torn clothes, gave him a long, plain nightshirt, and tucked him into a narrow bed.</p>
        <p>Then Jarred slept.</p>
        <p>When he woke, the great hammer was ringing on metal once more, the girl was singing in the kitchen, and the sun was setting. He had slept the day through.</p>
        <p>At the end of his bed he found a set of clothes. He pulled them on, tidied the bed, and crept outside.</p>
        <p>He found Crian at work in the forge. The old man turned and looked at him without speaking.</p>
        <p>"I thank you for your kindness with all my heart," Jarred said awkwardly. "I will leave now, for I do not want to cause you trouble. But I beg you not to say I was here if the palace guards come searching. They will tell you I tried to kill the new king. But I did not do it."</p>
        <p>"So much the worse," the old man answered grimly, returning to his work. "Many in Del would thank you if you had."</p>
        <p>Jarred caught his breath. So this was how things were. The king was not loved but hated. And no wonder. As far as his people knew, he lived in luxury behind his high walls while.</p>
        <p>they suffered. They did not understand that he had no idea of their trouble.</p>
        <p>"The guards will not come," the old man said, without turning around. "I threw your clothes over a cliff into the sea and watched as they found them. They think that you are</p>
        <p>drowned."&nbsp;</p>

          <em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em>
        </p>
        <p>Jarred plunged his hand into his shirt to get the book, to show it to Endon, prove to him that he had good reason for what he said.</p>
        <p>"Beware, your majesty! He has a knife!" shouted Prandine, leaping forward and sweeping Endon under his cloak as if to protect him. He raised his voice to a shriek. "Murderer! Traitor! Guards! Guards!"</p>
        <p>For a single moment Jarred stood frozen. Then he heard bells of warning ringing. He heard shouts of alarm and heavy feet thudding towards the chapel. He saw Prandine's mocking, triumphant smile. He realized that Prandine had been given the chance he had been waiting for-the chance to rid himself of Jarred for good.</p>
        <p>Jarred knew that if he valued his life he would have to flee. Pushing Prandine aside, he ran like the wind from the chapel, up the stairs and to the back of the palace. He plunged into the huge, dim kitchens, where the cooks were just beginning to light the fires in the great stoves. Behind him he could hear the shouts of the guards: "Traitor! Stop him! Stop him!"</p>
        <p>&nbsp; But the cooks did not try to stop Jarred. How could they think that he was the one the guards were pursuing? He was the young king's friend, and they had known him all his life.</p>
        <p>So they only watched as Jarred tore open the kitchen door and ran outside.</p>
        <p>The grounds were deserted, except for a ragged old man tipping food scraps into a horse-drawn cart. He took no notice as Jarred plunged under the cover of the thick bushes that grew against the palace walls.</p>
        <p>Afterwards, Jarred could barely remember scrambling from the ditch. He could not remember stumbling through the tangled weeds and thorny bushes beyond the road. He did not know what guided him to the blacksmith's forge, where at last he fell, fainting, to the ground.</p>
        <p>Perhaps he saw the glow of the fire. Perhaps he heard the hammer beating on the red-hot metal, and the sound reminded him of his lessons with Endon. Or perhaps the spirit of Adin was looking after him. For Crian the blacksmith, stubborn and fearless, was perhaps the only man in Del who would have taken him in.</p>
        <p>Crian roused him and helped him into the small house behind the forge. At Crian's call, a sweet-faced girl came running. Her eyes were full of questions, but she was silent as she helped Crian give Jarred water and bread and bathe his cuts and scratches. They took his filthy, torn clothes, gave him a long, plain nightshirt, and tucked him into a narrow bed.</p>
        <p>Then Jarred slept.</p>
        <p>When he woke, the great hammer was ringing on metal once more, the girl was singing in the kitchen, and the sun was setting. He had slept the day through.</p>
        <p>At the end of his bed he found a set of clothes. He pulled them on, tidied the bed, and crept outside.</p>
        <p>He found Crian at work in the forge. The old man turned and looked at him without speaking.</p>
        <p>"I thank you for your kindness with all my heart," Jarred said awkwardly. "I will leave now, for I do not want to cause you trouble. But I beg you not to say I was here if the palace guards come searching. They will tell you I tried to kill the new king. But I did not do it."</p>
        <p>"So much the worse," the old man answered grimly, returning to his work. "Many in Del would thank you if you had."</p>
        <p>Jarred caught his breath. So this was how things were. The king was not loved but hated. And no wonder. As far as his people knew, he lived in luxury behind his high walls while.</p>
        <p>they suffered. They did not understand that he had no idea of their trouble.</p>
        <p>"The guards will not come," the old man said, without turning around. "I threw your clothes over a cliff into the sea and watched as they found them. They think that you are</p>
        <p>drowned."&nbsp;</p>

          <em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em>
        </p>
        <p>Jarred plunged his hand into his shirt to get the book, to show it to Endon, prove to him that he had good reason for what he said.</p>
        <p>"Beware, your majesty! He has a knife!" shouted Prandine, leaping forward and sweeping Endon under his cloak as if to protect him. He raised his voice to a shriek. "Murderer! Traitor! Guards! Guards!"</p>
        <p>For a single moment Jarred stood frozen. Then he heard bells of warning ringing. He heard shouts of alarm and heavy feet thudding towards the chapel. He saw Prandine's mocking, triumphant smile. He realized that Prandine had been given the chance he had been waiting for-the chance to rid himself of Jarred for good.</p>
        <p>Jarred knew that if he valued his life he would have to flee. Pushing Prandine aside, he ran like the wind from the chapel, up the stairs and to the back of the palace. He plunged into the huge, dim kitchens, where the cooks were just beginning to light the fires in the great stoves. Behind him he could hear the shouts of the guards: "Traitor! Stop him! Stop him!"</p>
        <p>&nbsp; But the cooks did not try to stop Jarred. How could they think that he was the one the guards were pursuing? He was the young king's friend, and they had known him all his life.</p>
        <p>So they only watched as Jarred tore open the kitchen door and ran outside.</p>
        <p>The grounds were deserted, except for a ragged old man tipping food scraps into a horse-drawn cart. He took no notice as Jarred plunged under the cover of the thick bushes that grew against the palace walls.</p>
        <p>Afterwards, Jarred could barely remember scrambling from the ditch. He could not remember stumbling through the tangled weeds and thorny bushes beyond the road. He did not know what guided him to the blacksmith's forge, where at last he fell, fainting, to the ground.</p>
        <p>Perhaps he saw the glow of the fire. Perhaps he heard the hammer beating on the red-hot metal, and the sound reminded him of his lessons with Endon. Or perhaps the spirit of Adin was looking after him. For Crian the blacksmith, stubborn and fearless, was perhaps the only man in Del who would have taken him in.</p>
        <p>Crian roused him and helped him into the small house behind the forge. At Crian's call, a sweet-faced girl came running. Her eyes were full of questions, but she was silent as she helped Crian give Jarred water and bread and bathe his cuts and scratches. They took his filthy, torn clothes, gave him a long, plain nightshirt, and tucked him into a narrow bed.</p>
        <p>Then Jarred slept.</p>
        <p>When he woke, the great hammer was ringing on metal once more, the girl was singing in the kitchen, and the sun was setting. He had slept the day through.</p>
        <p>At the end of his bed he found a set of clothes. He pulled them on, tidied the bed, and crept outside.</p>
        <p>He found Crian at work in the forge. The old man turned and looked at him without speaking.</p>
        <p>"I thank you for your kindness with all my heart," Jarred said awkwardly. "I will leave now, for I do not want to cause you trouble. But I beg you not to say I was here if the palace guards come searching. They will tell you I tried to kill the new king. But I did not do it."</p>
        <p>"So much the worse," the old man answered grimly, returning to his work. "Many in Del would thank you if you had."</p>
        <p>Jarred caught his breath. So this was how things were. The king was not loved but hated. And no wonder. As far as his people knew, he lived in luxury behind his high walls while.</p>
        <p>they suffered. They did not understand that he had no idea of their trouble.</p>
        <p>"The guards will not come," the old man said, without turning around. "I threw your clothes over a cliff into the sea and watched as they found them. They think that you are</p>
        <p>drowned."&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Jarred plunged his hand into his shirt to get the book, to show it to Endon, prove to him that he had good reason for what he said.</p>
        <p>"Beware, your majesty! He has a knife!" shouted Prandine, leaping forward and sweeping Endon under his cloak as if to protect him. He raised his voice to a shriek. "Murderer! Traitor! Guards! Guards!"</p>
        <p>For a single moment Jarred stood frozen. Then he heard bells of warning ringing. He heard shouts of alarm and heavy feet thudding towards the chapel. He saw Prandine's mocking, triumphant smile. He realized that Prandine had been given the chance he had been waiting for-the chance to rid himself of Jarred for good.</p>
        <p>Jarred knew that if he valued his life he would have to flee. Pushing Prandine aside, he ran like the wind from the chapel, up the stairs and to the back of the palace. He plunged into the huge, dim kitchens, where the cooks were just beginning to light the fires in the great stoves. Behind him he could hear the shouts of the guards: "Traitor! Stop him! Stop him!"</p>
        <p>&nbsp; But the cooks did not try to stop Jarred. How could they think that he was the one the guards were pursuing? He was the young king's friend, and they had known him all his life.</p>
        <p>So they only watched as Jarred tore open the kitchen door and ran outside.</p>
        <p>The grounds were deserted, except for a ragged old man tipping food scraps into a horse-drawn cart. He took no notice as Jarred plunged under the cover of the thick bushes that grew against the palace walls.</p>
        <p>Afterwards, Jarred could barely remember scrambling from the ditch. He could not remember stumbling through the tangled weeds and thorny bushes beyond the road. He did not know what guided him to the blacksmith's forge, where at last he fell, fainting, to the ground.</p>
        <p>Perhaps he saw the glow of the fire. Perhaps he heard the hammer beating on the red-hot metal, and the sound reminded him of his lessons with Endon. Or perhaps the spirit of Adin was looking after him. For Crian the blacksmith, stubborn and fearless, was perhaps the only man in Del who would have taken him in.</p>
        <p>Crian roused him and helped him into the small house behind the forge. At Crian's call, a sweet-faced girl came running. Her eyes were full of questions, but she was silent as she helped Crian give Jarred water and bread and bathe his cuts and scratches. They took his filthy, torn clothes, gave him a long, plain nightshirt, and tucked him into a narrow bed.</p>
        <p>Then Jarred slept.</p>
        <p>When he woke, the great hammer was ringing on metal once more, the girl was singing in the kitchen, and the sun was setting. He had slept the day through.</p>
        <p>At the end of his bed he found a set of clothes. He pulled them on, tidied the bed, and crept outside.</p>
        <p>He found Crian at work in the forge. The old man turned and looked at him without speaking.</p>
        <p>"I thank you for your kindness with all my heart," Jarred said awkwardly. "I will leave now, for I do not want to cause you trouble. But I beg you not to say I was here if the palace guards come searching. They will tell you I tried to kill the new king. But I did not do it."</p>
        <p>"So much the worse," the old man answered grimly, returning to his work. "Many in Del would thank you if you had."</p>
        <p>Jarred caught his breath. So this was how things were. The king was not loved but hated. And no wonder. As far as his people knew, he lived in luxury behind his high walls while.</p>
        <p>they suffered. They did not understand that he had no idea of their trouble.</p>
        <p>"The guards will not come," the old man said, without turning around. "I threw your clothes over a cliff into the sea and watched as they found them. They think that you are</p>
        <p>drowned."&nbsp;</p>

With a shaky laugh, Jarred bent to raise the kneeling king. "Endon! I did not know you, either! Get up, for mercy's sake!"</p>
        <p>As he stared, his eyes slowly adjusting to the light, he thought that it was no wonder he had not recognized his old friend.</p>
        <p>The slim, solemn boy he had left behind him seven years ago had become a man. Endon had grown as tall and broad-shouldered as Jarred himself. His stiff robes and high collar</p>
        <p>were encrusted with tiny gems that glittered in the light. His eyes were outlined with black and his eyelids colored blue, in the palace fashion. His long hair and beard were plaited and twined with gold. He smelt of perfume and spices. To Jarred, who had been so long away from the palace and its ways, he made a strange, awesome picture.</p>
        <p>Jarred realized that Endon was staring at him, too, and suddenly he became aware of his workman's clothes, his thick boots, his rough beard, and untidy hair. He felt clumsy and</p>
        <p>awkward. To hide this he turned away.</p>
        <p>As he did, he at last realized where he was. He was in the chapel. One of the marble tiles that surrounded the raised platform in the center had been pushed aside, and a dark hole</p>
        <p>gaped where it had lain.</p>
        <p>"The tunnel through the hill is known only to the royal family, and is only to be used in times of great danger," he heard Endon say softly. "King Brandon caused it to be made when the palace was built. My father taught me of it when I was very young, as he had been taught in his time-in words that even a small child would remember. There is a rhyme for entering the palace, and a rhyme for leaving it. It is a dark secret. Even the chief advisors have never known of it."</p>
        <p>Jarred did not reply. He had raised his eyes to the platform and seen what was lying there. It was the body of an old woman. Her work-worn hands were folded on her chest. Her wrinkled face was peaceful in the flickering light of the candles that surrounded her.</p>
        <p>"Min!" he whispered. His eyes burned with sudden tears as he looked at the old nurse who had cared for him through his childhood. He had not seen her for many years, but he had thought of her often. It was hard to believe that she was dead.</p>
        <p>"She had a grown-up son, you know," Endon murmured. "He lived in the palace, but I never met him. I asked for him, when I heard she had died. They told me he had run away escaped through the gates during the feast. He was afraid, Jarred. Min must have told him what she heard. He knew she had been killed ... "</p>
        <p>"Killed?" gasped Jarred. "But-"</p>
        <p>Endon's face was twisted with sorrow. "She came to me in my chamber. I was about to leave for the feast celebrating my seven years as king," he muttered. "She was troubled. She had been working in her sewing room, and had overheard whisperings outside that frightened her. She told me that there were enemies within the palace, and that some great evil was to strike this night."</p>
        <p>He bowed his head. "I would not listen to her. I thought she had fallen asleep over her work, and dreamed. I smiled at her fears and sent her away. And within the hour, she was</p>
        <p>dead. She had fallen from the top of the stairs to the hall below.</p>
        <p>They said it was an accident. But ... "</p>
        <p>"But you do not think so," Jarred finished for him, looking sadly at Min's still, pale face. "You think she was killed because of what she knew."</p>

With a shaky laugh, Jarred bent to raise the kneeling king. "Endon! I did not know you, either! Get up, for mercy's sake!"</p>
        <p>As he stared, his eyes slowly adjusting to the light, he thought that it was no wonder he had not recognized his old friend.</p>
        <p>The slim, solemn boy he had left behind him seven years ago had become a man. Endon had grown as tall and broad-shouldered as Jarred himself. His stiff robes and high collar</p>
        <p>were encrusted with tiny gems that glittered in the light. His eyes were outlined with black and his eyelids colored blue, in the palace fashion. His long hair and beard were plaited and twined with gold. He smelt of perfume and spices. To Jarred, who had been so long away from the palace and its ways, he made a strange, awesome picture.</p>
        <p>Jarred realized that Endon was staring at him, too, and suddenly he became aware of his workman's clothes, his thick boots, his rough beard, and untidy hair. He felt clumsy and</p>
        <p>awkward. To hide this he turned away.</p>
        <p>As he did, he at last realized where he was. He was in the chapel. One of the marble tiles that surrounded the raised platform in the center had been pushed aside, and a dark hole</p>
        <p>gaped where it had lain.</p>
        <p>"The tunnel through the hill is known only to the royal family, and is only to be used in times of great danger," he heard Endon say softly. "King Brandon caused it to be made when the palace was built. My father taught me of it when I was very young, as he had been taught in his time-in words that even a small child would remember. There is a rhyme for entering the palace, and a rhyme for leaving it. It is a dark secret. Even the chief advisors have never known of it."</p>
        <p>Jarred did not reply. He had raised his eyes to the platform and seen what was lying there. It was the body of an old woman. Her work-worn hands were folded on her chest. Her wrinkled face was peaceful in the flickering light of the candles that surrounded her.</p>
        <p>"Min!" he whispered. His eyes burned with sudden tears as he looked at the old nurse who had cared for him through his childhood. He had not seen her for many years, but he had thought of her often. It was hard to believe that she was dead.</p>
        <p>"She had a grown-up son, you know," Endon murmured. "He lived in the palace, but I never met him. I asked for him, when I heard she had died. They told me he had run away escaped through the gates during the feast. He was afraid, Jarred. Min must have told him what she heard. He knew she had been killed ... "</p>
        <p>"Killed?" gasped Jarred. "But-"</p>
        <p>Endon's face was twisted with sorrow. "She came to me in my chamber. I was about to leave for the feast celebrating my seven years as king," he muttered. "She was troubled. She had been working in her sewing room, and had overheard whisperings outside that frightened her. She told me that there were enemies within the palace, and that some great evil was to strike this night."</p>
        <p>He bowed his head. "I would not listen to her. I thought she had fallen asleep over her work, and dreamed. I smiled at her fears and sent her away. And within the hour, she was</p>
        <p>dead. She had fallen from the top of the stairs to the hall below.</p>
        <p>They said it was an accident. But ... "</p>
        <p>"But you do not think so," Jarred finished for him, looking sadly at Min's still, pale face. "You think she was killed because of what she knew."</p>

With a shaky laugh, Jarred bent to raise the kneeling king. "Endon! I did not know you, either! Get up, for mercy's sake!"</p>
        <p>As he stared, his eyes slowly adjusting to the light, he thought that it was no wonder he had not recognized his old friend.</p>
        <p>The slim, solemn boy he had left behind him seven years ago had become a man. Endon had grown as tall and broad-shouldered as Jarred himself. His stiff robes and high collar</p>
        <p>were encrusted with tiny gems that glittered in the light. His eyes were outlined with black and his eyelids colored blue, in the palace fashion. His long hair and beard were plaited and twined with gold. He smelt of perfume and spices. To Jarred, who had been so long away from the palace and its ways, he made a strange, awesome picture.</p>
        <p>Jarred realized that Endon was staring at him, too, and suddenly he became aware of his workman's clothes, his thick boots, his rough beard, and untidy hair. He felt clumsy and</p>
        <p>awkward. To hide this he turned away.</p>
        <p>As he did, he at last realized where he was. He was in the chapel. One of the marble tiles that surrounded the raised platform in the center had been pushed aside, and a dark hole</p>
        <p>gaped where it had lain.</p>
        <p>"The tunnel through the hill is known only to the royal family, and is only to be used in times of great danger," he heard Endon say softly. "King Brandon caused it to be made when the palace was built. My father taught me of it when I was very young, as he had been taught in his time-in words that even a small child would remember. There is a rhyme for entering the palace, and a rhyme for leaving it. It is a dark secret. Even the chief advisors have never known of it."</p>
        <p>Jarred did not reply. He had raised his eyes to the platform and seen what was lying there. It was the body of an old woman. Her work-worn hands were folded on her chest. Her wrinkled face was peaceful in the flickering light of the candles that surrounded her.</p>
        <p>"Min!" he whispered. His eyes burned with sudden tears as he looked at the old nurse who had cared for him through his childhood. He had not seen her for many years, but he had thought of her often. It was hard to believe that she was dead.</p>
        <p>"She had a grown-up son, you know," Endon murmured. "He lived in the palace, but I never met him. I asked for him, when I heard she had died. They told me he had run away escaped through the gates during the feast. He was afraid, Jarred. Min must have told him what she heard. He knew she had been killed ... "</p>
        <p>"Killed?" gasped Jarred. "But-"</p>
        <p>Endon's face was twisted with sorrow. "She came to me in my chamber. I was about to leave for the feast celebrating my seven years as king," he muttered. "She was troubled. She had been working in her sewing room, and had overheard whisperings outside that frightened her. She told me that there were enemies within the palace, and that some great evil was to strike this night."</p>
        <p>He bowed his head. "I would not listen to her. I thought she had fallen asleep over her work, and dreamed. I smiled at her fears and sent her away. And within the hour, she was</p>
        <p>dead. She had fallen from the top of the stairs to the hall below.</p>
        <p>They said it was an accident. But ... "</p>
        <p>"But you do not think so," Jarred finished for him, looking sadly at Min's still, pale face. "You think she was killed because of what she knew."</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br>
Jarred backed away from him, fighting back the pain from his injured hand, trying desperately to think. He had no wish to die, but he knew that at all costs he must save Endon, Sharn, and their unborn child, the heir to the throne of Deltora.</p>
        <p>"We are too many for you, Prandine," he said loudly.</p>
        <p>"While you struggle with one, the others can escape." He wondered if Prandine would realize that this was not just a challenge to him, but a message for Endon. While I distract him, take Sharn and run!</p>
        <p>But Prandine was laughing again, kicking the door shut behind him. "There will be no struggle," he jeered, moving forward. "The poison on this blade is deadly. One tiny scratch</p>
        <p>and the end comes quickly. As it did for your mother and father, King Endon."</p>
        <p>"Murderer! Traitor!" breathed Endon, pushing Sharn behind him. "You have betrayed your king, and your land." "This is not my land," sneered Prandine. "My loyalty, like the loyalty of the chief advisors before me, has always been to another place and to a far greater master."</p>
        <p>He looked at Endon with contempt. "You are the last in a line of royal buffoons, King Endon. Little by little we robbed your family of power until you were nothing but puppets</p>
        <p>moving as we pulled the strings. And then, at last, the time was right to take your last protection from you."</p>
        <p>He pointed a bony finger at the tangled chain in Endon's hands. "Finally, the blacksmith Adin's accursed work has been undone. The Belt of Deltora is no more."</p>
        <p>"The gems cannot be destroyed," Endon said through pale lips. "And it is death to take them beyond Deltora's borders."</p>
        <p>Prandine smiled cruelly. "The gems have been scattered far and wide, hidden where no one would dare to find them. And when you and your unborn brat are dead, finding them</p>
        <p>would be no use in any case."</p>
        <p>The room darkened and thunder growled outside the tower. Prandine's eyes glowed with triumph. "The Shadow Lord comes," he hissed.</p>
        <p>Cowering against the wall, Sharn moaned softly. Then she seemed to hear something. She sidled to the open window and looked out-not up to the black sky but down to the ground below the tower. The next moment she had jumped back, covering her mouth with her hand as if to smother a shriek.</p>
        <p>"What is it?" snarled Prandine, suddenly alert.</p>
        <p>Sharn shook her head. "Nothing," she stammered. "I was mistaken. There is no one there."</p>
        <p>Oh, Sharn, even a child could tell that you are lying! thought Jarred desperately. Thanks to you, whoever has come to help us is doomed.</p>
        <p>"Stay where you are or she dies at once!" barked Prandine to the two men as he crossed the room.</p>
        <p>Sharn shrank away from him as he reached her. "Do not look out! There is no one there!" she cried again.</p>
        <p>"So you say," Prandine sneered. He thrust his head and shoulders out of the open window.</p>
        <p>And in the next instant Sharn had crouched behind him, thrown her arms around his knees, jerked his legs back and upwards, and tipped him over the sill.</p>
        <p>Jarred and Endon, frozen with shock, listened to their enemy's screams as he plunged to the hard earth far below. They both stared, astounded, at the small figure turning from the window to face them.</p>
        <p>"Often, in the great hall, I have watched little clowns upset big ones from below," Sharn said calmly. "I did not see why the trick should not work for me."</p>
        <p>"What-what did you see from the window?" Jarred stammered.</p>
        <p>"Nothing. As I told him. But I knew he would not trust my word." Sharn tossed her head. "And I knew he would lean out. Why should he fear a little painted doll like me?"</p>
        <p>Jarred gazed at her in frank admiration, then turned to Endon. "You are as fortunate in your bride as I am in mine," he said.</p>

Jarred backed away from him, fighting back the pain from his injured hand, trying desperately to think. He had no wish to die, but he knew that at all costs he must save Endon, Sharn, and their unborn child, the heir to the throne of Deltora.</p>
        <p>"We are too many for you, Prandine," he said loudly.</p>
        <p>"While you struggle with one, the others can escape." He wondered if Prandine would realize that this was not just a challenge to him, but a message for Endon. While I distract him, take Sharn and run!</p>
        <p>But Prandine was laughing again, kicking the door shut behind him. "There will be no struggle," he jeered, moving forward. "The poison on this blade is deadly. One tiny scratch</p>
        <p>and the end comes quickly. As it did for your mother and father, King Endon."</p>
        <p>"Murderer! Traitor!" breathed Endon, pushing Sharn behind him. "You have betrayed your king, and your land." "This is not my land," sneered Prandine. "My loyalty, like the loyalty of the chief advisors before me, has always been to another place and to a far greater master."</p>
        <p>He looked at Endon with contempt. "You are the last in a line of royal buffoons, King Endon. Little by little we robbed your family of power until you were nothing but puppets</p>
        <p>moving as we pulled the strings. And then, at last, the time was right to take your last protection from you."</p>
        <p>He pointed a bony finger at the tangled chain in Endon's hands. "Finally, the blacksmith Adin's accursed work has been undone. The Belt of Deltora is no more."</p>
        <p>"The gems cannot be destroyed," Endon said through pale lips. "And it is death to take them beyond Deltora's borders."</p>
        <p>Prandine smiled cruelly. "The gems have been scattered far and wide, hidden where no one would dare to find them. And when you and your unborn brat are dead, finding them</p>
        <p>would be no use in any case."</p>
        <p>The room darkened and thunder growled outside the tower. Prandine's eyes glowed with triumph. "The Shadow Lord comes," he hissed.</p>
        <p>Cowering against the wall, Sharn moaned softly. Then she seemed to hear something. She sidled to the open window and looked out-not up to the black sky but down to the ground below the tower. The next moment she had jumped back, covering her mouth with her hand as if to smother a shriek.</p>
