        <p>
          <strong>Dad’s Big Toe</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Dad was a hard worker. He had a little office upstairs, and he worked there all day and sometimes all evening. At night he was usually tired.</p>
        <p>Lucy and Will sat in their bedroom, watching him being tired as he searched for a story to read.</p>
        <p>‘You’re all full of yawns,’ Lucy said to him.</p>
        <p>‘The funny thing about yawns,’ Will said thoughtfully, ‘is they’re not like sneezes.’ He began to explain the difference between a yawn and a sneeze, but it was hard to hear him because he was lying squished face-down on the floor with his feet up on Lucy’s bed and his head under the bedside table. Will liked to invent new positions.</p>
        <p>‘Will ’ Dad said. ‘What are you doing?’ ‘Relaxing.’</p>
        <p>‘Relax on your own bed,’ Lucy said.</p>
        <p>‘I can’t get my feet on the top bunk from here,’ Will said, spitting out carpet fur. They began to bicker.</p>
        <p>‘No bickering,’ Dad said. ‘I’m too tired.’</p>
        <p>‘We’re not asking you to bicker,’ Will said. ‘Lucy and I can manage on our own.’</p>
        <p>‘I mean I’m too tired to deal with you bickering,’ Dad said, but he couldn’t make himself sound cross because at that moment he began to yawn. In fact it was such a long, stretchy, blind sort of yawn that when he had finished it and could see again, Will had finished bickering with Lucy and had gone downstairs to bicker with Mum instead, and the bedroom was quiet.</p>
        <p>‘Are you going to read to me now?’ Lucy asked. ‘Can you read if you’re full of yawns?’&nbsp; Dad sat on the bed, yawning. ‘I’ll try,’ he said.</p>
        <p>Five minutes later, as he was saying, ‘For the first time in his life he was face to face with a silk-monkey,’ he fell asleep. He didn’t say he was going to fall asleep, he just did. He slid slowly sideways along the wall and sprawled on Lucy’s bed with his eyes closed and his chin on his chest.</p>
        <p>Lucy crawled out from under her duvet to have a closer look. ‘Dad, you’ve fallen asleep,’ she whispered.</p>
        <p>Dad didn’t disagree. Lucy watched him for a while. His face was slack and he was breathing through his nose in deep, whispery breaths. She put her finger out to feel the breaths, and they were warm and damp. She grinned to herself. Then she put her finger behind his right ear, and tickled him. A puzzled, frowny look went across his face, but he didn’t wake up. Lucy grinned again. She tickled him behind his other ear, and in his sleep he smacked his lips together as if he were tasting something odd, and Lucy had to put her hand over her mouth to stop herself laughing. Then she sat back and looked at him a bit longer while she decided what to do next.</p>
        <p>What would it be like, she wondered, if she tried to take his shoes off without waking him up? She thought it would be hard.</p>
        <p>But it turned out to be easy.</p>
        <p>Then she wondered if she could take off his socks without waking him up, and she did that too.</p>
        <p>His bare feet dangled over the edge of the bed, and she sat looking at them, and grinning. Naturally she thought about tickling them, but she had a better idea. A much better idea. She got up and went to her drawer where she kept her precious things, and searched through it until she found what she wanted, and went back and sat cross-legged next to Dad's feet, and got to work.</p>
        <p>At first she found it difficult, and she made a few mistakes. It was hard to keep her hands steady all the time. But in ten minutes she had painted all Dad's toenails in her favourite purple sparkly nail polish.</p>
        <p>Feeling very pleased with herself, she sat looking at the gleaming toes. They were much nicer purple and sparkly, she thought. She thought all toes should be sparkly purple, even Dad's. And then, quite suddenly, she thought that Dad wouldn't think so, and she was scared at what she'd done. Downstairs she could hear Mum and Will coming to the end of their argument, and she began to panic. As quickly and carefully as she could, she put Dad's socks back on, and his shoes, and just as she was finishing doing up the laces Dad woke with a grunt, saying, 'And the sulky-minkey said . . . the silly-money . . . Oh.'</p>
        <p>He sat on the edge of the bed, looking baffled. 'I think I must have nodded off for a few seconds,' he said at last. Lucy waited anxiously for him to ask her what she'd been doing while he was asleep, but he didn't. He tucked her into bed, kissed her good-night, and went downstairs. A few minutes later Will came up to read on his own, and he didn't ask her what she'd been doing either. She lay in bed, thinking nervously about what would happen when Dad found out that his toes were purple and sparkly. She felt very worried, but somehow it didn't stop her being tired, and, before she knew it, she was asleep.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Dad’s Big Toe</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Dad was a hard worker. He had a little office upstairs, and he worked there all day and sometimes all evening. At night he was usually tired.</p>
        <p>Lucy and Will sat in their bedroom, watching him being tired as he searched for a story to read.</p>
        <p>‘You’re all full of yawns,’ Lucy said to him.</p>
        <p>‘The funny thing about yawns,’ Will said thoughtfully, ‘is they’re not like sneezes.’ He began to explain the difference between a yawn and a sneeze, but it was hard to hear him because he was lying squished face-down on the floor with his feet up on Lucy’s bed and his head under the bedside table. Will liked to invent new positions.</p>
        <p>‘Will ’ Dad said. ‘What are you doing?’ ‘Relaxing.’</p>
        <p>‘Relax on your own bed,’ Lucy said.</p>
        <p>‘I can’t get my feet on the top bunk from here,’ Will said, spitting out carpet fur. They began to bicker.</p>
        <p>‘No bickering,’ Dad said. ‘I’m too tired.’</p>
        <p>‘We’re not asking you to bicker,’ Will said. ‘Lucy and I can manage on our own.’</p>
        <p>‘I mean I’m too tired to deal with you bickering,’ Dad said, but he couldn’t make himself sound cross because at that moment he began to yawn. In fact it was such a long, stretchy, blind sort of yawn that when he had finished it and could see again, Will had finished bickering with Lucy and had gone downstairs to bicker with Mum instead, and the bedroom was quiet.</p>
        <p>‘Are you going to read to me now?’ Lucy asked. ‘Can you read if you’re full of yawns?’&nbsp; Dad sat on the bed, yawning. ‘I’ll try,’ he said.</p>
        <p>Five minutes later, as he was saying, ‘For the first time in his life he was face to face with a silk-monkey,’ he fell asleep. He didn’t say he was going to fall asleep, he just did. He slid slowly sideways along the wall and sprawled on Lucy’s bed with his eyes closed and his chin on his chest.</p>
        <p>Lucy crawled out from under her duvet to have a closer look. ‘Dad, you’ve fallen asleep,’ she whispered.</p>
        <p>Dad didn’t disagree. Lucy watched him for a while. His face was slack and he was breathing through his nose in deep, whispery breaths. She put her finger out to feel the breaths, and they were warm and damp. She grinned to herself. Then she put her finger behind his right ear, and tickled him. A puzzled, frowny look went across his face, but he didn’t wake up. Lucy grinned again. She tickled him behind his other ear, and in his sleep he smacked his lips together as if he were tasting something odd, and Lucy had to put her hand over her mouth to stop herself laughing. Then she sat back and looked at him a bit longer while she decided what to do next.</p>
        <p>What would it be like, she wondered, if she tried to take his shoes off without waking him up? She thought it would be hard.</p>
        <p>But it turned out to be easy.</p>
        <p>Then she wondered if she could take off his socks without waking him up, and she did that too.</p>
        <p>His bare feet dangled over the edge of the bed, and she sat looking at them, and grinning. Naturally she thought about tickling them, but she had a better idea. A much better idea. She got up and went to her drawer where she kept her precious things, and searched through it until she found what she wanted, and went back and sat cross-legged next to Dad's feet, and got to work.</p>
        <p>At first she found it difficult, and she made a few mistakes. It was hard to keep her hands steady all the time. But in ten minutes she had painted all Dad's toenails in her favourite purple sparkly nail polish.</p>
        <p>Feeling very pleased with herself, she sat looking at the gleaming toes. They were much nicer purple and sparkly, she thought. She thought all toes should be sparkly purple, even Dad's. And then, quite suddenly, she thought that Dad wouldn't think so, and she was scared at what she'd done. Downstairs she could hear Mum and Will coming to the end of their argument, and she began to panic. As quickly and carefully as she could, she put Dad's socks back on, and his shoes, and just as she was finishing doing up the laces Dad woke with a grunt, saying, 'And the sulky-minkey said . . . the silly-money . . . Oh.'</p>
        <p>He sat on the edge of the bed, looking baffled. 'I think I must have nodded off for a few seconds,' he said at last. Lucy waited anxiously for him to ask her what she'd been doing while he was asleep, but he didn't. He tucked her into bed, kissed her good-night, and went downstairs. A few minutes later Will came up to read on his own, and he didn't ask her what she'd been doing either. She lay in bed, thinking nervously about what would happen when Dad found out that his toes were purple and sparkly. She felt very worried, but somehow it didn't stop her being tired, and, before she knew it, she was asleep.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Dad’s Big Toe</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Dad was a hard worker. He had a little office upstairs, and he worked there all day and sometimes all evening. At night he was usually tired.</p>
        <p>Lucy and Will sat in their bedroom, watching him being tired as he searched for a story to read.</p>
        <p>‘You’re all full of yawns,’ Lucy said to him.</p>
        <p>‘The funny thing about yawns,’ Will said thoughtfully, ‘is they’re not like sneezes.’ He began to explain the difference between a yawn and a sneeze, but it was hard to hear him because he was lying squished face-down on the floor with his feet up on Lucy’s bed and his head under the bedside table. Will liked to invent new positions.</p>
        <p>‘Will ’ Dad said. ‘What are you doing?’ ‘Relaxing.’</p>
        <p>‘Relax on your own bed,’ Lucy said.</p>
        <p>‘I can’t get my feet on the top bunk from here,’ Will said, spitting out carpet fur. They began to bicker.</p>
        <p>‘No bickering,’ Dad said. ‘I’m too tired.’</p>
        <p>‘We’re not asking you to bicker,’ Will said. ‘Lucy and I can manage on our own.’</p>
        <p>‘I mean I’m too tired to deal with you bickering,’ Dad said, but he couldn’t make himself sound cross because at that moment he began to yawn. In fact it was such a long, stretchy, blind sort of yawn that when he had finished it and could see again, Will had finished bickering with Lucy and had gone downstairs to bicker with Mum instead, and the bedroom was quiet.</p>
        <p>‘Are you going to read to me now?’ Lucy asked. ‘Can you read if you’re full of yawns?’&nbsp; Dad sat on the bed, yawning. ‘I’ll try,’ he said.</p>
        <p>Five minutes later, as he was saying, ‘For the first time in his life he was face to face with a silk-monkey,’ he fell asleep. He didn’t say he was going to fall asleep, he just did. He slid slowly sideways along the wall and sprawled on Lucy’s bed with his eyes closed and his chin on his chest.</p>
        <p>Lucy crawled out from under her duvet to have a closer look. ‘Dad, you’ve fallen asleep,’ she whispered.</p>
        <p>Dad didn’t disagree. Lucy watched him for a while. His face was slack and he was breathing through his nose in deep, whispery breaths. She put her finger out to feel the breaths, and they were warm and damp. She grinned to herself. Then she put her finger behind his right ear, and tickled him. A puzzled, frowny look went across his face, but he didn’t wake up. Lucy grinned again. She tickled him behind his other ear, and in his sleep he smacked his lips together as if he were tasting something odd, and Lucy had to put her hand over her mouth to stop herself laughing. Then she sat back and looked at him a bit longer while she decided what to do next.</p>
        <p>What would it be like, she wondered, if she tried to take his shoes off without waking him up? She thought it would be hard.</p>
        <p>But it turned out to be easy.</p>
        <p>Then she wondered if she could take off his socks without waking him up, and she did that too.</p>
        <p>His bare feet dangled over the edge of the bed, and she sat looking at them, and grinning. Naturally she thought about tickling them, but she had a better idea. A much better idea. She got up and went to her drawer where she kept her precious things, and searched through it until she found what she wanted, and went back and sat cross-legged next to Dad's feet, and got to work.</p>
        <p>At first she found it difficult, and she made a few mistakes. It was hard to keep her hands steady all the time. But in ten minutes she had painted all Dad's toenails in her favourite purple sparkly nail polish.</p>
        <p>Feeling very pleased with herself, she sat looking at the gleaming toes. They were much nicer purple and sparkly, she thought. She thought all toes should be sparkly purple, even Dad's. And then, quite suddenly, she thought that Dad wouldn't think so, and she was scared at what she'd done. Downstairs she could hear Mum and Will coming to the end of their argument, and she began to panic. As quickly and carefully as she could, she put Dad's socks back on, and his shoes, and just as she was finishing doing up the laces Dad woke with a grunt, saying, 'And the sulky-minkey said . . . the silly-money . . . Oh.'</p>
        <p>He sat on the edge of the bed, looking baffled. 'I think I must have nodded off for a few seconds,' he said at last. Lucy waited anxiously for him to ask her what she'd been doing while he was asleep, but he didn't. He tucked her into bed, kissed her good-night, and went downstairs. A few minutes later Will came up to read on his own, and he didn't ask her what she'd been doing either. She lay in bed, thinking nervously about what would happen when Dad found out that his toes were purple and sparkly. She felt very worried, but somehow it didn't stop her being tired, and, before she knew it, she was asleep.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Is Wilbur the Pig About to Become Bacon?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>In the new movie <em>Charlotte’s </em>Web (based on the book by E.B. White), the porker is slated for the chopping block—until a barn spider named Charlotte comes to his rescue. Secretly spinning messages such as “Some Pig ” and “Terrific” into her web, Charlotte outsmarts the humans and keeps Wilbur off the breakfast table. <em>National Geographic Kids</em> uncovers what really would be going on at Charlotte’s web site.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Web Master</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Charlotte is a graceful acrobat: Attached to her spider silk, she drops onto Wilbur’s snout and later swings across the barn to Ike the horse. Real spiders are just as athletic.</p>
        <p>Releasing a silk dragline from their spinnerets to keep them attached to their webs, some spiders can bungee jump up to 40 times their body length, then climb right back up the thin, strong-as-steel silk cord.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>The Boss of Them</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Golly the goose barks orders to help Wilbur escape through a fence and chases Templeton the rat when he steals an egg. Golly is just trying to help, but he sure seems bossy In real life, geese are bossy beasts. They pinch, honk, stretch out their necks, and flap around. “A dominant male wants to be the boss of everything,” says Don Schrider of the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy. “He doesn’t think that even a horse is that much bigger than he is.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Pig Smarts</strong>
        </p>
        <p>When Wilbur discovers a loose board in his fence, he pushes it open with his snout and makes a break for freedom. Would a pig really be smart enough to escape? Yep. Schrider says pigs are as brainy as dogs and often use their snouts as tools to nudge open latches or dig under fences. And though pigs may have a reputation for being lazy, they’re fast runners. So once they’re out, they’re great at avoiding recapture.</p>

          <strong>Is Wilbur the Pig About to Become Bacon?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>In the new movie <em>Charlotte’s </em>Web (based on the book by E.B. White), the porker is slated for the chopping block—until a barn spider named Charlotte comes to his rescue. Secretly spinning messages such as “Some Pig ” and “Terrific” into her web, Charlotte outsmarts the humans and keeps Wilbur off the breakfast table. <em>National Geographic Kids</em> uncovers what really would be going on at Charlotte’s web site.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Web Master</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Charlotte is a graceful acrobat: Attached to her spider silk, she drops onto Wilbur’s snout and later swings across the barn to Ike the horse. Real spiders are just as athletic.</p>
        <p>Releasing a silk dragline from their spinnerets to keep them attached to their webs, some spiders can bungee jump up to 40 times their body length, then climb right back up the thin, strong-as-steel silk cord.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>The Boss of Them</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Golly the goose barks orders to help Wilbur escape through a fence and chases Templeton the rat when he steals an egg. Golly is just trying to help, but he sure seems bossy In real life, geese are bossy beasts. They pinch, honk, stretch out their necks, and flap around. “A dominant male wants to be the boss of everything,” says Don Schrider of the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy. “He doesn’t think that even a horse is that much bigger than he is.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Pig Smarts</strong>
        </p>
        <p>When Wilbur discovers a loose board in his fence, he pushes it open with his snout and makes a break for freedom. Would a pig really be smart enough to escape? Yep. Schrider says pigs are as brainy as dogs and often use their snouts as tools to nudge open latches or dig under fences. And though pigs may have a reputation for being lazy, they’re fast runners. So once they’re out, they’re great at avoiding recapture.</p>

          <strong>Is Wilbur the Pig About to Become Bacon?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>In the new movie <em>Charlotte’s </em>Web (based on the book by E.B. White), the porker is slated for the chopping block—until a barn spider named Charlotte comes to his rescue. Secretly spinning messages such as “Some Pig ” and “Terrific” into her web, Charlotte outsmarts the humans and keeps Wilbur off the breakfast table. <em>National Geographic Kids</em> uncovers what really would be going on at Charlotte’s web site.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Web Master</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Charlotte is a graceful acrobat: Attached to her spider silk, she drops onto Wilbur’s snout and later swings across the barn to Ike the horse. Real spiders are just as athletic.</p>
        <p>Releasing a silk dragline from their spinnerets to keep them attached to their webs, some spiders can bungee jump up to 40 times their body length, then climb right back up the thin, strong-as-steel silk cord.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>The Boss of Them</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Golly the goose barks orders to help Wilbur escape through a fence and chases Templeton the rat when he steals an egg. Golly is just trying to help, but he sure seems bossy In real life, geese are bossy beasts. They pinch, honk, stretch out their necks, and flap around. “A dominant male wants to be the boss of everything,” says Don Schrider of the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy. “He doesn’t think that even a horse is that much bigger than he is.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Pig Smarts</strong>
        </p>
        <p>When Wilbur discovers a loose board in his fence, he pushes it open with his snout and makes a break for freedom. Would a pig really be smart enough to escape? Yep. Schrider says pigs are as brainy as dogs and often use their snouts as tools to nudge open latches or dig under fences. And though pigs may have a reputation for being lazy, they’re fast runners. So once they’re out, they’re great at avoiding recapture.</p>
