        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Skull Island is a fictional island located in the south Pacific Ocean west of Indonesia and is the home of King Kong in the original 1933 King Kong, its 1976 and 2005 remakes, and the 2017 film Kong: Skull Island. Film producer, Carl Denham received a strange map marking the location of a mysterious uncharted island located west of Indonesia.<br>
<br>
Determined to explore the island and shoot his next picture there, Denham assembled a film crew and left for the island from New York on board the Venture. After months of sea travel, the Venture came upon the island, which was shrouded in fog and marked by a gigantic mountain on the centre of the island shaped like a human skull. Denham and his crew came ashore on the island and discovered a massive wall surrounding a native village. The crew entered the village and witnessed the natives performing a ritual, preparing to sacrifice a woman to their god, "Kong". The native chief, after seeing Denham's leading lady Ann Darrow, offered to trade several of his tribe's women for her.<br>
<br>
Denham refused, angering the natives. The crew returned to the Venture, which was anchored off the coast of the island. During the night, a group of natives used canoes to approach the ship and abduct Ann. The natives brought Ann back to their village and tied her onto a pedestal located outside of the wall. Eventually, a gigantic gorilla, the natives' god Kong, emerged from the jungle and grabbed Ann, carrying her off back into the jungle.<br>

Atlantis is a legendary island in the Atlantic Ocean, lying west of the Strait of Gibraltar. The principal sources for the legend are two of ancient Greek, Plato’s writings,&nbsp;Timaeus&nbsp;and&nbsp;Critias. In the former, Plato describes how Egyptian priests, in conversation with the Athenian lawgiver Solon, described Atlantis as an island larger than Asia Minor and Libya combined, and situated just beyond the Pillars of Hercules (the Strait of Gibraltar). About 9,000 years before the birth of Solon, the priests said, Atlantis was a rich island whose powerful princes conquered many of the lands of the Mediterranean until they were finally defeated by the Athenians and the latter’s allies. The Atlantians eventually became wicked and impious, and their island was swallowed up by the sea, as a result of earthquakes.<br>

The novel, ‘Island of Adventure’ was written by the famous author, Enid Blyton. Philip and Dinah Mannering and their new friends Jack and Lucy-Ann Trent — along with Jack's irrepressible talking parrot, Kiki — are spending their summer holiday at Craggy-Tops, an ancient, half-ruined house by the sea. Before long, they are drawn to the mysterious Isle of Gloom in the distance and are determined to find a way to get there and explore it. But gradually it becomes apparent that the island may not be as deserted as it's supposed to be. Who is signaling from the island to the mainland at night? What is going on in the abandoned copper mines beneath the island? And what does the friendly, yet enigmatic Bill Smugs know about it all? The four children find themselves caught up in an adventure more thrilling — and dangerous — than they could have imagined.<br>

There are a handful of places around the world that are largely untouched or uninhabited. Unexplored areas around the world also include small islands, such as Pitcairn Island off of New Zealand, and Palmerston Island in the South Pacific. Pitcairn Island is located 3,300 miles from New Zealand, and no plane or helicopter has ever landed there. It requires a hefty 32-hour yacht ride to get to the remote island of Pitcairn from Auckland, New Zealand, and apparently, no plane or helicopter has ever landed there. The island is known as a British Overseas Territory, and its government is situated in New Zealand. It's also considered to be one of the least-populated territories in the world, with about 50 residents in 2018. A photographer who has visited the island previously told Insider that when Pitcairn's inhabitants need medical attention, they must go to New Zealand or Fiji, and sometimes are unable to return to Pitcairn for weeks or even months.<br>

Pitcairn Island is located 3,300 miles from New Zealand, and no plane or helicopter has ever landed there. It requires a hefty 32-hour yacht ride to get to the remote island of Pitcairn from Auckland, New Zealand, and apparently, no plane or helicopter has ever landed there. The island is known as a British Overseas Territory, and its government is situated in New Zealand. It's also considered to be one of the least-populated territories in the world, with about 50 residents in 2018. A photographer who has visited the island previously told Insider that when Pitcairn's inhabitants need medical attention, they must go to New Zealand or Fiji, and sometimes are unable to return to Pitcairn for weeks or even months.<br>

<p class="txt-ctr"><strong>ORCHIDS</strong></p>

<p>Popular around the globe for their beauty and variety, orchids are the largest family of plants in the entire world. There are 25,000 – 30,000 different species of orchid, at least 10,000 of which can be found in the tropics. <strong>1</strong> ............ . While some orchids may only be the size of a nickel when in bloom, others may weigh up to one ton with petals as long as 30 inches, and sprays of small flowers 12 – 14 feet long. Orchid blossoms appear in almost every imaginable colour except for true black.<br>
<br>
<strong>2</strong> ............ . The outer three flower parts are green ‘sepals’. The inner three flower parts are beautifully coloured ‘petals’. Some orchids live underground (subterranean), some grow on rocks (lithophytes), and some grow in the soil. However, most are epiphytes, which means they grow on other plants and trees.<br>
<br>
Orchids tend to obtain their nourishment from the air, rain or moisture in the soil. While some are self-pollinating, most rely on specific insects or birds for pollination. Another unique fact about the orchid is that the plant compensates for its lack of a true water-retentive root system by working with a certain type of fungi called mycorrhizae fungi during some portion of their life cycle. During this period, the fungi grow partly inside orchid roots, helping the plant to absorb water and minerals. The orchid ‘repays’ the fungi by producing some nutrients during photosynthesis that help the fungi to survive. <strong>3</strong> ............ .<br>
<br>
Orchids that you can grow come in all shapes, sizes and colours and are grown for their bold and usually long-lasting flowers. <strong>4</strong> ............ . There are orchids that flower throughout the year and others that only flower at certain times of the year. Some are for experienced gardeners while others are ideal for beginners or those without much time. Easy-care orchids make welcome gifts and any orchid can be the beginning of a hobby or collection.<br>
<br>
Despite the huge variety in colour and flower shape along with growing conditions, most orchids grow best in a container such as a pot or hanging basket with good quality, free-draining orchid potting mix made from composted bark. Some can also be grown mounted on boards or grown on tree trunks (trees that don’t shed bark) or on tree ferns. Water occasionally and feed with a specialist orchid plant food when the orchid is actively growing (usually in spring). <strong>5</strong> ............ . This is also a good time to propagate orchids by division of an existing clump.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pests that threaten orchids include the orchid beetle, which can leave chewed and ragged leaves (remove by hand). There are also the mealy bug, scale, or two-spotted mite which also attack foliage. <strong>6</strong> ............ . Apply a registered chemical control or a diluted oil spray to remove pests. Also protect plants from snails and slugs, especially when buds are forming. Regularly remove discoloured leaves.</p>

<p class="txt-ctr"><strong>ORCHIDS</strong></p>

<p>Popular around the globe for their beauty and variety, orchids are the largest family of plants in the entire world. There are 25,000 – 30,000 different species of orchid, at least 10,000 of which can be found in the tropics. <strong>1</strong> ............ . While some orchids may only be the size of a nickel when in bloom, others may weigh up to one ton with petals as long as 30 inches, and sprays of small flowers 12 – 14 feet long. Orchid blossoms appear in almost every imaginable colour except for true black.<br>
<br>
<strong>2</strong> ............ . The outer three flower parts are green ‘sepals’. The inner three flower parts are beautifully coloured ‘petals’. Some orchids live underground (subterranean), some grow on rocks (lithophytes), and some grow in the soil. However, most are epiphytes, which means they grow on other plants and trees.<br>
<br>
Orchids tend to obtain their nourishment from the air, rain or moisture in the soil. While some are self-pollinating, most rely on specific insects or birds for pollination. Another unique fact about the orchid is that the plant compensates for its lack of a true water-retentive root system by working with a certain type of fungi called mycorrhizae fungi during some portion of their life cycle. During this period, the fungi grow partly inside orchid roots, helping the plant to absorb water and minerals. The orchid ‘repays’ the fungi by producing some nutrients during photosynthesis that help the fungi to survive. <strong>3</strong> ............ .<br>
<br>
Orchids that you can grow come in all shapes, sizes and colours and are grown for their bold and usually long-lasting flowers. <strong>4</strong> ............ . There are orchids that flower throughout the year and others that only flower at certain times of the year. Some are for experienced gardeners while others are ideal for beginners or those without much time. Easy-care orchids make welcome gifts and any orchid can be the beginning of a hobby or collection.<br>
<br>
Despite the huge variety in colour and flower shape along with growing conditions, most orchids grow best in a container such as a pot or hanging basket with good quality, free-draining orchid potting mix made from composted bark. Some can also be grown mounted on boards or grown on tree trunks (trees that don’t shed bark) or on tree ferns. Water occasionally and feed with a specialist orchid plant food when the orchid is actively growing (usually in spring). <strong>5</strong> ............ . This is also a good time to propagate orchids by division of an existing clump.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pests that threaten orchids include the orchid beetle, which can leave chewed and ragged leaves (remove by hand). There are also the mealy bug, scale, or two-spotted mite which also attack foliage. <strong>6</strong> ............ . Apply a registered chemical control or a diluted oil spray to remove pests. Also protect plants from snails and slugs, especially when buds are forming. Regularly remove discoloured leaves.</p>

<p class="txt-ctr"><strong>ORCHIDS</strong></p>

<p>Popular around the globe for their beauty and variety, orchids are the largest family of plants in the entire world. There are 25,000 – 30,000 different species of orchid, at least 10,000 of which can be found in the tropics. <strong>1</strong> ............ . While some orchids may only be the size of a nickel when in bloom, others may weigh up to one ton with petals as long as 30 inches, and sprays of small flowers 12 – 14 feet long. Orchid blossoms appear in almost every imaginable colour except for true black.<br>
<br>
<strong>2</strong> ............ . The outer three flower parts are green ‘sepals’. The inner three flower parts are beautifully coloured ‘petals’. Some orchids live underground (subterranean), some grow on rocks (lithophytes), and some grow in the soil. However, most are epiphytes, which means they grow on other plants and trees.<br>
<br>
Orchids tend to obtain their nourishment from the air, rain or moisture in the soil. While some are self-pollinating, most rely on specific insects or birds for pollination. Another unique fact about the orchid is that the plant compensates for its lack of a true water-retentive root system by working with a certain type of fungi called mycorrhizae fungi during some portion of their life cycle. During this period, the fungi grow partly inside orchid roots, helping the plant to absorb water and minerals. The orchid ‘repays’ the fungi by producing some nutrients during photosynthesis that help the fungi to survive. <strong>3</strong> ............ .<br>
<br>
Orchids that you can grow come in all shapes, sizes and colours and are grown for their bold and usually long-lasting flowers. <strong>4</strong> ............ . There are orchids that flower throughout the year and others that only flower at certain times of the year. Some are for experienced gardeners while others are ideal for beginners or those without much time. Easy-care orchids make welcome gifts and any orchid can be the beginning of a hobby or collection.<br>
<br>
Despite the huge variety in colour and flower shape along with growing conditions, most orchids grow best in a container such as a pot or hanging basket with good quality, free-draining orchid potting mix made from composted bark. Some can also be grown mounted on boards or grown on tree trunks (trees that don’t shed bark) or on tree ferns. Water occasionally and feed with a specialist orchid plant food when the orchid is actively growing (usually in spring). <strong>5</strong> ............ . This is also a good time to propagate orchids by division of an existing clump.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pests that threaten orchids include the orchid beetle, which can leave chewed and ragged leaves (remove by hand). There are also the mealy bug, scale, or two-spotted mite which also attack foliage. <strong>6</strong> ............ . Apply a registered chemical control or a diluted oil spray to remove pests. Also protect plants from snails and slugs, especially when buds are forming. Regularly remove discoloured leaves.</p>

Orchids that you can grow come in all shapes, sizes and colours and are grown for their bold and usually long-lasting flowers. <strong>4</strong> ............ . There are orchids that flower throughout the year and others that only flower at certain times of the year. Some are for experienced gardeners while others are ideal for beginners or those without much time. Easy-care orchids make welcome gifts and any orchid can be the beginning of a hobby or collection.<br>
<br>
Despite the huge variety in colour and flower shape along with growing conditions, most orchids grow best in a container such as a pot or hanging basket with good quality, free-draining orchid potting mix made from composted bark. Some can also be grown mounted on boards or grown on tree trunks (trees that don’t shed bark) or on tree ferns. Water occasionally and feed with a specialist orchid plant food when the orchid is actively growing (usually in spring). <strong>5</strong> ............ . This is also a good time to propagate orchids by division of an existing clump.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pests that threaten orchids include the orchid beetle, which can leave chewed and ragged leaves (remove by hand). There are also the mealy bug, scale, or two-spotted mite which also attack foliage. <strong>6</strong> ............ . Apply a registered chemical control or a diluted oil spray to remove pests. Also protect plants from snails and slugs, especially when buds are forming. Regularly remove discoloured leaves.</p>
