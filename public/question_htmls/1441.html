From the window I saw the horses.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I was in Berlin, in winter. The light&nbsp;<br>
had no light, the sky had no heaven.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The air was white like wet bread.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And from my window&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline"><strong>a vacant arena</strong></span>,<br>
<span class="txt-underline"><strong>bitten by the teeth of winter</strong></span>.</p>
        <p><span class="txt-underline"><strong>Suddenly</strong></span>&nbsp;driven out by a man,&nbsp;<br>
ten horses surged through the mist.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Like waves of fire, they flared forward&nbsp;<br>
and to my eyes filled the whole world,&nbsp;<br>
empty till then. Perfect, ablaze,&nbsp;<br>
they were like ten gods with pure white hoofs,&nbsp;<br>
with manes like a dream of salt.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Their rumps were worlds and oranges.&nbsp;<br>
Their colour was honey, amber, fire.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Their necks were towers&nbsp;<br>
cut from the stone of pride,&nbsp;<br>
and behind their transparent eyes&nbsp;<br>
energy raged, like a prisoner.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There, in silence, at midday,&nbsp;<br>
in that dirty, disordered winter,&nbsp;<br>
those intense horses were the blood&nbsp;<br>
the rhythm, the inciting treasure of life.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I looked. I looked and was reborn:&nbsp;<br>
for there, unknowing, was the fountain,&nbsp;<br>
the dance of gold, heaven&nbsp;<br>
and the fire that lives in beauty.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I have forgotten that dark Berlin winter.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I will not forget the light of the horses.</p>

          <strong>The Snow Goose&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Paul Gallico&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>
                  <img width="52%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766023205/owosejemxaakwmbqdppr.jpg" alt="Screenshot 2021-12-18 at 14.10.57">


        </p>
        <p>In 1940, The Saturday Evening Post carried a short story by Paul Gallico (1897-1976). Gallico had begun his career as a sports reporter but, in 1936, had moved to England and started writing fiction. In 1941, the story was published by Alfred A. Knopf as a slim novella of some fifty pages. <strong>15 ……….</strong> It was also Gallico's only critical success, although he later wrote the hugely popular "Mrs. 'Arris" series, as well as The Poseidon Adventure. The Snow Goose was, in Gallico's words, "a once in a lifetime happening for a writer".</p>
        <p>The story of The Snow Goose is a variation on the ageless myth of a man whose physical deformity prevents most people from seeing his underlying admirable character. It begins in 1930, and is set on the east coast of England. <strong>16 ……….</strong> Rebuffed by society, he retreats to the desolate marshland by the sea, where he lives in an abandoned lighthouse. There he paints the marsh and the wildfowl that inhabit it. He also provides a sanctuary for birds over the winter before they migrate north in the spring.</p>
        <p>One day, three years after Rhayader had come to the lighthouse, a young girl named Fritha, no more than twelve, comes to seek him out. Carrying an injured bird in her arms, she approaches the lighthouse timidly. She is frightened of its strange inhabitant, but she has heard of his reputation for taking care of the marsh's wildlife. Rhayader tends to the bird. He tells Fritha it is a Canadian snow goose, blown off course by a violent storm. Fritha visits the lighthouse often to see the bird, but after it flies north in the spring, her visits stop.<strong> 17 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>In mid-October the snow goose returns, and Rhayader is overjoyed. <strong>18 ……….</strong> And so the cycle repeats: when the snow goose returns, Fritha resumes her visits; when the snow goose leaves, her visits stop. Nonetheless, though the bird is the catalyst that brings Rhayader and Fritha together, their relationship develops beyond it. They sail in Rhayader's boat, and he teaches her the lore of the marsh. Over time, the snow goose's stays at the lighthouse become longer and longer. By the spring of 1940, it becomes clear that the bird will leave no more. What of Fritha, who is now a young woman?&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the spring of 1940, Britain is enlisting small, private craft on the South Coast. It is a desperate attempt to evacuate hundreds of thousands of Allied soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk. Here they have been trapped by the German invasion of Belgium and France. Rhayader is determined to add his small boat to the attempt: "For once - for once I can be a man and play my part." He sails across the North Sea and successfully rescues many&nbsp;soldiers, ferrying them to boats in deeper water. <strong>19 ………. </strong>Beautifully written in simple, lyrical prose, The Snow Goose is a moving story about love and courage, with an ending that is unforgettable.</p>
        <p>Like many, I first read The Snow Goose as a child, and no doubt its unabashed sentimentality was as appealing to me at that time as strawberry-flavoured lip gloss. On rereading I was amazed to discover that poor Philip, of the hunchback and claw-hand, was only 27.<strong> 20 ……….</strong> (I'm not quite sure how I figured the "love" bit of the "love story", except perhaps as a wartime Beauty and the Beast.) And yet I had forgotten the brutal realism of the final paragraphs, preferring to remember only Fritha's final realisation of her love for Rhayader.</p>

          <strong>The Snow Goose&nbsp;</strong>

        </p>
        <p>In 1940, The Saturday Evening Post carried a short story by Paul Gallico (1897-1976). Gallico had begun his career as a sports reporter but, in 1936, had moved to England and started writing fiction. In 1941, the story was published by Alfred A. Knopf as a slim novella of some fifty pages. <strong>15 ……….</strong> It was also Gallico's only critical success, although he later wrote the hugely popular "Mrs. 'Arris" series, as well as The Poseidon Adventure. The Snow Goose was, in Gallico's words, "a once in a lifetime happening for a writer".</p>
        <p>The story of The Snow Goose is a variation on the ageless myth of a man whose physical deformity prevents most people from seeing his underlying admirable character. It begins in 1930, and is set on the east coast of England. <strong>16 ……….</strong> Rebuffed by society, he retreats to the desolate marshland by the sea, where he lives in an abandoned lighthouse. There he paints the marsh and the wildfowl that inhabit it. He also provides a sanctuary for birds over the winter before they migrate north in the spring.</p>
        <p>One day, three years after Rhayader had come to the lighthouse, a young girl named Fritha, no more than twelve, comes to seek him out. Carrying an injured bird in her arms, she approaches the lighthouse timidly. She is frightened of its strange inhabitant, but she has heard of his reputation for taking care of the marsh's wildlife. Rhayader tends to the bird. He tells Fritha it is a Canadian snow goose, blown off course by a violent storm. Fritha visits the lighthouse often to see the bird, but after it flies north in the spring, her visits stop.<strong> 17 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>In mid-October the snow goose returns, and Rhayader is overjoyed. <strong>18 ……….</strong> And so the cycle repeats: when the snow goose returns, Fritha resumes her visits; when the snow goose leaves, her visits stop. Nonetheless, though the bird is the catalyst that brings Rhayader and Fritha together, their relationship develops beyond it. They sail in Rhayader's boat, and he teaches her the lore of the marsh. Over time, the snow goose's stays at the lighthouse become longer and longer. By the spring of 1940, it becomes clear that the bird will leave no more. What of Fritha, who is now a young woman?&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the spring of 1940, Britain is enlisting small, private craft on the South Coast. It is a desperate attempt to evacuate hundreds of thousands of Allied soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk. Here they have been trapped by the German invasion of Belgium and France. Rhayader is determined to add his small boat to the attempt: "For once - for once I can be a man and play my part." He sails across the North Sea and successfully rescues many&nbsp;soldiers, ferrying them to boats in deeper water. <strong>19 ………. </strong>Beautifully written in simple, lyrical prose, The Snow Goose is a moving story about love and courage, with an ending that is unforgettable.</p>
        <p>Like many, I first read The Snow Goose as a child, and no doubt its unabashed sentimentality was as appealing to me at that time as strawberry-flavoured lip gloss. On rereading I was amazed to discover that poor Philip, of the hunchback and claw-hand, was only 27.<strong> 20 ……….</strong> (I'm not quite sure how I figured the "love" bit of the "love story", except perhaps as a wartime Beauty and the Beast.) And yet I had forgotten the brutal realism of the final paragraphs, preferring to remember only Fritha's final realisation of her love for Rhayader.</p>

        </p>
        <p>In 1940, The Saturday Evening Post carried a short story by Paul Gallico (1897-1976). Gallico had begun his career as a sports reporter but, in 1936, had moved to England and started writing fiction. In 1941, the story was published by Alfred A. Knopf as a slim novella of some fifty pages. <strong>15 ……….</strong> It was also Gallico's only critical success, although he later wrote the hugely popular "Mrs. 'Arris" series, as well as The Poseidon Adventure. The Snow Goose was, in Gallico's words, "a once in a lifetime happening for a writer".</p>
        <p>The story of The Snow Goose is a variation on the ageless myth of a man whose physical deformity prevents most people from seeing his underlying admirable character. It begins in 1930, and is set on the east coast of England. <strong>16 ……….</strong> Rebuffed by society, he retreats to the desolate marshland by the sea, where he lives in an abandoned lighthouse. There he paints the marsh and the wildfowl that inhabit it. He also provides a sanctuary for birds over the winter before they migrate north in the spring.</p>
        <p>One day, three years after Rhayader had come to the lighthouse, a young girl named Fritha, no more than twelve, comes to seek him out. Carrying an injured bird in her arms, she approaches the lighthouse timidly. She is frightened of its strange inhabitant, but she has heard of his reputation for taking care of the marsh's wildlife. Rhayader tends to the bird. He tells Fritha it is a Canadian snow goose, blown off course by a violent storm. Fritha visits the lighthouse often to see the bird, but after it flies north in the spring, her visits stop.<strong> 17 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>In mid-October the snow goose returns, and Rhayader is overjoyed. <strong>18 ……….</strong> And so the cycle repeats: when the snow goose returns, Fritha resumes her visits; when the snow goose leaves, her visits stop. Nonetheless, though the bird is the catalyst that brings Rhayader and Fritha together, their relationship develops beyond it. They sail in Rhayader's boat, and he teaches her the lore of the marsh. Over time, the snow goose's stays at the lighthouse become longer and longer. By the spring of 1940, it becomes clear that the bird will leave no more. What of Fritha, who is now a young woman?&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the spring of 1940, Britain is enlisting small, private craft on the South Coast. It is a desperate attempt to evacuate hundreds of thousands of Allied soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk. Here they have been trapped by the German invasion of Belgium and France. Rhayader is determined to add his small boat to the attempt: "For once - for once I can be a man and play my part." He sails across the North Sea and successfully rescues many&nbsp;soldiers, ferrying them to boats in deeper water. <strong>19 ………. </strong>Beautifully written in simple, lyrical prose, The Snow Goose is a moving story about love and courage, with an ending that is unforgettable.</p>
        <p>Like many, I first read The Snow Goose as a child, and no doubt its unabashed sentimentality was as appealing to me at that time as strawberry-flavoured lip gloss. On rereading I was amazed to discover that poor Philip, of the hunchback and claw-hand, was only 27.<strong> 20 ……….</strong> (I'm not quite sure how I figured the "love" bit of the "love story", except perhaps as a wartime Beauty and the Beast.) And yet I had forgotten the brutal realism of the final paragraphs, preferring to remember only Fritha's final realisation of her love for Rhayader.</p>

        </p>
        <p>In 1940, The Saturday Evening Post carried a short story by Paul Gallico (1897-1976). Gallico had begun his career as a sports reporter but, in 1936, had moved to England and started writing fiction. In 1941, the story was published by Alfred A. Knopf as a slim novella of some fifty pages. <strong>15 ……….</strong> It was also Gallico's only critical success, although he later wrote the hugely popular "Mrs. 'Arris" series, as well as The Poseidon Adventure. The Snow Goose was, in Gallico's words, "a once in a lifetime happening for a writer".</p>
        <p>The story of The Snow Goose is a variation on the ageless myth of a man whose physical deformity prevents most people from seeing his underlying admirable character. It begins in 1930, and is set on the east coast of England. <strong>16 ……….</strong> Rebuffed by society, he retreats to the desolate marshland by the sea, where he lives in an abandoned lighthouse. There he paints the marsh and the wildfowl that inhabit it. He also provides a sanctuary for birds over the winter before they migrate north in the spring.</p>
        <p>One day, three years after Rhayader had come to the lighthouse, a young girl named Fritha, no more than twelve, comes to seek him out. Carrying an injured bird in her arms, she approaches the lighthouse timidly. She is frightened of its strange inhabitant, but she has heard of his reputation for taking care of the marsh's wildlife. Rhayader tends to the bird. He tells Fritha it is a Canadian snow goose, blown off course by a violent storm. Fritha visits the lighthouse often to see the bird, but after it flies north in the spring, her visits stop.<strong> 17 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>In mid-October the snow goose returns, and Rhayader is overjoyed. <strong>18 ……….</strong> And so the cycle repeats: when the snow goose returns, Fritha resumes her visits; when the snow goose leaves, her visits stop. Nonetheless, though the bird is the catalyst that brings Rhayader and Fritha together, their relationship develops beyond it. They sail in Rhayader's boat, and he teaches her the lore of the marsh. Over time, the snow goose's stays at the lighthouse become longer and longer. By the spring of 1940, it becomes clear that the bird will leave no more. What of Fritha, who is now a young woman?&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In the spring of 1940, Britain is enlisting small, private craft on the South Coast. It is a desperate attempt to evacuate hundreds of thousands of Allied soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk. Here they have been trapped by the German invasion of Belgium and France. Rhayader is determined to add his small boat to the attempt: "For once - for once I can be a man and play my part." He sails across the North Sea and successfully rescues many&nbsp;soldiers, ferrying them to boats in deeper water. <strong>19 ………. </strong>Beautifully written in simple, lyrical prose, The Snow Goose is a moving story about love and courage, with an ending that is unforgettable.</p>
        <p>Like many, I first read The Snow Goose as a child, and no doubt its unabashed sentimentality was as appealing to me at that time as strawberry-flavoured lip gloss. On rereading I was amazed to discover that poor Philip, of the hunchback and claw-hand, was only 27.<strong> 20 ……….</strong> (I'm not quite sure how I figured the "love" bit of the "love story", except perhaps as a wartime Beauty and the Beast.) And yet I had forgotten the brutal realism of the final paragraphs, preferring to remember only Fritha's final realisation of her love for Rhayader.</p>

        <p>In 1940, The Saturday Evening Post carried a short story by Paul Gallico (1897-1976). Gallico had begun his career as a sports reporter but, in 1936, had moved to England and started writing fiction. In 1941, the story was published by Alfred A. Knopf as a slim novella of some fifty pages. <strong>15 ……….</strong> It was also Gallico's only critical success, although he later wrote the hugely popular "Mrs. 'Arris" series, as well as The Poseidon Adventure. The Snow Goose was, in Gallico's words, "a once in a lifetime happening for a writer".</p>
        <p>The story of The Snow Goose is a variation on the ageless myth of a man whose physical deformity prevents most people from seeing his underlying admirable character. It begins in 1930, and is set on the east coast of England. <strong>16 ……….</strong> Rebuffed by society, he retreats to the desolate marshland by the sea, where he lives in an abandoned lighthouse. There he paints the marsh and the wildfowl that inhabit it. He also provides a sanctuary for birds over the winter before they migrate north in the spring.</p>

He sails across the North Sea and successfully rescues many&nbsp;soldiers, ferrying them to boats in deeper water. <strong>19 ………. </strong>Beautifully written in simple, lyrical prose, The Snow Goose is a moving story about love and courage, with an ending that is unforgettable.</p>
        <p>Like many, I first read The Snow Goose as a child, and no doubt its unabashed sentimentality was as appealing to me at that time as strawberry-flavoured lip gloss. On rereading I was amazed to discover that poor Philip, of the hunchback and claw-hand, was only 27.<strong> 20 ……….</strong> (I'm not quite sure how I figured the "love" bit of the "love story", except perhaps as a wartime Beauty and the Beast.) And yet I had forgotten the brutal realism of the final paragraphs, preferring to remember only Fritha's final realisation of her love for Rhayader.</p>

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
When looking at music, we can assign a category based on various musical elements. For example, genres can be defined by the use of specific instruments. If the piece was being played in a certain style using orchestral instruments, then we could classify it as classical music. Similarly, if the instruments were highly distorted guitars, we would classify as rock or heavy metal.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Some genres are based on instruments and timing. Blues music uses a series of patterns and is played by a traditional live band using guitars and a drum kit. Likewise, drum and bass use a very fast bpm and are primarily electronic.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The most recognised genres is pop music, which is simply because of the mass media proliferation. Pop music can take cues from any other genre. Over the years, lots of different styles have become pop music. Everything from R&amp;B, soul, funk, rock and folk has been popularised and played on mainstream radio stations. While hip-hop and rap music have taken over the charts recently, pop music is still the ‘most heard’ of all music genres.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
What’s incredibly interesting about music is that both geography and culture play a huge role in the popularity of music. Your own home-town probably has its own music scene where one type of music is more prevalent. There are literally thousands of different genres of music. Music in the modern age is incredibly diverse and every genre borrows something from another, then evolves.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Rhythm and blues, commonly known as R&amp;B, is a musical genre developed by African Americans in the 1940s that’s been continuously refined through the present day. R&amp;B was derived from gospel, jazz, folk and traditional blues music and was the father of rock ‘n’ roll. R&amp;B notably diverged from rock music in later decades.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Contemporary R&amp;B is often driven by keyboards, synthesisers, strong bass lines, and looped drumbeats. In this sense, it has more in common with hip hop than rock music. Contemporary R&amp;B songs regularly top charts, making R&amp;B one of the most commercially successful genres in the modern music industry.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky is widely considered the most popular Russian composer in history. He manifested a clear interest in music from childhood, and his earliest musical impressions came from an orchestrina in the family home. At age four, he made his first recorded attempt at composition, a song written with his younger sister Alexandra. His work includes the 'The Sleeping Beauty' and 'The Nutcracker'. His music has always had great appeal for the general public in virtue of its tuneful, open-hearted melodies, impressive harmonies, and colourful, picturesque orchestration, all of which evoke a profound emotional response.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's work was first publicly performed in 1865. In 1868, his First Symphony was well-received. In 1874, he established himself with Piano Concerto No.1 in B-flat Minor. Tchaikovsky resigned from the Moscow Conservatory in 1878 and spent the rest of his career composing yet more prolifically. Tchaikovsky is most celebrated for his ballets, specifically Swan Lake, The Sleeping Beauty and The Nutcracker. He died in St. Petersburg on November 6, 1893.&nbsp;<br>

Who are the greatest singing voices of all time? Whether it's a soaring soprano or distinctive baritone, a great voice is the cornerstone of great music. When paired with stunning compositions and expert instrumentation, an iconic voice helps create iconic songs. Below is a look at the all-time great voices in music, ranging from R&amp;B icons to opera stars, pop chanteuses and everyone in between.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
First of our top 31 is Barbra Streisand. Barbra is a truly prolific talent who's earned the coveted EGOT — an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony — Barbra Streisand's distinctive voice has been a fixture of American music since the 1960s. Throughout the years, she's recorded 50 full-length albums, and notched hits with songs like "Woman in Love" and "Why Did I Choose You".&nbsp;<br>

Contemporary R&amp;B is often driven by keyboards, synthesisers, strong bass lines, and looped drumbeats. In this sense, it has more in common with hip hop than rock music. Contemporary R&amp;B songs regularly top charts, making R&amp;B one of the most commercially successful genres in the modern music industry.<br>

Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky is widely considered the most popular Russian composer in history. He manifested a clear interest in music from childhood, and his earliest musical impressions came from an orchestrina in the family home. At age four, he made his first recorded attempt at composition, a song written with his younger sister Alexandra. His work includes the 'The Sleeping Beauty' and 'The Nutcracker'. His music has always had great appeal for the general public in virtue of its tuneful, open-hearted melodies, impressive harmonies, and colourful, picturesque orchestration, all of which evoke a profound emotional response.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's work was first publicly performed in 1865. In 1868, his First Symphony was well-received. In 1874, he established himself with Piano Concerto No.1 in B-flat Minor. Tchaikovsky resigned from the Moscow Conservatory in 1878 and spent the rest of his career composing yet more prolifically. Tchaikovsky is most celebrated for his ballets, specifically Swan Lake, The Sleeping Beauty and The Nutcracker. He died in St. Petersburg on November 6, 1893.&nbsp;<br>

When looking at music, we can assign a category based on various musical elements. For example, genres can be defined by the use of specific instruments. If the piece was being played in a certain style using orchestral instruments, then we could classify it as classical music. Similarly, if the instruments were highly distorted guitars, we would classify as rock or heavy metal.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Some genres are based on instruments and timing. Blues music uses a series of patterns and is played by a traditional live band using guitars and a drum kit. Likewise, drum and bass use a very fast bpm and are primarily electronic.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The most recognised genres is pop music, which is simply because of the mass media proliferation. Pop music can take cues from any other genre. Over the years, lots of different styles have become pop music. Everything from R&amp;B, soul, funk, rock and folk has been popularised and played on mainstream radio stations. While hip-hop and rap music have taken over the charts recently, pop music is still the ‘most heard’ of all music genres.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
What’s incredibly interesting about music is that both geography and culture play a huge role in the popularity of music. Your own home-town probably has its own music scene where one type of music is more prevalent. There are literally thousands of different genres of music. Music in the modern age is incredibly diverse and every genre borrows something from another, then evolves.&nbsp;<br>

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
When looking at music, we can assign a category based on various musical elements. For example, genres can be defined by the use of specific instruments. If the piece was being played in a certain style using orchestral instruments, then we could classify it as classical music. Similarly, if the instruments were highly distorted guitars, we would classify as rock or heavy metal.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Some genres are based on instruments and timing. Blues music uses a series of patterns and is played by a traditional live band using guitars and a drum kit. Likewise, drum and bass use a very fast bpm and are primarily electronic.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The most recognised genres is pop music, which is simply because of the mass media proliferation. Pop music can take cues from any other genre. Over the years, lots of different styles have become pop music. Everything from R&amp;B, soul, funk, rock and folk has been popularised and played on mainstream radio stations. While hip-hop and rap music have taken over the charts recently, pop music is still the ‘most heard’ of all music genres.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
What’s incredibly interesting about music is that both geography and culture play a huge role in the popularity of music. Your own home-town probably has its own music scene where one type of music is more prevalent. There are literally thousands of different genres of music. Music in the modern age is incredibly diverse and every genre borrows something from another, then evolves.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Rhythm and blues, commonly known as R&amp;B, is a musical genre developed by African Americans in the 1940s that’s been continuously refined through the present day. R&amp;B was derived from gospel, jazz, folk and traditional blues music and was the father of rock ‘n’ roll. R&amp;B notably diverged from rock music in later decades.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Contemporary R&amp;B is often driven by keyboards, synthesisers, strong bass lines, and looped drumbeats. In this sense, it has more in common with hip hop than rock music. Contemporary R&amp;B songs regularly top charts, making R&amp;B one of the most commercially successful genres in the modern music industry.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky is widely considered the most popular Russian composer in history. He manifested a clear interest in music from childhood, and his earliest musical impressions came from an orchestrina in the family home. At age four, he made his first recorded attempt at composition, a song written with his younger sister Alexandra. His work includes the 'The Sleeping Beauty' and 'The Nutcracker'. His music has always had great appeal for the general public in virtue of its tuneful, open-hearted melodies, impressive harmonies, and colourful, picturesque orchestration, all of which evoke a profound emotional response.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's work was first publicly performed in 1865. In 1868, his First Symphony was well-received. In 1874, he established himself with Piano Concerto No.1 in B-flat Minor. Tchaikovsky resigned from the Moscow Conservatory in 1878 and spent the rest of his career composing yet more prolifically. Tchaikovsky is most celebrated for his ballets, specifically Swan Lake, The Sleeping Beauty and The Nutcracker. He died in St. Petersburg on November 6, 1893.&nbsp;<br>

          <strong>First experience of Bombay&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>A factory is going to be built in Thul, a small fishing village in India. The villagers fear it will change their traditional way of life, so a group of them, led by Adarkar, go to Bombay, to protest. The story is told from the point of view of Hari, a young boy who goes with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>Here they have just set off in boats from Rewas to Bombay.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(1) By the time the sun was up, turning the dull sea into peacock blue and emerald green and lighting up the city of Bombay on the far shore like a white castle made of sand, or salt, blinding against the hot blue sky, all the boats had been loaded and were setting out like a shoal of dolphins over the waves.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(2) It was fourteen kilometres from Rewas to Bombay. All the way they shouted and sang. Their voices rang from boat to boat. They were all in high spirits; it was such a rare outing for them who usually never gave up a day’s work to leave their villages, it seemed almost like a holiday. Adarkar had to shout occasionally to remind the farmers and fishermen why they were going to Bombay. His voice was getting so hoarse, one of the older fishermen finally tugged at his shirt, hanging out over his dhoti* and wet with perspiration, and said,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(3) “Sit down, son, sit for a while. Keep your breath for all the shouting you are going to do in Bombay. When we get there, we will shout so every man in the city hears us, never you fear. Sit and have a little rest. Give our brother some tea to drink,” he called to the men in the boat. One of them produced a clay cup which was still half full of tea, the rest having spilt earlier. They passed it to their leader who sat down and drank gratefully. Another produced a sweet lime, peeled it and passed him the segments to suck. He was grateful to them and took their advice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(4) Hari, who had bought neither tea nor fruit at the pier nor food from home, sat very quietly on the floor of the boat and no one paid him any attention at all. There was no one else from Thul in his boat; it was full of strangers from other villages along the coast, and he sat listening to them feeling very hot, tired and thirsty, and very afraid of the journey he had undertaken, without thinking, simply because he had been upset and angry and simply could not bear to live another day in Thul in the old way. The time for change had come, he had felt that. He had had to make the break he had been thinking about for so long. Had he done wrong?&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(5) He was silenced by awe when he saw the city of Bombay looming over their boats and the oily green waves. He would have liked to stand and stare as he disembarked from the boat at the Sassoon docks, aching and stiff from the long ride&nbsp;in the jam-packed boat, but there was no time. His fellow passengers were pushing and shoving past him and he was carried along by them. They pushed and shoved because they were in turn being pushed and shoved by the Bombay crowds that thronged the docks – so many people in such a great hurry as the villagers had never seen before. It was only out of the corner of his eye that he saw, briefly, before being pushed on, the great looming sides of steamships berthed at the docks, cranes lifting and lowering huge bales, men bare-bodied and sweating carrying huge packing cases and baskets on their heads and shoulders, grunting as they hurried, women like the fisherwomen at home with their purple and green saris tucked up as they ran with baskets of shining, slithering fish from the boats to the market, straw and mud and fish scales making the ground dangerously slippery.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(6) And now they were out through the gates and on the street and in the midst of the terrifying traffic. In all his life Hari had not seen so much traffic as he saw on that one street. In Thul there was only the occasional bus driving down the main road of the village to the highway, and very rarely a single dusty car. He clutched the arm of the man next to him in alarm and then was relieved to find it was a farmer, Mahe, from Thul.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(7) “Hurry, brother – we have to go to the Kala Ghoda, the Black Horse,” Mahe panted, and together they dodged the traffic and ran into a huge red double decker bus that screeched to a halt just before their noses.

          <strong>First experience of Bombay&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>A factory is going to be built in Thul, a small fishing village in India. The villagers fear it will change their traditional way of life, so a group of them, led by Adarkar, go to Bombay, to protest. The story is told from the point of view of Hari, a young boy who goes with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>Here they have just set off in boats from Rewas to Bombay.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(1) By the time the sun was up, turning the dull sea into peacock blue and emerald green and lighting up the city of Bombay on the far shore like a white castle made of sand, or salt, blinding against the hot blue sky, all the boats had been loaded and were setting out like a shoal of dolphins over the waves.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(2) It was fourteen kilometres from Rewas to Bombay. All the way they shouted and sang. Their voices rang from boat to boat. They were all in high spirits; it was such a rare outing for them who usually never gave up a day’s work to leave their villages, it seemed almost like a holiday. Adarkar had to shout occasionally to remind the farmers and fishermen why they were going to Bombay. His voice was getting so hoarse, one of the older fishermen finally tugged at his shirt, hanging out over his dhoti* and wet with perspiration, and said,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(3) “Sit down, son, sit for a while. Keep your breath for all the shouting you are going to do in Bombay. When we get there, we will shout so every man in the city hears us, never you fear. Sit and have a little rest. Give our brother some tea to drink,” he called to the men in the boat. One of them produced a clay cup which was still half full of tea, the rest having spilt earlier. They passed it to their leader who sat down and drank gratefully. Another produced a sweet lime, peeled it and passed him the segments to suck. He was grateful to them and took their advice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(4) Hari, who had bought neither tea nor fruit at the pier nor food from home, sat very quietly on the floor of the boat and no one paid him any attention at all. There was no one else from Thul in his boat; it was full of strangers from other villages along the coast, and he sat listening to them feeling very hot, tired and thirsty, and very afraid of the journey he had undertaken, without thinking, simply because he had been upset and angry and simply could not bear to live another day in Thul in the old way. The time for change had come, he had felt that. He had had to make the break he had been thinking about for so long. Had he done wrong?&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(5) He was silenced by awe when he saw the city of Bombay looming over their boats and the oily green waves. He would have liked to stand and stare as he disembarked from the boat at the Sassoon docks, aching and stiff from the long ride&nbsp;in the jam-packed boat, but there was no time. His fellow passengers were pushing and shoving past him and he was carried along by them. They pushed and shoved because they were in turn being pushed and shoved by the Bombay crowds that thronged the docks – so many people in such a great hurry as the villagers had never seen before. It was only out of the corner of his eye that he saw, briefly, before being pushed on, the great looming sides of steamships berthed at the docks, cranes lifting and lowering huge bales, men bare-bodied and sweating carrying huge packing cases and baskets on their heads and shoulders, grunting as they hurried, women like the fisherwomen at home with their purple and green saris tucked up as they ran with baskets of shining, slithering fish from the boats to the market, straw and mud and fish scales making the ground dangerously slippery.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(6) And now they were out through the gates and on the street and in the midst of the terrifying traffic. In all his life Hari had not seen so much traffic as he saw on that one street. In Thul there was only the occasional bus driving down the main road of the village to the highway, and very rarely a single dusty car. He clutched the arm of the man next to him in alarm and then was relieved to find it was a farmer, Mahe, from Thul.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(7) “Hurry, brother – we have to go to the Kala Ghoda, the Black Horse,” Mahe panted, and together they dodged the traffic and ran into a huge red double decker bus that screeched to a halt just before their noses. The driver leant out of the window and bellowed at them. They stood transfixed, shaking.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then the police appeared. “Where have you come from, fool?” the policeman roared at Hari. “Never seen traffic lights? Don’t you know how to cross a street? Come straight from the pumpkin fields, have you?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The policeman laughed, held up his hand to keep the bus waiting and waved to the marchers to cross the road.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“We are farmers and fishermen from Alibagh,” said Mahe quietly before he moved on. “We have come to speak to the Chief Minister.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“You do that,” the policeman told him. “You do that – he is waiting for you with tea and a garland and a sweet for each of you.” He burst out laughing again, winking at the bus driver as he did so, and then blew his whistle shrilly to make them move. Hari and his companion moved on, very hurt and offended.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“These Bombay-wallahs, the rudest people on earth,” muttered Mahe, and Hari nodded.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>* A loose piece of clothing wrapped around the lower half of the body, worn by some men in South Asia.</p>

When we get there, we will shout so every man in the city hears us, never you fear. Sit and have a little rest. Give our brother some tea to drink,” he called to the men in the boat. One of them produced a clay cup which was still half full of tea, the rest having spilt earlier. They passed it to their leader who sat down and drank gratefully. Another produced a sweet lime, peeled it and passed him the segments to suck. He was grateful to them and took their advice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(4) Hari, who had bought neither tea nor fruit at the pier nor food from home, sat very quietly on the floor of the boat and no one paid him any attention at all. There was no one else from Thul in his boat; it was full of strangers from other villages along the coast, and he sat listening to them feeling very hot, tired and thirsty, and very afraid of the journey he had undertaken, without thinking, simply because he had been upset and angry and simply could not bear to live another day in Thul in the old way. The time for change had come, he had felt that. He had had to make the break he had been thinking about for so long. Had he done wrong?&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(5) He was silenced by awe when he saw the city of Bombay looming over their boats and the oily green waves. He would have liked to stand and stare as he disembarked from the boat at the Sassoon docks, aching and stiff from the long ride&nbsp;in the jam-packed boat, but there was no time. His fellow passengers were pushing and shoving past him and he was carried along by them. They pushed and shoved because they were in turn being pushed and shoved by the Bombay crowds that thronged the docks – so many people in such a great hurry as the villagers had never seen before. It was only out of the corner of his eye that he saw, briefly, before being pushed on, the great looming sides of steamships berthed at the docks, cranes lifting and lowering huge bales, men bare-bodied and sweating carrying huge packing cases and baskets on their heads and shoulders, grunting as they hurried, women like the fisherwomen at home with their purple and green saris tucked up as they ran with baskets of shining, slithering fish from the boats to the market, straw and mud and fish scales making the ground dangerously slippery.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(6) And now they were out through the gates and on the street and in the midst of the terrifying traffic. In all his life Hari had not seen so much traffic as he saw on that one street. In Thul there was only the occasional bus driving down the main road of the village to the highway, and very rarely a single dusty car. He clutched the arm of the man next to him in alarm and then was relieved to find it was a farmer, Mahe, from Thul.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(7) “Hurry, brother – we have to go to the Kala Ghoda, the Black Horse,” Mahe panted, and together they dodged the traffic and ran into a huge red double decker bus that screeched to a halt just before their noses. The driver leant out of the window and bellowed at them. They stood transfixed, shaking.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then the police appeared. “Where have you come from, fool?” the policeman roared at Hari. “Never seen traffic lights? Don’t you know how to cross a street? Come straight from the pumpkin fields, have you?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The policeman laughed, held up his hand to keep the bus waiting and waved to the marchers to cross the road.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“We are farmers and fishermen from Alibagh,” said Mahe quietly before he moved on. “We have come to speak to the Chief Minister.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“You do that,” the policeman told him. “You do that – he is waiting for you with tea and a garland and a sweet for each of you.” He burst out laughing again, winking at the bus driver as he did so, and then blew his whistle shrilly to make them move. Hari and his companion moved on, very hurt and offended.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“These Bombay-wallahs, the rudest people on earth,” muttered Mahe, and Hari nodded.</p>

            <strong>Passage 1</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Read the extract below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>First experience of Bombay&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>A factory is going to be built in Thul, a small fishing village in India. The villagers fear it will change their traditional way of life, so a group of them, led by Adarkar, go to Bombay, to protest. The story is told from the point of view of Hari, a young boy who goes with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>Here they have just set off in boats from Rewas to Bombay.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(1) By the time the sun was up, turning the dull sea into peacock blue and emerald green and lighting up the city of Bombay on the far shore like a white castle made of sand, or salt, blinding against the hot blue sky, all the boats had been loaded and were setting out like a shoal of dolphins over the waves.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(2) It was fourteen kilometres from Rewas to Bombay. All the way they shouted and sang. Their voices rang from boat to boat. They were all in high spirits; it was such a rare outing for them who usually never gave up a day’s work to leave their villages, it seemed almost like a holiday. Adarkar had to shout occasionally to remind the farmers and fishermen why they were going to Bombay. His voice was getting so hoarse, one of the older fishermen finally tugged at his shirt, hanging out over his dhoti* and wet with perspiration, and said,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(3) “Sit down, son, sit for a while. Keep your breath for all the shouting you are going to do in Bombay. When we get there, we will shout so every man in the city hears us, never you fear. Sit and have a little rest. Give our brother some tea to drink,” he called to the men in the boat. One of them produced a clay cup which was still half full of tea, the rest having spilt earlier. They passed it to their leader who sat down and drank gratefully. Another produced a sweet lime, peeled it and passed him the segments to suck. He was grateful to them and took their advice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(4) Hari, who had bought neither tea nor fruit at the pier nor food from home, sat very quietly on the floor of the boat and no one paid him any attention at all. There was no one else from Thul in his boat; it was full of strangers from other villages along the coast, and he sat listening to them feeling very hot, tired and thirsty, and very afraid of the journey he had undertaken, without thinking, simply because he had been upset and angry and simply could not bear to live another day in Thul in the old way. The time for change had come, he had felt that. He had had to make the break he had been thinking about for so long. Had he done wrong?&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(5) He was silenced by awe when he saw the city of Bombay looming over their boats and the oily green waves. He would have liked to stand and stare as he disembarked from the boat at the Sassoon docks, aching and stiff from the long ride&nbsp;in the jam-packed boat, but there was no time. His fellow passengers were pushing and shoving past him and he was carried along by them. They pushed and shoved because they were in turn being pushed and shoved by the Bombay crowds that thronged the docks – so many people in such a great hurry as the villagers had never seen before. It was only out of the corner of his eye that he saw, briefly, before being pushed on, the great looming sides of steamships berthed at the docks, cranes lifting and lowering huge bales, men bare-bodied and sweating carrying huge packing cases and baskets on their heads and shoulders, grunting as they hurried, women like the fisherwomen at home with their purple and green saris tucked up as they ran with baskets of shining, slithering fish from the boats to the market, straw and mud and fish scales making the ground dangerously slippery.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(6) And now they were out through the gates and on the street and in the midst of the terrifying traffic. In all his life Hari had not seen so much traffic as he saw on that one street. In Thul there was only the occasional bus driving down the main road of the village to the highway, and very rarely a single dusty car. He clutched the arm of the man next to him in alarm and then was relieved to find it was a farmer, Mahe, from Thul.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(7) “Hurry, brother – we have to go to the Kala Ghoda, the Black Horse,” Mahe panted, and together they dodged the traffic and ran into a huge red double decker bus that screeched to a halt just before their noses. The driver leant out of the window and bellowed at them. They stood transfixed, shaking.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then the police appeared. “Where have you come from, fool?” the policeman roared at Hari. “Never seen traffic lights? Don’t you know how to cross a street? Come straight from the pumpkin fields, have you?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The policeman laughed, held up his hand to keep the bus waiting and waved to the marchers to cross the road.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“We are farmers and fishermen from Alibagh,” said Mahe quietly before he moved on. “We have come to speak to the Chief Minister.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“You do that,” the policeman told him. “You do that – he is waiting for you with tea and a garland and a sweet for each of you.” He burst out laughing again, winking at the bus driver as he did so, and then blew his whistle shrilly to make them move. Hari and his companion moved on, very hurt and offended.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“These Bombay-wallahs, the rudest people on earth,” muttered Mahe, and Hari nodded.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>* A loose piece of clothing wrapped around the lower half of the body, worn by some men in South Asia.</p>

          <strong>First experience of Bombay&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>A factory is going to be built in Thul, a small fishing village in India. The villagers fear it will change their traditional way of life, so a group of them, led by Adarkar, go to Bombay, to protest. The story is told from the point of view of Hari, a young boy who goes with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>Here they have just set off in boats from Rewas to Bombay.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(1) By the time the sun was up, turning the dull sea into peacock blue and emerald green and lighting up the city of Bombay on the far shore like a white castle made of sand, or salt, blinding against the hot blue sky, all the boats had been loaded and were setting out like a shoal of dolphins over the waves.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(2) It was fourteen kilometres from Rewas to Bombay. All the way they shouted and sang. Their voices rang from boat to boat. They were all in high spirits; it was such a rare outing for them who usually never gave up a day’s work to leave their villages, it seemed almost like a holiday. Adarkar had to shout occasionally to remind the farmers and fishermen why they were going to Bombay. His voice was getting so hoarse, one of the older fishermen finally tugged at his shirt, hanging out over his dhoti* and wet with perspiration, and said,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(3) “Sit down, son, sit for a while. Keep your breath for all the shouting you are going to do in Bombay. When we get there, we will shout so every man in the city hears us, never you fear. Sit and have a little rest. Give our brother some tea to drink,” he called to the men in the boat. One of them produced a clay cup which was still half full of tea, the rest having spilt earlier. They passed it to their leader who sat down and drank gratefully. Another produced a sweet lime, peeled it and passed him the segments to suck. He was grateful to them and took their advice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(4) Hari, who had bought neither tea nor fruit at the pier nor food from home, sat very quietly on the floor of the boat and no one paid him any attention at all. There was no one else from Thul in his boat; it was full of strangers from other villages along the coast, and he sat listening to them feeling very hot, tired and thirsty, and very afraid of the journey he had undertaken, without thinking, simply because he had been upset and angry and simply could not bear to live another day in Thul in the old way. The time for change had come, he had felt that. He had had to make the break he had been thinking about for so long. Had he done wrong?&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(5) He was silenced by awe when he saw the city of Bombay looming over their boats and the oily green waves. He would have liked to stand and stare as he disembarked from the boat at the Sassoon docks, aching and stiff from the long ride&nbsp;in the jam-packed boat, but there was no time. His fellow passengers were pushing and shoving past him and he was carried along by them. They pushed and shoved because they were in turn being pushed and shoved by the Bombay crowds that thronged the docks – so many people in such a great hurry as the villagers had never seen before. It was only out of the corner of his eye that he saw, briefly, before being pushed on, the great looming sides of steamships berthed at the docks, cranes lifting and lowering huge bales, men bare-bodied and sweating carrying huge packing cases and baskets on their heads and shoulders, grunting as they hurried, women like the fisherwomen at home with their purple and green saris tucked up as they ran with baskets of shining, slithering fish from the boats to the market, straw and mud and fish scales making the ground dangerously slippery.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(6) And now they were out through the gates and on the street and in the midst of the terrifying traffic. In all his life Hari had not seen so much traffic as he saw on that one street. In Thul there was only the occasional bus driving down the main road of the village to the highway, and very rarely a single dusty car. He clutched the arm of the man next to him in alarm and then was relieved to find it was a farmer, Mahe, from Thul.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(7) “Hurry, brother – we have to go to the Kala Ghoda, the Black Horse,” Mahe panted, and together they dodged the traffic and ran into a huge red double decker bus that screeched to a halt just before their noses. The driver leant out of the window and bellowed at them. They stood transfixed, shaking.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then the police appeared. “Where have you come from, fool?” the policeman roared at Hari. “Never seen traffic lights? Don’t you know how to cross a street? Come straight from the pumpkin fields, have you?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The policeman laughed, held up his hand to keep the bus waiting and waved to the marchers to cross the road.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“We are farmers and fishermen from Alibagh,” said Mahe quietly before he moved on. “We have come to speak to the Chief Minister.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“You do that,” the policeman told him. “You do that – he is waiting for you with tea and a garland and a sweet for each of you.” He burst out laughing again, winking at the bus driver as he did so, and then blew his whistle shrilly to make them move. Hari and his companion moved on, very hurt and offended.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“These Bombay-wallahs, the rudest people on earth,” muttered Mahe, and Hari nodded.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>* A loose piece of clothing wrapped around the lower half of the body, worn by some men in South Asia.</p>

One of them produced a clay cup which was still half full of tea, the rest having spilt earlier. They passed it to their leader who sat down and drank gratefully. Another produced a sweet lime, peeled it and passed him the segments to suck. He was grateful to them and took their advice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <p>(5) He was silenced by awe when he saw the city of Bombay looming over their boats and the oily green waves. He would have liked to stand and stare as he disembarked from the boat at the Sassoon docks, aching and stiff from the long ride&nbsp;in the jam-packed boat, but there was no time. His fellow passengers were pushing and shoving past him and he was carried along by them.

        <p>“We are farmers and fishermen from Alibagh,” said Mahe quietly before he moved on. “We have come to speak to the Chief Minister.”</p>

          <strong>First experience of Bombay&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>A factory is going to be built in Thul, a small fishing village in India. The villagers fear it will change their traditional way of life, so a group of them, led by Adarkar, go to Bombay, to protest. The story is told from the point of view of Hari, a young boy who goes with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>Here they have just set off in boats from Rewas to Bombay.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(1) By the time the sun was up, turning the dull sea into peacock blue and emerald green and lighting up the city of Bombay on the far shore like a white castle made of sand, or salt, blinding against the hot blue sky, all the boats had been loaded and were setting out like a shoal of dolphins over the waves.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(2) It was fourteen kilometres from Rewas to Bombay. All the way they shouted and sang. Their voices rang from boat to boat. They were all in high spirits; it was such a rare outing for them who usually never gave up a day’s work to leave their villages, it seemed almost like a holiday. Adarkar had to shout occasionally to remind the farmers and fishermen why they were going to Bombay. His voice was getting so hoarse, one of the older fishermen finally tugged at his shirt, hanging out over his dhoti* and wet with perspiration, and said,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(3) “Sit down, son, sit for a while. Keep your breath for all the shouting you are going to do in Bombay. When we get there, we will shout so every man in the city hears us, never you fear. Sit and have a little rest. Give our brother some tea to drink,” he called to the men in the boat. One of them produced a clay cup which was still half full of tea, the rest having spilt earlier. They passed it to their leader who sat down and drank gratefully. Another produced a sweet lime, peeled it and passed him the segments to suck. He was grateful to them and took their advice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(4) Hari, who had bought neither tea nor fruit at the pier nor food from home, sat very quietly on the floor of the boat and no one paid him any attention at all. There was no one else from Thul in his boat; it was full of strangers from other villages along the coast, and he sat listening to them feeling very hot, tired and thirsty, and very afraid of the journey he had undertaken, without thinking, simply because he had been upset and angry and simply could not bear to live another day in Thul in the old way. The time for change had come, he had felt that. He had had to make the break he had been thinking about for so long. Had he done wrong?&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(5) He was silenced by awe when he saw the city of Bombay looming over their boats and the oily green waves. He would have liked to stand and stare as he disembarked from the boat at the Sassoon docks, aching and stiff from the long ride&nbsp;in the jam-packed boat, but there was no time. His fellow passengers were pushing and shoving past him and he was carried along by them. They pushed and shoved because they were in turn being pushed and shoved by the Bombay crowds that thronged the docks – so many people in such a great hurry as the villagers had never seen before. It was only out of the corner of his eye that he saw, briefly, before being pushed on, the great looming sides of steamships berthed at the docks, cranes lifting and lowering huge bales, men bare-bodied and sweating carrying huge packing cases and baskets on their heads and shoulders, grunting as they hurried, women like the fisherwomen at home with their purple and green saris tucked up as they ran with baskets of shining, slithering fish from the boats to the market, straw and mud and fish scales making the ground dangerously slippery.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(6) And now they were out through the gates and on the street and in the midst of the terrifying traffic. In all his life Hari had not seen so much traffic as he saw on that one street. In Thul there was only the occasional bus driving down the main road of the village to the highway, and very rarely a single dusty car. He clutched the arm of the man next to him in alarm and then was relieved to find it was a farmer, Mahe, from Thul.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(7) “Hurry, brother – we have to go to the Kala Ghoda, the Black Horse,” Mahe panted, and together they dodged the traffic and ran into a huge red double decker bus that screeched to a halt just before their noses. The driver leant out of the window and bellowed at them. They stood transfixed, shaking.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then the police appeared. “Where have you come from, fool?” the policeman roared at Hari. “Never seen traffic lights? Don’t you know how to cross a street? Come straight from the pumpkin fields, have you?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The policeman laughed, held up his hand to keep the bus waiting and waved to the marchers to cross the road.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“We are farmers and fishermen from Alibagh,” said Mahe quietly before he moved on. “We have come to speak to the Chief Minister.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“You do that,” the policeman told him. “You do that – he is waiting for you with tea and a garland and a sweet for each of you.” He burst out laughing again, winking at the bus driver as he did so, and then blew his whistle shrilly to make them move. Hari and his companion moved on, very hurt and offended.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“These Bombay-wallahs, the rudest people on earth,” muttered Mahe, and Hari nodded.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>* A loose piece of clothing wrapped around the lower half of the body, worn by some men in South Asia.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>Read the extract from the novel written by J. R. R. Tolkien then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Rescued by the Eagles&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(1) Tonight the Lord of the Eagles was filled with curiosity to know what was afoot; so he summoned many other eagles to him, and they flew away from the mountains, and slowly circling ever round and round they came down, down, down towards the ring of the wolves and the meeting-place of the goblins.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(2) A very good thing too! Dreadful things had been going on down there. The wolves that had caught fire and fled into the forest had set it alight in several places. It was high summer, and on this eastern side of the mountains there had been little rain for some time. Yellowing bracken, fallen branches, deep-piled pine-needles, and here and there dead trees, were soon in flames. All round the clearing of the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Wargs</strong></span> fire was leaping. But the wolf-guards did not leave the trees. Maddened and angry they were leaping and howling round the trunks, and cursing the dwarves in their horrible language, with their tongues hanging out, and their eyes shining as red and fierce as the flames.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(3) Then suddenly goblins came running up yelling. They thought a battle with the woodmen was going on; but they soon learned what had really happened. Some of them actually sat down and laughed. Others waved their spears and clashed the shafts against their shields. Goblins are not afraid of fire, and they soon had a plan which seemed to them most amusing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(4) Some got all the wolves together in a pack. Some stacked fern and brushwood round the tree-trunks. Others rushed round and stamped and beat, and beat and stamped, until nearly all the flames were put out-but they did not put out the fire nearest to the trees where the dwarves were. That fire they fed with leaves and dead branches and bracken. Soon they had a ring of smoke and flame all round the dwarves, a ring which they kept from spreading outwards; but it closed slowly in, till the running fire was licking the fuel piled under the trees. Smoke was in Bilbo's eyes; he could feel the heat of the flames; and through the reek he could see the goblins dancing round and round in a circle like people round a midsummer bonfire. Outside the ring of dancing warriors with spears and axes stood the wolves at a respectful distance, watching and waiting.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(5) He could hear the goblins beginning a horrible song: Then they stopped and shouted out: "Fly away little birds! Fly away if you can! Come down little birds, or you will get roasted in your nests! Sing, sing little birds! Why don't you sing?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(6) "Go away! little boys!" shouted Gandalf in answer. "It isn't bird-nesting time. Also, naughty little boys that play with fire get punished." He said it to make them angry,&nbsp;and to show them he was not frightened of them-though of course he was, wizard though he was. But they took no notice, and they went on singing, ‘Ya hoy!’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(7) And with that ‘Ya hoy!’ the flames were under Gandalf's tree. In a moment it spread to the others. The bark caught fire, the lower branches cracked.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(8) Then Gandalf climbed to the top of his tree. The sudden splendour flashed from his wand like lightning, as he got ready to spring down from on high right among the spears of the goblins. That would have been the end of him, though he would probably have killed many of them as he came hurtling down like a thunderbolt. But he never leaped.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(9) Just at that moment the Lord of the Eagles swept down from above, seized him in his talons, and was gone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(10) There was a howl of anger and surprise from the goblins. Loud cried the Lord of the Eagles, to whom Gandalf had now spoken. Back swept the great birds that were with him, and down they came like huge black shadows. The wolves yammered and gnashed their teeth; the goblins yelled and stamped with rage, and flung their heavy spears in the air in vain. Over them swooped the eagles; the dark rush of their beating wings smote them to the floor or drove them far away; their talons tore at goblin faces. Other birds flew to the tree-tops and seized the dwarves, who were scrambling up now as far as they ever dared to go.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(11) Poor little Bilbo was very nearly left behind again! He just managed to catch hold of Dori's legs, as Dori was borne off last of all; and up they went together above the tumult and the burning, Bilbo swinging in the air with his arms nearly breaking.</p>

            <strong>Passage 2</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>Read the extract from the novel written by J. R. R. Tolkien then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Rescued by the Eagles&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(1) Tonight the Lord of the Eagles was filled with curiosity to know what was afoot; so he summoned many other eagles to him, and they flew away from the mountains, and slowly circling ever round and round they came down, down, down towards the ring of the wolves and the meeting-place of the goblins.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(2) A very good thing too! Dreadful things had been going on down there. The wolves that had caught fire and fled into the forest had set it alight in several places. It was high summer, and on this eastern side of the mountains there had been little rain for some time. Yellowing bracken, fallen branches, deep-piled pine-needles, and here and there dead trees, were soon in flames. All round the clearing of the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Wargs</strong></span> fire was leaping. But the wolf-guards did not leave the trees. Maddened and angry they were leaping and howling round the trunks, and cursing the dwarves in their horrible language, with their tongues hanging out, and their eyes shining as red and fierce as the flames.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(3) Then suddenly goblins came running up yelling. They thought a battle with the woodmen was going on; but they soon learned what had really happened. Some of them actually sat down and laughed. Others waved their spears and clashed the shafts against their shields. Goblins are not afraid of fire, and they soon had a plan which seemed to them most amusing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(4) Some got all the wolves together in a pack. Some stacked fern and brushwood round the tree-trunks. Others rushed round and stamped and beat, and beat and stamped, until nearly all the flames were put out-but they did not put out the fire nearest to the trees where the dwarves were. That fire they fed with leaves and dead branches and bracken. Soon they had a ring of smoke and flame all round the dwarves, a ring which they kept from spreading outwards; but it closed slowly in, till the running fire was licking the fuel piled under the trees. Smoke was in Bilbo's eyes; he could feel the heat of the flames; and through the reek he could see the goblins dancing round and round in a circle like people round a midsummer bonfire. Outside the ring of dancing warriors with spears and axes stood the wolves at a respectful distance, watching and waiting.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(5) He could hear the goblins beginning a horrible song: Then they stopped and shouted out: "Fly away little birds! Fly away if you can! Come down little birds, or you will get roasted in your nests! Sing, sing little birds! Why don't you sing?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(6) "Go away! little boys!" shouted Gandalf in answer. "It isn't bird-nesting time. Also, naughty little boys that play with fire get punished." He said it to make them angry,&nbsp;and to show them he was not frightened of them-though of course he was, wizard though he was. But they took no notice, and they went on singing, ‘Ya hoy!’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(7) And with that ‘Ya hoy!’ the flames were under Gandalf's tree. In a moment it spread to the others. The bark caught fire, the lower branches cracked.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(8) Then Gandalf climbed to the top of his tree. The sudden splendour flashed from his wand like lightning, as he got ready to spring down from on high right among the spears of the goblins. That would have been the end of him, though he would probably have killed many of them as he came hurtling down like a thunderbolt. But he never leaped.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(9) Just at that moment the Lord of the Eagles swept down from above, seized him in his talons, and was gone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(10) There was a howl of anger and surprise from the goblins. Loud cried the Lord of the Eagles, to whom Gandalf had now spoken. Back swept the great birds that were with him, and down they came like huge black shadows. The wolves yammered and gnashed their teeth; the goblins yelled and stamped with rage, and flung their heavy spears in the air in vain. Over them swooped the eagles; the dark rush of their beating wings smote them to the floor or drove them far away; their talons tore at goblin faces. Other birds flew to the tree-tops and seized the dwarves, who were scrambling up now as far as they ever dared to go.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(11) Poor little Bilbo was very nearly left behind again! He just managed to catch hold of Dori's legs, as Dori was borne off last of all; and up they went together above the tumult and the burning, Bilbo swinging in the air with his arms nearly breaking.</p>
