        <p>
          <strong>Rescued by the Eagles&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(1) Tonight the Lord of the Eagles was filled with curiosity to know what was afoot; so he summoned many other eagles to him, and they flew away from the mountains, and slowly circling ever round and round they came down, down, down towards the ring of the wolves and the meeting-place of the goblins.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(2) A very good thing too! Dreadful things had been going on down there. The wolves that had caught fire and fled into the forest had set it alight in several places. It was high summer, and on this eastern side of the mountains there had been little rain for some time. Yellowing bracken, fallen branches, deep-piled pine-needles, and here and there dead trees, were soon in flames. All round the clearing of the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Wargs</strong></span> fire was leaping. But the wolf-guards did not leave the trees. Maddened and angry they were leaping and howling round the trunks, and cursing the dwarves in their horrible language, with their tongues hanging out, and their eyes shining as red and fierce as the flames.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(3) Then suddenly goblins came running up yelling. They thought a battle with the woodmen was going on; but they soon learned what had really happened. Some of them actually sat down and laughed. Others waved their spears and clashed the shafts against their shields. Goblins are not afraid of fire, and they soon had a plan which seemed to them most amusing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(4) Some got all the wolves together in a pack. Some stacked fern and brushwood round the tree-trunks. Others rushed round and stamped and beat, and beat and stamped, until nearly all the flames were put out-but they did not put out the fire nearest to the trees where the dwarves were. That fire they fed with leaves and dead branches and bracken. Soon they had a ring of smoke and flame all round the dwarves, a ring which they kept from spreading outwards; but it closed slowly in, till the running fire was licking the fuel piled under the trees. Smoke was in Bilbo's eyes; he could feel the heat of the flames; and through the reek he could see the goblins dancing round and round in a circle like people round a midsummer bonfire. Outside the ring of dancing warriors with spears and axes stood the wolves at a respectful distance, watching and waiting.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(5) He could hear the goblins beginning a horrible song: Then they stopped and shouted out: "Fly away little birds! Fly away if you can! Come down little birds, or you will get roasted in your nests! Sing, sing little birds! Why don't you sing?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(6) "Go away! little boys!" shouted Gandalf in answer. "It isn't bird-nesting time. Also, naughty little boys that play with fire get punished." He said it to make them angry,&nbsp;and to show them he was not frightened of them-though of course he was, wizard though he was. But they took no notice, and they went on singing, ‘Ya hoy!’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(7) And with that ‘Ya hoy!’ the flames were under Gandalf's tree. In a moment it spread to the others. The bark caught fire, the lower branches cracked.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(8) Then Gandalf climbed to the top of his tree. The sudden splendour flashed from his wand like lightning, as he got ready to spring down from on high right among the spears of the goblins. That would have been the end of him, though he would probably have killed many of them as he came hurtling down like a thunderbolt. But he never leaped.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(9) Just at that moment the Lord of the Eagles swept down from above, seized him in his talons, and was gone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(10) There was a howl of anger and surprise from the goblins. Loud cried the Lord of the Eagles, to whom Gandalf had now spoken. Back swept the great birds that were with him, and down they came like huge black shadows. The wolves yammered and gnashed their teeth; the goblins yelled and stamped with rage, and flung their heavy spears in the air in vain. Over them swooped the eagles; the dark rush of their beating wings smote them to the floor or drove them far away; their talons tore at goblin faces. Other birds flew to the tree-tops and seized the dwarves, who were scrambling up now as far as they ever dared to go.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(11) Poor little Bilbo was very nearly left behind again! He just managed to catch hold of Dori's legs, as Dori was borne off last of all; and up they went together above the tumult and the burning, Bilbo swinging in the air with his arms nearly breaking.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Rescued by the Eagles&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(1) Tonight the Lord of the Eagles was filled with curiosity to know what was afoot; so he summoned many other eagles to him, and they flew away from the mountains, and slowly circling ever round and round they came down, down, down towards the ring of the wolves and the meeting-place of the goblins.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(2) A very good thing too! Dreadful things had been going on down there. The wolves that had caught fire and fled into the forest had set it alight in several places. It was high summer, and on this eastern side of the mountains there had been little rain for some time. Yellowing bracken, fallen branches, deep-piled pine-needles, and here and there dead trees, were soon in flames. All round the clearing of the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Wargs</strong></span> fire was leaping. But the wolf-guards did not leave the trees. Maddened and angry they were leaping and howling round the trunks, and cursing the dwarves in their horrible language, with their tongues hanging out, and their eyes shining as red and fierce as the flames.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(3) Then suddenly goblins came running up yelling. They thought a battle with the woodmen was going on; but they soon learned what had really happened. Some of them actually sat down and laughed. Others waved their spears and clashed the shafts against their shields. Goblins are not afraid of fire, and they soon had a plan which seemed to them most amusing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(4) Some got all the wolves together in a pack. Some stacked fern and brushwood round the tree-trunks. Others rushed round and stamped and beat, and beat and stamped, until nearly all the flames were put out-but they did not put out the fire nearest to the trees where the dwarves were. That fire they fed with leaves and dead branches and bracken. Soon they had a ring of smoke and flame all round the dwarves, a ring which they kept from spreading outwards; but it closed slowly in, till the running fire was licking the fuel piled under the trees. Smoke was in Bilbo's eyes; he could feel the heat of the flames; and through the reek he could see the goblins dancing round and round in a circle like people round a midsummer bonfire. Outside the ring of dancing warriors with spears and axes stood the wolves at a respectful distance, watching and waiting.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(5) He could hear the goblins beginning a horrible song: Then they stopped and shouted out: "Fly away little birds! Fly away if you can! Come down little birds, or you will get roasted in your nests! Sing, sing little birds! Why don't you sing?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(6) "Go away! little boys!" shouted Gandalf in answer. "It isn't bird-nesting time. Also, naughty little boys that play with fire get punished." He said it to make them angry,&nbsp;and to show them he was not frightened of them-though of course he was, wizard though he was. But they took no notice, and they went on singing, ‘Ya hoy!’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(7) And with that ‘Ya hoy!’ the flames were under Gandalf's tree. In a moment it spread to the others. The bark caught fire, the lower branches cracked.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(8) Then Gandalf climbed to the top of his tree. The sudden splendour flashed from his wand like lightning, as he got ready to spring down from on high right among the spears of the goblins. That would have been the end of him, though he would probably have killed many of them as he came hurtling down like a thunderbolt. But he never leaped.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(9) Just at that moment the Lord of the Eagles swept down from above, seized him in his talons, and was gone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(10) There was a howl of anger and surprise from the goblins. Loud cried the Lord of the Eagles, to whom Gandalf had now spoken. Back swept the great birds that were with him, and down they came like huge black shadows. The wolves yammered and gnashed their teeth; the goblins yelled and stamped with rage, and flung their heavy spears in the air in vain. Over them swooped the eagles; the dark rush of their beating wings smote them to the floor or drove them far away; their talons tore at goblin faces. Other birds flew to the tree-tops and seized the dwarves, who were scrambling up now as far as they ever dared to go.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(11) Poor little Bilbo was very nearly left behind again! He just managed to catch hold of Dori's legs, as Dori was borne off last of all; and up they went together above the tumult and the burning, Bilbo swinging in the air with his arms nearly breaking.</p>

All round the clearing of the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Wargs</strong></span> fire was leaping. But the wolf-guards did not leave the trees. Maddened and angry they were leaping and howling round the trunks, and cursing the dwarves in their horrible language, with their tongues hanging out, and their eyes shining as red and fierce as the flames.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(3) Then suddenly goblins came running up yelling. They thought a battle with the woodmen was going on; but they soon learned what had really happened. Some of them actually sat down and laughed. Others waved their spears and clashed the shafts against their shields. Goblins are not afraid of fire, and they soon had a plan which seemed to them most amusing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(4) Some got all the wolves together in a pack. Some stacked fern and brushwood round the tree-trunks. Others rushed round and stamped and beat, and beat and stamped, until nearly all the flames were put out-but they did not put out the fire nearest to the trees where the dwarves were. That fire they fed with leaves and dead branches and bracken. Soon they had a ring of smoke and flame all round the dwarves, a ring which they kept from spreading outwards; but it closed slowly in, till the running fire was licking the fuel piled under the trees. Smoke was in Bilbo's eyes; he could feel the heat of the flames; and through the reek he could see the goblins dancing round and round in a circle like people round a midsummer bonfire. Outside the ring of dancing warriors with spears and axes stood the wolves at a respectful distance, watching and waiting.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(5) He could hear the goblins beginning a horrible song: Then they stopped and shouted out: "Fly away little birds! Fly away if you can! Come down little birds, or you will get roasted in your nests! Sing, sing little birds! Why don't you sing?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(6) "Go away! little boys!" shouted Gandalf in answer. "It isn't bird-nesting time. Also, naughty little boys that play with fire get punished." He said it to make them angry,&nbsp;and to show them he was not frightened of them-though of course he was, wizard though he was. But they took no notice, and they went on singing, ‘Ya hoy!’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(7) And with that ‘Ya hoy!’ the flames were under Gandalf's tree. In a moment it spread to the others. The bark caught fire, the lower branches cracked.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(8) Then Gandalf climbed to the top of his tree. The sudden splendour flashed from his wand like lightning, as he got ready to spring down from on high right among the spears of the goblins. That would have been the end of him, though he would probably have killed many of them as he came hurtling down like a thunderbolt. But he never leaped.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(9) Just at that moment the Lord of the Eagles swept down from above, seized him in his talons, and was gone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(10) There was a howl of anger and surprise from the goblins. Loud cried the Lord of the Eagles, to whom Gandalf had now spoken. Back swept the great birds that were with him, and down they came like huge black shadows. The wolves yammered and gnashed their teeth; the goblins yelled and stamped with rage, and flung their heavy spears in the air in vain. Over them swooped the eagles; the dark rush of their beating wings smote them to the floor or drove them far away; their talons tore at goblin faces. Other birds flew to the tree-tops and seized the dwarves, who were scrambling up now as far as they ever dared to go.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>(11) Poor little Bilbo was very nearly left behind again! He just managed to catch hold of Dori's legs, as Dori was borne off last of all; and up they went together above the tumult and the burning, Bilbo swinging in the air with his arms nearly breaking.</p>

        <p>
          <em>Read the extract from the novel written by John Christopher then answer the questions.</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>The City of the Ancients&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The most likely thing was that we were being held for a <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Capping ceremony</strong></span>. I was scared again, realising how close this might be—it could be tomorrow, even—and, for the first time it seemed, envisioning the lonely mad life ahead. There would not even be Henry, because Vagrants wandered apart, each cloaked in his own wild dreams and fancies.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Henry said, “I wonder …”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Hearing his voice was a small relief. I said, “What?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“The window. If I gave you a leg up …”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I did not believe they would have imprisoned us in a place we could break out of so easily, but it was something to do. Henry knelt by the wall, and I stood on his shoulders in my stockinged feet. There was a twinge of pain in my ankle, but I disregarded it. He raised up slowly, while I kept my hands against the wall and reached for the window bars. I got hold at last, first of one and then another. I heaved and pushed, but they were firmly bedded in stone, top and bottom. Henry shifted under me, and I called down:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“It’s no good.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Try again. If you …”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He broke off, and I heard what he had heard: the scrape of a key against the sides of the lock. I jumped down and stood watching the darker rectangle of the door. Slowly, it creaked open. There was light beyond, a lamp held up, and the light gleamed on small circles of glass and the bottles in the room we were in. It was <span class="txt-underline"><strong>the boy who had watched us from the stairs</strong></span>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then he spoke and, to my greater astonishment, in English.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Do not make a noise,” he said. “I will help you.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Silently, we followed him up the stairs, the old timbers creaking under us, and across the bar room. He drew the bolts very carefully, but they sounded hideously loud. At last, the door was open. I whispered, “Thank you. We …”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He thrust his head forward, the contraption on his nose looking even more ludicrous, and said, “You wish to go to the boat? I can still help.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Not to a boat. South.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“South? From the town, into land? Not to the sea?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Yes,” I said, “inland.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I can help there also.” He blew out the lamp and set it down inside the door. “I will show you.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The moonlight was still bright on the waterfront and the gently bobbing masts of the boats in the harbour, but in places the stars were hidden by cloud, and a breeze was getting up from the sea. He started along the way Captain Curtis had said, but before long led us into an alley. We went up steps, and the alley twisted and turned. It was so narrow that moonlight did not penetrate; there was barely enough light to see our way.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Later, there was a road, then another alley, and a road again. The road widened, houses thinned on either side, and at last we reached a place where there was a bright meadow, dotted with the dark shapes of cows. He stopped beside a grassy bank.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“This goes south,” he said.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I said, “Will you get into trouble? Will they know it was you that let us out?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He shrugged, his head bobbing. “It does not matter.” He said it like ‘mat-air’. “Will you tell me why you wish to go into land?” He corrected himself: “In-land?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I hesitated only for a moment. “We have heard of a place, in the south, where there are no Cappings, and no Tripods.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Cappings?” he repeated. “Tripods?” He touched his head and said a word in his own language. “The great ones, with three legs—they are Tripods? A place without them? Is it possible? Everyone puts on—the Cap?—and the Tripods go everywhere.”</p>

        <p>Henry said, “I wonder …”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Hearing his voice was a small relief. I said, “What?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“The window. If I gave you a leg up …”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I did not believe they would have imprisoned us in a place we could break out of so easily, but it was something to do. Henry knelt by the wall, and I stood on his shoulders in my stockinged feet. There was a twinge of pain in my ankle, but I disregarded it. He raised up slowly, while I kept my hands against the wall and reached for the window bars. I got hold at last, first of one and then another. I heaved and pushed, but they were firmly bedded in stone, top and bottom. Henry shifted under me, and I called down:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“It’s no good.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Try again. If you …”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He broke off, and I heard what he had heard: the scrape of a key against the sides of the lock. I jumped down and stood watching the darker rectangle of the door. Slowly, it creaked open. There was light beyond, a lamp held up, and the light gleamed on small circles of glass and the bottles in the room we were in. It was <span class="txt-underline"><strong>the boy who had watched us from the stairs</strong></span>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then he spoke and, to my greater astonishment, in English.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Do not make a noise,” he said. “I will help you.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Silently, we followed him up the stairs, the old timbers creaking under us, and across the bar room. He drew the bolts very carefully, but they sounded hideously loud. At last, the door was open. I whispered, “Thank you. We …”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He thrust his head forward, the contraption on his nose looking even more ludicrous, and said, “You wish to go to the boat? I can still help.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Not to a boat. South.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“South? From the town, into land? Not to the sea?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Yes,” I said, “inland.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I can help there also.” He blew out the lamp and set it down inside the door. “I will show you.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The moonlight was still bright on the waterfront and the gently bobbing masts of the boats in the harbour, but in places the stars were hidden by cloud, and a breeze was getting up from the sea. He started along the way Captain Curtis had said, but before long led us into an alley. We went up steps, and the alley twisted and turned. It was so narrow that moonlight did not penetrate; there was barely enough light to see our way.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Later, there was a road, then another alley, and a road again. The road widened, houses thinned on either side, and at last we reached a place where there was a bright meadow, dotted with the dark shapes of cows. He stopped beside a grassy bank.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“This goes south,” he said.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I said, “Will you get into trouble? Will they know it was you that let us out?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He shrugged, his head bobbing. “It does not matter.” He said it like ‘mat-air’. “Will you tell me why you wish to go into land?” He corrected himself: “In-land?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I hesitated only for a moment. “We have heard of a place, in the south, where there are no Cappings, and no Tripods.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Cappings?” he repeated. “Tripods?” He touched his head and said a word in his own language. “The great ones, with three legs—they are Tripods? A place without them? Is it possible? Everyone puts on—the Cap?—and the Tripods go everywhere.”</p>

          <em>Read the extract from the novel written by John Christopher then answer the questions.</em>

          <strong>The City of the Ancients&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The most likely thing was that we were being held for a <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Capping ceremony</strong></span>. I was scared again, realising how close this might be—it could be tomorrow, even—and, for the first time it seemed, envisioning the lonely mad life ahead. There would not even be Henry, because Vagrants wandered apart, each cloaked in his own wild dreams and fancies.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Henry said, “I wonder …”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Hearing his voice was a small relief. I said, “What?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“The window. If I gave you a leg up …”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I did not believe they would have imprisoned us in a place we could break out of so easily, but it was something to do. Henry knelt by the wall, and I stood on his shoulders in my stockinged feet. There was a twinge of pain in my ankle, but I disregarded it. He raised up slowly, while I kept my hands against the wall and reached for the window bars. I got hold at last, first of one and then another. I heaved and pushed, but they were firmly bedded in stone, top and bottom. Henry shifted under me, and I called down:&nbsp;</p>

        <p>“Try again. If you …”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He broke off, and I heard what he had heard: the scrape of a key against the sides of the lock. I jumped down and stood watching the darker rectangle of the door. Slowly, it creaked open. There was light beyond, a lamp held up, and the light gleamed on small circles of glass and the bottles in the room we were in. It was <span class="txt-underline"><strong>the boy who had watched us from the stairs</strong></span>.</p>

          <strong>The City of the Ancients&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The most likely thing was that we were being held for a <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Capping ceremony</strong></span>. I was scared again, realising how close this might be—it could be tomorrow, even—and, for the first time it seemed, envisioning the lonely mad life ahead. There would not even be Henry, because Vagrants wandered apart, each cloaked in his own wild dreams and fancies.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Henry said, “I wonder …”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Hearing his voice was a small relief. I said, “What?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“The window. If I gave you a leg up …”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I did not believe they would have imprisoned us in a place we could break out of so easily, but it was something to do. Henry knelt by the wall, and I stood on his shoulders in my stockinged feet. There was a twinge of pain in my ankle, but I disregarded it. He raised up slowly, while I kept my hands against the wall and reached for the window bars. I got hold at last, first of one and then another. I heaved and pushed, but they were firmly bedded in stone, top and bottom. Henry shifted under me, and I called down:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“It’s no good.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Try again. If you …”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He broke off, and I heard what he had heard: the scrape of a key against the sides of the lock. I jumped down and stood watching the darker rectangle of the door. Slowly, it creaked open. There was light beyond, a lamp held up, and the light gleamed on small circles of glass and the bottles in the room we were in. It was <span class="txt-underline"><strong>the boy who had watched us from the stairs</strong></span>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then he spoke and, to my greater astonishment, in English.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Do not make a noise,” he said. “I will help you.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Silently, we followed him up the stairs, the old timbers creaking under us, and across the bar room. He drew the bolts very carefully, but they sounded hideously loud. At last, the door was open. I whispered, “Thank you. We …”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He thrust his head forward, the contraption on his nose looking even more ludicrous, and said, “You wish to go to the boat? I can still help.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Not to a boat. South.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“South? From the town, into land? Not to the sea?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Yes,” I said, “inland.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I can help there also.” He blew out the lamp and set it down inside the door. “I will show you.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The moonlight was still bright on the waterfront and the gently bobbing masts of the boats in the harbour, but in places the stars were hidden by cloud, and a breeze was getting up from the sea. He started along the way Captain Curtis had said, but before long led us into an alley. We went up steps, and the alley twisted and turned. It was so narrow that moonlight did not penetrate; there was barely enough light to see our way.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Later, there was a road, then another alley, and a road again. The road widened, houses thinned on either side, and at last we reached a place where there was a bright meadow, dotted with the dark shapes of cows. He stopped beside a grassy bank.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“This goes south,” he said.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I said, “Will you get into trouble? Will they know it was you that let us out?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He shrugged, his head bobbing. “It does not matter.” He said it like ‘mat-air’. “Will you tell me why you wish to go into land?” He corrected himself: “In-land?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I hesitated only for a moment. “We have heard of a place, in the south, where there are no Cappings, and no Tripods.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Cappings?” he repeated. “Tripods?” He touched his head and said a word in his own language. “The great ones, with three legs—they are Tripods? A place without them? Is it possible? Everyone puts on—the Cap?—and the Tripods go everywhere.”</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

There was light beyond, a lamp held up, and the light gleamed on small circles of glass and the bottles in the room we were in.

          <strong>The City of the Ancients&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The most likely thing was that we were being held for a <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Capping ceremony</strong></span>. I was scared again, realising how close this might be—it could be tomorrow, even—and, for the first time it seemed, envisioning the lonely mad life ahead. There would not even be Henry, because Vagrants wandered apart, each cloaked in his own wild dreams and fancies.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Henry said, “I wonder …”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Hearing his voice was a small relief. I said, “What?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“The window. If I gave you a leg up …”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I did not believe they would have imprisoned us in a place we could break out of so easily, but it was something to do. Henry knelt by the wall, and I stood on his shoulders in my stockinged feet. There was a twinge of pain in my ankle, but I disregarded it. He raised up slowly, while I kept my hands against the wall and reached for the window bars. I got hold at last, first of one and then another. I heaved and pushed, but they were firmly bedded in stone, top and bottom. Henry shifted under me, and I called down:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“It’s no good.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Try again. If you …”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He broke off, and I heard what he had heard: the scrape of a key against the sides of the lock. I jumped down and stood watching the darker rectangle of the door. Slowly, it creaked open. There was light beyond, a lamp held up, and the light gleamed on small circles of glass and the bottles in the room we were in. It was <span class="txt-underline"><strong>the boy who had watched us from the stairs</strong></span>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then he spoke and, to my greater astonishment, in English.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Do not make a noise,” he said. “I will help you.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Silently, we followed him up the stairs, the old timbers creaking under us, and across the bar room. He drew the bolts very carefully, but they sounded hideously loud. At last, the door was open. I whispered, “Thank you. We …”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He thrust his head forward, the contraption on his nose looking even more ludicrous, and said, “You wish to go to the boat? I can still help.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Not to a boat. South.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“South? From the town, into land? Not to the sea?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Yes,” I said, “inland.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I can help there also.” He blew out the lamp and set it down inside the door. “I will show you.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The moonlight was still bright on the waterfront and the gently bobbing masts of the boats in the harbour, but in places the stars were hidden by cloud, and a breeze was getting up from the sea. He started along the way Captain Curtis had said, but before long led us into an alley. We went up steps, and the alley twisted and turned. It was so narrow that moonlight did not penetrate; there was barely enough light to see our way.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Later, there was a road, then another alley, and a road again. The road widened, houses thinned on either side, and at last we reached a place where there was a bright meadow, dotted with the dark shapes of cows. He stopped beside a grassy bank.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“This goes south,” he said.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I said, “Will you get into trouble? Will they know it was you that let us out?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He shrugged, his head bobbing. “It does not matter.” He said it like ‘mat-air’. “Will you tell me why you wish to go into land?” He corrected himself: “In-land?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I hesitated only for a moment. “We have heard of a place, in the south, where there are no Cappings, and no Tripods.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Cappings?” he repeated. “Tripods?” He touched his head and said a word in his own language. “The great ones, with three legs—they are Tripods? A place without them? Is it possible? Everyone puts on—the Cap?—and the Tripods go everywhere.”</p>

            <strong>Passage 3</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>Read the extract from the novel written by John Christopher then answer the questions.</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>The City of the Ancients&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The most likely thing was that we were being held for a <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Capping ceremony</strong></span>. I was scared again, realising how close this might be—it could be tomorrow, even—and, for the first time it seemed, envisioning the lonely mad life ahead. There would not even be Henry, because Vagrants wandered apart, each cloaked in his own wild dreams and fancies.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Henry said, “I wonder …”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Hearing his voice was a small relief. I said, “What?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“The window. If I gave you a leg up …”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I did not believe they would have imprisoned us in a place we could break out of so easily, but it was something to do. Henry knelt by the wall, and I stood on his shoulders in my stockinged feet. There was a twinge of pain in my ankle, but I disregarded it. He raised up slowly, while I kept my hands against the wall and reached for the window bars. I got hold at last, first of one and then another. I heaved and pushed, but they were firmly bedded in stone, top and bottom. Henry shifted under me, and I called down:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“It’s no good.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Try again. If you …”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He broke off, and I heard what he had heard: the scrape of a key against the sides of the lock. I jumped down and stood watching the darker rectangle of the door. Slowly, it creaked open. There was light beyond, a lamp held up, and the light gleamed on small circles of glass and the bottles in the room we were in. It was <span class="txt-underline"><strong>the boy who had watched us from the stairs</strong></span>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then he spoke and, to my greater astonishment, in English.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Do not make a noise,” he said. “I will help you.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Silently, we followed him up the stairs, the old timbers creaking under us, and across the bar room. He drew the bolts very carefully, but they sounded hideously loud. At last, the door was open. I whispered, “Thank you. We …”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He thrust his head forward, the contraption on his nose looking even more ludicrous, and said, “You wish to go to the boat? I can still help.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Not to a boat. South.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“South? From the town, into land? Not to the sea?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Yes,” I said, “inland.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I can help there also.” He blew out the lamp and set it down inside the door. “I will show you.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The moonlight was still bright on the waterfront and the gently bobbing masts of the boats in the harbour, but in places the stars were hidden by cloud, and a breeze was getting up from the sea. He started along the way Captain Curtis had said, but before long led us into an alley. We went up steps, and the alley twisted and turned. It was so narrow that moonlight did not penetrate; there was barely enough light to see our way.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Later, there was a road, then another alley, and a road again. The road widened, houses thinned on either side, and at last we reached a place where there was a bright meadow, dotted with the dark shapes of cows. He stopped beside a grassy bank.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“This goes south,” he said.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I said, “Will you get into trouble? Will they know it was you that let us out?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He shrugged, his head bobbing. “It does not matter.” He said it like ‘mat-air’. “Will you tell me why you wish to go into land?” He corrected himself: “In-land?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I hesitated only for a moment. “We have heard of a place, in the south, where there are no Cappings, and no Tripods.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Cappings?” he repeated. “Tripods?” He touched his head and said a word in his own language. “The great ones, with three legs—they are Tripods? A place without them? Is it possible? Everyone puts on—the Cap?—and the Tripods go everywhere.”</p>

          <strong>RANGER’S APPRENTICE&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Try to eat something, Will. Tomorrow’s a big day, after all.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jenny, blond, pretty and cheerful, gestured toward Will’s barely touched plate and smiled encouragingly at him. Will made an attempt to return the smile, but it was a dismal failure. He picked at the plate before him, piled high with his favourite foods. Tonight, his stomach knotted tight with tension and anticipation, he could hardly bring himself to swallow a bite. Tomorrow would be a big day, he knew. He knew it all too well, in fact. Tomorrow would be the biggest day in his life, because tomorrow was the Choosing Day and it would determine how he spent the rest of his life.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Nerves, I imagine,” said George, setting down his loaded fork and seizing the lapels of his jacket in a judicious manner. He was a thin, gangly and studious boy, fascinated by rules and regulations and with a penchant for examining and debating both sides of any question—sometimes at great length. “Dreadful thing, nervousness. It can just freeze you up so you can’t think, can’t eat, can’t speak.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I’m not nervous,” Will said quickly, noticing that Horace had looked up, ready to form a sarcastic comment.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;George nodded several times, considering Will’s statement. “On the other hand,” he added, “a little nervousness can actually improve performance. It can heighten your perceptions and sharpen your reactions. So, the fact that you are worried, if, in fact, you are, is not necessarily something to be worried about, of itself—so to speak.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In spite of himself, a wry smile touched Will’s mouth. George would be a natural in the legal profession, he thought. He would almost certainly be the Scribemaster’s choice on the following morning. Perhaps, Will thought, that was at the heart of his own problem. He was the only one of the wardmates who had any fears about the Choosing that would take place within twelve hours.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“He ought to be nervous!” Horace scoffed. “After all, which Craftmaster is going to want him as an apprentice?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I’m sure we’re all nervous,” Alyss said. She directed one of her rare smiles at Will. “We’d be stupid not to be.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Well, I’m not!” Horace said, then reddened as Alyss raised one eyebrow and Jenny giggled.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was typical of Alyss, Will thought. He knew that the tall, graceful girl had already been promised a place as an apprentice by Lady Pauline, head of Castle Redmont’s Diplomatic Service. Her pretense that she was nervous about the following day, and her discretion in refraining from pointing out Horace’s gaffe, showed that she was already a diplomat of some skill.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jenny, of course, would gravitate immediately to the castle kitchens, domain of Master Chubb, Redmont’s head chef. He was a man renowned throughout the kingdom for the banquets served in the castle’s massive dining hall. Jenny loved food and cooking, and her easy-going nature and unfailing good humour would make her an invaluable staff member in the turmoil of the castle kitchens.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Battleschool would be Horace’s choice. Will glanced at his wardmate now, hungrily tucking into the roast turkey, ham and potatoes that he had heaped onto his plate. Horace was big for his age and a natural athlete. The chances that he would be refused were virtually non-existent. Horace was exactly the type of recruit that Sir Rodney looked for in his warrior apprentices. Strong, athletic, fit. And, thought Will a trifle sourly, not too bright.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Battleschool was the path to knighthood for boys like Horace—born commoners but with the physical abilities to serve as knights of the kingdom. Which left Will. What would his choice be? More importantly, as Horace had pointed out, what Craftmaster would accept him as an apprentice?</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For Choosing Day was the pivotal point in the life of the castle wards. They were orphan children raised by the generosity of Baron Arald, the Lord of Redmont Fief. For the most part, their parents had died in the service of the fief, and the Baron saw it as his responsibility to care for and raise the children of his former subjects— and to give them an opportunity to improve their station in life wherever possible.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Choosing Day provided that opportunity. Each year, castle wards turning fifteen could apply to be apprenticed to the masters of the various crafts that served the castle and its people. Ordinarily, craft apprentices were selected by dint of their parents’ occupations or influence with the Craftmasters. The castle wards usually had no such influence, and this was their chance to win a future for themselves. Those wards who weren’t chosen, or for whom no openings could be found, would be assigned to farming families in the nearby village, providing farm labour to raise the crops and animals that fed the castle inhabitants. It was rare for this to happen, Will knew. The Baron and his Craftmasters usually went out of their way to fit the wards into one craft or another. But it could happen, and it was a fate he feared more than anything.</p>

          <strong>RANGER’S APPRENTICE&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Try to eat something, Will. Tomorrow’s a big day, after all.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jenny, blond, pretty and cheerful, gestured toward Will’s barely touched plate and smiled encouragingly at him. Will made an attempt to return the smile, but it was a dismal failure. He picked at the plate before him, piled high with his favourite foods. Tonight, his stomach knotted tight with tension and anticipation, he could hardly bring himself to swallow a bite. Tomorrow would be a big day, he knew. He knew it all too well, in fact. Tomorrow would be the biggest day in his life, because tomorrow was the Choosing Day and it would determine how he spent the rest of his life.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Nerves, I imagine,” said George, setting down his loaded fork and seizing the lapels of his jacket in a judicious manner. He was a thin, gangly and studious boy, fascinated by rules and regulations and with a penchant for examining and debating both sides of any question—sometimes at great length. “Dreadful thing, nervousness. It can just freeze you up so you can’t think, can’t eat, can’t speak.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I’m not nervous,” Will said quickly, noticing that Horace had looked up, ready to form a sarcastic comment.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;George nodded several times, considering Will’s statement. “On the other hand,” he added, “a little nervousness can actually improve performance. It can heighten your perceptions and sharpen your reactions. So, the fact that you are worried, if, in fact, you are, is not necessarily something to be worried about, of itself—so to speak.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In spite of himself, a wry smile touched Will’s mouth. George would be a natural in the legal profession, he thought. He would almost certainly be the Scribemaster’s choice on the following morning. Perhaps, Will thought, that was at the heart of his own problem. He was the only one of the wardmates who had any fears about the Choosing that would take place within twelve hours.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“He ought to be nervous!” Horace scoffed. “After all, which Craftmaster is going to want him as an apprentice?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I’m sure we’re all nervous,” Alyss said. She directed one of her rare smiles at Will. “We’d be stupid not to be.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Well, I’m not!” Horace said, then reddened as Alyss raised one eyebrow and Jenny giggled.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was typical of Alyss, Will thought. He knew that the tall, graceful girl had already been promised a place as an apprentice by Lady Pauline, head of Castle Redmont’s Diplomatic Service. Her pretense that she was nervous about the following day, and her discretion in refraining from pointing out Horace’s gaffe, showed that she was already a diplomat of some skill.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jenny, of course, would gravitate immediately to the castle kitchens, domain of Master Chubb, Redmont’s head chef. He was a man renowned throughout the kingdom for the banquets served in the castle’s massive dining hall. Jenny loved food and cooking, and her easy-going nature and unfailing good humour would make her an invaluable staff member in the turmoil of the castle kitchens.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Battleschool would be Horace’s choice. Will glanced at his wardmate now, hungrily tucking into the roast turkey, ham and potatoes that he had heaped onto his plate. Horace was big for his age and a natural athlete. The chances that he would be refused were virtually non-existent. Horace was exactly the type of recruit that Sir Rodney looked for in his warrior apprentices. Strong, athletic, fit. And, thought Will a trifle sourly, not too bright.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Battleschool was the path to knighthood for boys like Horace—born commoners but with the physical abilities to serve as knights of the kingdom. Which left Will. What would his choice be? More importantly, as Horace had pointed out, what Craftmaster would accept him as an apprentice?</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For Choosing Day was the pivotal point in the life of the castle wards. They were orphan children raised by the generosity of Baron Arald, the Lord of Redmont Fief. For the most part, their parents had died in the service of the fief, and the Baron saw it as his responsibility to care for and raise the children of his former subjects— and to give them an opportunity to improve their station in life wherever possible.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Choosing Day provided that opportunity. Each year, castle wards turning fifteen could apply to be apprenticed to the masters of the various crafts that served the castle and its people. Ordinarily, craft apprentices were selected by dint of their parents’ occupations or influence with the Craftmasters. The castle wards usually had no such influence, and this was their chance to win a future for themselves. Those wards who weren’t chosen, or for whom no openings could be found, would be assigned to farming families in the nearby village, providing farm labour to raise the crops and animals that fed the castle inhabitants. It was rare for this to happen, Will knew. The Baron and his Craftmasters usually went out of their way to fit the wards into one craft or another. But it could happen, and it was a fate he feared more than anything.</p>

          <strong>RANGER’S APPRENTICE&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Try to eat something, Will. Tomorrow’s a big day, after all.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jenny, blond, pretty and cheerful, gestured toward Will’s barely touched plate and smiled encouragingly at him. Will made an attempt to return the smile, but it was a dismal failure. He picked at the plate before him, piled high with his favourite foods. Tonight, his stomach knotted tight with tension and anticipation, he could hardly bring himself to swallow a bite. Tomorrow would be a big day, he knew. He knew it all too well, in fact. Tomorrow would be the biggest day in his life, because tomorrow was the Choosing Day and it would determine how he spent the rest of his life.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Nerves, I imagine,” said George, setting down his loaded fork and seizing the lapels of his jacket in a judicious manner. He was a thin, gangly and studious boy, fascinated by rules and regulations and with a penchant for examining and debating both sides of any question—sometimes at great length. “Dreadful thing, nervousness. It can just freeze you up so you can’t think, can’t eat, can’t speak.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I’m not nervous,” Will said quickly, noticing that Horace had looked up, ready to form a sarcastic comment.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;George nodded several times, considering Will’s statement. “On the other hand,” he added, “a little nervousness can actually improve performance. It can heighten your perceptions and sharpen your reactions. So, the fact that you are worried, if, in fact, you are, is not necessarily something to be worried about, of itself—so to speak.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In spite of himself, a wry smile touched Will’s mouth. George would be a natural in the legal profession, he thought. He would almost certainly be the Scribemaster’s choice on the following morning. Perhaps, Will thought, that was at the heart of his own problem. He was the only one of the wardmates who had any fears about the Choosing that would take place within twelve hours.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“He ought to be nervous!” Horace scoffed. “After all, which Craftmaster is going to want him as an apprentice?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I’m sure we’re all nervous,” Alyss said. She directed one of her rare smiles at Will. “We’d be stupid not to be.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Well, I’m not!” Horace said, then reddened as Alyss raised one eyebrow and Jenny giggled.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was typical of Alyss, Will thought. He knew that the tall, graceful girl had already been promised a place as an apprentice by Lady Pauline, head of Castle Redmont’s Diplomatic Service. Her pretense that she was nervous about the following day, and her discretion in refraining from pointing out Horace’s gaffe, showed that she was already a diplomat of some skill.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jenny, of course, would gravitate immediately to the castle kitchens, domain of Master Chubb, Redmont’s head chef. He was a man renowned throughout the kingdom for the banquets served in the castle’s massive dining hall. Jenny loved food and cooking, and her easy-going nature and unfailing good humour would make her an invaluable staff member in the turmoil of the castle kitchens.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Battleschool would be Horace’s choice. Will glanced at his wardmate now, hungrily tucking into the roast turkey, ham and potatoes that he had heaped onto his plate. Horace was big for his age and a natural athlete. The chances that he would be refused were virtually non-existent. Horace was exactly the type of recruit that Sir Rodney looked for in his warrior apprentices. Strong, athletic, fit. And, thought Will a trifle sourly, not too bright.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Battleschool was the path to knighthood for boys like Horace—born commoners but with the physical abilities to serve as knights of the kingdom. Which left Will. What would his choice be? More importantly, as Horace had pointed out, what Craftmaster would accept him as an apprentice?</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For Choosing Day was the pivotal point in the life of the castle wards. They were orphan children raised by the generosity of Baron Arald, the Lord of Redmont Fief. For the most part, their parents had died in the service of the fief, and the Baron saw it as his responsibility to care for and raise the children of his former subjects— and to give them an opportunity to improve their station in life wherever possible.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Choosing Day provided that opportunity. Each year, castle wards turning fifteen could apply to be apprenticed to the masters of the various crafts that served the castle and its people. Ordinarily, craft apprentices were selected by dint of their parents’ occupations or influence with the Craftmasters. The castle wards usually had no such influence, and this was their chance to win a future for themselves. Those wards who weren’t chosen, or for whom no openings could be found, would be assigned to farming families in the nearby village, providing farm labour to raise the crops and animals that fed the castle inhabitants. It was rare for this to happen, Will knew. The Baron and his Craftmasters usually went out of their way to fit the wards into one craft or another. But it could happen, and it was a fate he feared more than anything.</p>

          <strong>RANGER’S APPRENTICE&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Try to eat something, Will. Tomorrow’s a big day, after all.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jenny, blond, pretty and cheerful, gestured toward Will’s barely touched plate and smiled encouragingly at him. Will made an attempt to return the smile, but it was a dismal failure. He picked at the plate before him, piled high with his favourite foods. Tonight, his stomach knotted tight with tension and anticipation, he could hardly bring himself to swallow a bite. Tomorrow would be a big day, he knew. He knew it all too well, in fact. Tomorrow would be the biggest day in his life, because tomorrow was the Choosing Day and it would determine how he spent the rest of his life.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Nerves, I imagine,” said George, setting down his loaded fork and seizing the lapels of his jacket in a judicious manner. He was a thin, gangly and studious boy, fascinated by rules and regulations and with a penchant for examining and debating both sides of any question—sometimes at great length. “Dreadful thing, nervousness. It can just freeze you up so you can’t think, can’t eat, can’t speak.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I’m not nervous,” Will said quickly, noticing that Horace had looked up, ready to form a sarcastic comment.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;George nodded several times, considering Will’s statement. “On the other hand,” he added, “a little nervousness can actually improve performance. It can heighten your perceptions and sharpen your reactions. So, the fact that you are worried, if, in fact, you are, is not necessarily something to be worried about, of itself—so to speak.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In spite of himself, a wry smile touched Will’s mouth. George would be a natural in the legal profession, he thought. He would almost certainly be the Scribemaster’s choice on the following morning. Perhaps, Will thought, that was at the heart of his own problem. He was the only one of the wardmates who had any fears about the Choosing that would take place within twelve hours.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“He ought to be nervous!” Horace scoffed. “After all, which Craftmaster is going to want him as an apprentice?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I’m sure we’re all nervous,” Alyss said. She directed one of her rare smiles at Will. “We’d be stupid not to be.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Well, I’m not!” Horace said, then reddened as Alyss raised one eyebrow and Jenny giggled.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was typical of Alyss, Will thought. He knew that the tall, graceful girl had already been promised a place as an apprentice by Lady Pauline, head of Castle Redmont’s Diplomatic Service. Her pretense that she was nervous about the following day, and her discretion in refraining from pointing out Horace’s gaffe, showed that she was already a diplomat of some skill.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jenny, of course, would gravitate immediately to the castle kitchens, domain of Master Chubb, Redmont’s head chef. He was a man renowned throughout the kingdom for the banquets served in the castle’s massive dining hall. Jenny loved food and cooking, and her easy-going nature and unfailing good humour would make her an invaluable staff member in the turmoil of the castle kitchens.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Battleschool would be Horace’s choice. Will glanced at his wardmate now, hungrily tucking into the roast turkey, ham and potatoes that he had heaped onto his plate. Horace was big for his age and a natural athlete. The chances that he would be refused were virtually non-existent. Horace was exactly the type of recruit that Sir Rodney looked for in his warrior apprentices. Strong, athletic, fit. And, thought Will a trifle sourly, not too bright.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Battleschool was the path to knighthood for boys like Horace—born commoners but with the physical abilities to serve as knights of the kingdom. Which left Will. What would his choice be? More importantly, as Horace had pointed out, what Craftmaster would accept him as an apprentice?</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For Choosing Day was the pivotal point in the life of the castle wards. They were orphan children raised by the generosity of Baron Arald, the Lord of Redmont Fief. For the most part, their parents had died in the service of the fief, and the Baron saw it as his responsibility to care for and raise the children of his former subjects— and to give them an opportunity to improve their station in life wherever possible.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Choosing Day provided that opportunity. Each year, castle wards turning fifteen could apply to be apprenticed to the masters of the various crafts that served the castle and its people. Ordinarily, craft apprentices were selected by dint of their parents’ occupations or influence with the Craftmasters. The castle wards usually had no such influence, and this was their chance to win a future for themselves. Those wards who weren’t chosen, or for whom no openings could be found, would be assigned to farming families in the nearby village, providing farm labour to raise the crops and animals that fed the castle inhabitants. It was rare for this to happen, Will knew. The Baron and his Craftmasters usually went out of their way to fit the wards into one craft or another. But it could happen, and it was a fate he feared more than anything.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Choosing Day provided that opportunity. Each year, castle wards turning fifteen could apply to be apprenticed to the masters of the various crafts that served the castle and its people. Ordinarily, craft apprentices were selected by dint of their parents’ occupations or influence with the Craftmasters. The castle wards usually had no such influence, and this was their chance to win a future for themselves. Those wards who weren’t chosen, or for whom no openings could be found, would be assigned to farming families in the nearby village, providing farm labour to raise the crops and animals that fed the castle inhabitants. It was rare for this to happen, Will knew. The Baron and his Craftmasters usually went out of their way to fit the wards into one craft or another. But it could happen, and it was a fate he feared more than anything.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>Read the extract from the novel written by John Flanagan then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>RANGER’S APPRENTICE&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Try to eat something, Will. Tomorrow’s a big day, after all.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jenny, blond, pretty and cheerful, gestured toward Will’s barely touched plate and smiled encouragingly at him. Will made an attempt to return the smile, but it was a dismal failure. He picked at the plate before him, piled high with his favourite foods. Tonight, his stomach knotted tight with tension and anticipation, he could hardly bring himself to swallow a bite. Tomorrow would be a big day, he knew. He knew it all too well, in fact. Tomorrow would be the biggest day in his life, because tomorrow was the Choosing Day and it would determine how he spent the rest of his life.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Nerves, I imagine,” said George, setting down his loaded fork and seizing the lapels of his jacket in a judicious manner. He was a thin, gangly and studious boy, fascinated by rules and regulations and with a penchant for examining and debating both sides of any question—sometimes at great length. “Dreadful thing, nervousness. It can just freeze you up so you can’t think, can’t eat, can’t speak.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I’m not nervous,” Will said quickly, noticing that Horace had looked up, ready to form a sarcastic comment.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;George nodded several times, considering Will’s statement. “On the other hand,” he added, “a little nervousness can actually improve performance. It can heighten your perceptions and sharpen your reactions. So, the fact that you are worried, if, in fact, you are, is not necessarily something to be worried about, of itself—so to speak.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In spite of himself, a wry smile touched Will’s mouth. George would be a natural in the legal profession, he thought. He would almost certainly be the Scribemaster’s choice on the following morning. Perhaps, Will thought, that was at the heart of his own problem. He was the only one of the wardmates who had any fears about the Choosing that would take place within twelve hours.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“He ought to be nervous!” Horace scoffed. “After all, which Craftmaster is going to want him as an apprentice?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I’m sure we’re all nervous,” Alyss said. She directed one of her rare smiles at Will. “We’d be stupid not to be.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Well, I’m not!” Horace said, then reddened as Alyss raised one eyebrow and Jenny giggled.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was typical of Alyss, Will thought. He knew that the tall, graceful girl had already been promised a place as an apprentice by Lady Pauline, head of Castle Redmont’s Diplomatic Service. Her pretense that she was nervous about the following day, and her discretion in refraining from pointing out Horace’s gaffe, showed that she was already a diplomat of some skill.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jenny, of course, would gravitate immediately to the castle kitchens, domain of Master Chubb, Redmont’s head chef. He was a man renowned throughout the kingdom for the banquets served in the castle’s massive dining hall. Jenny loved food and cooking, and her easy-going nature and unfailing good humour would make her an invaluable staff member in the turmoil of the castle kitchens.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Battleschool would be Horace’s choice. Will glanced at his wardmate now, hungrily tucking into the roast turkey, ham and potatoes that he had heaped onto his plate. Horace was big for his age and a natural athlete. The chances that he would be refused were virtually non-existent. Horace was exactly the type of recruit that Sir Rodney looked for in his warrior apprentices. Strong, athletic, fit. And, thought Will a trifle sourly, not too bright.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Battleschool was the path to knighthood for boys like Horace—born commoners but with the physical abilities to serve as knights of the kingdom. Which left Will. What would his choice be? More importantly, as Horace had pointed out, what Craftmaster would accept him as an apprentice?</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For Choosing Day was the pivotal point in the life of the castle wards. They were orphan children raised by the generosity of Baron Arald, the Lord of Redmont Fief. For the most part, their parents had died in the service of the fief, and the Baron saw it as his responsibility to care for and raise the children of his former subjects— and to give them an opportunity to improve their station in life wherever possible.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Choosing Day provided that opportunity. Each year, castle wards turning fifteen could apply to be apprenticed to the masters of the various crafts that served the castle and its people. Ordinarily, craft apprentices were selected by dint of their parents’ occupations or influence with the Craftmasters. The castle wards usually had no such influence, and this was their chance to win a future for themselves. Those wards who weren’t chosen, or for whom no openings could be found, would be assigned to farming families in the nearby village, providing farm labour to raise the crops and animals that fed the castle inhabitants. It was rare for this to happen, Will knew. The Baron and his Craftmasters usually went out of their way to fit the wards into one craft or another. But it could happen, and it was a fate he feared more than anything.</p>

        <p>One day soon he’ll tell her it’s time to start&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>packing,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And the kids will yell “Truly?” and get wildly&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>excited for no reason,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And the brown kelpie pup will start dashing about,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>tripping everyone up,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And she’ll go out to the vegetable patch and pick&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>all the green tomatoes from the vines,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And notice how the oldest girl is close to tears&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>because she was happy here,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And how the youngest girl is beaming because she&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>wasn’t.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And the first thing she’ll put on the trailer will be&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The bottling set she never unpacked from&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Grovedale,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And when the loaded ute* bumps down the drive&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>past the blackberry canes with their last&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>shrivelled fruit,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>She won’t even ask why they’re leaving this time,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Or where they’re heading for&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>– she’ll only remember how, when they came&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>here,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>she held out her hands bright with berries,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>the first of the season, and said:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Make a wish, Tom, make a wish.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
