        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Mark Twain said that “Humour is the great thing, the saving thing after all. The minute it crops up, all our hardnesses yield, all our irritations, and resentments flit away and a sunny spirit takes their place.”<br>
<br>
He is certainly not wrong. Humour may very well be the great thing. It touches upon nearly every facet of life — 90 percent of men and 81 percent of women report that a sense of humour is the most important quality in a partner, it’s a crucial quality for leaders and it’s even been shown to improve cancer treatments.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Humour doesn’t just guard against depression. It also improves people’s overall quality of life. Researchers have found that people who score highly in certain types of humour have better self-esteem, more positive affect, greater self-competency, more control over anxiety and better performance in social interactions.<br>
<br>
In addition to working as a mental immune system, research has shown that humour can actually improve your physical immune system.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Laughter can also improve cardiovascular health and lowers heart rates, blood pressure, and muscular tension. Aside from improving your health, laughter can also lead to greater creativity and a productivity tool as well. This is because laughter lights up the anterior cingulate cortex, an area of the brain associated with attention and decision-making.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There’s no doubt that humour is a life skill that everybody needs, but how do we define it? Can it be taught? The jury is still out on those issues.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
A colleague accused me of having a tendency to over-react, so I have no choice but to burn down his house and wish him only bad luck. Fair’s fair, right? I learned to respond strongly to things from a former boss who used to say the following sentence at least once a day: “Some fool has moved my (random object) and when I find out who did it, God help me, I am going to tear this place down… oh, there it is.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Some people think overreacting is a bad thing but look at the evidence. The richest country in the world is the United States, from which a reader has just sent me a video of a man riding a moped pursued by 12 police cars. A moped, for those who don’t know, is a motorbike powered by an engine with the strength of a mosquito suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But just days later, the US record on maximum overreaction was beaten by a news report sent to me by a reader in Canada. Twelve police squad cars and a tactical attack squad were sent to a block of flats in Winnipeg, Ontario, after an unknown person slammed a door in the building.<br>
<br>
This makes me want to live in Canada. I’ve lived in places where the police don’t even react to murders unless they happen at the actual police station, and even then, the only reaction is an irritated desk sergeant looking up from Candy Crush and raising an eyebrow.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Learning how to be funny is an essential people skill. Most people don’t realise you can learn how to be funny. In fact, I want to convince you that the funniest people hone their witty craft. And being funny matters.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
You’ll be more successful if you know how to make people laugh … but only the good kind of laugh, not the awkward kind: So, this is how you do it. Give the opposite answer to yes/no questions. Play with Numbers e.g. only 2000 people at the small party. Use The Rule of 3, that establishes a pattern, then ends with something unexpected. Use a Character Switch e.g. if you meet a bear in the woods, scary for the bear! Use “Whatever” as Your Secret Weapon. Use real-life stories, not jokes. Delay the funny. Now, I am going to end on something you know: practise makes perfect.<br>

Hey, you don't read this book. Do NOT read this book. Just shut it quietly and put it back where you found it. Look, bozo, I'm not kidding. What is there about the last sentence that you don't understand? Are you being rude or are you just really, really stupid? Can you even read? Let me try it one more time: Shut this book and put it back right now. I see we have an extremely difficult customer here. Take my advice, shut this book and put it back on the shelf. It's for your own good. There are BAD things in this book. REALLY BAD things. Not convinced? Then I'm going to have to list some of the things in this book. Don't blame me if it upsets you. It's not my fault; I warned you. VIOLENCE. Yep. There's blood in this book. Red stuff. It's nasty. It's yucky. It's downright gory. SAD THINGS. I'm talking about accidents, people going insane, even dying. We take no responsibility for any deeply traumatic condition that may yuck up your life if you are stupid enough to read this book despite the loads and loads of warnings telling you not to. Good grief! You really are a pest, aren't you? Well, this is your final chance. Put the book down quietly and go away.<br>

Mark Twain said that “Humour is the great thing, the saving thing after all. The minute it crops up, all our hardnesses yield, all our irritations, and resentments flit away and a sunny spirit takes their place.”<br>
<br>
He is certainly not wrong. Humour may very well be the great thing. It touches upon nearly every facet of life — 90 percent of men and 81 percent of women report that a sense of humour is the most important quality in a partner, it’s a crucial quality for leaders and it’s even been shown to improve cancer treatments.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Humour doesn’t just guard against depression. It also improves people’s overall quality of life. Researchers have found that people who score highly in certain types of humour have better self-esteem, more positive affect, greater self-competency, more control over anxiety and better performance in social interactions.<br>
<br>
In addition to working as a mental immune system, research has shown that humour can actually improve your physical immune system.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Laughter can also improve cardiovascular health and lowers heart rates, blood pressure, and muscular tension. Aside from improving your health, laughter can also lead to greater creativity and a productivity tool as well. This is because laughter lights up the anterior cingulate cortex, an area of the brain associated with attention and decision-making.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There’s no doubt that humour is a life skill that everybody needs, but how do we define it? Can it be taught? The jury is still out on those issues.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
A colleague accused me of having a tendency to over-react, so I have no choice but to burn down his house and wish him only bad luck. Fair’s fair, right? I learned to respond strongly to things from a former boss who used to say the following sentence at least once a day: “Some fool has moved my (random object) and when I find out who did it, God help me, I am going to tear this place down… oh, there it is.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Some people think overreacting is a bad thing but look at the evidence. The richest country in the world is the United States, from which a reader has just sent me a video of a man riding a moped pursued by 12 police cars. A moped, for those who don’t know, is a motorbike powered by an engine with the strength of a mosquito suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But just days later, the US record on maximum overreaction was beaten by a news report sent to me by a reader in Canada. Twelve police squad cars and a tactical attack squad were sent to a block of flats in Winnipeg, Ontario, after an unknown person slammed a door in the building.<br>
<br>
This makes me want to live in Canada. I’ve lived in places where the police don’t even react to murders unless they happen at the actual police station, and even then, the only reaction is an irritated desk sergeant looking up from Candy Crush and raising an eyebrow.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Learning how to be funny is an essential people skill. Most people don’t realise you can learn how to be funny. In fact, I want to convince you that the funniest people hone their witty craft. And being funny matters.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
You’ll be more successful if you know how to make people laugh … but only the good kind of laugh, not the awkward kind: So, this is how you do it. Give the opposite answer to yes/no questions. Play with Numbers e.g. only 2000 people at the small party. Use The Rule of 3, that establishes a pattern, then ends with something unexpected. Use a Character Switch e.g. if you meet a bear in the woods, scary for the bear! Use “Whatever” as Your Secret Weapon. Use real-life stories, not jokes. Delay the funny. Now, I am going to end on something you know: practise makes perfect.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Hey, you don't read this book. Do NOT read this book. Just shut it quietly and put it back where you found it. Look, bozo, I'm not kidding. What is there about the last sentence that you don't understand? Are you being rude or are you just really, really stupid? Can you even read? Let me try it one more time: Shut this book and put it back right now. I see we have an extremely difficult customer here. Take my advice, shut this book and put it back on the shelf. It's for your own good. There are BAD things in this book. REALLY BAD things. Not convinced? Then I'm going to have to list some of the things in this book. Don't blame me if it upsets you. It's not my fault; I warned you. VIOLENCE. Yep. There's blood in this book. Red stuff. It's nasty. It's yucky. It's downright gory. SAD THINGS. I'm talking about accidents, people going insane, even dying. We take no responsibility for any deeply traumatic condition that may yuck up your life if you are stupid enough to read this book despite the loads and loads of warnings telling you not to. Good grief! You really are a pest, aren't you? Well, this is your final chance. Put the book down quietly and go away.<br>

        <p><em>Read the poem below by Pablo Neruda then answer the questions.</em>&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Horses</strong><br><br>
From the window I saw the horses.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I was in Berlin, in winter. The light&nbsp;<br>
had no light, the sky had no heaven.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The air was white like wet bread.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And from my window <span class="txt-underline"><strong>a vacant arena,</strong></span><br>
<span class="txt-underline"><strong>bitten by the teeth of winter.</strong></span></p>
        <p><strong><span class="txt-underline">Suddenly</span></strong>&nbsp;driven out by a man,&nbsp;<br>
ten horses surged through the mist.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Like waves of fire, they flared forward&nbsp;<br>
and to my eyes filled the whole world,&nbsp;<br>
empty till then. Perfect, ablaze,&nbsp;<br>
they were like ten gods with pure white hoofs,&nbsp;<br>
with manes like a dream of salt.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Their rumps were worlds and oranges.&nbsp;<br>
Their colour was honey, amber, fire.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Their necks were towers&nbsp;<br>
cut from the stone of pride,&nbsp;<br>
and behind their transparent eyes&nbsp;<br>
energy raged, like a prisoner.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There, in silence, at midday,&nbsp;<br>
in that dirty, disordered winter,&nbsp;<br>
those intense horses were the blood&nbsp;<br>
the rhythm, the inciting treasure of life.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I looked. I looked and was reborn:&nbsp;<br>
for there, unknowing, was the fountain,&nbsp;<br>
the dance of gold, heaven&nbsp;<br>
and the fire that lives in beauty.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I have forgotten that dark Berlin winter.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I will not forget the light of the horses.</p>

        <p><em>Read the poem below by Pablo Neruda then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Horses</strong><br><br>
From the window I saw the horses.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I was in Berlin, in winter. The light&nbsp;<br>
had no light, the sky had no heaven.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The air was white like wet bread.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And from my window&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline"><strong>a vacant arena,</strong></span><br>
<span class="txt-underline"><strong>bitten by the teeth of winter</strong></span>.</p>
        <p><span class="txt-underline"><strong>Suddenly</strong></span>&nbsp;driven out by a man,&nbsp;<br>
ten horses surged through the mist.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Like waves of fire, they flared forward&nbsp;<br>
and to my eyes filled the whole world,&nbsp;<br>
empty till then. Perfect, ablaze,&nbsp;<br>
they were like ten gods with pure white hoofs,&nbsp;<br>
with manes like a dream of salt.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Their rumps were worlds and oranges.&nbsp;<br>
Their colour was honey, amber, fire.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Their necks were towers&nbsp;<br>
cut from the stone of pride,&nbsp;<br>
and behind their transparent eyes&nbsp;<br>
energy raged, like a prisoner.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There, in silence, at midday,&nbsp;<br>
in that dirty, disordered winter,&nbsp;<br>
those intense horses were the blood&nbsp;<br>
the rhythm, the inciting treasure of life.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I looked. I looked and was reborn:&nbsp;<br>
for there, unknowing, was the fountain,&nbsp;<br>
the dance of gold, heaven&nbsp;<br>
and the fire that lives in beauty.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I have forgotten that dark Berlin winter.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I will not forget the light of the horses.</p>

From the window I saw the horses.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I was in Berlin, in winter. The light&nbsp;<br>
had no light, the sky had no heaven.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The air was white like wet bread.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And from my window&nbsp;a <span class="txt-underline"><strong>vacant arena</strong></span>,<br>
<span class="txt-underline"><strong>bitten by the teeth of winter</strong></span>.</p>
        <p><span class="txt-underline"><strong>Suddenly</strong></span>&nbsp;driven out by a man,&nbsp;<br>
ten horses surged through the mist.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Like waves of fire, they flared forward&nbsp;<br>
and to my eyes filled the whole world,&nbsp;<br>
empty till then. Perfect, ablaze,&nbsp;<br>
they were like ten gods with pure white hoofs,&nbsp;<br>
with manes like a dream of salt.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Their rumps were worlds and oranges.&nbsp;<br>
Their colour was honey, amber, fire.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Their necks were towers&nbsp;<br>
cut from the stone of pride,&nbsp;<br>
and behind their transparent eyes&nbsp;<br>
energy raged, like a prisoner.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There, in silence, at midday,&nbsp;<br>
in that dirty, disordered winter,&nbsp;<br>
those intense horses were the blood&nbsp;<br>
the rhythm, the inciting treasure of life.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I looked. I looked and was reborn:&nbsp;<br>
for there, unknowing, was the fountain,&nbsp;<br>
the dance of gold, heaven&nbsp;<br>
and the fire that lives in beauty.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I have forgotten that dark Berlin winter.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I will not forget the light of the horses.</p>

        <p><em>Read the poem below by Pablo Neruda then answer the questions.</em>&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Horses</strong><br><br>
From the window I saw the horses.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I was in Berlin, in winter. The light&nbsp;<br>
had no light, the sky had no heaven.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The air was white like wet bread.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And from my window&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline"><strong>a vacant arena</strong></span>,<br>
<span class="txt-underline"><strong>bitten by the teeth of winter</strong></span>.</p>
        <p><span class="txt-underline"><strong>Suddenly</strong></span>&nbsp;driven out by a man,&nbsp;<br>
ten horses surged through the mist.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Like waves of fire, they flared forward&nbsp;<br>
and to my eyes filled the whole world,&nbsp;<br>
empty till then. Perfect, ablaze,&nbsp;<br>
they were like ten gods with pure white hoofs,&nbsp;<br>
with manes like a dream of salt.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Their rumps were worlds and oranges.&nbsp;<br>
Their colour was honey, amber, fire.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Their necks were towers&nbsp;<br>
cut from the stone of pride,&nbsp;<br>
and behind their transparent eyes&nbsp;<br>
energy raged, like a prisoner.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There, in silence, at midday,&nbsp;<br>
in that dirty, disordered winter,&nbsp;<br>
those intense horses were the blood&nbsp;<br>
the rhythm, the inciting treasure of life.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I looked. I looked and was reborn:&nbsp;<br>
for there, unknowing, was the fountain,&nbsp;<br>
the dance of gold, heaven&nbsp;<br>
and the fire that lives in beauty.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I have forgotten that dark Berlin winter.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I will not forget the light of the horses.</p>

        <p>At the beginning of the school year, Ursula considered her afternoon schedule from Monday to Thursday. Every Monday she attends music lessons and every Thursday she attends soccer practice. Once a fortnight, on Tuesdays she has a group debating project and once every four weeks, on Wednesdays, she goes shopping with her mother.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Ursula</strong>: “But, Mum, that means that every second week, I won’t have a single afternoon during the week to spend time with my best friend.”</p>
        <p><strong>Mum</strong>: “Don’t be so melodramatic, Ursula. After seeing her often for three weeks in a row, having a break for a week won’t kill you. And there’s still the weekend.”</p>
