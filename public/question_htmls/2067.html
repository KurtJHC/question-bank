        <p><strong>Riding to Win</strong><br><em>My notes about what I am reading</em><br><br><em><strong>1</strong></em> Tacy waited anxiously for the gate to open and her race to begin. She could feel her horse Stubby restlessly stomping the ground. Tacy tried to pretend it was just like all her practices back at her father’s ranch, but she couldn’t fool herself. The rodeo crowd buzzed in the background, and the air seemed charged with excitement. “I can do this,” Tacy told herself. Tacy looked over at her sister Sheri, who was always calm. Sheri had been through this many times before. Sheri smiled and gave Tacy a thumbs-up sign.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> Then the gate opened, and Stubby charged out toward the first barrel. The big chestnut horse knew what to do without Tacy even guiding him. They had spent many hours practicing, so circling the barrels was automatic for both of them. But now Tacy thought Stubby was going a little too fast. She tugged on the reins and guided him carefully around the first barrel. Stubby seemed to fight her, as if to say, “I can do this. Let me show you.” But Tacy didn’t want to mess up. It was the first of two rides to determine the winner of the Ranger County Rodeo Junior Barrel Racing Championship. Riders had two chances to circle the three barrels with their horse and return to the starting point. The contestant with the fastest combined time would win.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> After Stubby got around the first barrel, Tacy let him gain speed across the arena toward the second barrel. She could feel the powerful horse digging into the ground and picking up speed. Tacy knew they needed to be fast to have a chance of winning, but she also knew that missing a barrel or knocking one over could put her in last place. She didn’t trust her racing skills that much yet. She pulled back on the reins, just a little, to make sure that Stubby was not going too fast. Stubby snorted as they circled the second barrel. Now he shot toward the final barrel at the end of the arena. Tacy slowed him again, leaning into the turn as they rounded the barrel. She urged him forward, and he sped back to the line. Tacy looked for her time: 19.6 seconds. Not bad for the newest rider in the championship. So far that put her in fourth place out of more than twenty riders.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> Now it was her sister’s second turn. “Ride carefully,” Tacy said as her sister waited at the line.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> “Lynda Adams finished her first race in 18.1,” Sheri reminded her. “I’m not going to beat that by riding carefully.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “But—” Tacy started to protest as the gate opened and Sheri raced out. She was riding a black mare named Beetle. Beetle and Sheri headed full speed toward the first barrel. “Slow down. Slow down,” Tacy whispered. Tacy had watched her sister race before but never this fast. She was sure that Sheri would knock the barrel over. Beetle’s front hooves dug in, and the mare’s hind legs swiveled hard, looking as if they would wind around the barrel. Somehow Sheri and Beetle made it safely around and began racing for the second barrel. Tacy looked at the clock; Sheri had made good time. “Be careful,” she pleaded under her breath, but Sheri and Beetle charged full speed. Again, somehow, Beetle managed to get cleanly around the barrel. Now they were charging for the last barrel. Tacy could see they were making great time. She could hear the roar of the crowd building. “Maybe Sheri can beat Lynda’s time!” Tacy thought. But then Beetle cut around the last barrel too early, knocking it down. The crowd groaned as Sheri and Beetle raced back to the start gate. Their time was 18.0, but a fivesecond penalty was added for knocking one barrel over, bringing their time to 23.0 seconds—last place.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> “Sheri, why weren’t you more careful?” Tacy asked her sister in surprise. “Now you don’t have a chance to win.”</p>
        <p><strong><em>8</em></strong> “I told you, Tacy,” Sheri said. “I didn’t have a chance to win anyway if I rode carefully. So I rode to win.” Tacy walked away slowly. She had another ride to make. She might still be able to finish in the top three. “I’m not like you, Tacy,” Sheri called after her. “I try my best to win, and if I lose, well, I’ll just try again next time.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> Tacy mounted Stubby and got ready for her second ride. Sheri’s words were still in her ears. Lynda Adams was just finishing her second ride. Her horse had slipped a little, and she had finished her second run in 19.8 seconds. Tacy did the math in her head. She needed to finish in 18.0 seconds to beat Lynda. “That’s crazy,” she thought. She had ridden that fast in practice but never in a real rodeo. If Stubby slipped, she wouldn’t finish in the top three. She looked over at Sheri. Her sister smiled and clapped her hands. “Come on, Tacy!” she yelled. “You can do it!”</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> But it was Sheri’s earlier words that echoed through Tacy’s mind as the gate opened: “<em><strong>I’m not like you, Tacy.</strong></em>” Stubby seemed to be charging too hard. She started to pull him back, but something stopped her. Instead, she leaned into the turn and let her horse swing around toward the first barrel. Stubby had never felt so fast. The ground seemed to thunder under them as he tore for the second barrel. In a dizzying whirl, Stubby was around it and streaking toward the third and final turn. Tacy could hear the noise of the crowd rising as they saw that she had a chance. Now Stubby turned hard around the last barrel, his hind legs bumping it as he dug for the finish. “That’s it,” Tacy thought. With a five-second penalty, she would finish near the bottom. But the crowd noise was increasing! The barrel had wobbled but hadn’t fallen. As Stubby flashed across the line, Tacy saw her time: 17.9 seconds! She had done it. She had won! She looked at Sheri, who was jumping up and down. “Way to go, Tacy!” she shouted. “Way to go!”</p>

          <strong>Mattie Stepanek, Poet-Hero</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by S. L. Dulak</em><br><br><em><strong>1</strong></em> Mattie Stepanek is very busy. He speaks at conferences and participates in fund-raising events. He has been a guest on television shows in Chicago and New York City. He has written two number-one best-sellers. He owns a motorized scooter that he calls Slick. Although this sounds like an exciting life, Mattie has to deal with many hardships as well. Mattie is an 11-year-old boy with a life-threatening disease.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> Matthew Joseph Thaddeus Stepanek likes to be called Mattie. He was born with a rare form of muscular dystrophy, or MD for short. MD interferes with the body’s ability to breathe and also affects the heart. Mattie’s muscles have become so weak that he has a hard time walking. His scooter is a motorized wheelchair. He must take a portable oxygen tank everywhere he goes. These things remind Mattie of the seriousness of his disease, as do the many timeconsuming medical treatments he has to have each day. But despite the disease, Mattie enjoys many of the same activities as other children his age. He loves to watch baseball and read. He has favorite games and toys. He even has a first-degree black belt in a martial art. And like other 11-year-olds, he has schoolwork. Because of the complications related to his disease, Mattie is homeschooled instead of going to a regular school.</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="65%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766025574/hpa1xk5f55kfmoc2bkqn.png" alt="ASS_Y4_EN_35_2">


        </p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> Every summer Mattie spends one week at Camp Maria, the Muscular Dystrophy Association camp in Leonardtown, Maryland. The camp motto is “Friends Helping Friends.” A friend is assigned to help each camper. Mattie’s friend helps him with arts and crafts, wheelchair football and baseball, singing, and dancing. At the close of the session, campers write their special wishes on a piece of paper. The papers are then put into a basket, which is tied to balloons and released into the air. The balloons sail into the sky, launching the wishes.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> For the past five years, Mattie has made the same three wishes: to have some of the thousands of poems he has written published in a book, to meet one of his heroes, former U.S. president Jimmy Carter, and to have his poems read on television. Now Mattie believes the balloon wishes work.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> Mattie’s first wish came true during one of his numerous stays in the hospital. Cheryl and Peter Barnes, founders of VSP Books, read some of Mattie’s poems and knew right away that they were special. In July 2001 the Barneses agreed to print some of the poems in a book Mattie entitled <strong>Heartsongs</strong>. His second book, <strong>Journey Through Heartsongs</strong>, was published in October 2001. More than 450,000 copies of both books have been sold.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> While Mattie was in the hospital in Washington, D.C., another wish came true. He spoke on the telephone with Jimmy Carter. During their conversation Mattie didn’t mention his disease. Instead, he and Mr. Carter talked of bringing peace to countries at war, such as Bosnia. Mattie thinks Jimmy Carter is the perfect hero. Since his presidency ended in 1981, Mr. Carter has worked for world peace and human rights. Mattie, too, wants to grow up to be a peacemaker and a politician.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7 </strong></em>On October 19, 2001, the last of his wishes came true. Mattie was a guest on Oprah Winfrey’s nationally televised talk show. He talked with Ms. Winfrey about his desire for peace in the world. She read several of Mattie’s poems on television. Some of Mattie’s poems are about the ordeal of living with a serious disease. But Mattie doesn’t always write about the hardships of life. Most of his poems are about hope, peace, and wisdom.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> Mattie is the Muscular Dystrophy Association’s 2002 National Goodwill Ambassador. As a spokesperson for Children’s Hospice International, he speaks on behalf of sick children and their families. Although he has received many honors, Mattie feels that his greatest achievement is being alive today, especially since he has had many close calls throughout the years. Mattie continues to spread his message of peace and goodwill, hoping to inspire people to help others.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> Mattie tries to live his life by three ideas. The first is to play in the puddles after every storm. The second is to celebrate life every day. The third is to never give up trying to reach what you want. Mattie’s life is certainly a reflection of each of these principles.</p>

          <strong>Mattie Stepanek, Poet-Hero</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by S. L. Dulak</em><br><br><em><strong>1</strong></em> Mattie Stepanek is very busy. He speaks at conferences and participates in fund-raising events. He has been a guest on television shows in Chicago and New York City. He has written two number-one best-sellers. He owns a motorized scooter that he calls Slick. Although this sounds like an exciting life, Mattie has to deal with many hardships as well. Mattie is an 11-year-old boy with a life-threatening disease.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> Matthew Joseph Thaddeus Stepanek likes to be called Mattie. He was born with a rare form of muscular dystrophy, or MD for short. MD interferes with the body’s ability to breathe and also affects the heart. Mattie’s muscles have become so weak that he has a hard time walking. His scooter is a motorized wheelchair. He must take a portable oxygen tank everywhere he goes. These things remind Mattie of the seriousness of his disease, as do the many timeconsuming medical treatments he has to have each day. But despite the disease, Mattie enjoys many of the same activities as other children his age. He loves to watch baseball and read. He has favorite games and toys. He even has a first-degree black belt in a martial art. And like other 11-year-olds, he has schoolwork. Because of the complications related to his disease, Mattie is homeschooled instead of going to a regular school.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> Every summer Mattie spends one week at Camp Maria, the Muscular Dystrophy Association camp in Leonardtown, Maryland. The camp motto is “Friends Helping Friends.” A friend is assigned to help each camper. Mattie’s friend helps him with arts and crafts, wheelchair football and baseball, singing, and dancing. At the close of the session, campers write their special wishes on a piece of paper. The papers are then put into a basket, which is tied to balloons and released into the air. The balloons sail into the sky, launching the wishes.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> For the past five years, Mattie has made the same three wishes: to have some of the thousands of poems he has written published in a book, to meet one of his heroes, former U.S. president Jimmy Carter, and to have his poems read on television. Now Mattie believes the balloon wishes work.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> Mattie’s first wish came true during one of his numerous stays in the hospital. Cheryl and Peter Barnes, founders of VSP Books, read some of Mattie’s poems and knew right away that they were special. In July 2001 the Barneses agreed to print some of the poems in a book Mattie entitled <strong>Heartsongs</strong>. His second book, <strong>Journey Through Heartsongs</strong>, was published in October 2001. More than 450,000 copies of both books have been sold.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> While Mattie was in the hospital in Washington, D.C., another wish came true. He spoke on the telephone with Jimmy Carter. During their conversation Mattie didn’t mention his disease. Instead, he and Mr. Carter talked of bringing peace to countries at war, such as Bosnia. Mattie thinks Jimmy Carter is the perfect hero. Since his presidency ended in 1981, Mr. Carter has worked for world peace and human rights. Mattie, too, wants to grow up to be a peacemaker and a politician.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7 </strong></em>On October 19, 2001, the last of his wishes came true. Mattie was a guest on Oprah Winfrey’s nationally televised talk show. He talked with Ms. Winfrey about his desire for peace in the world. She read several of Mattie’s poems on television. Some of Mattie’s poems are about the ordeal of living with a serious disease. But Mattie doesn’t always write about the hardships of life. Most of his poems are about hope, peace, and wisdom.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> Mattie is the Muscular Dystrophy Association’s 2002 National Goodwill Ambassador. As a spokesperson for Children’s Hospice International, he speaks on behalf of sick children and their families. Although he has received many honors, Mattie feels that his greatest achievement is being alive today, especially since he has had many close calls throughout the years. Mattie continues to spread his message of peace and goodwill, hoping to inspire people to help others.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> Mattie tries to live his life by three ideas. The first is to play in the puddles after every storm. The second is to celebrate life every day. The third is to never give up trying to reach what you want. Mattie’s life is certainly a reflection of each of these principles.</p>

        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> Matthew Joseph Thaddeus Stepanek likes to be called Mattie. He was born with a rare form of muscular dystrophy, or MD for short. MD interferes with the body’s ability to breathe and also affects the heart. Mattie’s muscles have become so weak that he has a hard time walking. His scooter is a motorized wheelchair. He must take a portable oxygen tank everywhere he goes. These things remind Mattie of the seriousness of his disease, as do the many timeconsuming medical treatments he has to have each day. But despite the disease, Mattie enjoys many of the same activities as other children his age. He loves to watch baseball and read. He has favorite games and toys. He even has a first-degree black belt in a martial art. And like other 11-year-olds, he has schoolwork. Because of the complications related to his disease, Mattie is homeschooled instead of going to a regular school.</p>

        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> Every summer Mattie spends one week at Camp Maria, the Muscular Dystrophy Association camp in Leonardtown, Maryland. The camp motto is “Friends Helping Friends.” A friend is assigned to help each camper. Mattie’s friend helps him with arts and crafts, wheelchair football and baseball, singing, and dancing. At the close of the session, campers write their special wishes on a piece of paper. The papers are then put into a basket, which is tied to balloons and released into the air. The balloons sail into the sky, launching the wishes.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> For the past five years, Mattie has made the same three wishes: to have some of the thousands of poems he has written published in a book, to meet one of his heroes, former U.S. president Jimmy Carter, and to have his poems read on television. Now Mattie believes the balloon wishes work.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> Mattie’s first wish came true during one of his numerous stays in the hospital. Cheryl and Peter Barnes, founders of VSP Books, read some of Mattie’s poems and knew right away that they were special. In July 2001 the Barneses agreed to print some of the poems in a book Mattie entitled <strong>Heartsongs</strong>. His second book, <strong>Journey Through Heartsongs</strong>, was published in October 2001. More than 450,000 copies of both books have been sold.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> While Mattie was in the hospital in Washington, D.C., another wish came true. He spoke on the telephone with Jimmy Carter. During their conversation Mattie didn’t mention his disease. Instead, he and Mr. Carter talked of bringing peace to countries at war, such as Bosnia. Mattie thinks Jimmy Carter is the perfect hero. Since his presidency ended in 1981, Mr. Carter has worked for world peace and human rights. Mattie, too, wants to grow up to be a peacemaker and a politician.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7 </strong></em>On October 19, 2001, the last of his wishes came true. Mattie was a guest on Oprah Winfrey’s nationally televised talk show. He talked with Ms. Winfrey about his desire for peace in the world. She read several of Mattie’s poems on television. Some of Mattie’s poems are about the ordeal of living with a serious disease. But Mattie doesn’t always write about the hardships of life. Most of his poems are about hope, peace, and wisdom.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> Mattie is the Muscular Dystrophy Association’s 2002 National Goodwill Ambassador. As a spokesperson for Children’s Hospice International, he speaks on behalf of sick children and their families. Although he has received many honors, Mattie feels that his greatest achievement is being alive today, especially since he has had many close calls throughout the years. Mattie continues to spread his message of peace and goodwill, hoping to inspire people to help others.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> Mattie tries to live his life by three ideas. The first is to play in the puddles after every storm. The second is to celebrate life every day. The third is to never give up trying to reach what you want. Mattie’s life is certainly a reflection of each of these principles.</p>

        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> Every summer Mattie spends one week at Camp Maria, the Muscular Dystrophy Association camp in Leonardtown, Maryland. The camp motto is “Friends Helping Friends.” A friend is assigned to help each camper. Mattie’s friend helps him with arts and crafts, wheelchair football and baseball, singing, and dancing. At the close of the session, campers write their special wishes on a piece of paper. The papers are then put into a basket, which is tied to balloons and released into the air. The balloons sail into the sky, launching the wishes.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> For the past five years, Mattie has made the same three wishes: to have some of the thousands of poems he has written published in a book, to meet one of his heroes, former U.S. president Jimmy Carter, and to have his poems read on television. Now Mattie believes the balloon wishes work.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> Mattie’s first wish came true during one of his numerous stays in the hospital. Cheryl and Peter Barnes, founders of VSP Books, read some of Mattie’s poems and knew right away that they were special. In July 2001 the Barneses agreed to print some of the poems in a book Mattie entitled <strong>Heartsongs</strong>. His second book, <strong>Journey Through Heartsongs</strong>, was published in October 2001. More than 450,000 copies of both books have been sold.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> While Mattie was in the hospital in Washington, D.C., another wish came true. He spoke on the telephone with Jimmy Carter. During their conversation Mattie didn’t mention his disease. Instead, he and Mr. Carter talked of bringing peace to countries at war, such as Bosnia. Mattie thinks Jimmy Carter is the perfect hero. Since his presidency ended in 1981, Mr. Carter has worked for world peace and human rights. Mattie, too, wants to grow up to be a peacemaker and a politician.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7 </strong></em>On October 19, 2001, the last of his wishes came true. Mattie was a guest on Oprah Winfrey’s nationally televised talk show. He talked with Ms. Winfrey about his desire for peace in the world. She read several of Mattie’s poems on television. Some of Mattie’s poems are about the ordeal of living with a serious disease. But Mattie doesn’t always write about the hardships of life. Most of his poems are about hope, peace, and wisdom.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> Mattie is the Muscular Dystrophy Association’s 2002 National Goodwill Ambassador. As a spokesperson for Children’s Hospice International, he speaks on behalf of sick children and their families. Although he has received many honors, Mattie feels that his greatest achievement is being alive today, especially since he has had many close calls throughout the years. Mattie continues to spread his message of peace and goodwill, hoping to inspire people to help others.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> Mattie tries to live his life by three ideas. The first is to play in the puddles after every storm. The second is to celebrate life every day. The third is to never give up trying to reach what you want. Mattie’s life is certainly a reflection of each of these principles.</p>

          <strong>Mattie Stepanek, Poet-Hero</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by S. L. Dulak</em><br><br><em><strong>1</strong></em> Mattie Stepanek is very busy. He speaks at conferences and participates in fund-raising events. He has been a guest on television shows in Chicago and New York City. He has written two number-one best-sellers. He owns a motorized scooter that he calls Slick. Although this sounds like an exciting life, Mattie has to deal with many hardships as well. Mattie is an 11-year-old boy with a life-threatening disease.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> Matthew Joseph Thaddeus Stepanek likes to be called Mattie. He was born with a rare form of muscular dystrophy, or MD for short. MD interferes with the body’s ability to breathe and also affects the heart. Mattie’s muscles have become so weak that he has a hard time walking. His scooter is a motorized wheelchair. He must take a portable oxygen tank everywhere he goes. These things remind Mattie of the seriousness of his disease, as do the many timeconsuming medical treatments he has to have each day. But despite the disease, Mattie enjoys many of the same activities as other children his age. He loves to watch baseball and read. He has favorite games and toys. He even has a first-degree black belt in a martial art. And like other 11-year-olds, he has schoolwork. Because of the complications related to his disease, Mattie is homeschooled instead of going to a regular school.</p>

        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> Every summer Mattie spends one week at Camp Maria, the Muscular Dystrophy Association camp in Leonardtown, Maryland. The camp motto is “Friends Helping Friends.” A friend is assigned to help each camper. Mattie’s friend helps him with arts and crafts, wheelchair football and baseball, singing, and dancing. At the close of the session, campers write their special wishes on a piece of paper. The papers are then put into a basket, which is tied to balloons and released into the air. The balloons sail into the sky, launching the wishes.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> For the past five years, Mattie has made the same three wishes: to have some of the thousands of poems he has written published in a book, to meet one of his heroes, former U.S. president Jimmy Carter, and to have his poems read on television. Now Mattie believes the balloon wishes work.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> Mattie’s first wish came true during one of his numerous stays in the hospital. Cheryl and Peter Barnes, founders of VSP Books, read some of Mattie’s poems and knew right away that they were special. In July 2001 the Barneses agreed to print some of the poems in a book Mattie entitled <strong>Heartsongs</strong>. His second book, <strong>Journey Through Heartsongs</strong>, was published in October 2001. More than 450,000 copies of both books have been sold.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> While Mattie was in the hospital in Washington, D.C., another wish came true. He spoke on the telephone with Jimmy Carter. During their conversation Mattie didn’t mention his disease. Instead, he and Mr. Carter talked of bringing peace to countries at war, such as Bosnia. Mattie thinks Jimmy Carter is the perfect hero. Since his presidency ended in 1981, Mr. Carter has worked for world peace and human rights. Mattie, too, wants to grow up to be a peacemaker and a politician.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7 </strong></em>On October 19, 2001, the last of his wishes came true. Mattie was a guest on Oprah Winfrey’s nationally televised talk show. He talked with Ms. Winfrey about his desire for peace in the world. She read several of Mattie’s poems on television. Some of Mattie’s poems are about the ordeal of living with a serious disease. But Mattie doesn’t always write about the hardships of life. Most of his poems are about hope, peace, and wisdom.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> Mattie is the Muscular Dystrophy Association’s 2002 National Goodwill Ambassador. As a spokesperson for Children’s Hospice International, he speaks on behalf of sick children and their families. Although he has received many honors, Mattie feels that his greatest achievement is being alive today, especially since he has had many close calls throughout the years. Mattie continues to spread his message of peace and goodwill, hoping to inspire people to help others.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> Mattie tries to live his life by three ideas. The first is to play in the puddles after every storm. The second is to celebrate life every day. The third is to never give up trying to reach what you want. Mattie’s life is certainly a reflection of each of these principles.</p>
