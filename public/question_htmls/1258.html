        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>We Need Plastics. What We Don’t Need is Plastic Waste.&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
The World Economic Forum predicts that by 2050, plastic waste in the oceans will outweigh the fish. This is a huge problem for marine life as a myriad of animals either get tangled up in plastic waste or else mistake it for food and ingest it. Fortunately, more and more people are waking up to the issue. <strong>15 ………. </strong>While that intention is admirable, we may need to look at the issue from another perspective.</p>
        <p>People tend to think that many companies have shifted to using more plastic packaging just because it’s cheaper. It is cheaper, but there are other good reasons we have started relying more and more on plastic packaging. Plastic is durable and provides protection from contaminants and the elements. <strong>16 ……….</strong> Without this protection, food is more likely to get damaged and become unusable. Since food waste contributes to climate change, water and energy consumption, deforestation and biodiversity loss, every effort we make to mitigate those effects makes a big difference, and plastic packaging helps make that possible.</p>
        <p>In addition, plastic can easily be made thin and lightweight, which lowers emissions, since it doesn’t appreciably add volume or mass to transport. In other words, the overall environmental impact of plastic is lower than that of alternative materials, like bulky cardboard and weighty metal. <strong>17 ……….</strong> That means you can reduce fuel consumption, which saves money and lowers emissions that are harmful to the environment.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Overall, plastic packaging is a better alternative for the environment than glass, metal or other packaging alternatives, but even so, some systems are better than others. In an effort to create the most environmentally friendly packaging solution, Swedish inventor, Rickard Gillblad invented the Torus Pak. <strong>18 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>By now, many people know that frozen meals radically reduce food waste by increasing shelf life and limiting plate waste through pre-portioning. <strong>19 ……….</strong>, there is no need to eat out of the container or scrape the meal out.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In an age where threats to the environment are widespread, <strong>20……….</strong> Plastic food packaging reduces food waste and lowers carbon emissions, both of which contribute to a reduction in global warming. The key is to create packaging that more environmentally friendly and then dispose of that packaging in environmentally friendly manners.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>We Need Plastics. What We Don’t Need is Plastic Waste.&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
The World Economic Forum predicts that by 2050, plastic waste in the oceans will outweigh the fish. This is a huge problem for marine life as a myriad of animals either get tangled up in plastic waste or else mistake it for food and ingest it. Fortunately, more and more people are waking up to the issue. <strong>15 ………. </strong>While that intention is admirable, we may need to look at the issue from another perspective.</p>
        <p>People tend to think that many companies have shifted to using more plastic packaging just because it’s cheaper. It is cheaper, but there are other good reasons we have started relying more and more on plastic packaging. Plastic is durable and provides protection from contaminants and the elements. <strong>16 ……….</strong> Without this protection, food is more likely to get damaged and become unusable. Since food waste contributes to climate change, water and energy consumption, deforestation and biodiversity loss, every effort we make to mitigate those effects makes a big difference, and plastic packaging helps make that possible.</p>
        <p>In addition, plastic can easily be made thin and lightweight, which lowers emissions, since it doesn’t appreciably add volume or mass to transport. In other words, the overall environmental impact of plastic is lower than that of alternative materials, like bulky cardboard and weighty metal. <strong>17 ……….</strong> That means you can reduce fuel consumption, which saves money and lowers emissions that are harmful to the environment.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Overall, plastic packaging is a better alternative for the environment than glass, metal or other packaging alternatives, but even so, some systems are better than others. In an effort to create the most environmentally friendly packaging solution, Swedish inventor, Rickard Gillblad invented the Torus Pak. <strong>18 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>By now, many people know that frozen meals radically reduce food waste by increasing shelf life and limiting plate waste through pre-portioning. <strong>19 ……….</strong>, there is no need to eat out of the container or scrape the meal out.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In an age where threats to the environment are widespread, <strong>20……….</strong> Plastic food packaging reduces food waste and lowers carbon emissions, both of which contribute to a reduction in global warming. The key is to create packaging that more environmentally friendly and then dispose of that packaging in environmentally friendly manners.</p>

The popular view of life in ancient&nbsp;Egypt&nbsp;is often that it was a&nbsp;death-obsessed&nbsp;culture&nbsp;in which powerful pharaohs forced the people to labour at constructing&nbsp;pyramids&nbsp;and temples and, at an unspecified time, enslaved the Hebrews for this purpose. In reality, ancient Egyptians loved life, no matter their social class, and the ancient&nbsp;Egyptian government&nbsp;used slave labour as every other ancient culture did without regard to any particular ethnicity. The ancient Egyptians did have a well-known contempt for non-Egyptians but this was simply because they believed they were living the best life possible in the best of all possible worlds. Life in ancient Egypt was considered so perfect, in fact, that the&nbsp;Egyptian&nbsp;afterlife was imagined as an eternal continuation of life on earth. Slaves in Egypt were either criminals, those who could not pay their debts, or captives from foreign military campaigns. These people were considered to have forfeited their freedoms either by their individual choices or by military&nbsp;conquest&nbsp;and so were forced to endure a quality of existence far below that of free Egyptians.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}

<p>The individuals who actually built the pyramids and other famous monuments of Egypt were Egyptians who were compensated for their labour and, in many cases, were masters of their art. These monuments were raised not in honour of death but of life and the belief that an individual life mattered enough to be remembered for eternity. Further, the Egyptian belief that one's life was an eternal journey and death only a transition inspired the people to try to make their lives worth living eternally. Far from a death-obsessed and dour culture, Egyptian daily life was focused on enjoying the time one had as much as possible and trying to make other's lives equally memorable<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Sports, games, reading, festivals, and time with one's friends and family were as much a part of Egyptian life as toil in farming the land or erecting monuments and temples. The world of the Egyptians was imbued with magic. Magic (heka) predated the gods and, in fact, was the underlying force which allowed the gods to perform their duties. Magic was personified in the god Heka (also the god of&nbsp;medicine) who had participated in the creation and sustained it afterwards. The concept of&nbsp;ma'at&nbsp;(harmony and balance) was central to the Egyptian's understanding of life and the operation of the universe and it was&nbsp;heka&nbsp;which made&nbsp;ma'at&nbsp;possible. Through the observance of balance and harmony people were encouraged to live at peace with others and contribute to communal happiness.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Letting one's face "shine" meant being happy, having a good spirit, in the belief that this would make one's own heart light and lighten those of others. Although Egyptian society was highly stratified from a very early period (as early as the&nbsp;Predynastic Period in Egypt&nbsp;of c. 6000-3150 BCE), this does not mean that the royalty and upper classes enjoyed their lives at the expense of the peasantry. The king and court are always the best-documented individuals because then, as now, people paid more attention to celebrities than their neighbors and the scribes who recorded the history of the time documented what was of greater interest. Still, reports from later&nbsp;Greek&nbsp;and&nbsp;Roman&nbsp;writers, as well as archaeological evidence and letters from different time periods, show that Egyptians of all social classes valued life and enjoyed themselves as often as they could, very much like people in the modern day.<br>

The popular view of life in ancient&nbsp;Egypt&nbsp;is often that it was a&nbsp;death-obsessed&nbsp;culture&nbsp;in which powerful pharaohs forced the people to labour at constructing&nbsp;pyramids&nbsp;and temples and, at an unspecified time, enslaved the Hebrews for this purpose. In reality, ancient Egyptians loved life, no matter their social class, and the ancient&nbsp;Egyptian government&nbsp;used slave labour as every other ancient culture did without regard to any particular ethnicity. The ancient Egyptians did have a well-known contempt for non-Egyptians but this was simply because they believed they were living the best life possible in the best of all possible worlds. Life in ancient Egypt was considered so perfect, in fact, that the&nbsp;Egyptian&nbsp;afterlife was imagined as an eternal continuation of life on earth. Slaves in Egypt were either criminals, those who could not pay their debts, or captives from foreign military campaigns. These people were considered to have forfeited their freedoms either by their individual choices or by military&nbsp;conquest&nbsp;and so were forced to endure a quality of existence far below that of free Egyptians.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}

<p>The individuals who actually built the pyramids and other famous monuments of Egypt were Egyptians who were compensated for their labour and, in many cases, were masters of their art. These monuments were raised not in honour of death but of life and the belief that an individual life mattered enough to be remembered for eternity. Further, the Egyptian belief that one's life was an eternal journey and death only a transition inspired the people to try to make their lives worth living eternally. Far from a death-obsessed and dour culture, Egyptian daily life was focused on enjoying the time one had as much as possible and trying to make other's lives equally memorable<br>

Sports, games, reading, festivals, and time with one's friends and family were as much a part of Egyptian life as toil in farming the land or erecting monuments and temples. The world of the Egyptians was imbued with magic. Magic (heka) predated the gods and, in fact, was the underlying force which allowed the gods to perform their duties. Magic was personified in the god Heka (also the god of&nbsp;medicine) who had participated in the creation and sustained it afterwards. The concept of&nbsp;ma'at&nbsp;(harmony and balance) was central to the Egyptian's understanding of life and the operation of the universe and it was&nbsp;heka&nbsp;which made&nbsp;ma'at&nbsp;possible. Through the observance of balance and harmony people were encouraged to live at peace with others and contribute to communal happiness.<br>

The popular view of life in ancient&nbsp;Egypt&nbsp;is often that it was a&nbsp;death-obsessed&nbsp;culture&nbsp;in which powerful pharaohs forced the people to labour at constructing&nbsp;pyramids&nbsp;and temples and, at an unspecified time, enslaved the Hebrews for this purpose. In reality, ancient Egyptians loved life, no matter their social class, and the ancient&nbsp;Egyptian government&nbsp;used slave labour as every other ancient culture did without regard to any particular ethnicity. The ancient Egyptians did have a well-known contempt for non-Egyptians but this was simply because they believed they were living the best life possible in the best of all possible worlds. Life in ancient Egypt was considered so perfect, in fact, that the&nbsp;Egyptian&nbsp;afterlife was imagined as an eternal continuation of life on earth. Slaves in Egypt were either criminals, those who could not pay their debts, or captives from foreign military campaigns. These people were considered to have forfeited their freedoms either by their individual choices or by military&nbsp;conquest&nbsp;and so were forced to endure a quality of existence far below that of free Egyptians.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}

<p>The individuals who actually built the pyramids and other famous monuments of Egypt were Egyptians who were compensated for their labour and, in many cases, were masters of their art. These monuments were raised not in honour of death but of life and the belief that an individual life mattered enough to be remembered for eternity. Further, the Egyptian belief that one's life was an eternal journey and death only a transition inspired the people to try to make their lives worth living eternally. Far from a death-obsessed and dour culture, Egyptian daily life was focused on enjoying the time one had as much as possible and trying to make other's lives equally memorable<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Sports, games, reading, festivals, and time with one's friends and family were as much a part of Egyptian life as toil in farming the land or erecting monuments and temples. The world of the Egyptians was imbued with magic. Magic (heka) predated the gods and, in fact, was the underlying force which allowed the gods to perform their duties. Magic was personified in the god Heka (also the god of&nbsp;medicine) who had participated in the creation and sustained it afterwards. The concept of&nbsp;ma'at&nbsp;(harmony and balance) was central to the Egyptian's understanding of life and the operation of the universe and it was&nbsp;heka&nbsp;which made&nbsp;ma'at&nbsp;possible. Through the observance of balance and harmony people were encouraged to live at peace with others and contribute to communal happiness.<br>

​Letting one's face "shine" meant being happy, having a good spirit, in the belief that this would make one's own heart light and lighten those of others.

          <strong>The Outsiders&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by S. E. Hinton&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When I stepped out into the bright sunlight from the darkness of the movie house, I had only two things on my mind: Paul Newman and a ride home. I was wishing I looked like Paul Newman—he looks tough and I don’t—but I guess my own looks aren’t so bad. I have light-brown, almost-red hair and greenish gray eyes. I wish they were more gray, because I hate most guys that have green eyes, but I have to be content with what I have. My hair is longer than a lot of boys wear theirs, squared off in back and long at the front and sides, but I am a greaser and most of my neighborhood rarely bothers to get a haircut. Besides, I look better with long hair.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I had a long walk home and no company, but I usually lone it anyway, for no reason except that I like to watch movies undisturbed so I can get into them and live them with the actors. When I see a movie with someone it’s kind of uncomfortable, like having someone read your book over your shoulder. I’m different that way. I mean, my second-oldest brother, Soda, who is sixteen-going on-seventeen, never cracks a book at all, and my oldest brother, Darrel, who we call Darry, works too long and hard to be interested in a story or drawing a picture, so I’m not like them. And nobody in our gang digs movies and books the way I do. For a while there, I thought I was the only person in the world that did. So I loned it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Soda tries to understand, at least, which is more than Darry does. But then, Soda is different from anybody; he understands everything, almost. Like he’s never hollering at me all the time the way Darry is, or treating me as if I was six. I love Soda more than I’ve ever loved anyone, even Mum and Dad. He’s always happy-go-lucky and grinning, while Darry’s hard and firm and rarely grins at all. But then, Darry’s gone through a lot in his twenty years, grown up too fast. Sodapop will never grow up at all. I don’t know which way’s the best. I’ll find out one of these days.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Anyway, I went on walking home, thinking about the movie, and then suddenly wishing I had some company. Greasers can’t walk alone too much or they’ll get jumped, or someone will come by and scream “Greaser!” at them, which doesn’t make you feel too hot, if you know what I mean. We get jumped by the Socs. I’m not sure how you spell it, but it’s the abbreviation for the Socials, the jet set, the West-side rich kids. It’s like the term “greaser,” which is used to class all us boys on the East Side.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We’re poorer than the Socs and the middle class. I reckon we’re wilder, too. Not like the Socs, who jump greasers and wreck houses and throw beer blasts for kicks, and get editorials in the paper for being a public disgrace one day and an asset to society the next. Greasers are almost like hoods; we steal things and drive old souped-up cars and hold up gas stations and have a gang fight once in a while. I don’t mean I do things like that. Darry would kill me if I got into trouble with the police. Since Mum and Dad were killed in an auto&nbsp;wreck, the three of us get to stay together only as long as we behave. So Soda and I stay out of trouble as much as we can, and we’re careful not to get caught when we can’t. I only mean that most greasers do things like that, just like we wear our hair long and dress in blue jeans and T-shirts, or leave our shirttails out and wear leather jackets and tennis shoes or boots. I’m not saying that either Socs or greasers are better; that’s just the way things are.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I could have waited to go to the movies until Darry or Sodapop got off work. They would have gone with me, or driven me there, or walked along, although Soda just can’t sit still long enough to enjoy a movie and they bore Darry to death. Darry thinks his life is enough without inspecting other peoples’. Or I could have gotten one of the gang to come along, one of the four boys Darry and Soda and I have grown up with and consider family. We’re almost as close as brothers; when you grow up in a tight-knit neighborhood like ours you get to know each other real well. If I had thought about it, I could have called Darry and he would have come by on his way home and picked me up, or Two-Bit Mathews—one of our gang—would have come to get me in his car if I had asked him, but sometimes I just don’t use my head. It drives my brother Darry nuts when I do stuff like that, ’cause I’m supposed to be smart; I make good grades and have a high IQ and everything, but I don’t use my head. Besides, I like walking.</p>

          <strong>The Outsiders&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by S. E. Hinton&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When I stepped out into the bright sunlight from the darkness of the movie house, I had only two things on my mind: Paul Newman and a ride home. I was wishing I looked like Paul Newman—he looks tough and I don’t—but I guess my own looks aren’t so bad. I have light-brown, almost-red hair and greenish gray eyes. I wish they were more gray, because I hate most guys that have green eyes, but I have to be content with what I have. My hair is longer than a lot of boys wear theirs, squared off in back and long at the front and sides, but I am a greaser and most of my neighborhood rarely bothers to get a haircut. Besides, I look better with long hair.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I had a long walk home and no company, but I usually lone it anyway, for no reason except that I like to watch movies undisturbed so I can get into them and live them with the actors. When I see a movie with someone it’s kind of uncomfortable, like having someone read your book over your shoulder. I’m different that way. I mean, my second-oldest brother, Soda, who is sixteen-going on-seventeen, never cracks a book at all, and my oldest brother, Darrel, who we call Darry, works too long and hard to be interested in a story or drawing a picture, so I’m not like them. And nobody in our gang digs movies and books the way I do. For a while there, I thought I was the only person in the world that did. So I loned it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Soda tries to understand, at least, which is more than Darry does. But then, Soda is different from anybody; he understands everything, almost. Like he’s never hollering at me all the time the way Darry is, or treating me as if I was six. I love Soda more than I’ve ever loved anyone, even Mum and Dad. He’s always happy-go-lucky and grinning, while Darry’s hard and firm and rarely grins at all. But then, Darry’s gone through a lot in his twenty years, grown up too fast. Sodapop will never grow up at all. I don’t know which way’s the best. I’ll find out one of these days.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Anyway, I went on walking home, thinking about the movie, and then suddenly wishing I had some company. Greasers can’t walk alone too much or they’ll get jumped, or someone will come by and scream “Greaser!” at them, which doesn’t make you feel too hot, if you know what I mean. We get jumped by the Socs. I’m not sure how you spell it, but it’s the abbreviation for the Socials, the jet set, the West-side rich kids. It’s like the term “greaser,” which is used to class all us boys on the East Side.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We’re poorer than the Socs and the middle class. I reckon we’re wilder, too. Not like the Socs, who jump greasers and wreck houses and throw beer blasts for kicks, and get editorials in the paper for being a public disgrace one day and an asset to society the next. Greasers are almost like hoods; we steal things and drive old souped-up cars and hold up gas stations and have a gang fight once in a while. I don’t mean I do things like that. Darry would kill me if I got into trouble with the police. Since Mum and Dad were killed in an auto&nbsp;wreck, the three of us get to stay together only as long as we behave. So Soda and I stay out of trouble as much as we can, and we’re careful not to get caught when we can’t. I only mean that most greasers do things like that, just like we wear our hair long and dress in blue jeans and T-shirts, or leave our shirttails out and wear leather jackets and tennis shoes or boots. I’m not saying that either Socs or greasers are better; that’s just the way things are.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I could have waited to go to the movies until Darry or Sodapop got off work. They would have gone with me, or driven me there, or walked along, although Soda just can’t sit still long enough to enjoy a movie and they bore Darry to death. Darry thinks his life is enough without inspecting other peoples’. Or I could have gotten one of the gang to come along, one of the four boys Darry and Soda and I have grown up with and consider family. We’re almost as close as brothers; when you grow up in a tight-knit neighborhood like ours you get to know each other real well. If I had thought about it, I could have called Darry and he would have come by on his way home and picked me up, or Two-Bit Mathews—one of our gang—would have come to get me in his car if I had asked him, but sometimes I just don’t use my head. It drives my brother Darry nuts when I do stuff like that, ’cause I’m supposed to be smart; I make good grades and have a high IQ and everything, but I don’t use my head. Besides, I like walking.</p>

          <strong>The Outsiders&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by S. E. Hinton&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When I stepped out into the bright sunlight from the darkness of the movie house, I had only two things on my mind: Paul Newman and a ride home. I was wishing I looked like Paul Newman—he looks tough and I don’t—but I guess my own looks aren’t so bad. I have light-brown, almost-red hair and greenish gray eyes. I wish they were more gray, because I hate most guys that have green eyes, but I have to be content with what I have. My hair is longer than a lot of boys wear theirs, squared off in back and long at the front and sides, but I am a greaser and most of my neighborhood rarely bothers to get a haircut. Besides, I look better with long hair.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I had a long walk home and no company, but I usually lone it anyway, for no reason except that I like to watch movies undisturbed so I can get into them and live them with the actors. When I see a movie with someone it’s kind of uncomfortable, like having someone read your book over your shoulder. I’m different that way. I mean, my second-oldest brother, Soda, who is sixteen-going on-seventeen, never cracks a book at all, and my oldest brother, Darrel, who we call Darry, works too long and hard to be interested in a story or drawing a picture, so I’m not like them. And nobody in our gang digs movies and books the way I do. For a while there, I thought I was the only person in the world that did. So I loned it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Soda tries to understand, at least, which is more than Darry does. But then, Soda is different from anybody; he understands everything, almost. Like he’s never hollering at me all the time the way Darry is, or treating me as if I was six. I love Soda more than I’ve ever loved anyone, even Mum and Dad. He’s always happy-go-lucky and grinning, while Darry’s hard and firm and rarely grins at all. But then, Darry’s gone through a lot in his twenty years, grown up too fast. Sodapop will never grow up at all. I don’t know which way’s the best. I’ll find out one of these days.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Anyway, I went on walking home, thinking about the movie, and then suddenly wishing I had some company. Greasers can’t walk alone too much or they’ll get jumped, or someone will come by and scream “Greaser!” at them, which doesn’t make you feel too hot, if you know what I mean. We get jumped by the Socs. I’m not sure how you spell it, but it’s the abbreviation for the Socials, the jet set, the West-side rich kids. It’s like the term “greaser,” which is used to class all us boys on the East Side.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We’re poorer than the Socs and the middle class. I reckon we’re wilder, too. Not like the Socs, who jump greasers and wreck houses and throw beer blasts for kicks, and get editorials in the paper for being a public disgrace one day and an asset to society the next. Greasers are almost like hoods; we steal things and drive old souped-up cars and hold up gas stations and have a gang fight once in a while. I don’t mean I do things like that. Darry would kill me if I got into trouble with the police. Since Mum and Dad were killed in an auto&nbsp;wreck, the three of us get to stay together only as long as we behave. So Soda and I stay out of trouble as much as we can, and we’re careful not to get caught when we can’t. I only mean that most greasers do things like that, just like we wear our hair long and dress in blue jeans and T-shirts, or leave our shirttails out and wear leather jackets and tennis shoes or boots. I’m not saying that either Socs or greasers are better; that’s just the way things are.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I could have waited to go to the movies until Darry or Sodapop got off work. They would have gone with me, or driven me there, or walked along, although Soda just can’t sit still long enough to enjoy a movie and they bore Darry to death. Darry thinks his life is enough without inspecting other peoples’. Or I could have gotten one of the gang to come along, one of the four boys Darry and Soda and I have grown up with and consider family. We’re almost as close as brothers; when you grow up in a tight-knit neighborhood like ours you get to know each other real well. If I had thought about it, I could have called Darry and he would have come by on his way home and picked me up, or Two-Bit Mathews—one of our gang—would have come to get me in his car if I had asked him, but sometimes I just don’t use my head. It drives my brother Darry nuts when I do stuff like that, ’cause I’m supposed to be smart; I make good grades and have a high IQ and everything, but I don’t use my head. Besides, I like walking.</p>

          <strong>The Outsiders&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by S. E. Hinton&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When I stepped out into the bright sunlight from the darkness of the movie house, I had only two things on my mind: Paul Newman and a ride home. I was wishing I looked like Paul Newman—he looks tough and I don’t—but I guess my own looks aren’t so bad. I have light-brown, almost-red hair and greenish gray eyes. I wish they were more gray, because I hate most guys that have green eyes, but I have to be content with what I have. My hair is longer than a lot of boys wear theirs, squared off in back and long at the front and sides, but I am a greaser and most of my neighborhood rarely bothers to get a haircut. Besides, I look better with long hair.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I had a long walk home and no company, but I usually lone it anyway, for no reason except that I like to watch movies undisturbed so I can get into them and live them with the actors. When I see a movie with someone it’s kind of uncomfortable, like having someone read your book over your shoulder. I’m different that way. I mean, my second-oldest brother, Soda, who is sixteen-going on-seventeen, never cracks a book at all, and my oldest brother, Darrel, who we call Darry, works too long and hard to be interested in a story or drawing a picture, so I’m not like them. And nobody in our gang digs movies and books the way I do. For a while there, I thought I was the only person in the world that did. So I loned it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Soda tries to understand, at least, which is more than Darry does. But then, Soda is different from anybody; he understands everything, almost. Like he’s never hollering at me all the time the way Darry is, or treating me as if I was six. I love Soda more than I’ve ever loved anyone, even Mum and Dad. He’s always happy-go-lucky and grinning, while Darry’s hard and firm and rarely grins at all. But then, Darry’s gone through a lot in his twenty years, grown up too fast. Sodapop will never grow up at all. I don’t know which way’s the best. I’ll find out one of these days.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Anyway, I went on walking home, thinking about the movie, and then suddenly wishing I had some company. Greasers can’t walk alone too much or they’ll get jumped, or someone will come by and scream “Greaser!” at them, which doesn’t make you feel too hot, if you know what I mean. We get jumped by the Socs. I’m not sure how you spell it, but it’s the abbreviation for the Socials, the jet set, the West-side rich kids. It’s like the term “greaser,” which is used to class all us boys on the East Side.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We’re poorer than the Socs and the middle class. I reckon we’re wilder, too. Not like the Socs, who jump greasers and wreck houses and throw beer blasts for kicks, and get editorials in the paper for being a public disgrace one day and an asset to society the next. Greasers are almost like hoods; we steal things and drive old souped-up cars and hold up gas stations and have a gang fight once in a while. I don’t mean I do things like that. Darry would kill me if I got into trouble with the police. Since Mum and Dad were killed in an auto&nbsp;wreck, the three of us get to stay together only as long as we behave. So Soda and I stay out of trouble as much as we can, and we’re careful not to get caught when we can’t. I only mean that most greasers do things like that, just like we wear our hair long and dress in blue jeans and T-shirts, or leave our shirttails out and wear leather jackets and tennis shoes or boots. I’m not saying that either Socs or greasers are better; that’s just the way things are.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I could have waited to go to the movies until Darry or Sodapop got off work. They would have gone with me, or driven me there, or walked along, although Soda just can’t sit still long enough to enjoy a movie and they bore Darry to death. Darry thinks his life is enough without inspecting other peoples’. Or I could have gotten one of the gang to come along, one of the four boys Darry and Soda and I have grown up with and consider family. We’re almost as close as brothers; when you grow up in a tight-knit neighborhood like ours you get to know each other real well. If I had thought about it, I could have called Darry and he would have come by on his way home and picked me up, or Two-Bit Mathews—one of our gang—would have come to get me in his car if I had asked him, but sometimes I just don’t use my head. It drives my brother Darry nuts when I do stuff like that, ’cause I’m supposed to be smart; I make good grades and have a high IQ and everything, but I don’t use my head. Besides, I like walking.</p>

        <p>This universe has a language,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That the world we live in uses,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But it's not made of twenty-six letters,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It’s made of scars and bruises,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It doesn’t write its words on paper,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It writes upon our skin,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So many dots and dashes,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That we can’t tell where they begin,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We don’t understand this language,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That the world we live in speaks,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So we mistake its poems and proses,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As a sign of being weak,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We hate our scars and bruises,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Hide them away so no-one sees,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Instead of stating proudly,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>

            <span class="txt-underline">“Look at what the world wrote just for me”,&nbsp;</span>
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>A lot of scars and bruises,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Will slowly fade away,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But there will always be those special few,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That the world made sure would stay,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Savour these scars and bruises,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For if you wait for enough time,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You’ll find someone with faith and love,&nbsp;</p>

          <em>Read the poem below by Erin Hanson then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>This Universe&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This universe has a language,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That the world we live in uses,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But it's not made of twenty-six letters,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It’s made of scars and bruises,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It doesn’t write its words on paper,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It writes upon our skin,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So many dots and dashes,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That we can’t tell where they begin,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We don’t understand this language,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That the world we live in speaks,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So we mistake its poems and proses,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As a sign of being weak,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We hate our scars and bruises,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Hide them away so no-one sees,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Instead of stating proudly,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            <span class="txt-underline">“Look at what the world wrote just for me”,&nbsp;</span>
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>A lot of scars and bruises,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Will slowly fade away,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But there will always be those special few,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That the world made sure would stay,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Savour these scars and bruises,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For if you wait for enough time,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You’ll find someone with faith and love,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To decipher every line.</p>

          <strong>Is the Skinny Tie on the Way Out? Harry Styles Says Yes&nbsp;</strong>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For the past few years, men’s ties have gotten skinnier and skinnier. Designers suddenly decided that wide, patterned ties were too reminiscent of a slimy politician or math teacher— <strong>12 ……….</strong> Hedi Slimane is the man pretty much single-handedly responsible for the look: he introduced it during his early-’00s Dior Homme days—along with scrawny, slim-cut suits—and continued pushing it forward while at both Saint Laurent, and Celine today. <strong>13 ………. </strong>But halt the presses! The popular menswear trend may finally be on its way out—and Harry Styles is leading the charge.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Performing on The Today Show in New York City yesterday, the singer took to the stage in an extra thick polka-dot tie. Skinny tie, who? <strong>14 ………. </strong>Styles may be on to something with the go-big-or-go-home necktie: <strong>15 ……….</strong>, as seen at shows such as Off-White (it was printed with the Mona Lisa), E. Tautz (tucked into the trousers), and Prada (worn with a sweater vest). Like any trend, the pendulum often swings into the opposite direction, <strong>16 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But Styles is also a notorious style risk-taker: he may be on board with the widened silhouette, but will other Hollywood gents follow suit? <strong>17 ……….</strong> — just remember not to go too wide. But, as Styles proved this week, if you strike the balance right, it can look surprisingly fresh.</p>

        <p>For the past few years, men’s ties have gotten skinnier and skinnier. Designers suddenly decided that wide, patterned ties were too reminiscent of a slimy politician or math teacher— <strong>12 ……….</strong> Hedi Slimane is the man pretty much single-handedly responsible for the look: he introduced it during his early-’00s Dior Homme days—along with scrawny, slim-cut suits—and continued pushing it forward while at both Saint Laurent, and Celine today. <strong>13 ………. </strong>But halt the presses! The popular menswear trend may finally be on its way out—and Harry Styles is leading the charge.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Performing on The Today Show in New York City yesterday, the singer took to the stage in an extra thick polka-dot tie. Skinny tie, who? <strong>14 ………. </strong>Styles may be on to something with the go-big-or-go-home necktie: <strong>15 ……….</strong>, as seen at shows such as Off-White (it was printed with the Mona Lisa), E. Tautz (tucked into the trousers), and Prada (worn with a sweater vest). Like any trend, the pendulum often swings into the opposite direction, <strong>16 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But Styles is also a notorious style risk-taker: he may be on board with the widened silhouette, but will other Hollywood gents follow suit? <strong>17 ……….</strong> — just remember not to go too wide. But, as Styles proved this week, if you strike the balance right, it can look surprisingly fresh.</p>

          <strong>Is the Skinny Tie on the Way Out? Harry Styles Says Yes&nbsp;</strong>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For the past few years, men’s ties have gotten skinnier and skinnier. Designers suddenly decided that wide, patterned ties were too reminiscent of a slimy politician or math teacher— <strong>12 ……….</strong> Hedi Slimane is the man pretty much single-handedly responsible for the look: he introduced it during his early-’00s Dior Homme days—along with scrawny, slim-cut suits—and continued pushing it forward while at both Saint Laurent, and Celine today. <strong>13 ………. </strong>But halt the presses! The popular menswear trend may finally be on its way out—and Harry Styles is leading the charge.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Performing on The Today Show in New York City yesterday, the singer took to the stage in an extra thick polka-dot tie. Skinny tie, who? <strong>14 ………. </strong>Styles may be on to something with the go-big-or-go-home necktie: <strong>15 ……….</strong>, as seen at shows such as Off-White (it was printed with the Mona Lisa), E. Tautz (tucked into the trousers), and Prada (worn with a sweater vest). Like any trend, the pendulum often swings into the opposite direction, <strong>16 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But Styles is also a notorious style risk-taker: he may be on board with the widened silhouette, but will other Hollywood gents follow suit? <strong>17 ……….</strong> — just remember not to go too wide. But, as Styles proved this week, if you strike the balance right, it can look surprisingly fresh.</p>
