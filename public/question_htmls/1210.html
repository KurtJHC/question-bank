        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I’ve seen a lot of different therapists over the years. Some were great, some good, and some worryingly bad. When I was twenty-three, one of the great ones said to me:</p>
        <p>“Every symptom and issue you bring to me, Sarah, makes me believe that you carry trauma. I think something happened in your past that made you deeply overwhelmed and afraid, and you’re still reacting to it.”</p>
        <p>I stared at her in stunned silence. I’d had a stable upbring­ing. I’d been to a good school. I was struggling, yes, but I hadn’t been through anything&nbsp;<em>traumatic</em>.</p>
        <p>Once I regained my composure I decided I’d better set her straight. “You’ve got it totally wrong,” I told her firmly. “I don’t have trauma.”</p>
        <p>“Okay,” she said. And I pretty much left there and then.</p>
        <p>My defensive&nbsp;<em>how-dare-you</em>&nbsp;response to the therapist’s suggestion that I carried trauma was about my own denial. But it also reflects a wider cultural fear of what trauma means. Within mainstream culture, three false-truths about trauma persist. First, that trauma is a&nbsp;<em>disorder</em>. Second, that trauma only happens to an unlucky few who experience very extreme events and symptoms. Third, that trauma permanently damages us, leaving us fundamentally broken.</p>
        <p>The result of these misperceptions is, of course, that many of us are afraid of the word. We push it away, when really what we need to do is move towards it so we can better understand it.</p>
        <p>Trauma is a protective human&nbsp;<em>reaction</em>,&nbsp;not a disorder. Post-traumatic Stress&nbsp;<em>Disorder&nbsp;</em>(PTSD) is the name clinical psychologists and psychiatrists have given to high levels of trauma that are prolonged, but it’s just a name.</p>
        <p>The fact remains that trauma is a reaction, and this is true whether the reaction is more or less severe. (For some reason they lost sight of this as they labelled it in the 1970s.) This reaction can be a response to extreme events, but it can also be a response to common everyday experiences. Maybe the incident was relatively&nbsp;<em>small</em>: one we didn’t label as traumatic at the time, but as time goes on we can see the lasting effect isn’t&nbsp;<em>small&nbsp;</em>at all. To a greater or lesser extent, we’ve all expe­rienced this traumatic reaction. It’s part of being human – it unifies us. And far from leaving us fundamentally broken, understanding our own traumatic reactions can lead to our greatest transformation. As we move towards the thing we’ve been pushing away, we break free and reclaim our life.</p>
        <p>When we&nbsp;<em>don’t&nbsp;</em>recognise how traumatic experiences have affected us, we remain bound to the past and discon­nected from our true selves. We’re trapped in painful old reactions, patterns and self-limiting traumatic beliefs.</p>
        <p>Perhaps something happened that didn’t feel at all&nbsp;<em>okay</em>, but you laughed it off? Perhaps you can’t remember exactly what happened, but you just know there’s something there, something you’ve been afraid to look back at? You’re happy to admit things could be better; that you’re struggling a little, but –&nbsp;<em>trauma</em>? That just sounds too much, too serious, too something-that-happens-to-veterans.</p>
        <p>I was afraid for a long time too. My fear held me back from living a full, free, authentic life. Incredible growth is possible once we’re brave enough to consider the idea that maybe (just maybe) the difficulties we’re experiencing today are connected to our own past traumas. Once we do, and as our understanding grows, we change. We stop feeling afraid of the past. We see the patterns we’re stuck in. We see, as clear as day, how the past has affected our self-belief, thoughts, feelings, choices, even our body. We shift from confusion to clarity, and with that clarity comes freedom and growth, coupled with empowerment and thriving.</p>

        <p>My defensive&nbsp;<em>how-dare-you</em>&nbsp;response to the therapist’s suggestion that I carried trauma was about my own denial. But it also reflects a wider cultural fear of what trauma means. Within mainstream culture, three false-truths about trauma persist. First, that trauma is a&nbsp;<em>disorder</em>. Second, that trauma only happens to an unlucky few who experience very extreme events and symptoms. Third, that trauma permanently damages us, leaving us fundamentally broken.</p>
        <p>The result of these misperceptions is, of course, that many of us are afraid of the word. We push it away, when really what we need to do is move towards it so we can better understand it.</p>
        <p>Trauma is a protective human&nbsp;<em>reaction</em>,&nbsp;not a disorder. Post-traumatic Stress&nbsp;<em>Disorder&nbsp;</em>(PTSD) is the name clinical psychologists and psychiatrists have given to high levels of trauma that are prolonged, but it’s just a name.</p>
        <p>The fact remains that trauma is a reaction, and this is true whether the reaction is more or less severe. (For some reason they lost sight of this as they labelled it in the 1970s.) This reaction can be a response to extreme events, but it can also be a response to common everyday experiences. Maybe the incident was relatively&nbsp;<em>small</em>: one we didn’t label as traumatic at the time, but as time goes on we can see the lasting effect isn’t&nbsp;<em>small&nbsp;</em>at all. To a greater or lesser extent, we’ve all expe­rienced this traumatic reaction. It’s part of being human – it unifies us. And far from leaving us fundamentally broken, understanding our own traumatic reactions can lead to our greatest transformation. As we move towards the thing we’ve been pushing away, we break free and reclaim our life.</p>
        <p>When we&nbsp;<em>don’t&nbsp;</em>recognise how traumatic experiences have affected us, we remain bound to the past and discon­nected from our true selves. We’re trapped in painful old reactions, patterns and self-limiting traumatic beliefs.</p>
        <p>Perhaps something happened that didn’t feel at all&nbsp;<em>okay</em>, but you laughed it off? Perhaps you can’t remember exactly what happened, but you just know there’s something there, something you’ve been afraid to look back at? You’re happy to admit things could be better; that you’re struggling a little, but –&nbsp;<em>trauma</em>? That just sounds too much, too serious, too something-that-happens-to-veterans.</p>
        <p>I was afraid for a long time too. My fear held me back from living a full, free, authentic life. Incredible growth is possible once we’re brave enough to consider the idea that maybe (just maybe) the difficulties we’re experiencing today are connected to our own past traumas. Once we do, and as our understanding grows, we change. We stop feeling afraid of the past. We see the patterns we’re stuck in. We see, as clear as day, how the past has affected our self-belief, thoughts, feelings, choices, even our body. We shift from confusion to clarity, and with that clarity comes freedom and growth, coupled with empowerment and thriving.</p>

          <em>by Sarah Woodhouse</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I’ve seen a lot of different therapists over the years. Some were great, some good, and some worryingly bad. When I was twenty-three, one of the great ones said to me:</p>
        <p>“Every symptom and issue you bring to me, Sarah, makes me believe that you carry trauma. I think something happened in your past that made you deeply overwhelmed and afraid, and you’re still reacting to it.”</p>
        <p>I stared at her in stunned silence. I’d had a stable upbring­ing. I’d been to a good school. I was struggling, yes, but I hadn’t been through anything&nbsp;<em>traumatic</em>.</p>
        <p>Once I regained my composure I decided I’d better set her straight. “You’ve got it totally wrong,” I told her firmly. “I don’t have trauma.”</p>
        <p>“Okay,” she said. And I pretty much left there and then.</p>
        <p>My defensive&nbsp;<em>how-dare-you</em>&nbsp;response to the therapist’s suggestion that I carried trauma was about my own denial. But it also reflects a wider cultural fear of what trauma means. Within mainstream culture, three false-truths about trauma persist. First, that trauma is a&nbsp;<em>disorder</em>. Second, that trauma only happens to an unlucky few who experience very extreme events and symptoms. Third, that trauma permanently damages us, leaving us fundamentally broken.</p>
        <p>The result of these misperceptions is, of course, that many of us are afraid of the word. We push it away, when really what we need to do is move towards it so we can better understand it.</p>
        <p>Trauma is a protective human&nbsp;<em>reaction</em>,&nbsp;not a disorder. Post-traumatic Stress&nbsp;<em>Disorder&nbsp;</em>(PTSD) is the name clinical psychologists and psychiatrists have given to high levels of trauma that are prolonged, but it’s just a name.</p>
        <p>The fact remains that trauma is a reaction, and this is true whether the reaction is more or less severe. (For some reason they lost sight of this as they labelled it in the 1970s.) This reaction can be a response to extreme events, but it can also be a response to common everyday experiences. Maybe the incident was relatively&nbsp;<em>small</em>: one we didn’t label as traumatic at the time, but as time goes on we can see the lasting effect isn’t&nbsp;<em>small&nbsp;</em>at all.

          <strong>The Science of Soft Serve</strong>
        </p>
        <p>In England, they often call it Mr. Whippy. <strong>12</strong> ….….. But anywhere it's eaten, people can tell you it tastes good.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Soft serve is a classic sweet treat that has been enjoyed since the 1940s. As anyone who has ever stopped by a Mr. Whippy can attest to, although it is definitely ice cream, it's a bit different from what you might buy in a grocery store. There are several competing claims about who first invented soft serve–Tom Carvel, the&nbsp;Dairy Queen&nbsp;family and even&nbsp;Margaret Thatcher&nbsp;are all names that come up. <strong>13</strong> ….…..</p>
        <p>It shares a lot with regular ice cream<br>
In its purest form soft serve is basically just regular ice cream at a different point in its process,&nbsp;according to&nbsp;the University of Guelph. After the ice cream ingredients are mixed together, the university writes, a machine “both freezes a portion of the water and whips air into the frozen mixture.” Ice cream is between 30 and 60 per cent air–<strong>14</strong> ….….. At this point in the process, if the mixture is drawn into a cone, it's soft serve.&nbsp;<strong>15</strong> ….….. In a sense, soft serve is really just melted ice cream.</p>
        <p>The difference is (partially) in the air<br>
All ice cream is technically foam–at least that's what chemists would tell you.&nbsp;“In ice cream–liquid particles of fat–called fat globules–are spread throughout a mixture of water, sugar and ice, along with air bubbles,”&nbsp;writes&nbsp;Brian Rohrig for&nbsp;ChemMatters.&nbsp;<strong>16</strong> ….….. In soft serve,&nbsp;writes&nbsp;Vanessa Farquharson for the&nbsp;National Post,&nbsp;“all that air leaves less room for dairy fat.” &nbsp;</p>
        <p>A side effect of all this air is that soft serve is much warmer than regular ice cream, Rohrig writes.&nbsp;<strong>17</strong> ….….. while soft serve is about 21 degrees Fahrenheit. But they're both delicious.</p>

          <strong>The Science of Soft Serve</strong>
        </p>
        <p>In England, they often call it Mr. Whippy. <strong>12</strong> ….….. But anywhere it's eaten, people can tell you it tastes good.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Soft serve is a classic sweet treat that has been enjoyed since the 1940s. As anyone who has ever stopped by a Mr. Whippy can attest to, although it is definitely ice cream, it's a bit different from what you might buy in a grocery store. There are several competing claims about who first invented soft serve–Tom Carvel, the&nbsp;Dairy Queen&nbsp;family and even&nbsp;Margaret Thatcher&nbsp;are all names that come up. <strong>13</strong> ….…..</p>
        <p>It shares a lot with regular ice cream<br>
In its purest form soft serve is basically just regular ice cream at a different point in its process,&nbsp;according to&nbsp;the University of Guelph. After the ice cream ingredients are mixed together, the university writes, a machine “both freezes a portion of the water and whips air into the frozen mixture.” Ice cream is between 30 and 60 per cent air–<strong>14</strong> ….….. At this point in the process, if the mixture is drawn into a cone, it's soft serve.&nbsp;<strong>15</strong> ….….. In a sense, soft serve is really just melted ice cream.</p>
        <p>The difference is (partially) in the air<br>
All ice cream is technically foam–at least that's what chemists would tell you.&nbsp;“In ice cream–liquid particles of fat–called fat globules–are spread throughout a mixture of water, sugar and ice, along with air bubbles,”&nbsp;writes&nbsp;Brian Rohrig for&nbsp;ChemMatters.&nbsp;<strong>16</strong> ….….. In soft serve,&nbsp;writes&nbsp;Vanessa Farquharson for the&nbsp;National Post,&nbsp;“all that air leaves less room for dairy fat.” &nbsp;</p>
        <p>A side effect of all this air is that soft serve is much warmer than regular ice cream, Rohrig writes.&nbsp;<strong>17</strong> ….….. while soft serve is about 21 degrees Fahrenheit. But they're both delicious.</p>

          <strong>The Science of Soft Serve</strong>
        </p>
        <p>In England, they often call it Mr. Whippy. <strong>12</strong> ….….. But anywhere it's eaten, people can tell you it tastes good.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Soft serve is a classic sweet treat that has been enjoyed since the 1940s. As anyone who has ever stopped by a Mr. Whippy can attest to, although it is definitely ice cream, it's a bit different from what you might buy in a grocery store. There are several competing claims about who first invented soft serve–Tom Carvel, the&nbsp;Dairy Queen&nbsp;family and even&nbsp;Margaret Thatcher&nbsp;are all names that come up. <strong>13</strong> ….…..</p>
        <p>It shares a lot with regular ice cream<br>
In its purest form soft serve is basically just regular ice cream at a different point in its process,&nbsp;according to&nbsp;the University of Guelph. After the ice cream ingredients are mixed together, the university writes, a machine “both freezes a portion of the water and whips air into the frozen mixture.” Ice cream is between 30 and 60 per cent air–<strong>14</strong> ….….. At this point in the process, if the mixture is drawn into a cone, it's soft serve.&nbsp;<strong>15</strong> ….….. In a sense, soft serve is really just melted ice cream.</p>
        <p>The difference is (partially) in the air<br>
All ice cream is technically foam–at least that's what chemists would tell you.&nbsp;“In ice cream–liquid particles of fat–called fat globules–are spread throughout a mixture of water, sugar and ice, along with air bubbles,”&nbsp;writes&nbsp;Brian Rohrig for&nbsp;ChemMatters.&nbsp;<strong>16</strong> ….….. In soft serve,&nbsp;writes&nbsp;Vanessa Farquharson for the&nbsp;National Post,&nbsp;“all that air leaves less room for dairy fat.” &nbsp;</p>
        <p>A side effect of all this air is that soft serve is much warmer than regular ice cream, Rohrig writes.&nbsp;<strong>17</strong> ….….. while soft serve is about 21 degrees Fahrenheit. But they're both delicious.</p>

            <p>While it would be ideal to share a meal together each day, make it your goal to enjoy a family meal 3-4 times per week. The good news is that dinner isn’t the only opportunity -- breakfast during the week or lunch on the weekend also counts. And while a home-cooked meal is always healthiest (less fat, sodium and added sugar), it’s fine to enjoy a frozen pizza together too. What matters is that you aren’t distracted and that everyone can relax, which leads to kids being more willing to share what’s really going on in their lives.<br>

            </p>
            <p>Ideally, you’d eat together seven days a week, but I know that isn’t realistic. Your daughter has gymnastics on Mondays and your son has soccer practice on Tuesdays; then there’s swimming on Thursday, and don’t forget your book group meeting on Friday evening. With everyone’s busy schedules, sitting down together for dinner isn’t always a possibility, but this is an important one to make time for.</p>
            <p>Try to schedule a family dinner at least a few times a week, and if that doesn’t work, what about breakfast, or even snack time? Find a time for everyone to sit down together and enjoy one another’s company. Making family meals a daily habit that children look forward to helps them develop healthier attitudes about food and resist destructive weight behaviours.<br>

              <strong>Extract C</strong>
            </p>
            <p>For psychologist, Amanda Gordon, one of the main benefits of eating together is connection. “[We can] live very isolated lives, sitting in front of a desk, talking to people online or on the phone. We get very little opportunity to engage with people at a deeper level,” she says. “Connecting around food can be a very safe way of doing this, because you can eat and stop and think for a while.”</p>
            <p>Gordon says that food takes on more importance than just nutritional value when we’re eating with others. Oxford University research even goes so far as to suggest that&nbsp;people who eat socially&nbsp;feel happier and are “more satisfied with life, are more trusting of others, are more engaged with their local communities and have more friends they can depend on for support.” The same research suggests that social eating could improve self-esteem.<br>

            </p>
            <p>Studies show the effect of eating with your children is both immediate and long lasting. Gordon suggests it can also help children understand social cues. “We teach the skills that go with being part of a society when we’re sitting around a table,” she explains. “It’s a chance for parents to teach children to wait until the next person has spoken, to teach them restaurant behaviours and how to ignore distractions and focus on the conversation at hand.”</p>
            <p>Gordon says it’s also the perfect time for each family member to talk about their day, reflect on what’s happened and offer each other support. For young children, family meals have been linked to better vocabulary, according to Harvard University research. For teenagers, a lack of family meals has been linked to increased disruptive behaviour, academic problems and an increase in alcohol and drug use, according to&nbsp;recent research</p>

            <p>Ideally, you’d eat together seven days a week, but I know that isn’t realistic. Your daughter has gymnastics on Mondays and your son has soccer practice on Tuesdays; then there’s swimming on Thursday, and don’t forget your book group meeting on Friday evening. With everyone’s busy schedules, sitting down together for dinner isn’t always a possibility, but this is an important one to make time for.</p>
            <p>Try to schedule a family dinner at least a few times a week, and if that doesn’t work, what about breakfast, or even snack time? Find a time for everyone to sit down together and enjoy one another’s company. Making family meals a daily habit that children look forward to helps them develop healthier attitudes about food and resist destructive weight behaviours.<br>

            <p>Studies show the effect of eating with your children is both immediate and long lasting. Gordon suggests it can also help children understand social cues. “We teach the skills that go with being part of a society when we’re sitting around a table,” she explains. “It’s a chance for parents to teach children to wait until the next person has spoken, to teach them restaurant behaviours and how to ignore distractions and focus on the conversation at hand.”</p>
            <p>Gordon says it’s also the perfect time for each family member to talk about their day, reflect on what’s happened and offer each other support. For young children, family meals have been linked to better vocabulary, according to Harvard University research. For teenagers, a lack of family meals has been linked to increased disruptive behaviour, academic problems and an increase in alcohol and drug use, according to&nbsp;recent research</p>

            <p>Studies show the effect of eating with your children is both immediate and long lasting. Gordon suggests it can also help children understand social cues. “We teach the skills that go with being part of a society when we’re sitting around a table,” she explains. “It’s a chance for parents to teach children to wait until the next person has spoken, to teach them restaurant behaviours and how to ignore distractions and focus on the conversation at hand.”</p>
            <p>Gordon says it’s also the perfect time for each family member to talk about their day, reflect on what’s happened and offer each other support. For young children, family meals have been linked to better vocabulary, according to Harvard University research. For teenagers, a lack of family meals has been linked to increased disruptive behaviour, academic problems and an increase in alcohol and drug use, according to&nbsp;recent research</p>

            </p>
            <p>While it would be ideal to share a meal together each day, make it your goal to enjoy a family meal 3-4 times per week. The good news is that dinner isn’t the only opportunity -- breakfast during the week or lunch on the weekend also counts. And while a home-cooked meal is always healthiest (less fat, sodium and added sugar), it’s fine to enjoy a frozen pizza together too. What matters is that you aren’t distracted and that everyone can relax, which leads to kids being more willing to share what’s really going on in their lives.<br>

            </p>
            <p>Ideally, you’d eat together seven days a week, but I know that isn’t realistic. Your daughter has gymnastics on Mondays and your son has soccer practice on Tuesdays; then there’s swimming on Thursday, and don’t forget your book group meeting on Friday evening. With everyone’s busy schedules, sitting down together for dinner isn’t always a possibility, but this is an important one to make time for.</p>
            <p>Try to schedule a family dinner at least a few times a week, and if that doesn’t work, what about breakfast, or even snack time? Find a time for everyone to sit down together and enjoy one another’s company. Making family meals a daily habit that children look forward to helps them develop healthier attitudes about food and resist destructive weight behaviours.<br>

              <strong>Extract C</strong>
            </p>
            <p>For psychologist, Amanda Gordon, one of the main benefits of eating together is connection. “[We can] live very isolated lives, sitting in front of a desk, talking to people online or on the phone. We get very little opportunity to engage with people at a deeper level,” she says. “Connecting around food can be a very safe way of doing this, because you can eat and stop and think for a while.”</p>
            <p>Gordon says that food takes on more importance than just nutritional value when we’re eating with others. Oxford University research even goes so far as to suggest that&nbsp;people who eat socially&nbsp;feel happier and are “more satisfied with life, are more trusting of others, are more engaged with their local communities and have more friends they can depend on for support.” The same research suggests that social eating could improve self-esteem.<br>

              <strong>Extract A&nbsp;</strong>
            </p>
            <p>While it would be ideal to share a meal together each day, make it your goal to enjoy a family meal 3-4 times per week. The good news is that dinner isn’t the only opportunity -- breakfast during the week or lunch on the weekend also counts. And while a home-cooked meal is always healthiest (less fat, sodium and added sugar), it’s fine to enjoy a frozen pizza together too. What matters is that you aren’t distracted and that everyone can relax, which leads to kids being more willing to share what’s really going on in their lives.<br>

            <p>Ideally, you’d eat together seven days a week, but I know that isn’t realistic. Your daughter has gymnastics on Mondays and your son has soccer practice on Tuesdays; then there’s swimming on Thursday, and don’t forget your book group meeting on Friday evening. With everyone’s busy schedules, sitting down together for dinner isn’t always a possibility, but this is an important one to make time for.</p>
            <p>Try to schedule a family dinner at least a few times a week, and if that doesn’t work, what about breakfast, or even snack time? Find a time for everyone to sit down together and enjoy one another’s company. Making family meals a daily habit that children look forward to helps them develop healthier attitudes about food and resist destructive weight behaviours.<br>

              <strong>Extract C</strong>
            </p>
            <p>For psychologist, Amanda Gordon, one of the main benefits of eating together is connection. “[We can] live very isolated lives, sitting in front of a desk, talking to people online or on the phone. We get very little opportunity to engage with people at a deeper level,” she says. “Connecting around food can be a very safe way of doing this, because you can eat and stop and think for a while.”</p>
            <p>Gordon says that food takes on more importance than just nutritional value when we’re eating with others. Oxford University research even goes so far as to suggest that&nbsp;people who eat socially&nbsp;feel happier and are “more satisfied with life, are more trusting of others, are more engaged with their local communities and have more friends they can depend on for support.” The same research suggests that social eating could improve self-esteem.<br>

            <p>Studies show the effect of eating with your children is both immediate and long lasting. Gordon suggests it can also help children understand social cues. “We teach the skills that go with being part of a society when we’re sitting around a table,” she explains. “It’s a chance for parents to teach children to wait until the next person has spoken, to teach them restaurant behaviours and how to ignore distractions and focus on the conversation at hand.”</p>
            <p>Gordon says it’s also the perfect time for each family member to talk about their day, reflect on what’s happened and offer each other support. For young children, family meals have been linked to better vocabulary, according to Harvard University research. For teenagers, a lack of family meals has been linked to increased disruptive behaviour, academic problems and an increase in alcohol and drug use, according to&nbsp;recent research</p>
