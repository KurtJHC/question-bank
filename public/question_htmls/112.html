          <em>May 21</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is coming closer. Today it was almost on top of the ridge, though not quite, because when I looked with the binoculars, I could not see the flame, but still only the smoke — rising very fast, not far above the fire. I know where it is: at the crossroads. Just on the other side of the ridge, the east-west highway, the Dean Town Road, crosses our road. It is Route Number 9, a state highway, bigger than our road, which is County Road 793. He has stopped there and is deciding whether to follow Number 9 or come over the ridge. I say <em>he</em> because that is what I think of, though it could be <em>they</em> or even <em>she</em>. But I think it is he. If he decides to follow the highway, he will go away, and everything will be all right again. Why would he come back? But if he comes to the top of the ridge, he is sure to come down here, because he will see the green leaves. On the other side of the ridge, even on the other side of Burden Hill, there are no leaves; everything is dead.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are some things I need to explain. One is why I am afraid. Another is why I am writing in this composition book, which I got from Klein's store a mile up the road. I took the book and a supply of ball-point pens back in February. By then the last radio station, a very faint one that I could only hear at night had stopped broadcasting. It had been dead for about three or four months. I say <em>about</em>, and that is one reason I got the book: because I discovered I was forgetting when things happened, and sometimes even <em>whether</em> things happened or not. Another reason I got it is that I thought writing in it might be like having someone to talk to, and if I read it back later it would be&nbsp;like someone talking to me. But the truth is I haven't written in it much after all, because there isn't much to write about.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sometimes I would put in what the weather was like, if there was a storm or something unusual. I put in when I planted the garden because I thought that would be useful to know next year. But most of the time I didn't write, because one day was just like the day before, and sometimes I thought — what's the use of writing anyway, when nobody is ever going to read it? Then I would remind myself: sometime, years from now, <em>you’re</em> going to read it. I was pretty sure I was the only person left in the world. But now I have something to write about. I was wrong. I am not the only person left in the world. I am both excited and afraid.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At first when all the others went away, I hated being alone, and I watched the road all day and most of the night hoping that a car, <em>anybody</em>, would come over the hill from either direction. When I slept, I would dream that one came and drove on past without knowing I was here; then I would wake up and run to the road looking for the taillight disappearing. Then the weeks went by and the radio stations went off, one by one. When the last one went off and stayed off, it came to me, finally, that nobody, no car, was ever going to come. Of course I thought it was the batteries in my radio that had run down, so I got new batteries from the store. I tried them in the flashlight and it lit, so I knew it was really the station. Anyway, the man on the last radio station had said he was going to have to go off; there wasn't any more power. He kept repeating his latitude and longitude, though he was not on a ship, he was on land — somewhere near Boston, Massachusetts. He said some other things, too, that I did not like to hear. And that started me thinking. Suppose a car came over the hill, and I ran out, and whoever was in it got out — suppose he was crazy? Or suppose it was someone mean, or even cruel, and brutal? A murderer? What could I do? The fact is, the man on the radio, toward the end, sounded crazy. He was afraid; there were only a few people left where he was and not much food. He said that men should act with dignity even in the face of death, which no one was better off than any other. He pleaded on the radio, and I knew something terrible was happening there. Once he broke down and cried on the radio.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So I decided: if anyone does come, I want to see who it is before I show myself. It is one thing to hope for someone to come when things are civilised, when there are other people around, too. But when there is nobody else, then the whole idea changes. This is what I gradually realised. There are worse things than being alone. It was after I thought about that, that I began moving my things to the cave.</p>

        <p>
          <em>May 21</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is coming closer. Today it was almost on top of the ridge, though not quite, because when I looked with the binoculars, I could not see the flame, but still only the smoke — rising very fast, not far above the fire. I know where it is: at the crossroads. Just on the other side of the ridge, the east-west highway, the Dean Town Road, crosses our road. It is Route Number 9, a state highway, bigger than our road, which is County Road 793. He has stopped there and is deciding whether to follow Number 9 or come over the ridge. I say <em>he</em> because that is what I think of, though it could be <em>they</em> or even <em>she</em>. But I think it is he. If he decides to follow the highway, he will go away, and everything will be all right again. Why would he come back? But if he comes to the top of the ridge, he is sure to come down here, because he will see the green leaves. On the other side of the ridge, even on the other side of Burden Hill, there are no leaves; everything is dead.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are some things I need to explain. One is why I am afraid. Another is why I am writing in this composition book, which I got from Klein's store a mile up the road. I took the book and a supply of ball-point pens back in February. By then the last radio station, a very faint one that I could only hear at night had stopped broadcasting. It had been dead for about three or four months. I say <em>about</em>, and that is one reason I got the book: because I discovered I was forgetting when things happened, and sometimes even <em>whether</em> things happened or not. Another reason I got it is that I thought writing in it might be like having someone to talk to, and if I read it back later it would be&nbsp;like someone talking to me. But the truth is I haven't written in it much after all, because there isn't much to write about.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sometimes I would put in what the weather was like, if there was a storm or something unusual. I put in when I planted the garden because I thought that would be useful to know next year. But most of the time I didn't write, because one day was just like the day before, and sometimes I thought — what's the use of writing anyway, when nobody is ever going to read it? Then I would remind myself: sometime, years from now, <em>you’re</em> going to read it. I was pretty sure I was the only person left in the world. But now I have something to write about. I was wrong. I am not the only person left in the world. I am both excited and afraid.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At first when all the others went away, I hated being alone, and I watched the road all day and most of the night hoping that a car, <em>anybody</em>, would come over the hill from either direction. When I slept, I would dream that one came and drove on past without knowing I was here; then I would wake up and run to the road looking for the taillight disappearing. Then the weeks went by and the radio stations went off, one by one. When the last one went off and stayed off, it came to me, finally, that nobody, no car, was ever going to come. Of course I thought it was the batteries in my radio that had run down, so I got new batteries from the store. I tried them in the flashlight and it lit, so I knew it was really the station. Anyway, the man on the last radio station had said he was going to have to go off; there wasn't any more power. He kept repeating his latitude and longitude, though he was not on a ship, he was on land — somewhere near Boston, Massachusetts. He said some other things, too, that I did not like to hear. And that started me thinking. Suppose a car came over the hill, and I ran out, and whoever was in it got out — suppose he was crazy? Or suppose it was someone mean, or even cruel, and brutal? A murderer? What could I do? The fact is, the man on the radio, toward the end, sounded crazy. He was afraid; there were only a few people left where he was and not much food. He said that men should act with dignity even in the face of death, which no one was better off than any other. He pleaded on the radio, and I knew something terrible was happening there. Once he broke down and cried on the radio.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So I decided: if anyone does come, I want to see who it is before I show myself. It is one thing to hope for someone to come when things are civilised, when there are other people around, too. But when there is nobody else, then the whole idea changes. This is what I gradually realised. There are worse things than being alone. It was after I thought about that, that I began moving my things to the cave.</p>

          <strong>Z for Zachariah</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>May 21</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is coming closer. Today it was almost on top of the ridge, though not quite, because when I looked with the binoculars, I could not see the flame, but still only the smoke — rising very fast, not far above the fire. I know where it is: at the crossroads. Just on the other side of the ridge, the east-west highway, the Dean Town Road, crosses our road. It is Route Number 9, a state highway, bigger than our road, which is County Road 793. He has stopped there and is deciding whether to follow Number 9 or come over the ridge. I say <em>he</em> because that is what I think of, though it could be <em>they</em> or even <em>she</em>. But I think it is he. If he decides to follow the highway, he will go away, and everything will be all right again. Why would he come back? But if he comes to the top of the ridge, he is sure to come down here, because he will see the green leaves. On the other side of the ridge, even on the other side of Burden Hill, there are no leaves; everything is dead.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are some things I need to explain. One is why I am afraid. Another is why I am writing in this composition book, which I got from Klein's store a mile up the road. I took the book and a supply of ball-point pens back in February. By then the last radio station, a very faint one that I could only hear at night had stopped broadcasting. It had been dead for about three or four months. I say <em>about</em>, and that is one reason I got the book: because I discovered I was forgetting when things happened, and sometimes even <em>whether</em> things happened or not. Another reason I got it is that I thought writing in it might be like having someone to talk to, and if I read it back later it would be&nbsp;like someone talking to me. But the truth is I haven't written in it much after all, because there isn't much to write about.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sometimes I would put in what the weather was like, if there was a storm or something unusual. I put in when I planted the garden because I thought that would be useful to know next year. But most of the time I didn't write, because one day was just like the day before, and sometimes I thought — what's the use of writing anyway, when nobody is ever going to read it? Then I would remind myself: sometime, years from now, <em>you’re</em> going to read it. I was pretty sure I was the only person left in the world. But now I have something to write about. I was wrong. I am not the only person left in the world. I am both excited and afraid.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At first when all the others went away, I hated being alone, and I watched the road all day and most of the night hoping that a car, <em>anybody</em>, would come over the hill from either direction. When I slept, I would dream that one came and drove on past without knowing I was here; then I would wake up and run to the road looking for the taillight disappearing. Then the weeks went by and the radio stations went off, one by one. When the last one went off and stayed off, it came to me, finally, that nobody, no car, was ever going to come. Of course I thought it was the batteries in my radio that had run down, so I got new batteries from the store. I tried them in the flashlight and it lit, so I knew it was really the station. Anyway, the man on the last radio station had said he was going to have to go off; there wasn't any more power. He kept repeating his latitude and longitude, though he was not on a ship, he was on land — somewhere near Boston, Massachusetts. He said some other things, too, that I did not like to hear. And that started me thinking. Suppose a car came over the hill, and I ran out, and whoever was in it got out — suppose he was crazy? Or suppose it was someone mean, or even cruel, and brutal? A murderer? What could I do? The fact is, the man on the radio, toward the end, sounded crazy. He was afraid; there were only a few people left where he was and not much food. He said that men should act with dignity even in the face of death, which no one was better off than any other. He pleaded on the radio, and I knew something terrible was happening there. Once he broke down and cried on the radio.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So I decided: if anyone does come, I want to see who it is before I show myself. It is one thing to hope for someone to come when things are civilised, when there are other people around, too. But when there is nobody else, then the whole idea changes. This is what I gradually realised. There are worse things than being alone. It was after I thought about that, that I began moving my things to the cave.</p>

When he played tag at recess, he pretended he was a fierce dragon chasing princes and princesses. When he drank from the water fountain, he pretended he was a thirsty dragon drinking hot melted rock from a volcano. But in school Cameron’s class never talked about dragons. So far this year they had looked at polar bears and plants and prairie dogs, but not dragons. This week they were learning about dinosaurs and everyone had chosen a favourite one to dress up as, for a dinosaur parade. Everyone, except Cameron. He liked dinosaurs well enough, but he’d much rather be a dragon.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the other kids cut and painted and pasted, Cameron walked around the classroom, pretending he was breathing fire. His friend Cherry showed him her Stegosaurus costume. “See these sharp spines at the end of my tail?” she asked Cameron. “Stegosauruses used these for self-defence.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cameron wasn’t impressed.<sup>1 </sup>“Dragons breathe fire for self-defence,” he told her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Look at me,” Amy said as she painted an old pair of cloth shoes to match the rest of her costume. “I’m Dromiceiomimus and I can run faster than any other dinosaur.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Dragons don’t have to run, they can fly!” Cameron answered.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Calvin was dressing up as Triceratops. “I’ve got three horns,” he bragged, “and I’m as long as this classroom!”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Dragons are as long as the whole school,” replied Cameron.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Well, what about Diplodocus?” asked Mike. “It was big, too, and it used its long tail like a whip.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cameron shrugged.<sup>2</sup> “Dragons don’t need any whips. They’re not afraid of anything.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“But dragons aren’t real,” said Calvin, fixing one of the horns on his costume. “And dinosaurs were. You’d better hurry up and choose which dinosaur you’re going to be.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cameron shoved his hands deep into his pockets and walked away talking to himself. “Grrrrrr!” he growled. “I’m a monster dragon and I eat dinosaurs for dinner.” He bumped right into his teacher.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Hey, Cameron,” she said. “I bet you didn’t know that not everyone thought dragons were monsters. Long ago in China, a dragon was the sign of a king.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Really?” Cameron was surprised.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Really,” said his teacher.</p>
        <p>Cameron suddenly had an idea. He remembered something about kings and dinosaurs. “I’ve got it!” he shouted. “I know what kind of dinosaur I can be.”</p>
        <p>And with the he busily set to work on his costume.</p>
        <p>The next day was the day of the dinosaur parade. The whole class lined up in their costumes. Stegosaurus came first, then Dromiceiomimus and Triceratops and Diplodocus. So many dinosaurs!</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At the end of the line stood Cameron. He didn’t have wings like a dragon and he didn’t breathe fire like a dragon, but he was as kingly as a dragon. He was … king of the dinosaurs.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cameron shoved his hands deep into his pockets and walked away talking to himself. “Grrrrrr!” he growled. “I’m a monster dragon and I eat dinosaurs for dinner.” He bumped right into his teacher.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Hey, Cameron,” she said. “I bet you didn’t know that not everyone thought dragons were monsters. Long ago in China, a dragon was the sign of a king.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Really?” Cameron was surprised.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Really,” said his teacher.</p>
        <p>Cameron suddenly had an idea. He remembered something about kings and dinosaurs. “I’ve got it!” he shouted. “I know what kind of dinosaur I can be.”</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cameron liked dragons. He thought about them all the time. When he rode the bus to school, he pretended he was a huge dragon flying down the street. When he played tag at recess, he pretended he was a fierce dragon chasing princes and princesses. When he drank from the water fountain, he pretended he was a thirsty dragon drinking hot melted rock from a volcano. But in school Cameron’s class never talked about dragons. So far this year they had looked at polar bears and plants and prairie dogs, but not dragons. This week they were learning about dinosaurs and everyone had chosen a favourite one to dress up as, for a dinosaur parade. Everyone, except Cameron. He liked dinosaurs well enough, but he’d much rather be a dragon.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the other kids cut and painted and pasted, Cameron walked around the classroom, pretending he was breathing fire. His friend Cherry showed him her Stegosaurus costume. “See these sharp spines at the end of my tail?” she asked Cameron. “Stegosauruses used these for self-defence.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cameron wasn’t impressed.<sup>1 </sup>“Dragons breathe fire for self-defence,” he told her.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Look at me,” Amy said as she painted an old pair of cloth shoes to match the rest of her costume. “I’m Dromiceiomimus and I can run faster than any other dinosaur.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Dragons don’t have to run, they can fly!” Cameron answered.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Calvin was dressing up as Triceratops. “I’ve got three horns,” he bragged, “and I’m as long as this classroom!”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Dragons are as long as the whole school,” replied Cameron.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Well, what about Diplodocus?” asked Mike. “It was big, too, and it used its long tail like a whip.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cameron shrugged.<sup>2</sup> “Dragons don’t need any whips. They’re not afraid of anything.”</p>
