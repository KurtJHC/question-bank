        <p>Taj Mahal, the magnificent monument that stands at the heart of India, has a story that has been melting the hearts of millions of listeners since the time Taj Mahal has been visible. It is a story, that although ending back in 1631, continues to live on in the concrete form of Taj Mahal and is considered a living example of eternal love. <strong>15 ………. </strong>These two people from the course of history have set an example for the people living in the present and the future. As the poet, Edwin Arnold describes it, "Not a piece of architecture, as other buildings are, but the proud passion of an emperor's love wrought in living stones." The story that follows next will prove why that statement is true.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Shah Jahan, initially named Prince Khurram, was born in the year 1592. He was the son of Jehangir, the fourth Mughal emperor of India and the grandson of Akbar the Great. In 1607, Shah Jahan strolled down the Meena Bazaar, accompanied by a string of fawning courtiers. <strong>16 ……….</strong> It was love at first sight and the girl was Mumtaz Mahal, who was known as Arjumand Banu Begum at that time. At that time, he was 14 years old and she, a Muslim Persian princess, was 15. After meeting her, Shah Jahan went back to his father and declared that he wanted to marry her. The match was solemnised five years later i.e., in the year 1612.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was in the year 1628 that Shah Jahan became the Emperor and he entrusted Arjumand Banu with the royal seal. <strong>17 ………. </strong>Though Shah Jahan also had other wives, Mumtaz Mahal was his favourite and accompanied him everywhere, even on military campaigns. In the year 1631, when Mumtaz Mahal was giving birth to their 14th child, she died due to some complications. While Mumtaz was on her deathbed, Shah Jahan promised her that he would never remarry and would build the richest mausoleum over her grave.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It is said that Shah Jahan was so heartbroken after her death that he ordered the court into mourning for two years. Sometime after her death, Shah Jahan undertook the task of creating the world's most beautiful monument in the memory of his beloved. It took 22 years and the labour of 22,000 workers to construct the monument. <strong>18 ………. </strong>This magnificent monument came to be known as "Taj Mahal" and now counts amongst the Seven Wonders of the World. It is the true story of the Taj Mahal of India which has mesmerised many people with its bewitching beauty</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Shah Jahan was wealthy enough to support the Taj Mahal and its mighty maintenance costs. However, over the centuries, the Mughal Empire lost its riches and the Taj Mahal fell into ruins. By the 1800s, the British ousted the Mughals and took over India. The Taj Mahal was dissected for its beauty—the British cut gemstones from its walls, stole silver candlesticks and doors, and even tried to sell the white marble overseas. <strong>19 ……….</strong> Rather than looting the Taj Mahal, Curzon worked to restore it.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Taj Mahal has once again become a magnificent place with 2.5 million visitors each year. <strong>20 ………. </strong>Once a month, visitors also have the opportunity to make a short visit during a full moon to see how the Taj Mahal seems to glow from the inside out in the moonlight. The Taj Mahal was placed on the World Heritage List by UNESCO in 1983, but this protection has not guaranteed its safety. It is now at the mercy of pollutants from nearby factories and excessive humidity from the breath of its visitors.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Taj Mahal, the magnificent monument that stands at the heart of India, has a story that has been melting the hearts of millions of listeners since the time Taj Mahal has been visible. It is a story, that although ending back in 1631, continues to live on in the concrete form of Taj Mahal and is considered a living example of eternal love. <strong>15 ………. </strong>These two people from the course of history have set an example for the people living in the present and the future. As the poet, Edwin Arnold describes it, "Not a piece of architecture, as other buildings are, but the proud passion of an emperor's love wrought in living stones." The story that follows next will prove why that statement is true.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Shah Jahan, initially named Prince Khurram, was born in the year 1592. He was the son of Jehangir, the fourth Mughal emperor of India and the grandson of Akbar the Great. In 1607, Shah Jahan strolled down the Meena Bazaar, accompanied by a string of fawning courtiers. <strong>16 ……….</strong> It was love at first sight and the girl was Mumtaz Mahal, who was known as Arjumand Banu Begum at that time. At that time, he was 14 years old and she, a Muslim Persian princess, was 15. After meeting her, Shah Jahan went back to his father and declared that he wanted to marry her. The match was solemnised five years later i.e., in the year 1612.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was in the year 1628 that Shah Jahan became the Emperor and he entrusted Arjumand Banu with the royal seal. <strong>17 ………. </strong>Though Shah Jahan also had other wives, Mumtaz Mahal was his favourite and accompanied him everywhere, even on military campaigns. In the year 1631, when Mumtaz Mahal was giving birth to their 14th child, she died due to some complications. While Mumtaz was on her deathbed, Shah Jahan promised her that he would never remarry and would build the richest mausoleum over her grave.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It is said that Shah Jahan was so heartbroken after her death that he ordered the court into mourning for two years. Sometime after her death, Shah Jahan undertook the task of creating the world's most beautiful monument in the memory of his beloved. It took 22 years and the labour of 22,000 workers to construct the monument. <strong>18 ………. </strong>This magnificent monument came to be known as "Taj Mahal" and now counts amongst the Seven Wonders of the World. It is the true story of the Taj Mahal of India which has mesmerised many people with its bewitching beauty</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Shah Jahan was wealthy enough to support the Taj Mahal and its mighty maintenance costs. However, over the centuries, the Mughal Empire lost its riches and the Taj Mahal fell into ruins. By the 1800s, the British ousted the Mughals and took over India. The Taj Mahal was dissected for its beauty—the British cut gemstones from its walls, stole silver candlesticks and doors, and even tried to sell the white marble overseas. <strong>19 ……….</strong> Rather than looting the Taj Mahal, Curzon worked to restore it.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Taj Mahal has once again become a magnificent place with 2.5 million visitors each year. <strong>20 ………. </strong>Once a month, visitors also have the opportunity to make a short visit during a full moon to see how the Taj Mahal seems to glow from the inside out in the moonlight. The Taj Mahal was placed on the World Heritage List by UNESCO in 1983, but this protection has not guaranteed its safety. It is now at the mercy of pollutants from nearby factories and excessive humidity from the breath of its visitors.</p>

Mark Twain said that “Humour is the great thing, the saving thing after all. The minute it crops up, all our hardnesses yield, all our irritations, and resentments flit away and a sunny spirit takes their place.”<br>
<br>
He is certainly not wrong. Humour may very well be the great thing. It touches upon nearly every facet of life — 90 percent of men and 81 percent of women report that a sense of humour is the most important quality in a partner, it’s a crucial quality for leaders and it’s even been shown to improve cancer treatments.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Humour doesn’t just guard against depression. It also improves people’s overall quality of life. Researchers have found that people who score highly in certain types of humour have better self-esteem, more positive affect, greater self-competency, more control over anxiety and better performance in social interactions.<br>
<br>
In addition to working as a mental immune system, research has shown that humour can actually improve your physical immune system.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Laughter can also improve cardiovascular health and lowers heart rates, blood pressure, and muscular tension. Aside from improving your health, laughter can also lead to greater creativity and a productivity tool as well. This is because laughter lights up the anterior cingulate cortex, an area of the brain associated with attention and decision-making.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There’s no doubt that humour is a life skill that everybody needs, but how do we define it? Can it be taught? The jury is still out on those issues.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
A colleague accused me of having a tendency to over-react, so I have no choice but to burn down his house and wish him only bad luck. Fair’s fair, right? I learned to respond strongly to things from a former boss who used to say the following sentence at least once a day: “Some fool has moved my (random object) and when I find out who did it, God help me, I am going to tear this place down… oh, there it is.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Some people think overreacting is a bad thing but look at the evidence. The richest country in the world is the United States, from which a reader has just sent me a video of a man riding a moped pursued by 12 police cars. A moped, for those who don’t know, is a motorbike powered by an engine with the strength of a mosquito suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But just days later, the US record on maximum overreaction was beaten by a news report sent to me by a reader in Canada. Twelve police squad cars and a tactical attack squad were sent to a block of flats in Winnipeg, Ontario, after an unknown person slammed a door in the building.<br>
<br>
This makes me want to live in Canada. I’ve lived in places where the police don’t even react to murders unless they happen at the actual police station, and even then, the only reaction is an irritated desk sergeant looking up from Candy Crush and raising an eyebrow.&nbsp;<br>

Learning how to be funny is an essential people skill. Most people don’t realise you can learn how to be funny. In fact, I want to convince you that the funniest people hone their witty craft. And being funny matters.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
You’ll be more successful if you know how to make people laugh … but only the good kind of laugh, not the awkward kind: So, this is how you do it. Give the opposite answer to yes/no questions. Play with Numbers e.g. only 2000 people at the small party. Use The Rule of 3, that establishes a pattern, then ends with something unexpected. Use a Character Switch e.g. if you meet a bear in the woods, scary for the bear! Use “Whatever” as Your Secret Weapon. Use real-life stories, not jokes. Delay the funny. Now, I am going to end on something you know: practise makes perfect.<br>

Hey, you don't read this book. Do NOT read this book. Just shut it quietly and put it back where you found it. Look, bozo, I'm not kidding. What is there about the last sentence that you don't understand? Are you being rude or are you just really, really stupid? Can you even read? Let me try it one more time: Shut this book and put it back right now. I see we have an extremely difficult customer here. Take my advice, shut this book and put it back on the shelf. It's for your own good. There are BAD things in this book. REALLY BAD things. Not convinced? Then I'm going to have to list some of the things in this book. Don't blame me if it upsets you. It's not my fault; I warned you. VIOLENCE. Yep. There's blood in this book. Red stuff. It's nasty. It's yucky. It's downright gory. SAD THINGS. I'm talking about accidents, people going insane, even dying. We take no responsibility for any deeply traumatic condition that may yuck up your life if you are stupid enough to read this book despite the loads and loads of warnings telling you not to. Good grief! You really are a pest, aren't you? Well, this is your final chance. Put the book down quietly and go away.<br>

Mark Twain said that “Humour is the great thing, the saving thing after all. The minute it crops up, all our hardnesses yield, all our irritations, and resentments flit away and a sunny spirit takes their place.”<br>
<br>
He is certainly not wrong. Humour may very well be the great thing. It touches upon nearly every facet of life — 90 percent of men and 81 percent of women report that a sense of humour is the most important quality in a partner, it’s a crucial quality for leaders and it’s even been shown to improve cancer treatments.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Humour doesn’t just guard against depression. It also improves people’s overall quality of life. Researchers have found that people who score highly in certain types of humour have better self-esteem, more positive affect, greater self-competency, more control over anxiety and better performance in social interactions.<br>
<br>
In addition to working as a mental immune system, research has shown that humour can actually improve your physical immune system.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Laughter can also improve cardiovascular health and lowers heart rates, blood pressure, and muscular tension. Aside from improving your health, laughter can also lead to greater creativity and a productivity tool as well. This is because laughter lights up the anterior cingulate cortex, an area of the brain associated with attention and decision-making.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There’s no doubt that humour is a life skill that everybody needs, but how do we define it? Can it be taught? The jury is still out on those issues.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
A colleague accused me of having a tendency to over-react, so I have no choice but to burn down his house and wish him only bad luck. Fair’s fair, right? I learned to respond strongly to things from a former boss who used to say the following sentence at least once a day: “Some fool has moved my (random object) and when I find out who did it, God help me, I am going to tear this place down… oh, there it is.”&nbsp;<br>

This makes me want to live in Canada. I’ve lived in places where the police don’t even react to murders unless they happen at the actual police station, and even then, the only reaction is an irritated desk sergeant looking up from Candy Crush and raising an eyebrow.&nbsp;<br>

Learning how to be funny is an essential people skill. Most people don’t realise you can learn how to be funny. In fact, I want to convince you that the funniest people hone their witty craft. And being funny matters.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
You’ll be more successful if you know how to make people laugh … but only the good kind of laugh, not the awkward kind: So, this is how you do it. Give the opposite answer to yes/no questions. Play with Numbers e.g. only 2000 people at the small party. Use The Rule of 3, that establishes a pattern, then ends with something unexpected. Use a Character Switch e.g. if you meet a bear in the woods, scary for the bear! Use “Whatever” as Your Secret Weapon. Use real-life stories, not jokes. Delay the funny. Now, I am going to end on something you know: practise makes perfect.<br>

Hey, you don't read this book. Do NOT read this book. Just shut it quietly and put it back where you found it. Look, bozo, I'm not kidding. What is there about the last sentence that you don't understand? Are you being rude or are you just really, really stupid? Can you even read? Let me try it one more time: Shut this book and put it back right now. I see we have an extremely difficult customer here. Take my advice, shut this book and put it back on the shelf. It's for your own good. There are BAD things in this book. REALLY BAD things. Not convinced? Then I'm going to have to list some of the things in this book. Don't blame me if it upsets you. It's not my fault; I warned you. VIOLENCE. Yep. There's blood in this book. Red stuff. It's nasty. It's yucky. It's downright gory. SAD THINGS. I'm talking about accidents, people going insane, even dying. We take no responsibility for any deeply traumatic condition that may yuck up your life if you are stupid enough to read this book despite the loads and loads of warnings telling you not to. Good grief! You really are a pest, aren't you? Well, this is your final chance. Put the book down quietly and go away.<br>

Mark Twain said that “Humour is the great thing, the saving thing after all. The minute it crops up, all our hardnesses yield, all our irritations, and resentments flit away and a sunny spirit takes their place.”<br>
<br>
He is certainly not wrong. Humour may very well be the great thing. It touches upon nearly every facet of life — 90 percent of men and 81 percent of women report that a sense of humour is the most important quality in a partner, it’s a crucial quality for leaders and it’s even been shown to improve cancer treatments.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Humour doesn’t just guard against depression. It also improves people’s overall quality of life. Researchers have found that people who score highly in certain types of humour have better self-esteem, more positive affect, greater self-competency, more control over anxiety and better performance in social interactions.<br>
<br>
In addition to working as a mental immune system, research has shown that humour can actually improve your physical immune system.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Laughter can also improve cardiovascular health and lowers heart rates, blood pressure, and muscular tension. Aside from improving your health, laughter can also lead to greater creativity and a productivity tool as well. This is because laughter lights up the anterior cingulate cortex, an area of the brain associated with attention and decision-making.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There’s no doubt that humour is a life skill that everybody needs, but how do we define it? Can it be taught? The jury is still out on those issues.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
A colleague accused me of having a tendency to over-react, so I have no choice but to burn down his house and wish him only bad luck. Fair’s fair, right? I learned to respond strongly to things from a former boss who used to say the following sentence at least once a day: “Some fool has moved my (random object) and when I find out who did it, God help me, I am going to tear this place down… oh, there it is.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Some people think overreacting is a bad thing but look at the evidence. The richest country in the world is the United States, from which a reader has just sent me a video of a man riding a moped pursued by 12 police cars. A moped, for those who don’t know, is a motorbike powered by an engine with the strength of a mosquito suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome.&nbsp;<br>

You’ll be more successful if you know how to make people laugh … but only the good kind of laugh, not the awkward kind: So, this is how you do it. Give the opposite answer to yes/no questions. Play with Numbers e.g. only 2000 people at the small party. Use The Rule of 3, that establishes a pattern, then ends with something unexpected. Use a Character Switch e.g. if you meet a bear in the woods, scary for the bear! Use “Whatever” as Your Secret Weapon. Use real-life stories, not jokes. Delay the funny. Now, I am going to end on something you know: practise makes perfect.<br>

Hey, you don't read this book. Do NOT read this book. Just shut it quietly and put it back where you found it. Look, bozo, I'm not kidding. What is there about the last sentence that you don't understand? Are you being rude or are you just really, really stupid? Can you even read? Let me try it one more time: Shut this book and put it back right now. I see we have an extremely difficult customer here. Take my advice, shut this book and put it back on the shelf. It's for your own good. There are BAD things in this book. REALLY BAD things. Not convinced? Then I'm going to have to list some of the things in this book. Don't blame me if it upsets you. It's not my fault; I warned you. VIOLENCE. Yep. There's blood in this book. Red stuff. It's nasty. It's yucky. It's downright gory. SAD THINGS. I'm talking about accidents, people going insane, even dying. We take no responsibility for any deeply traumatic condition that may yuck up your life if you are stupid enough to read this book despite the loads and loads of warnings telling you not to. Good grief! You really are a pest, aren't you? Well, this is your final chance. Put the book down quietly and go away.<br>

Mark Twain said that “Humour is the great thing, the saving thing after all. The minute it crops up, all our hardnesses yield, all our irritations, and resentments flit away and a sunny spirit takes their place.”<br>
<br>
He is certainly not wrong. Humour may very well be the great thing. It touches upon nearly every facet of life — 90 percent of men and 81 percent of women report that a sense of humour is the most important quality in a partner, it’s a crucial quality for leaders and it’s even been shown to improve cancer treatments.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Humour doesn’t just guard against depression. It also improves people’s overall quality of life. Researchers have found that people who score highly in certain types of humour have better self-esteem, more positive affect, greater self-competency, more control over anxiety and better performance in social interactions.<br>
<br>
In addition to working as a mental immune system, research has shown that humour can actually improve your physical immune system.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Laughter can also improve cardiovascular health and lowers heart rates, blood pressure, and muscular tension. Aside from improving your health, laughter can also lead to greater creativity and a productivity tool as well. This is because laughter lights up the anterior cingulate cortex, an area of the brain associated with attention and decision-making.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There’s no doubt that humour is a life skill that everybody needs, but how do we define it? Can it be taught? The jury is still out on those issues.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
A colleague accused me of having a tendency to over-react, so I have no choice but to burn down his house and wish him only bad luck. Fair’s fair, right? I learned to respond strongly to things from a former boss who used to say the following sentence at least once a day: “Some fool has moved my (random object) and when I find out who did it, God help me, I am going to tear this place down… oh, there it is.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Some people think overreacting is a bad thing but look at the evidence. The richest country in the world is the United States, from which a reader has just sent me a video of a man riding a moped pursued by 12 police cars. A moped, for those who don’t know, is a motorbike powered by an engine with the strength of a mosquito suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But just days later, the US record on maximum overreaction was beaten by a news report sent to me by a reader in Canada. Twelve police squad cars and a tactical attack squad were sent to a block of flats in Winnipeg, Ontario, after an unknown person slammed a door in the building.<br>
<br>
This makes me want to live in Canada. I’ve lived in places where the police don’t even react to murders unless they happen at the actual police station, and even then, the only reaction is an irritated desk sergeant looking up from Candy Crush and raising an eyebrow.&nbsp;<br>

        <p>At the end of each term, Mr Chen gives scores in reading and writing to each student in his English class. These two scores are then added together to give an overall score in English for the term (for example, a student with scores of 30 in reading and 40 in writing would have an overall score of 70 in English). Last term, Sara and Mila got the same overall score in English.</p>
