Only in sleep I see their faces,<br>
Children I played with when I was a child,<br>
Louise comes back with her brown hair braided,<br>
Annie with ringlets warm and wild.</p>
        <p>Only in sleep Time is forgotten --<br>
What may have come to them, who can know?<br>
Yet we played last night as long ago,<br>
And the doll-house stood at the turn of the stair.</p>
        <p>The years had not sharpened their smooth round faces,<br>
I met their eyes and found them mild --<br>
Do they, too, dream of me, I wonder,<br>
And for them am I too a child? Sarah<br>

        <p><strong>Read the text below. Six sentences&nbsp;have been removed from this text so that there are six gaps.</strong><br><br><em>(Summary of the Article)</em><br><br>
The Titanic, built by White Star Line, was completed on 31 March 1912 in Belfast, Ireland, after three years of construction. <strong>(A)</strong> …………… It measured 28 meters wide, 53 meters tall, and 269 meters long. The Titanic embarked on its maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York, USA, on 10 April 1912, stopping at Cherbourg, France, and Queenstown, Ireland, to pick up passengers. Known as RMS Titanic, which stands for ‘Royal Mail Steamer,’ the ship carried 3,500 sacks of letters, packages, and documents along with over 2,200 passengers and crew members. The ship was referred to as ‘she,’ a tradition linked to ancient language or the idea of goddesses protecting ships.</p>
        <p>The Titanic’s passengers were divided into three classes based on their wealth. First-class passengers enjoyed luxurious accommodations and facilities, including private suites, a swimming pool, and a dining room. Second-class passengers had comfortable cabins with access to amenities like a library and dining room. Third-class passengers, although in more basic accommodations, experienced better conditions than on other ships of that era. The Titanic was powered by its coal-burning engines, with 175 firemen shovelling 600 tons of coal daily. <strong>(B)</strong> …………… Despite claims of being the safest ship due to its hull design, the Titanic met disaster on its fifth day at sea.</p>
        <p>On the night of 14 April 1912, the Titanic struck an iceberg in the North Atlantic, tearing holes in at least four sections of its hull. The collision was catastrophic, and Captain Edward John Smith and his crew quickly realized the ship would sink within hours. Distress signals were sent out, and passengers were ordered to the lifeboats. However, the Titanic only had 20 lifeboats, enough for about half of those on board, and the initial lifeboats were launched half-empty. <strong>(C) </strong>…………… The ship eventually broke in two, with the bow sinking first and the stern rising before sinking.</p>
        <p>The freezing -2°C waters proved fatal for most passengers who ended up in the ocean. <strong>(D)</strong> …………… The RMS Carpathia was the first ship to respond to the distress signals, arriving over an hour after the Titanic sank. It rescued around 705 survivors from the lifeboats and transported them to New York. Tragically, over 1,500 people lost their lives, with many bodies never recovered. In the aftermath, ships retrieved 300 bodies, which were either buried at sea or taken to Halifax, Canada, for identification. The wreck of the Titanic remained hidden for nearly 70 years until discovered in 1985 by oceanographer Dr.&nbsp;Robert Ballard.</p>
        <p>Since the discovery, numerous expeditions have salvaged over 6,000 items from the Titanic wreckage, now displayed in museums worldwide. These artifacts include jewellery, perfumes, plates, clothes, furniture, and even lunch menus. <strong>(E)</strong> .…………… The Titanic’s story has inspired many documentaries and movies, the most famous being the 1997 film “Titanic,” directed by James Cameron. This film, featuring a fictionalized romance between characters played by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, became one of the highest grossing films of all time.</p>
        <p>The Titanic was famously dubbed “unsinkable” before its maiden voyage. This belief was partly due to its advanced safety features, such as 16 compartments within the hull designed to contain flooding. <strong>(F)</strong> …………… The ship’s grandeur and luxury, rather than its safety, were its main selling points. Despite the “unsinkable” reputation, the Titanic’s sinking revealed flaws in its design and safety measures, highlighting the importance of adequate lifeboat provisions and emergency preparedness. The disaster led to significant changes in maritime safety regulations, ensuring that such a tragedy would not be repeated.</p>

<br>
What makes people excited at the sight of huge, steep, dead rocks? One expert, noting how monkeys climb around all day, claims it is simply a case of people returning to their primal nature. Walking to the summit itself does not satisfy this breed of person; they need an extraordinary amount of excitement and challenge. Disdaining competition with others, rock climbers prefer to push their bodies and spirit to the limit, with their four limbs shaking by the side of a cliff. Rarely do they admit defeat and descend an unconquered mountain. All agree that reaching the top yields an unparalleled sense of exhilaration and accomplishment. Rock climbing is not for dilettantes. Climbers must practice and exercise often. Perhaps students are best suited for the sport. Most men, after college graduation and military service, find jobs and start families, and lack the freedom that allows them to spend hours on a rock. One climber says he regularly hammers two more pitons for added security every time he thinks of his wife and children. Perhaps he can help satisfy his climbing urge by passing on his expertise to the younger generation, for as long as there are massive, sheer cliffs, there will be rock climbers.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of rock climbing. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Is free solo climbing insane? I explain it like this: When you walk upstairs you don’t always use the handrail. So, if you get really good at stairs, I can take the railing away. Now, no railing, but I am going to make the stairs smaller. You master this in no time, but it makes your heart beat harder. This is the concept. You gain mastery, and it feels like walking up stairs. This is how your perspective changes and you reach a mental place where you are able to solo. “During a solo, you feel freedom. You never climb better than when you are soloing,” says famous American rock climber Honnold. “For me, I feel weightless because falling is not an option. There is a rush, but it comes in the anticipation, not in the execution,” says another rock climber. Soloing requires a sound and confident mind. It can also change your perspective on climbing and how you view risk. Soloing is personal, and each person’s experience will be unique. What you think about and how you do it is completely up to you – don’t let anyone convince you otherwise. These are my thoughts from personal experience.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of rock climbing. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
How dangerous is free solo climbing? It is about as dangerous as it gets. I’d say it is the most dangerous sport ever, in the history of mankind. Does that sound like an overstatement? I would disagree. Free solo climbing will not allow for any mistakes. If you miss a foothold, you die. If a fly lands on your nose and you get distracted, you die. Of course, not all free solo climbing falls kill you, since you can also fall from less-than-fatal heights or situations (YouTube has many videos of such non-lethal falls). But I’d say that free soloing is only ‘real’ (let me use that word very carefully here) when the risk of falling is not an option. Therefore, people who participate in sports where falling is an option (such as high-ball bouldering where a fall is likely to result in serious injury but not death), are not truly ‘free soloing’. Instead, free&nbsp;&nbsp;solo climbing is being totally alone on the rock, unable to call anyone for help, and unable to bail if things go wrong. You either go up, or you fall.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of rock climbing. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Renowned rock climber Alex Honnold became the first person to scale the iconic, nearly 3,000-foot granite wall known as El Capitan without using ropes or other safety gear, completing what may be the greatest feat of pure rock climbing in the history of the sport. “Years ago, when I first mentally mapped out what it would mean to free solo Freerider [the El Capitan wall], there were half a dozen of pitches where I was like, ‘Oh that’s a scary move and that’s a really scary sequence, and that little slab, and that traverse’,” Honnold said. “There were so many little sections where I thought ‘Ughh cringe.’ But in the years since, I’ve pushed my comfort zone and made it bigger and bigger until these objectives that seemed totally crazy eventually fell within the realm of the possible.”<br>

While many places have enacted bans on single-use plastic straws, experts caution that no perfect alternative exists. For example, alternatives like paper straws or bamboo straws still require considerable natural resources to produce, and their effectiveness in replacing plastic straws is limited by issues like durability and cost.</div>

For years, students have been taught that the First World War was triggered mainly by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. However, more recent historical research suggests that the causes were much more complex, involving factors like nationalism, imperialism, and military alliances. To keep up with these new developments, it’s important to update the way we teach this topic to give students a fuller understanding of the war’s causes. The current approach oversimplifies the situation and presents a limited view of history.</div>
