That the stars are always shining,<br>
Even on bright, cloudless days.<br>
They don’t only come out at night.<br>
<em>5</em> Beyond the blinding sunlight,<br>
They are always burning,<br>
Signaling to one another<br>
With their light<br>
Even when I can’t see them.
<p><br><em>10</em> Sometimes, we forget<br>
That under our feet<br>
Is an unseen universe.<br>
A world of roots seeking<br>
Underground rivers.<br>

Rocks that shift and melt<br>

An eternity.<br>
Sometimes, you forget<br>
That what you see<br>
<em>25</em> Is not all that I am.<br>
You know I like mathematics,<br>
But did you know<br>
I can juggle three balls at once?<br>
You see me walk to school,<br>
<em>30</em> But you don’t know<br>
I dream of flying to the stars.<br>
Beneath the surface<br>
There is a world of mystery,<br>
Within me and you.<br>
<em>35</em> Look closely.<br>
Reveal something about yourself<br>
That I can’t see.<br>
Dig deep.<br>
Uncover what you haven’t yet<br>
discovered in me.</p>

<br>
Vending Machines in School<br>
<br>
Student 1 Editorial</strong><br><br>
During our sixth grade class meeting, our principal asked all of us to think about ways we could improve our school. The one thing that I think would be a tremendous help to all of the students is to offer only healthy food at school.<br>
<br>
I usually bring my lunch to school because the meals in the cafeteria have too many fried foods and starches and not enough fruits and vegetables. For instance, the last day that I ate the school lunch, the cafeteria served hamburgers. For vegetables, we could choose French fries, macaroni and cheese, or soggy green beans. I didn’t see anybody choose the beans. Dessert that day was fruit cocktail in heavy syrup. That is a pretty typical lunch, but I think we could do a lot better.<br>
<br>
Experts who specialize in children’s health recommend that kids have a limited amount of fried foods, sugary snacks, and fast foods. Instead, of course, we are supposed to eat fruits, vegetables, and healthy snacks. We could do this if they were readily available here at school, where we spend so much of our time.<br>
<br>
One way to improve the lunches is to have a salad bar that also offers things like individual containers of yogurt. Every day there should be at least one kind of fresh fruit available. At my old school, we always at least had apples because the local farmers offered all the schools a good deal on them. We also got other fresh fruit and vegetables in season. Maybe we could check with farmers in this area.<br>
<br>
Also, I think that we should get rid of the machines that sell soda and junk food. Some kids don’t use them just for snacks; they spend their lunch money there. Some of them have too much sugar and then they are hyperactive in class. Drinking one 12-ounce soda a day is like eating 10 teaspoons of sugar, and experts say that drinking one sweetened soda a day increases a child’s chance of becoming overweight by 60 percent. Too much caffeine also causes kids to be jittery. Drinking sodas and eating candy bars keeps students from eating and drinking the things that their bodies need in order to work properly.<br>
<br>
It would be nice if there were machines for those of us who would like to have a granola bar or a can of fruit juice—real fruit juice, not sugary, juice-flavored drinks. We should have<br>
milk machines, too. Take, for example, the commercial on TV that has famous people drinking milk. It must be a good idea, otherwise famous people wouldn’t appear in the commercials. A recent poll indicated that 8 out of 10 individuals think that the soda machines should be replaced with machines for water, milk, and 100% juice. One school district has already removed all the soda and junk food machines. Why shouldn’t we do the same thing?<br>
<br>
It doesn’t do us much good to learn about proper nutrition in class and then not be able to buy healthy snacks at school or eat a nutritious meal in the cafeteria. If we’re going to say that being healthy is important, then all the choices at school should be healthy choices. After all, think about how much time we spend here.<br>
<br>
<strong>Student 2 Editorial</strong><br>
<br>
I definitely have some suggestions about improvements for this school. However, since I have to stick to just one suggestion, I’ve picked what is most important to me—food! We really need to do something to improve the variety of food here. All of my friends think so.<br>
<br>
I think that we should add to the number of vending machines we have right now. I have seen a great one that offers different kinds of ice cream treats. It would be good, too, if we had a variety of soda machines. Choosing from the same ones every day gets really boring. The same thing is true of the machine for candy and chips. We only get a few choices when we should have as many as we have at the store. I’ve talked to my friends who go to other schools, and they all have many more choices than we do here.<br>
<br>
The school shouldn’t <span class="txt-underline">mind </span>adding more machines because I know that the profit from the machines is divided up among the school clubs. We get to feel good every time we buy a soda or a candy bar because we know we’re helping everyone at school. Also, one of the clubs at school collects the empty cans and takes them to recycling. The money from that is given to charity, so drinking a soda is really like donating money to a good cause!<br>
<br>
The food in the cafeteria is really sad, too. I kept a record, and we had hamburgers ten times in the past month. That is completely boring. Again, what we need are more choices. I think they should have hamburgers every day because everybody likes hamburgers and fries, but they should have other things, too. They should offer pizza every day, but they could have different kinds. Then they could have something like fried chicken wings or chicken nuggets with dipping sauce. And they should always definitely have more than one dessert. I think there should be a suggestion box in the cafeteria and people could put in their ideas for dessert. Then we would have a great variety. My friends all agree that this is a good idea.<br>
<br>
Obviously, I think we need more variety in our food choices. That is important because the ability to make choices will make us happier and more content to be at school. A soda or a candy bar gives us quick energy so that we can be more alert in class, which makes the teachers happy.<br>

<br>
Vending Machines in School<br>
<br>
Student 1 Editorial</strong><br><br>
During our sixth grade class meeting, our principal asked all of us to think about ways we could improve our school. The one thing that I think would be a tremendous help to all of the students is to offer only healthy food at school.<br>
<br>
I usually bring my lunch to school because the meals in the cafeteria have too many fried foods and starches and not enough fruits and vegetables. For instance, the last day that I ate the school lunch, the cafeteria served hamburgers. For vegetables, we could choose French fries, macaroni and cheese, or soggy green beans. I didn’t see anybody choose the beans. Dessert that day was fruit cocktail in heavy syrup. That is a pretty typical lunch, but I think we could do a lot better.<br>
<br>
Experts who specialize in children’s health recommend that kids have a limited amount of fried foods, sugary snacks, and fast foods. Instead, of course, we are supposed to eat fruits, vegetables, and healthy snacks. We could do this if they were readily available here at school, where we spend so much of our time.<br>
<br>
One way to improve the lunches is to have a salad bar that also offers things like individual containers of yogurt. Every day there should be at least one kind of fresh fruit available. At my old school, we always at least had apples because the local farmers offered all the schools a good deal on them. We also got other fresh fruit and vegetables in season. Maybe we could check with farmers in this area.<br>
<br>
Also, I think that we should get rid of the machines that sell soda and junk food. Some kids don’t use them just for snacks; they spend their lunch money there. Some of them have too much sugar and then they are hyperactive in class. Drinking one 12-ounce soda a day is like eating 10 teaspoons of sugar, and experts say that drinking one sweetened soda a day increases a child’s chance of becoming overweight by 60 percent. Too much caffeine also causes kids to be jittery. Drinking sodas and eating candy bars keeps students from eating and drinking the things that their bodies need in order to work properly.<br>
<br>
It would be nice if there were machines for those of us who would like to have a granola bar or a can of fruit juice—real fruit juice, not sugary, juice-flavored drinks. We should have<br>
milk machines, too. Take, for example, the commercial on TV that has famous people drinking milk. It must be a good idea, otherwise famous people wouldn’t appear in the commercials. A recent poll indicated that 8 out of 10 individuals think that the soda machines should be replaced with machines for water, milk, and 100% juice. One school district has already removed all the soda and junk food machines. Why shouldn’t we do the same thing?<br>
<br>
It doesn’t do us much good to learn about proper nutrition in class and then not be able to buy healthy snacks at school or eat a nutritious meal in the cafeteria. If we’re going to say that being healthy is important, then all the choices at school should be healthy choices. After all, think about how much time we spend here.<br>
<br>
<strong>Student 2 Editorial</strong><br>
<br>
I definitely have some suggestions about improvements for this school. However, since I have to stick to just one suggestion, I’ve picked what is most important to me—food! We really need to do something to improve the variety of food here. All of my friends think so.<br>
<br>
I think that we should add to the number of vending machines we have right now. I have seen a great one that offers different kinds of ice cream treats. It would be good, too, if we had a variety of soda machines. Choosing from the same ones every day gets really boring. The same thing is true of the machine for candy and chips. We only get a few choices when we should have as many as we have at the store. I’ve talked to my friends who go to other schools, and they all have many more choices than we do here.<br>
<br>
The school shouldn’t <span class="txt-underline">mind </span>adding more machines because I know that the profit from the machines is divided up among the school clubs. We get to feel good every time we buy a soda or a candy bar because we know we’re helping everyone at school. Also, one of the clubs at school collects the empty cans and takes them to recycling. The money from that is given to charity, so drinking a soda is really like donating money to a good cause!<br>
<br>
The food in the cafeteria is really sad, too. I kept a record, and we had hamburgers ten times in the past month. That is completely boring. Again, what we need are more choices. I think they should have hamburgers every day because everybody likes hamburgers and fries, but they should have other things, too. They should offer pizza every day, but they could have different kinds. Then they could have something like fried chicken wings or chicken nuggets with dipping sauce. And they should always definitely have more than one dessert. I think there should be a suggestion box in the cafeteria and people could put in their ideas for dessert. Then we would have a great variety. My friends all agree that this is a good idea.<br>
<br>
Obviously, I think we need more variety in our food choices. That is important because the ability to make choices will make us happier and more content to be at school. A soda or a candy bar gives us quick energy so that we can be more alert in class, which makes the teachers happy.<br>

<br>
Vending Machines in School<br>
<br>
Student 1 Editorial</strong><br><br>
During our sixth grade class meeting, our principal asked all of us to think about ways we could improve our school. The one thing that I think would be a tremendous help to all of the students is to offer only healthy food at school.<br>
<br>
I usually bring my lunch to school because the meals in the cafeteria have too many fried foods and starches and not enough fruits and vegetables. For instance, the last day that I ate the school lunch, the cafeteria served hamburgers. For vegetables, we could choose French fries, macaroni and cheese, or soggy green beans. I didn’t see anybody choose the beans. Dessert that day was fruit cocktail in heavy syrup. That is a pretty typical lunch, but I think we could do a lot better.<br>
<br>
Experts who specialize in children’s health recommend that kids have a limited amount of fried foods, sugary snacks, and fast foods. Instead, of course, we are supposed to eat fruits, vegetables, and healthy snacks. We could do this if they were readily available here at school, where we spend so much of our time.<br>
<br>
One way to improve the lunches is to have a salad bar that also offers things like individual containers of yogurt. Every day there should be at least one kind of fresh fruit available. At my old school, we always at least had apples because the local farmers offered all the schools a good deal on them. We also got other fresh fruit and vegetables in season. Maybe we could check with farmers in this area.<br>
<br>
Also, I think that we should get rid of the machines that sell soda and junk food. Some kids don’t use them just for snacks; they spend their lunch money there. Some of them have too much sugar and then they are hyperactive in class. Drinking one 12-ounce soda a day is like eating 10 teaspoons of sugar, and experts say that drinking one sweetened soda a day increases a child’s chance of becoming overweight by 60 percent. Too much caffeine also causes kids to be jittery. Drinking sodas and eating candy bars keeps students from eating and drinking the things that their bodies need in order to work properly.<br>
<br>
It would be nice if there were machines for those of us who would like to have a granola bar or a can of fruit juice—real fruit juice, not sugary, juice-flavored drinks. We should have<br>
milk machines, too. Take, for example, the commercial on TV that has famous people drinking milk. It must be a good idea, otherwise famous people wouldn’t appear in the commercials. A recent poll indicated that 8 out of 10 individuals think that the soda machines should be replaced with machines for water, milk, and 100% juice. One school district has already removed all the soda and junk food machines. Why shouldn’t we do the same thing?<br>
<br>
It doesn’t do us much good to learn about proper nutrition in class and then not be able to buy healthy snacks at school or eat a nutritious meal in the cafeteria. If we’re going to say that being healthy is important, then all the choices at school should be healthy choices. After all, think about how much time we spend here.<br>
<br>
<strong>Student 2 Editorial</strong><br>
<br>
I definitely have some suggestions about improvements for this school. However, since I have to stick to just one suggestion, I’ve picked what is most important to me—food! We really need to do something to improve the variety of food here. All of my friends think so.<br>
<br>
I think that we should add to the number of vending machines we have right now. I have seen a great one that offers different kinds of ice cream treats. It would be good, too, if we had a variety of soda machines. Choosing from the same ones every day gets really boring. The same thing is true of the machine for candy and chips. We only get a few choices when we should have as many as we have at the store. I’ve talked to my friends who go to other schools, and they all have many more choices than we do here.<br>
<br>
The school shouldn’t <span class="txt-underline">mind </span>adding more machines because I know that the profit from the machines is divided up among the school clubs. We get to feel good every time we buy a soda or a candy bar because we know we’re helping everyone at school. Also, one of the clubs at school collects the empty cans and takes them to recycling. The money from that is given to charity, so drinking a soda is really like donating money to a good cause!<br>
<br>
The food in the cafeteria is really sad, too. I kept a record, and we had hamburgers ten times in the past month. That is completely boring. Again, what we need are more choices. I think they should have hamburgers every day because everybody likes hamburgers and fries, but they should have other things, too. They should offer pizza every day, but they could have different kinds. Then they could have something like fried chicken wings or chicken nuggets with dipping sauce. And they should always definitely have more than one dessert. I think there should be a suggestion box in the cafeteria and people could put in their ideas for dessert. Then we would have a great variety. My friends all agree that this is a good idea.<br>
<br>
Obviously, I think we need more variety in our food choices. That is important because the ability to make choices will make us happier and more content to be at school. A soda or a candy bar gives us quick energy so that we can be more alert in class, which makes the teachers happy.<br>

One school district has already removed all the soda and junk food machines. Why shouldn’t we do the same thing?<br>
<br>
It doesn’t do us much good to learn about proper nutrition in class and then not be able to buy healthy snacks at school or eat a nutritious meal in the cafeteria. If we’re going to say that being healthy is important, then all the choices at school should be healthy choices. After all, think about how much time we spend here.<br>
<br>
<strong>Student 2 Editorial</strong><br>
<br>
I definitely have some suggestions about improvements for this school. However, since I have to stick to just one suggestion, I’ve picked what is most important to me—food! We really need to do something to improve the variety of food here. All of my friends think so.<br>
<br>
I think that we should add to the number of vending machines we have right now. I have seen a great one that offers different kinds of ice cream treats. It would be good, too, if we had a variety of soda machines. Choosing from the same ones every day gets really boring. The same thing is true of the machine for candy and chips. We only get a few choices when we should have as many as we have at the store. I’ve talked to my friends who go to other schools, and they all have many more choices than we do here.<br>
<br>
The school shouldn’t <span class="txt-underline">mind </span>adding more machines because I know that the profit from the machines is divided up among the school clubs. We get to feel good every time we buy a soda or a candy bar because we know we’re helping everyone at school. Also, one of the clubs at school collects the empty cans and takes them to recycling. The money from that is given to charity, so drinking a soda is really like donating money to a good cause!<br>
<br>
The food in the cafeteria is really sad, too. I kept a record, and we had hamburgers ten times in the past month. That is completely boring. Again, what we need are more choices. I think they should have hamburgers every day because everybody likes hamburgers and fries, but they should have other things, too. They should offer pizza every day, but they could have different kinds. Then they could have something like fried chicken wings or chicken nuggets with dipping sauce. And they should always definitely have more than one dessert. I think there should be a suggestion box in the cafeteria and people could put in their ideas for dessert. Then we would have a great variety. My friends all agree that this is a good idea.<br>
<br>
Obviously, I think we need more variety in our food choices. That is important because the ability to make choices will make us happier and more content to be at school. A soda or a candy bar gives us quick energy so that we can be more alert in class, which makes the teachers happy.<br>

<br>
THE SHARK</strong><br><br><em>E.J. Pratt</em><br><br>
He seemed to know the harbour,<br>
So leisurely he swam;<br>
His fin,<br>
Like a piece of sheet-iron,<br>
Three-cornered,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5<br>
And with knife-edge,<br>
Stirred not a bubble<br>
As it moved<br>
With its base-line on the water.<br>
<br>
His body was tubular&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10<br>
And tapered<br>
And smoke-blue,<br>
And as he passed the wharf<br>
He turned,<br>
And snapped at a flat-fish&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;15<br>
That was dead and floating.<br>
And I saw the flash of a white throat,<br>
And a double row of white teeth,<br>
And eyes of metallic grey,<br>
Hard and narrow and slit.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 20<br>
<br>
Then out of the harbour,<br>
With that three-cornered fin,<br>
Shearing without a bubble the water<br>
Lithely,<br>
He swam –&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;25<br>
That strange fish,<br>
Tubular, tapered, smoke-blue,<br>
Part vulture, part wolf,<br>
Part neither – for his blood was cold.</div>

<br>
Guardian Angel</strong><br><em>by Adoralida (Dora) Padilla</em><br><br><em>1</em> In the fall of 1998, my friend Eleanor, a seasoned traveler, wanted to visit Turkey but couldn’t find anyone to join her. I&nbsp; had always wanted to travel, and figured I had to start somewhere, so I signed on for a five-week trip.<br>
<br>
<em>2</em> We arrived in Istanbul. This was such an ancient city: Constantinople, Byzantium, the center of the Roman Empire; we were truly in awe and very humbled. The Hagia Sophia, the Blue Mosque, the Grand Bazaar—we saw it all.<br>
<br>
<em>3</em> We decided to venture out from Istanbul heading toward Izmir by ferry. Then, we would take a train to Selcuk where we would be only minutes away from the ancient ruins of Ephesus. Arriving at the ferry office rather early, we were the first ones there, other than a scruffy homeless-looking Turk asleep on a bench. We sat as far away from him as we could. His shoes were several sizes too big, and the soles were flopping off. His socks had been worn through at the heel, and turned so now the hole was at the front ankle. His pants were baggy and dirty, his jacket had holes, and he was in serious need of a shower and a shave.<br>
<br>
<em>4</em> People started to filter into the ferry building, getting in line to buy their tickets. Although most of the people we encountered spoke English, the ticket seller did not. It was difficult to convey that we wanted both ferry tickets and train tickets. To my surprise, the homeless-looking man appeared at my side, and in near perfect English told us that we were in the wrong line. He guided us to the proper line, ordered our tickets, made sure I counted my currency and that I received the proper change. He told me his name was Sinan.<br>
<br>
        <img width="72%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/db0yrhgnb/image/upload/v1767497533/eg7xnxnxkq1v4uoiqify.png" alt="1">

<br>
<br>
<em>5</em> Sinan helped us with our very heavy bags onto the ferry, and up several flights of stairs to the top observation deck. The seats were full. He asked a family at a nice booth to please let us sit there, and they obliged. We invited him to sit with us, and offered to buy him breakfast for all his help. He only accepted a cup of coffee.<br>
<br>
<em>6</em> Sinan explained he was in Istanbul for a job interview with a cruise line. He had worked at major hotels in Saudi Arabia and London. From his torn jacket, he produced his prized possession—a Polaroid picture of himself with Sean Connery, taken in London. He accompanied us out onto the deck and told us all about the sites along the Bosporus. We spent hours on the ferry enjoying his company, and took Polaroid pictures of ourselves with him. He placed our picture together with the picture of Sean Connery.<br>
<br>
<em>7</em> When we arrived at our stop, Sinan didn’t even hesitate before grabbing our bags and carrying them down the stairs. After walking us to the train station, he quickly paid a porter to watch our bags, and we walked several blocks to a pizzeria for lunch. We insisted on buying lunch, but he ate very little. He carried our bags onto the train, and again asked people to move so we had perfect seats. We didn’t realize the ferry trip would be about three hours and the train trip another eight hours. While Eleanor napped, Sinan and I talked about every subject under the sun: politics, the role of women in Turkish society, religion, family, law, UFO’s (he was convinced, as he said many Turks were, that America had contact with aliens and that is why we had advanced technology). He was bright, funny, insightful, naive.<br>
<br>
<em>8</em> We had not finished our lunch, and he had the foresight to have our leftovers wrapped up. We ate cold pizza and the people he had kicked out of our seats shared apples and bread with us. We told him where we were headed, and he asked where we planned to stay once we arrived in Selcuk. He advised that we should get off several stops before the end of the line, to be closer to the bus station where we had to connect to our final destination.<br>
<br>
<em>9</em> By the time we arrived in Izmir, it was about eleven P.M. Sinan helped us off the train, picked up our bags, one on each shoulder, and started off down a busy expressway. It was all Eleanor and I could do to keep up with him, in the dark. We feared we had made a terrible mistake, entrusting this stranger with our belongings, and that he was now running off with all we had. I saw him turn off way ahead,&nbsp; and Eleanor and I were out of breath trying to catch up. When we turned the same corner, we saw Sinan standing in front of a magnificent Mercedes bus, with our luggage in front of him, and his arms spread out wide to stop the bus which was pulling out of the station.<br>
<br>
<em>10</em> The driver got out and yelled at him, and he answered back in Turkish. The driver opened the storage area, and threw our bags in. We arrived breathless and Sinan ushered us onto the bus, telling us we could buy the tickets on board. He gave us a hurried hug good-bye, and he was drenched in sweat from running with our luggage. The moment we were on the bus, it pulled out of the station. Sinan ran alongside the bus, waving excitedly. It was then I noticed tears running down my face. I had missed the chance to tell my new friend how much we appreciated his kindness and company. We waved back and he was gone.<br>
<br>
<em>11</em> Eleanor and I sat and looked at each other and at the same time said: “He was a guardian angel!” Had it not been for Sinan, we would not have purchased the proper tickets, we would have labored terribly with our bags, we would have missed out on good seating, and who knows what we would have done about food. We would have missed the delightful guided tour of the Bosporus on the ferry. We would have gotten off at the wrong station, had to hire a taxi, and would have missed the last bus to Selcuk that night, leaving us stranded without reservations near midnight in a strange city.<br>
<br>
<em>12</em> When we arrived in Selcuk, it was nearly midnight. The little town was asleep. There was no one in sight. We were the only passengers getting off at that town. There was a<br>
man leaning by a car. He eyed us carefully. We were instantly worried. The man approached and asked: “Are you the American women coming from Istanbul?” We were shocked. “How did you know?” we asked. He answered: “Because a man named Sinan&nbsp;called the hotel and told us you would be arriving on this bus. He said you’d be hungry and asked that we keep the kitchen open for you.” We couldn’t believe it. Even though he was no longer traveling with us, Sinan, our guardian angel, was still looking out for us.<br>
<br>
<em>13</em> The man took our luggage and drove us the few blocks to our hotel. The kitchen was open and waiting to serve us dinner.<br>
<br>
<em>14</em> That night, as I drifted off to sleep, I felt ashamed for having initially judged Sinan by his appearance. I was also sad that such a wonderful man had so few opportunities—his greatest desire was to someday come to the United States and work at a 7-11 store. Most importantly, I was thankful to have opened my eyes to discover kindness when and where it was least expected.<br>
<br>
<em>15</em> It was stunning how much a total stranger was willing to do for us, without expecting anything in return. Throughout our adventure in Turkey, we saw this same kindness repeated time and time again. We never knew his last name, but we will always remember him as “Sinan, the guardian angel.”<br>

<br>
Guardian Angel</strong><br><em>by Adoralida (Dora) Padilla</em><br><br><em>1</em> In the fall of 1998, my friend Eleanor, a seasoned traveler, wanted to visit Turkey but couldn’t find anyone to join her. I&nbsp; had always wanted to travel, and figured I had to start somewhere, so I signed on for a five-week trip.<br>
<br>
<em>2</em> We arrived in Istanbul. This was such an ancient city: Constantinople, Byzantium, the center of the Roman Empire; we were truly in awe and very humbled. The Hagia Sophia, the Blue Mosque, the Grand Bazaar—we saw it all.<br>
<br>
<em>3</em> We decided to venture out from Istanbul heading toward Izmir by ferry. Then, we would take a train to Selcuk where we would be only minutes away from the ancient ruins of Ephesus. Arriving at the ferry office rather early, we were the first ones there, other than a scruffy homeless-looking Turk asleep on a bench. We sat as far away from him as we could. His shoes were several sizes too big, and the soles were flopping off. His socks had been worn through at the heel, and turned so now the hole was at the front ankle. His pants were baggy and dirty, his jacket had holes, and he was in serious need of a shower and a shave.<br>
<br>
<em>4</em> People started to filter into the ferry building, getting in line to buy their tickets. Although most of the people we encountered spoke English, the ticket seller did not. It was difficult to convey that we wanted both ferry tickets and train tickets. To my surprise, the homeless-looking man appeared at my side, and in near perfect English told us that we were in the wrong line. He guided us to the proper line, ordered our tickets, made sure I counted my currency and that I received the proper change. He told me his name was Sinan.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<em>5</em> Sinan helped us with our very heavy bags onto the ferry, and up several flights of stairs to the top observation deck. The seats were full. He asked a family at a nice booth to please let us sit there, and they obliged. We invited him to sit with us, and offered to buy him breakfast for all his help. He only accepted a cup of coffee.<br>
<br>
<em>6</em> Sinan explained he was in Istanbul for a job interview with a cruise line. He had worked at major hotels in Saudi Arabia and London. From his torn jacket, he produced his prized possession—a Polaroid picture of himself with Sean Connery, taken in London. He accompanied us out onto the deck and told us all about the sites along the Bosporus. We spent hours on the ferry enjoying his company, and took Polaroid pictures of ourselves with him. He placed our picture together with the picture of Sean Connery.<br>
<br>
<em>7</em> When we arrived at our stop, Sinan didn’t even hesitate before grabbing our bags and carrying them down the stairs. After walking us to the train station, he quickly paid a porter to watch our bags, and we walked several blocks to a pizzeria for lunch. We insisted on buying lunch, but he ate very little. He carried our bags onto the train, and again asked people to move so we had perfect seats. We didn’t realize the ferry trip would be about three hours and the train trip another eight hours. While Eleanor napped, Sinan and I talked about every subject under the sun: politics, the role of women in Turkish society, religion, family, law, UFO’s (he was convinced, as he said many Turks were, that America had contact with aliens and that is why we had advanced technology). He was bright, funny, insightful, naive.<br>
<br>
<em>8</em> We had not finished our lunch, and he had the foresight to have our leftovers wrapped up. We ate cold pizza and the people he had kicked out of our seats shared apples and bread with us. We told him where we were headed, and he asked where we planned to stay once we arrived in Selcuk. He advised that we should get off several stops before the end of the line, to be closer to the bus station where we had to connect to our final destination.<br>
<br>
<em>9</em> By the time we arrived in Izmir, it was about eleven P.M. Sinan helped us off the train, picked up our bags, one on each shoulder, and started off down a busy expressway. It was all Eleanor and I could do to keep up with him, in the dark. We feared we had made a terrible mistake, entrusting this stranger with our belongings, and that he was now running off with all we had. I saw him turn off way ahead,&nbsp; and Eleanor and I were out of breath trying to catch up. When we turned the same corner, we saw Sinan standing in front of a magnificent Mercedes bus, with our luggage in front of him, and his arms spread out wide to stop the bus which was pulling out of the station.<br>
<br>
<em>10</em> The driver got out and yelled at him, and he answered back in Turkish. The driver opened the storage area, and threw our bags in. We arrived breathless and Sinan ushered us onto the bus, telling us we could buy the tickets on board. He gave us a hurried hug good-bye, and he was drenched in sweat from running with our luggage. The moment we were on the bus, it pulled out of the station. Sinan ran alongside the bus, waving excitedly. It was then I noticed tears running down my face. I had missed the chance to tell my new friend how much we appreciated his kindness and company. We waved back and he was gone.<br>
<br>
<em>11</em> Eleanor and I sat and looked at each other and at the same time said: “He was a guardian angel!” Had it not been for Sinan, we would not have purchased the proper tickets, we would have labored terribly with our bags, we would have missed out on good seating, and who knows what we would have done about food. We would have missed the delightful guided tour of the Bosporus on the ferry. We would have gotten off at the wrong station, had to hire a taxi, and would have missed the last bus to Selcuk that night, leaving us stranded without reservations near midnight in a strange city.<br>
<br>
<em>12</em> When we arrived in Selcuk, it was nearly midnight. The little town was asleep. There was no one in sight. We were the only passengers getting off at that town. There was a<br>
man leaning by a car. He eyed us carefully. We were instantly worried. The man approached and asked: “Are you the American women coming from Istanbul?” We were shocked. “How did you know?” we asked. He answered: “Because a man named Sinan&nbsp;called the hotel and told us you would be arriving on this bus. He said you’d be hungry and asked that we keep the kitchen open for you.” We couldn’t believe it. Even though he was no longer traveling with us, Sinan, our guardian angel, was still looking out for us.<br>
<br>
<em>13</em> The man took our luggage and drove us the few blocks to our hotel. The kitchen was open and waiting to serve us dinner.<br>
<br>
<em>14</em> That night, as I drifted off to sleep, I felt ashamed for having initially judged Sinan by his appearance. I was also sad that such a wonderful man had so few opportunities—his greatest desire was to someday come to the United States and work at a 7-11 store. Most importantly, I was thankful to have opened my eyes to discover kindness when and where it was least expected.<br>
<br>
<em>15</em> It was stunning how much a total stranger was willing to do for us, without expecting anything in return. Throughout our adventure in Turkey, we saw this same kindness repeated time and time again. We never knew his last name, but we will always remember him as “Sinan, the guardian angel.”<br>

<br>
Guardian Angel</strong><br><em>by Adoralida (Dora) Padilla</em><br><br><em>1</em> In the fall of 1998, my friend Eleanor, a seasoned traveler, wanted to visit Turkey but couldn’t find anyone to join her. I&nbsp; had always wanted to travel, and figured I had to start somewhere, so I signed on for a five-week trip.<br>
<br>
<em>2</em> We arrived in Istanbul. This was such an ancient city: Constantinople, Byzantium, the center of the Roman Empire; we were truly in awe and very humbled. The Hagia Sophia, the Blue Mosque, the Grand Bazaar—we saw it all.<br>
<br>
<em>3</em> We decided to venture out from Istanbul heading toward Izmir by ferry. Then, we would take a train to Selcuk where we would be only minutes away from the ancient ruins of Ephesus. Arriving at the ferry office rather early, we were the first ones there, other than a scruffy homeless-looking Turk asleep on a bench. We sat as far away from him as we could. His shoes were several sizes too big, and the soles were flopping off. His socks had been worn through at the heel, and turned so now the hole was at the front ankle. His pants were baggy and dirty, his jacket had holes, and he was in serious need of a shower and a shave.<br>
<br>
<em>4</em> People started to filter into the ferry building, getting in line to buy their tickets. Although most of the people we encountered spoke English, the ticket seller did not. It was difficult to convey that we wanted both ferry tickets and train tickets. To my surprise, the homeless-looking man appeared at my side, and in near perfect English told us that we were in the wrong line. He guided us to the proper line, ordered our tickets, made sure I counted my currency and that I received the proper change. He told me his name was Sinan.<br>
<br>
        <img width="72%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/db0yrhgnb/image/upload/v1767492886/dk75jjqm0fpsnufttojx.png" alt="1">

<br>
<br>
<em>5</em> Sinan helped us with our very heavy bags onto the ferry, and up several flights of stairs to the top observation deck. The seats were full. He asked a family at a nice booth to please let us sit there, and they obliged. We invited him to sit with us, and offered to buy him breakfast for all his help. He only accepted a cup of coffee.<br>
<br>
<em>6</em> Sinan explained he was in Istanbul for a job interview with a cruise line. He had worked at major hotels in Saudi Arabia and London. From his torn jacket, he produced his prized possession—a Polaroid picture of himself with Sean Connery, taken in London. He accompanied us out onto the deck and told us all about the sites along the Bosporus. We spent hours on the ferry enjoying his company, and took Polaroid pictures of ourselves with him. He placed our picture together with the picture of Sean Connery.<br>
<br>
<em>7</em> When we arrived at our stop, Sinan didn’t even hesitate before grabbing our bags and carrying them down the stairs. After walking us to the train station, he quickly paid a porter to watch our bags, and we walked several blocks to a pizzeria for lunch. We insisted on buying lunch, but he ate very little. He carried our bags onto the train, and again asked people to move so we had perfect seats. We didn’t realize the ferry trip would be about three hours and the train trip another eight hours. While Eleanor napped, Sinan and I talked about every subject under the sun: politics, the role of women in Turkish society, religion, family, law, UFO’s (he was convinced, as he said many Turks were, that America had contact with aliens and that is why we had advanced technology). He was bright, funny, insightful, naive.<br>
<br>
<em>8</em> We had not finished our lunch, and he had the foresight to have our leftovers wrapped up. We ate cold pizza and the people he had kicked out of our seats shared apples and bread with us. We told him where we were headed, and he asked where we planned to stay once we arrived in Selcuk. He advised that we should get off several stops before the end of the line, to be closer to the bus station where we had to connect to our final destination.<br>
<br>
<em>9</em> By the time we arrived in Izmir, it was about eleven P.M. Sinan helped us off the train, picked up our bags, one on each shoulder, and started off down a busy expressway. It was all Eleanor and I could do to keep up with him, in the dark. We feared we had made a terrible mistake, entrusting this stranger with our belongings, and that he was now running off with all we had. I saw him turn off way ahead,&nbsp; and Eleanor and I were out of breath trying to catch up. When we turned the same corner, we saw Sinan standing in front of a magnificent Mercedes bus, with our luggage in front of him, and his arms spread out wide to stop the bus which was pulling out of the station.<br>
<br>
<em>10</em> The driver got out and yelled at him, and he answered back in Turkish. The driver opened the storage area, and threw our bags in. We arrived breathless and Sinan ushered us onto the bus, telling us we could buy the tickets on board. He gave us a hurried hug good-bye, and he was drenched in sweat from running with our luggage. The moment we were on the bus, it pulled out of the station. Sinan ran alongside the bus, waving excitedly. It was then I noticed tears running down my face. I had missed the chance to tell my new friend how much we appreciated his kindness and company. We waved back and he was gone.<br>
<br>
<em>11</em> Eleanor and I sat and looked at each other and at the same time said: “He was a guardian angel!” Had it not been for Sinan, we would not have purchased the proper tickets, we would have labored terribly with our bags, we would have missed out on good seating, and who knows what we would have done about food. We would have missed the delightful guided tour of the Bosporus on the ferry. We would have gotten off at the wrong station, had to hire a taxi, and would have missed the last bus to Selcuk that night, leaving us stranded without reservations near midnight in a strange city.<br>
<br>
<em>12</em> When we arrived in Selcuk, it was nearly midnight. The little town was asleep. There was no one in sight. We were the only passengers getting off at that town. There was a<br>
man leaning by a car. He eyed us carefully. We were instantly worried. The man approached and asked: “Are you the American women coming from Istanbul?” We were shocked. “How did you know?” we asked. He answered: “Because a man named Sinan&nbsp;called the hotel and told us you would be arriving on this bus. He said you’d be hungry and asked that we keep the kitchen open for you.” We couldn’t believe it. Even though he was no longer traveling with us, Sinan, our guardian angel, was still looking out for us.<br>
<br>
<em>13</em> The man took our luggage and drove us the few blocks to our hotel. The kitchen was open and waiting to serve us dinner.<br>
<br>
<em>14</em> That night, as I drifted off to sleep, I felt ashamed for having initially judged Sinan by his appearance. I was also sad that such a wonderful man had so few opportunities—his greatest desire was to someday come to the United States and work at a 7-11 store. Most importantly, I was thankful to have opened my eyes to discover kindness when and where it was least expected.<br>
<br>
<em>15</em> It was stunning how much a total stranger was willing to do for us, without expecting anything in return. Throughout our adventure in Turkey, we saw this same kindness repeated time and time again. We never knew his last name, but we will always remember him as “Sinan, the guardian angel.”<br>

<br>
Guardian Angel</strong><br><em>by Adoralida (Dora) Padilla</em><br><br><em>1</em> In the fall of 1998, my friend Eleanor, a seasoned traveler, wanted to visit Turkey but couldn’t find anyone to join her. I&nbsp; had always wanted to travel, and figured I had to start somewhere, so I signed on for a five-week trip.<br>
<br>
<em>2</em> We arrived in Istanbul. This was such an ancient city: Constantinople, Byzantium, the center of the Roman Empire; we were truly in awe and very humbled. The Hagia Sophia, the Blue Mosque, the Grand Bazaar—we saw it all.<br>
<br>
<em>3</em> We decided to venture out from Istanbul heading toward Izmir by ferry. Then, we would take a train to Selcuk where we would be only minutes away from the ancient ruins of Ephesus. Arriving at the ferry office rather early, we were the first ones there, other than a scruffy homeless-looking Turk asleep on a bench. We sat as far away from him as we could. His shoes were several sizes too big, and the soles were flopping off. His socks had been worn through at the heel, and turned so now the hole was at the front ankle. His pants were baggy and dirty, his jacket had holes, and he was in serious need of a shower and a shave.<br>
<br>
<em>4</em> People started to filter into the ferry building, getting in line to buy their tickets. Although most of the people we encountered spoke English, the ticket seller did not. It was difficult to convey that we wanted both ferry tickets and train tickets. To my surprise, the homeless-looking man appeared at my side, and in near perfect English told us that we were in the wrong line. He guided us to the proper line, ordered our tickets, made sure I counted my currency and that I received the proper change. He told me his name was Sinan.<br>
<br>
        <img width="72%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dmgrgrhfu/image/upload/v1767442481/kgj5wyz91eqlvrfnwjd2.png" alt="1">

<br>
<br>
<em>5</em> Sinan helped us with our very heavy bags onto the ferry, and up several flights of stairs to the top observation deck. The seats were full. He asked a family at a nice booth to please let us sit there, and they obliged. We invited him to sit with us, and offered to buy him breakfast for all his help. He only accepted a cup of coffee.<br>
<br>
<em>6</em> Sinan explained he was in Istanbul for a job interview with a cruise line. He had worked at major hotels in Saudi Arabia and London. From his torn jacket, he produced his prized possession—a Polaroid picture of himself with Sean Connery, taken in London. He accompanied us out onto the deck and told us all about the sites along the Bosporus. We spent hours on the ferry enjoying his company, and took Polaroid pictures of ourselves with him. He placed our picture together with the picture of Sean Connery.<br>
<br>
<em>7</em> When we arrived at our stop, Sinan didn’t even hesitate before grabbing our bags and carrying them down the stairs. After walking us to the train station, he quickly paid a porter to watch our bags, and we walked several blocks to a pizzeria for lunch. We insisted on buying lunch, but he ate very little. He carried our bags onto the train, and again asked people to move so we had perfect seats. We didn’t realize the ferry trip would be about three hours and the train trip another eight hours. While Eleanor napped, Sinan and I talked about every subject under the sun: politics, the role of women in Turkish society, religion, family, law, UFO’s (he was convinced, as he said many Turks were, that America had contact with aliens and that is why we had advanced technology). He was bright, funny, insightful, naive.<br>
<br>
<em>8</em> We had not finished our lunch, and he had the foresight to have our leftovers wrapped up. We ate cold pizza and the people he had kicked out of our seats shared apples and bread with us. We told him where we were headed, and he asked where we planned to stay once we arrived in Selcuk. He advised that we should get off several stops before the end of the line, to be closer to the bus station where we had to connect to our final destination.<br>
<br>
<em>9</em> By the time we arrived in Izmir, it was about eleven P.M. Sinan helped us off the train, picked up our bags, one on each shoulder, and started off down a busy expressway. It was all Eleanor and I could do to keep up with him, in the dark. We feared we had made a terrible mistake, entrusting this stranger with our belongings, and that he was now running off with all we had. I saw him turn off way ahead,&nbsp; and Eleanor and I were out of breath trying to catch up. When we turned the same corner, we saw Sinan standing in front of a magnificent Mercedes bus, with our luggage in front of him, and his arms spread out wide to stop the bus which was pulling out of the station.<br>
<br>
<em>10</em> The driver got out and yelled at him, and he answered back in Turkish. The driver opened the storage area, and threw our bags in. We arrived breathless and Sinan ushered us onto the bus, telling us we could buy the tickets on board. He gave us a hurried hug good-bye, and he was drenched in sweat from running with our luggage. The moment we were on the bus, it pulled out of the station. Sinan ran alongside the bus, waving excitedly. It was then I noticed tears running down my face. I had missed the chance to tell my new friend how much we appreciated his kindness and company. We waved back and he was gone.<br>
<br>
<em>11</em> Eleanor and I sat and looked at each other and at the same time said: “He was a guardian angel!” Had it not been for Sinan, we would not have purchased the proper tickets, we would have labored terribly with our bags, we would have missed out on good seating, and who knows what we would have done about food. We would have missed the delightful guided tour of the Bosporus on the ferry. We would have gotten off at the wrong station, had to hire a taxi, and would have missed the last bus to Selcuk that night, leaving us stranded without reservations near midnight in a strange city.<br>
<br>
<em>12</em> When we arrived in Selcuk, it was nearly midnight. The little town was asleep. There was no one in sight. We were the only passengers getting off at that town. There was a<br>
man leaning by a car. He eyed us carefully. We were instantly worried. The man approached and asked: “Are you the American women coming from Istanbul?” We were shocked. “How did you know?” we asked. He answered: “Because a man named Sinan&nbsp;called the hotel and told us you would be arriving on this bus. He said you’d be hungry and asked that we keep the kitchen open for you.” We couldn’t believe it. Even though he was no longer traveling with us, Sinan, our guardian angel, was still looking out for us.<br>
<br>
<em>13</em> The man took our luggage and drove us the few blocks to our hotel. The kitchen was open and waiting to serve us dinner.<br>
<br>
<em>14</em> That night, as I drifted off to sleep, I felt ashamed for having initially judged Sinan by his appearance. I was also sad that such a wonderful man had so few opportunities—his greatest desire was to someday come to the United States and work at a 7-11 store. Most importantly, I was thankful to have opened my eyes to discover kindness when and where it was least expected.<br>
<br>
<em>15</em> It was stunning how much a total stranger was willing to do for us, without expecting anything in return. Throughout our adventure in Turkey, we saw this same kindness repeated time and time again. We never knew his last name, but we will always remember him as “Sinan, the guardian angel.”<br>
