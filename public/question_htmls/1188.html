          <strong>Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Mildred D. Taylor&nbsp;</em><br><br>
The Great Faith Elementary and Secondary School, one of the largest black schools in the county, was a dismal end to an hour's journey. Consisting of four weather-beaten wooden houses on stilts of brick. 320 students, seven teachers, a principal, a caretaker, and the caretaker's cow, which kept the wide crabgrass lawn sufficiently clipped in spring and summer, the school was located near three plantations, the largest and closest by far being the Granger plantation. Most of the students were from families that sharecropped on Granger land, and the others mainly from Montier and Harrison plantation families. Because the students were needed in the fields from early spring when the cotton was planted until after most of the cotton had been picked in the fall, the school adjusted its terms accordingly, beginning in October and dismissing in March. But even so, after today, a number of the older students would not be seen again for a month or two, not until the last puff of cotton had been gleaned from the fields, and eventually most would drop out of school altogether. Because of this, the classes in the higher grades grew smaller with each passing year.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The class buildings, with their backs practically against the forest wall, formed a semicircle facing a small one-room church at the opposite edge of the compound. It was to this church that many of the school's students and their parents belonged. As we arrived, the enormous iron bell in the church belfry was ringing vigorously, warning the milling students that <span class="txt-underline"><strong>only five minutes of freedom remained</strong></span>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Little Man immediately pushed his way across the lawn to the well. Stacey and T.J., ignoring the rest of us now that they were on the school grounds, wandered off to be with the other seventh-grade boys, and Christopher-John and Claude rushed to reunite with their classmates of last year. Left alone, I dragged slowly to the building that held the first four grades and sat on the bottom step. Plopping my pencils and notebook into the dirt, I propped my elbows on my knees and rested my chin in the palms of my hands.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Hey, Cassie,' said Mary Lou Wellever, the principal's daughter, as she flounced by in a new yellow dress.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Hey, yourself,' I said, scowling so ferociously that she kept on walking. I stared after her a moment noting that she would have on a new dress. Certainly no one else did. Patches on faded pants and dresses abounded on boys and girls come so recently from the heat of the cotton fields. Girls stood awkwardly, afraid to sit, and boys pulled restlessly at starched, high buttoned collars. Those students fortunate enough to have shoes, hopped from one pinched foot to the other. Tonight, the Sunday clothes would be wrapped in newspaper and hung for Sunday and the shoes would be packed away to be brought out again only when the weather turned so cold that bare feet could no longer traverse the frozen roads: but for today we all suffered.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Mildred D. Taylor&nbsp;</em><br><br>
The Great Faith Elementary and Secondary School, one of the largest black schools in the county, was a dismal end to an hour's journey. Consisting of four weather-beaten wooden houses on stilts of brick. 320 students, seven teachers, a principal, a caretaker, and the caretaker's cow, which kept the wide crabgrass lawn sufficiently clipped in spring and summer, the school was located near three plantations, the largest and closest by far being the Granger plantation. Most of the students were from families that sharecropped on Granger land, and the others mainly from Montier and Harrison plantation families. Because the students were needed in the fields from early spring when the cotton was planted until after most of the cotton had been picked in the fall, the school adjusted its terms accordingly, beginning in October and dismissing in March. But even so, after today, a number of the older students would not be seen again for a month or two, not until the last puff of cotton had been gleaned from the fields, and eventually most would drop out of school altogether. Because of this, the classes in the higher grades grew smaller with each passing year.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The class buildings, with their backs practically against the forest wall, formed a semicircle facing a small one-room church at the opposite edge of the compound. It was to this church that many of the school's students and their parents belonged. As we arrived, the enormous iron bell in the church belfry was ringing vigorously, warning the milling students that <span class="txt-underline"><strong>only five minutes of freedom remained</strong></span>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Little Man immediately pushed his way across the lawn to the well. Stacey and T.J., ignoring the rest of us now that they were on the school grounds, wandered off to be with the other seventh-grade boys, and Christopher-John and Claude rushed to reunite with their classmates of last year. Left alone, I dragged slowly to the building that held the first four grades and sat on the bottom step. Plopping my pencils and notebook into the dirt, I propped my elbows on my knees and rested my chin in the palms of my hands.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Hey, Cassie,' said Mary Lou Wellever, the principal's daughter, as she flounced by in a new yellow dress.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>'Hey, yourself,' I said, scowling so ferociously that she kept on walking. I stared after her a moment noting that she would have on a new dress. Certainly no one else did. Patches on faded pants and dresses abounded on boys and girls come so recently from the heat of the cotton fields. Girls stood awkwardly, afraid to sit, and boys pulled restlessly at starched, high buttoned collars. Those students fortunate enough to have shoes, hopped from one pinched foot to the other. Tonight, the Sunday clothes would be wrapped in newspaper and hung for Sunday and the shoes would be packed away to be brought out again only when the weather turned so cold that bare feet could no longer traverse the frozen roads: but for today we all suffered.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the poem below by Wilfred Owen then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>Spring Offensive</strong><br><br>
Halted against the shade of a last hill,&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup><br>
They fed, and, lying easy, were at ease<br>
And, finding comfortable chests and knees<br>
Carelessly slept.&nbsp; &nbsp; <sup>4</sup><br>
But many there stood still<br>
To face the stark, blank sky beyond the ridge,<br>
Knowing their feet had come to the end of the world.<br>
Marvelling they stood, and watched the long grass swirled<br>
By the May breeze, murmurous with wasp and midge,<br>
For though the summer oozed into their veins<br>
Like the injected drug for their bones’ pains,<br>
Sharp on their souls hung the imminent line of grass,<br>
Fearfully flashed the sky’s mysterious glass.</p>
        <p>Hour after hour they ponder the warm field—<br>
And the far valley behind, where the buttercups<br>
Had blessed with gold their slow boots coming up,<br>
Where even the little brambles would not yield,<br>
But clutched and clung to them like sorrowing hands;<br>
They breathe like trees unstirred.<br>
Till like a cold gust thrilled the little word<br>
At which each body and its soul begird<br>
And tighten them for battle. No alarms<br>
Of bugles, no high flags, no clamorous haste—<br>
Only a lift and flare of eyes that faced<br>
The sun, like a friend with whom their love is done.<br>
O larger shone that smile against the sun,—<br>
Mightier than his whose bounty these have spurned.</p>
        <p>So, soon they topped the hill, and raced together<br>
Over an open stretch of herb and heather<br>
Exposed. And instantly<span class="txt-underline"><strong> the whole sky burned<br>
With fury against them</strong></span>; and soft sudden cups<br>
Opened in thousands for their blood; and the green slopes<br>
Chasmed and steepened sheer to infinite space.</p>
        <p>Of them who running on that last high place<br>
Leapt to swift unseen bullets, or went up<br>
On the hot blast and fury of hell’s upsurge,<br>
Or plunged and fell away past this world’s verge,<br>
Some say God caught them even before they fell.<br>
But what say such as from existence’ brink<br>
Ventured but drave too swift to sink.<br>
The few who rushed in the body to enter hell,<br>
And there out-fiending all its fiends and flames<br>
With superhuman inhumanities,<br>
Long-famous glories, immemorial shames—<br>
And crawling slowly back, have by degrees<br>
Regained cool peaceful air in wonder—<br>
Why speak they not of comrades that went under?</p>

They fed, and, lying easy, were at ease<br>
And, finding comfortable chests and knees<br>
Carelessly slept.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup><br>
But many there stood still<br>
To face the stark, blank sky beyond the ridge,<br>
Knowing their feet had come to the end of the world.<br>
Marvelling they stood, and watched the long grass swirled<br>
By the May breeze, murmurous with wasp and midge,<br>
For though the summer oozed into their veins<br>
Like the injected drug for their bones’ pains,<br>
Sharp on their souls hung the imminent line of grass,<br>
Fearfully flashed the sky’s mysterious glass.</p>
        <p>Hour after hour they ponder the warm field—<br>
And the far valley behind, where the buttercups<br>
Had blessed with gold their slow boots coming up,<br>
Where even the little brambles would not yield,<br>
But clutched and clung to them like sorrowing hands;<br>
They breathe like trees unstirred.<br>
Till like a cold gust thrilled the little word<br>
At which each body and its soul begird<br>
And tighten them for battle. No alarms<br>
Of bugles, no high flags, no clamorous haste—<br>
Only a lift and flare of eyes that faced<br>
The sun, like a friend with whom their love is done.<br>
O larger shone that smile against the sun,—<br>

On the hot blast and fury of hell’s upsurge,<br>
Or plunged and fell away past this world’s verge,<br>
Some say God caught them even before they fell.<br>

Ventured but drave too swift to sink.<br>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Post War Migration in Australia&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
From the 1950s, Australia began to relax its ‘White Australia’ policy. In 1956, nonEuropean residents were allowed to apply for citizenship. <strong>12 ……….</strong> with a non-European country, in this case, Turkey.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then in 1972, Australians elected their first Labour government since 1948. As Minister for Immigration, Al Grassby radically changed official policy. The quota system, based on country of origin and preservation of racial ‘homogeneity’, was replaced by ‘structured selection’. <strong>13 ……….</strong> rather than country of origin. In 1973, declaring Australia a ‘multicultural’ society, Al Grassby announced that every relic of past ethnic or racial discrimination had been abolished. The Australian Citizenship Act of that year declared that all migrants were to be accorded equal treatment.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>14 ………. </strong>More than 25 000 arrived in the next thirty years, initially from East Timor and then from Vietnam, China and most recently, the Middle East. All are subject to compulsory internment while their claims of refugee status are assessed. Although Australia has been criticised by the United Nations and Amnesty International for the injustice of interring all illegal migrants, particularly children, <strong>15 ……….</strong></p>

From the 1950s, Australia began to relax its ‘White Australia’ policy. In 1956, nonEuropean residents were allowed to apply for citizenship. <strong>12 ……….</strong> with a non-European country, in this case, Turkey.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then in 1972, Australians elected their first Labour government since 1948. As Minister for Immigration, Al Grassby radically changed official policy. The quota system, based on country of origin and preservation of racial ‘homogeneity’, was replaced by ‘structured selection’. <strong>13 ……….</strong> rather than country of origin. In 1973, declaring Australia a ‘multicultural’ society, Al Grassby announced that every relic of past ethnic or racial discrimination had been abolished. The Australian Citizenship Act of that year declared that all migrants were to be accorded equal treatment.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>14 ………. </strong>More than 25 000 arrived in the next thirty years, initially from East Timor and then from Vietnam, China and most recently, the Middle East. All are subject to compulsory internment while their claims of refugee status are assessed. Although Australia has been criticised by the United Nations and Amnesty International for the injustice of interring all illegal migrants, particularly children, <strong>15 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>In 1988, the Fitzgerald Inquiry led to further changes in migration with a move away from ‘family reunion’ towards an emphasis on skilled and business categories. The assisted passage scheme had ended in 1981 and only refugees are given any level of support on their arrival in Australia. In 1996, for the first time in Australia’s migration history, the number of British migrants arriving fell to second place behind New Zealand. <strong>16 ……….</strong> today, after New Zealand, it is people from China, South Africa and India. <strong>17 ……….</strong> In 2006, the fastest growing refugee group was from Sudan followed by Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>

From the 1950s, Australia began to relax its ‘White Australia’ policy. In 1956, nonEuropean residents were allowed to apply for citizenship. <strong>12 ……….</strong> with a non-European country, in this case, Turkey.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then in 1972, Australians elected their first Labour government since 1948. As Minister for Immigration, Al Grassby radically changed official policy. The quota system, based on country of origin and preservation of racial ‘homogeneity’, was replaced by ‘structured selection’. <strong>13 ……….</strong> rather than country of origin. In 1973, declaring Australia a ‘multicultural’ society, Al Grassby announced that every relic of past ethnic or racial discrimination had been abolished. The Australian Citizenship Act of that year declared that all migrants were to be accorded equal treatment.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>14 ………. </strong>More than 25 000 arrived in the next thirty years, initially from East Timor and then from Vietnam, China and most recently, the Middle East. All are subject to compulsory internment while their claims of refugee status are assessed. Although Australia has been criticised by the United Nations and Amnesty International for the injustice of interring all illegal migrants, particularly children, <strong>15 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>In 1988, the Fitzgerald Inquiry led to further changes in migration with a move away from ‘family reunion’ towards an emphasis on skilled and business categories. The assisted passage scheme had ended in 1981 and only refugees are given any level of support on their arrival in Australia. In 1996, for the first time in Australia’s migration history, the number of British migrants arriving fell to second place behind New Zealand. <strong>16 ……….</strong> today, after New Zealand, it is people from China, South Africa and India. <strong>17 ……….</strong> In 2006, the fastest growing refugee group was from Sudan followed by Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>

Emotions give us clues about how to respond to things happening in our environment: Is he dangerous? Does she love me? Can I trust him?<br>
<br>
But can we trust our perceptions as we travel around the globe? Can Japanese tourists identify threatening people in Canada? Can a man from Saudi Arabia tell the difference between anger and disgust in Argentina?<br>
<br>
A long line of research suggests the answer is basically “yes”—humans appear to express certain fundamental emotions through universal facial expressions that are usually recognisable to people from other cultures. This seems to be true even across cultures that have had little or no exposure to each other.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B&nbsp;</strong>^}<br>
Jessica Tracy, a University of British Columbia researcher who studies emotions—pride, in particular—agrees that studying children in emotion recognition tasks can be tricky, especially when children are from small-scale, non-literate societies.<br>
<br>
“I don’t think we really know how early children learn how to pair emotion words with their sense of what an emotion is,” she says. “The idea behind universality of emotion isn’t saying that every child is born knowing that a word goes with a particular emotional expression; it’s saying people evolved to understand the emotion behind an expression.”<br>
<br>
That’s why researchers who work with children—and even with adults in these kinds of societies—usually have to come up with more ingenious ways to study what they understand about an emotional expression, she adds. For example, in past research many scientists have used stories to give context for an emotion, perhaps by asking a participant to say what face in a group of photos looks like someone who is being attacked by a wild boar.<br>
<br>
{^ <strong>Extract C</strong> ^}<br>
<em><strong>How do people feel?</strong></em><br>
<br>
“At first, the question seemed flaky,” said Orlagh O’Brien. But for the quiet, withdrawn graphic designer, it was an earnest search for connection. She wondered whether others also felt emotions as physical sensations — anger as a tightness in the gut, happiness as a warm tingle. “We think we’re trapped with a whole world of individuality inside of ourselves, and I had this sense that we have more in common than we realise.”<br>
<br>
So, O’Brien led a survey of about 250 people over the course of three months. After asking respondents to describe five emotions in drawings, colours and words, she created Emotionally Vague, an online data visualisation of the results. Sure enough, distinct patterns emerged. For example, she asked respondents to draw lines on a human silhouette to illustrate each emotion. The more pleasurable the emotion, the more the lines radiated outward; the more painful the emotion, the more they contracted inward.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D&nbsp;</strong>^}<br>
In a study recently published in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences, more than 700 participants were shown two blank silhouettes alongside words, movies, stories, and facial expressions. They were then asked to rate how they felt and where on their body they felt it, corresponding to the silhouettes. This created an overall picture of bodily responses to emotions, with depression and sadness leading to numbed feelings in the extremities and anxiety centered in the torso.<br>
<br>
The researchers acknowledge that "[all] cultures have body-related expressions for describing emotional states" — such as "butterflies in the stomach" — that don't necessarily have an actual physiological link, and thus, some of the feelings experienced by the participants could be societally influenced rather than organic. But, even though they can't rule out such a possibility, the authors say the results of the study don't agree with that argument. Researchers claim they found a strong consensus in physical responses to a given emotion in people from a range of cultural and linguistic backgrounds, suggesting that these are "universal sensation patterns triggered by activation of emotion systems."</div>

              <strong>Extract B&nbsp;</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Jessica Tracy, a University of British Columbia researcher who studies emotions—pride, in particular—agrees that studying children in emotion recognition tasks can be tricky, especially when children are from small-scale, non-literate societies.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>“I don’t think we really know how early children learn how to pair emotion words with their sense of what an emotion is,” she says. “The idea behind universality of emotion isn’t saying that every child is born knowing that a word goes with a particular emotional expression; it’s saying people evolved to understand the emotion behind an expression.”&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>That’s why researchers who work with children—and even with adults in these kinds of societies—usually have to come up with more ingenious ways to study what they understand about an emotional expression, she adds. For example, in past research many scientists have used stories to give context for an emotion, perhaps by asking a participant to say what face in a group of photos looks like someone who is being attacked by a wild boar.</p>

              <em>How do people feel?&nbsp;</em>
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>“At first, the question seemed flaky,” said Orlagh O’Brien. But for the quiet, withdrawn graphic designer, it was an earnest search for connection. She wondered whether others also felt emotions as physical sensations — anger as a tightness in the gut, happiness as a warm tingle. “We think we’re trapped with a whole world of individuality inside of ourselves, and I had this sense that we have more in common than we realise.”&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>So, O’Brien led a survey of about 250 people over the course of three months. After asking respondents to describe five emotions in drawings, colours and words, she created Emotionally Vague, an online data visualisation of the results. Sure enough, distinct patterns emerged. For example, she asked respondents to draw lines on a human silhouette to illustrate each emotion. The more pleasurable the emotion, the more the lines radiated outward; the more painful the emotion, the more they contracted inward.</p>

            <p>In a study recently published in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences</em>, more than 700 participants were shown two blank silhouettes alongside words, movies, stories, and facial expressions.

              <strong>Extract A</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Emotions give us clues about how to respond to things happening in our environment: <em>Is he dangerous? Does she love me? Can I trust him?</em></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>But can we trust our perceptions as we travel around the globe? Can Japanese tourists identify threatening people in Canada? Can a man from Saudi Arabia tell the difference between anger and disgust in Argentina?</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>A long line of research suggests the answer is basically “yes”—humans appear to express certain fundamental emotions through universal facial expressions that are usually recognisable to people from other cultures. This seems to be true even across cultures that have had little or no exposure to each other.</p>

              <em>How do people feel?&nbsp;</em>
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>“At first, the question seemed flaky,” said Orlagh O’Brien. But for the quiet, withdrawn graphic designer, it was an earnest search for connection. She wondered whether others also felt emotions as physical sensations — anger as a tightness in the gut, happiness as a warm tingle. “We think we’re trapped with a whole world of individuality inside of ourselves, and I had this sense that we have more in common than we realise.”&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>So, O’Brien led a survey of about 250 people over the course of three months. After asking respondents to describe five emotions in drawings, colours and words, she created Emotionally Vague, an online data visualisation of the results. Sure enough, distinct patterns emerged. For example, she asked respondents to draw lines on a human silhouette to illustrate each emotion. The more pleasurable the emotion, the more the lines radiated outward; the more painful the emotion, the more they contracted inward.</p>

            <p>In a study recently published in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences</em>, more than 700 participants were shown two blank silhouettes alongside words, movies, stories, and facial expressions.

            </p>
            <p>Emotions give us clues about how to respond to things happening in our environment: <em>Is he dangerous? Does she love me? Can I trust him?</em></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>But can we trust our perceptions as we travel around the globe? Can Japanese tourists identify threatening people in Canada? Can a man from Saudi Arabia tell the difference between anger and disgust in Argentina?</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>A long line of research suggests the answer is basically “yes”—humans appear to express certain fundamental emotions through universal facial expressions that are usually recognisable to people from other cultures. This seems to be true even across cultures that have had little or no exposure to each other.</p>

            <p>Jessica Tracy, a University of British Columbia researcher who studies emotions—pride, in particular—agrees that studying children in emotion recognition tasks can be tricky, especially when children are from small-scale, non-literate societies.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>“I don’t think we really know how early children learn how to pair emotion words with their sense of what an emotion is,” she says. “The idea behind universality of emotion isn’t saying that every child is born knowing that a word goes with a particular emotional expression; it’s saying people evolved to understand the emotion behind an expression.”&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>That’s why researchers who work with children—and even with adults in these kinds of societies—usually have to come up with more ingenious ways to study what they understand about an emotional expression, she adds. For example, in past research many scientists have used stories to give context for an emotion, perhaps by asking a participant to say what face in a group of photos looks like someone who is being attacked by a wild boar.</p>

            <p>In a study recently published in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences</em>, more than 700 participants were shown two blank silhouettes alongside words, movies, stories, and facial expressions. They were then asked to rate how they felt and where on their body they felt it, corresponding to the silhouettes.

            <p>The researchers acknowledge that "[all] cultures have body-related expressions for describing emotional states" — such as "butterflies in the stomach" — that don't necessarily have an actual physiological link, and thus, some of the feelings experienced by the participants could be societally influenced rather than organic. But, even though they can't rule out such a possibility, the authors say the results of the study don't agree with that argument. Researchers claim they found a strong consensus in physical responses to a given emotion in people from a range of cultural and linguistic backgrounds, suggesting that these are "universal sensation patterns triggered by activation of emotion systems."</p>

              <strong>Extract A</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Emotions give us clues about how to respond to things happening in our environment: <em>Is he dangerous? Does she love me? Can I trust him?</em></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>But can we trust our perceptions as we travel around the globe? Can Japanese tourists identify threatening people in Canada? Can a man from Saudi Arabia tell the difference between anger and disgust in Argentina?</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>A long line of research suggests the answer is basically “yes”—humans appear to express certain fundamental emotions through universal facial expressions that are usually recognisable to people from other cultures. This seems to be true even across cultures that have had little or no exposure to each other.</p>

              <strong>Extract B&nbsp;</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Jessica Tracy, a University of British Columbia researcher who studies emotions—pride, in particular—agrees that studying children in emotion recognition tasks can be tricky, especially when children are from small-scale, non-literate societies.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>“I don’t think we really know how early children learn how to pair emotion words with their sense of what an emotion is,” she says. “The idea behind universality of emotion isn’t saying that every child is born knowing that a word goes with a particular emotional expression; it’s saying people evolved to understand the emotion behind an expression.”&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>That’s why researchers who work with children—and even with adults in these kinds of societies—usually have to come up with more ingenious ways to study what they understand about an emotional expression, she adds. For example, in past research many scientists have used stories to give context for an emotion, perhaps by asking a participant to say what face in a group of photos looks like someone who is being attacked by a wild boar.</p>

              <em>How do people feel?&nbsp;</em>
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>“At first, the question seemed flaky,” said Orlagh O’Brien. But for the quiet, withdrawn graphic designer, it was an earnest search for connection. She wondered whether others also felt emotions as physical sensations — anger as a tightness in the gut, happiness as a warm tingle. “We think we’re trapped with a whole world of individuality inside of ourselves, and I had this sense that we have more in common than we realise.”&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>So, O’Brien led a survey of about 250 people over the course of three months. After asking respondents to describe five emotions in drawings, colours and words, she created Emotionally Vague, an online data visualisation of the results. Sure enough, distinct patterns emerged. For example, she asked respondents to draw lines on a human silhouette to illustrate each emotion. The more pleasurable the emotion, the more the lines radiated outward; the more painful the emotion, the more they contracted inward.</p>
