        <p><strong>RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI&nbsp;</strong><br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="txt-rgt">
          <em>by Rudyard Kipling&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This is the story of a great war. Rikki-tikki-tavi fought this war in a family’s home in India. He had some help, but he did the real fighting. Rikki-tikki was a mongoose. His name came from the sound he made going into battle: Rikk-tikk-tikki-tikki-tchk! When Rikki was small, a flood swept him away from his home and family. A little boy named Teddy found him half-dead and brought him home. Teddy and his mother warmed the mongoose till he woke up. Although the mother had a soft spot for animals, she wasn’t sure she wanted a wild animal in her house. But Teddy’s father convinced her that a mongoose was the perfect house pet. After all, deadly snakes lived right in their garden, and mongooses were snake killers.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Rikki-tikki soon felt better, and he spent the rest of the day and the next morning exploring Teddy’s house. In the yard he heard the sad voices of two tailorbirds, Darzee and his wife. The birds were crying because a cobra named Nag had eaten one of their babies. Just then, Nag himself appeared. He was a huge black cobra, five feet long.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“<span class="txt-underline"><strong>I am Nag</strong></span>,” he said. “<span class="txt-underline"><strong>Look and be afraid!</strong></span>” Though Rikki had never met a cobra, he knew that a mongoose’s job was to kill snakes. Nag knew that, too, and the cobra was afraid. Rikki-tikki replied, “Well. Do you think you should eat baby birds?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Nag then played a trick on Rikki-tikki. “Let’s talk,” he said. “If you eat eggs, why shouldn’t I eat birds?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Behind you! Look behind you!” cried Darzee.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Rikki-tikki jumped high up in the air. He just missed being struck by Nag’s wife Nagaina, who had slithered up behind him. Rikki landed on Nagaina’s back and bit her, but she struggled free. When a mongoose’s eyes grow red, it means he is angry. Now Rikki-tikki’s eyes grew very red. But Nag and Nagaina were gone.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Teddy ran down the path to pet Rikki-tikki. But as Teddy bent down, something moved in the dust. It was Karait, a small but deadly snake. Rikki’s eyes glowed red. Teddy shouted to his parents. His father ran out with a stick. But Rikki-tikki had already killed Karait. <strong><span class="txt-underline">Teddy’s father beat the dead Karait</span></strong>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Why is he doing that?” thought Rikki-tikki. “I have already killed the snake.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The family treated Rikki like a hero. He enjoyed the attention. But he did not forget about Nag and Nagaina. That night, Rikki wandered around inside the house. He met Chuchundra the muskrat, a little ratlike animal. Chuchundra was very scared.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Don’t kill me!” cried Chuchundra.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Why would I kill you?” said Rikki-tikki scornfully.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I don’t know,” said Chuchundra. “Maybe Nag will think I am you some dark night, and he will kill me. My cousin Chua, the rat, told me —”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Told you what?” said Rikki-tikki.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Chuchundra was terrified, but he told Rikki that Nag and Nagaina were planning an attack that very night. Just then, Rikki-tikki heard a soft scratch-scratch coming from the bathroom. Rikki-tikki moved quietly into the bathroom. There he heard Nag and Nagaina whispering in the drainpipe.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Go in quietly, and kill the big man first,” said Nagaina.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Are you sure we should kill the people?” said Nag.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Of course. The mongoose will leave if we kill them. Then we can be king and queen of the garden, and we will have a safe hatching ground for our eggs,” said Nagaina. She and Nag had eggs that were almost ready to hatch.</p>

        <p><strong>RIKKI-TIKKI-TAVI&nbsp;</strong><br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="txt-rgt">
          <em>by Rudyard Kipling&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This is the story of a great war. Rikki-tikki-tavi fought this war in a family’s home in India. He had some help, but he did the real fighting. Rikki-tikki was a mongoose. His name came from the sound he made going into battle: Rikk-tikk-tikki-tikki-tchk! When Rikki was small, a flood swept him away from his home and family. A little boy named Teddy found him half-dead and brought him home. Teddy and his mother warmed the mongoose till he woke up. Although the mother had a soft spot for animals, she wasn’t sure she wanted a wild animal in her house. But Teddy’s father convinced her that a mongoose was the perfect house pet. After all, deadly snakes lived right in their garden, and mongooses were snake killers.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Rikki-tikki soon felt better, and he spent the rest of the day and the next morning exploring Teddy’s house. In the yard he heard the sad voices of two tailorbirds, Darzee and his wife. The birds were crying because a cobra named Nag had eaten one of their babies. Just then, Nag himself appeared. He was a huge black cobra, five feet long.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“<span class="txt-underline"><strong>I am Nag</strong></span>,” he said. “<span class="txt-underline"><strong>Look and be afraid!</strong></span>” Though Rikki had never met a cobra, he knew that a mongoose’s job was to kill snakes. Nag knew that, too, and the cobra was afraid. Rikki-tikki replied, “Well. Do you think you should eat baby birds?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Nag then played a trick on Rikki-tikki. “Let’s talk,” he said. “If you eat eggs, why shouldn’t I eat birds?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Behind you! Look behind you!” cried Darzee.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Rikki-tikki jumped high up in the air. He just missed being struck by Nag’s wife Nagaina, who had slithered up behind him. Rikki landed on Nagaina’s back and bit her, but she struggled free. When a mongoose’s eyes grow red, it means he is angry. Now Rikki-tikki’s eyes grew very red. But Nag and Nagaina were gone.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Teddy ran down the path to pet Rikki-tikki. But as Teddy bent down, something moved in the dust. It was Karait, a small but deadly snake. Rikki’s eyes glowed red. Teddy shouted to his parents. His father ran out with a stick. But Rikki-tikki had already killed Karait. <strong><span class="txt-underline">Teddy’s father beat the dead Karait</span></strong>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Why is he doing that?” thought Rikki-tikki. “I have already killed the snake.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The family treated Rikki like a hero. He enjoyed the attention. But he did not forget about Nag and Nagaina. That night, Rikki wandered around inside the house. He met Chuchundra the muskrat, a little ratlike animal. Chuchundra was very scared.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Don’t kill me!” cried Chuchundra.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Why would I kill you?” said Rikki-tikki scornfully.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“I don’t know,” said Chuchundra. “Maybe Nag will think I am you some dark night, and he will kill me. My cousin Chua, the rat, told me —”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Told you what?” said Rikki-tikki.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Chuchundra was terrified, but he told Rikki that Nag and Nagaina were planning an attack that very night. Just then, Rikki-tikki heard a soft scratch-scratch coming from the bathroom. Rikki-tikki moved quietly into the bathroom. There he heard Nag and Nagaina whispering in the drainpipe.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Go in quietly, and kill the big man first,” said Nagaina.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Are you sure we should kill the people?” said Nag.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Of course. The mongoose will leave if we kill them. Then we can be king and queen of the garden, and we will have a safe hatching ground for our eggs,” said Nagaina. She and Nag had eggs that were almost ready to hatch.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>The Sydney Opera House&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
“It stands by itself as one of the indisputable masterpieces of human creativity, not only in the 20th century but in the history of humankind.” Expert evaluation report to the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, 2007.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Sydney Opera House has fused ancient and modernist influences. It was built on a site sacred to the local Gadigal people for thousands of years, <strong>15 ………. </strong>Its design suggests inspiration and imagination. As Pritzker Prize judge Frank Gehry said, “Utzon made a building well ahead of its time, far ahead of available technology. It is a building that has changed the image of an entire country.”</p>
        <p>It was built to “help mould a better and more enlightened community,” said Premier Joseph Cahill in 1954. Today, it is Australia’s number one tourist destination. It welcomes more than 8.2 million visitors a year and is one of the world’s busiest performing arts centres. <strong>16 ………. </strong>The shows come from the work of the seven flagship arts companies to which it is home. It also features First Nations’ arts and culture, talks and ideas, theatre and dance and classical and contemporary music.</p>
        <p>The breadth of those experiences reflects our visionary 1961 Act of Paliament. This charges the Opera House not only with the promotion of artistic taste across all art forms, but also “scientific research into, and the encouragement of, new and improved forms of entertainment.” In 1955, Bennelong Point was declared the site for the proposed new opera house. <strong>17 ………. </strong>The competition guidelines were contained in a 25-page booklet known as the Brown Book. <strong>18 ……….</strong> Competitors were required to register for the competition by paying a fee of 10 Australian pounds.</p>
        <p>Unique among the entries, Utzon’s entry placed the concert halls side by side. Their shellshaped roofs cantilevered out over the end of Bennelong Point, evoking Sydney’s cliffs and the sails on its harbour. It was a sculptural response to both the competition guidelines and the location. It was alone in fully realising the potential of its unique harbour-side location. The building’s design was inspired - entirely unlike anything that had been seen before. <strong>19 ………. </strong>Pressures piled upon its architect, Jørn Utzon, who left Australia midway through construction, never to return to see the building completed.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Utzon’s masterpiece would define his career, and redefine the image of Australia, both to itself and to the world. An exercise in nation building it was an extraordinary collective act of dreaming in public. It was a work of art built for the performance of works of art. <strong>20 ………. </strong>Realising the dream involved us all - visionaries and pragmatists, politicians and architects, engineers, artists and most fundamentally, the people of Australia.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>The Sydney Opera House&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
“It stands by itself as one of the indisputable masterpieces of human creativity, not only in the 20th century but in the history of humankind.” Expert evaluation report to the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, 2007.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Sydney Opera House has fused ancient and modernist influences. It was built on a site sacred to the local Gadigal people for thousands of years, <strong>15 ………. </strong>Its design suggests inspiration and imagination. As Pritzker Prize judge Frank Gehry said, “Utzon made a building well ahead of its time, far ahead of available technology. It is a building that has changed the image of an entire country.”</p>
        <p>It was built to “help mould a better and more enlightened community,” said Premier Joseph Cahill in 1954. Today, it is Australia’s number one tourist destination. It welcomes more than 8.2 million visitors a year and is one of the world’s busiest performing arts centres. <strong>16 ………. </strong>The shows come from the work of the seven flagship arts companies to which it is home. It also features First Nations’ arts and culture, talks and ideas, theatre and dance and classical and contemporary music.</p>
        <p>The breadth of those experiences reflects our visionary 1961 Act of Paliament. This charges the Opera House not only with the promotion of artistic taste across all art forms, but also “scientific research into, and the encouragement of, new and improved forms of entertainment.” In 1955, Bennelong Point was declared the site for the proposed new opera house. <strong>17 ………. </strong>The competition guidelines were contained in a 25-page booklet known as the Brown Book. <strong>18 ……….</strong> Competitors were required to register for the competition by paying a fee of 10 Australian pounds.</p>
        <p>Unique among the entries, Utzon’s entry placed the concert halls side by side. Their shellshaped roofs cantilevered out over the end of Bennelong Point, evoking Sydney’s cliffs and the sails on its harbour. It was a sculptural response to both the competition guidelines and the location. It was alone in fully realising the potential of its unique harbour-side location. The building’s design was inspired - entirely unlike anything that had been seen before. <strong>19 ………. </strong>Pressures piled upon its architect, Jørn Utzon, who left Australia midway through construction, never to return to see the building completed.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Utzon’s masterpiece would define his career, and redefine the image of Australia, both to itself and to the world. An exercise in nation building it was an extraordinary collective act of dreaming in public. It was a work of art built for the performance of works of art. <strong>20 ………. </strong>Realising the dream involved us all - visionaries and pragmatists, politicians and architects, engineers, artists and most fundamentally, the people of Australia.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Unique among the entries, Utzon’s entry placed the concert halls side by side. Their shellshaped roofs cantilevered out over the end of Bennelong Point, evoking Sydney’s cliffs and the sails on its harbour. It was a sculptural response to both the competition guidelines and the location. It was alone in fully realising the potential of its unique harbour-side location. The building’s design was inspired - entirely unlike anything that had been seen before. <strong>19 ………. </strong>Pressures piled upon its architect, Jørn Utzon, who left Australia midway through construction, never to return to see the building completed.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Utzon’s masterpiece would define his career, and redefine the image of Australia, both to itself and to the world. An exercise in nation building it was an extraordinary collective act of dreaming in public. It was a work of art built for the performance of works of art. <strong>20 ………. </strong>Realising the dream involved us all - visionaries and pragmatists, politicians and architects, engineers, artists and most fundamentally, the people of Australia.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>The Sydney Opera House&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
“It stands by itself as one of the indisputable masterpieces of human creativity, not only in the 20th century but in the history of humankind.” Expert evaluation report to the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, 2007.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Sydney Opera House has fused ancient and modernist influences. It was built on a site sacred to the local Gadigal people for thousands of years, <strong>15 ………. </strong>Its design suggests inspiration and imagination. As Pritzker Prize judge Frank Gehry said, “Utzon made a building well ahead of its time, far ahead of available technology. It is a building that has changed the image of an entire country.”</p>
        <p>It was built to “help mould a better and more enlightened community,” said Premier Joseph Cahill in 1954. Today, it is Australia’s number one tourist destination. It welcomes more than 8.2 million visitors a year and is one of the world’s busiest performing arts centres. <strong>16 ………. </strong>The shows come from the work of the seven flagship arts companies to which it is home. It also features First Nations’ arts and culture, talks and ideas, theatre and dance and classical and contemporary music.</p>
        <p>The breadth of those experiences reflects our visionary 1961 Act of Paliament. This charges the Opera House not only with the promotion of artistic taste across all art forms, but also “scientific research into, and the encouragement of, new and improved forms of entertainment.” In 1955, Bennelong Point was declared the site for the proposed new opera house. <strong>17 ………. </strong>The competition guidelines were contained in a 25-page booklet known as the Brown Book. <strong>18 ……….</strong> Competitors were required to register for the competition by paying a fee of 10 Australian pounds.</p>
        <p>Unique among the entries, Utzon’s entry placed the concert halls side by side. Their shellshaped roofs cantilevered out over the end of Bennelong Point, evoking Sydney’s cliffs and the sails on its harbour. It was a sculptural response to both the competition guidelines and the location. It was alone in fully realising the potential of its unique harbour-side location. The building’s design was inspired - entirely unlike anything that had been seen before. <strong>19 ………. </strong>Pressures piled upon its architect, Jørn Utzon, who left Australia midway through construction, never to return to see the building completed.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Utzon’s masterpiece would define his career, and redefine the image of Australia, both to itself and to the world. An exercise in nation building it was an extraordinary collective act of dreaming in public. It was a work of art built for the performance of works of art. <strong>20 ………. </strong>Realising the dream involved us all - visionaries and pragmatists, politicians and architects, engineers, artists and most fundamentally, the people of Australia.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>The Sydney Opera House&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
“It stands by itself as one of the indisputable masterpieces of human creativity, not only in the 20th century but in the history of humankind.” Expert evaluation report to the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, 2007.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Sydney Opera House has fused ancient and modernist influences. It was built on a site sacred to the local Gadigal people for thousands of years, <strong>15 ………. </strong>Its design suggests inspiration and imagination. As Pritzker Prize judge Frank Gehry said, “Utzon made a building well ahead of its time, far ahead of available technology. It is a building that has changed the image of an entire country.”</p>
        <p>It was built to “help mould a better and more enlightened community,” said Premier Joseph Cahill in 1954. Today, it is Australia’s number one tourist destination. It welcomes more than 8.2 million visitors a year and is one of the world’s busiest performing arts centres. <strong>16 ………. </strong>The shows come from the work of the seven flagship arts companies to which it is home. It also features First Nations’ arts and culture, talks and ideas, theatre and dance and classical and contemporary music.</p>
        <p>The breadth of those experiences reflects our visionary 1961 Act of Paliament. This charges the Opera House not only with the promotion of artistic taste across all art forms, but also “scientific research into, and the encouragement of, new and improved forms of entertainment.” In 1955, Bennelong Point was declared the site for the proposed new opera house. <strong>17 ………. </strong>The competition guidelines were contained in a 25-page booklet known as the Brown Book. <strong>18 ……….</strong> Competitors were required to register for the competition by paying a fee of 10 Australian pounds.</p>
        <p>Unique among the entries, Utzon’s entry placed the concert halls side by side. Their shellshaped roofs cantilevered out over the end of Bennelong Point, evoking Sydney’s cliffs and the sails on its harbour. It was a sculptural response to both the competition guidelines and the location. It was alone in fully realising the potential of its unique harbour-side location. The building’s design was inspired - entirely unlike anything that had been seen before. <strong>19 ………. </strong>Pressures piled upon its architect, Jørn Utzon, who left Australia midway through construction, never to return to see the building completed.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Utzon’s masterpiece would define his career, and redefine the image of Australia, both to itself and to the world. An exercise in nation building it was an extraordinary collective act of dreaming in public. It was a work of art built for the performance of works of art. <strong>20 ………. </strong>Realising the dream involved us all - visionaries and pragmatists, politicians and architects, engineers, artists and most fundamentally, the people of Australia.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>In the past, the reason for superhero popularity has been fairly clear: driven by social crises, the costumed protectors have emerged to save our society. While part of the appeal of superhero films is their fantastical aspect, which we can use as a form of escapism from the troubles we face in reality, superhero films are also popular because of the opposite: they mirror the human experience and that makes them more relatable and closer to home. A new study may explain why you (and the rest of the world) love superheroes so much—it's an innate human characteristic. We love superheroes because they show us how a single person has the capacity to make the world a better place if he puts his powers to good use. They can also be viewed as the positive signs of our brain fighting the bad and the evil ones that can probably destroy you.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Superman has edged out Spider-Man as America’s most popular superhero. For the last two decades, superheroes have dominated American popular culture. Everyone has their preference. However, it looks like the Man of Steel is officially the country’s favourite superhero. A new survey conducted by OnePoll recently named the most popular superheroes in the U.S.A. And sitting proudly at the top of the list is the Last Son of&nbsp;Krypton himself, Superman. Clark Kent hasn’t had much luck on the big screen. But Superman did popularise the superhero genre back in 1938 as the original superhero. Plus, it doesn’t get more patriotic than fighting for truth, justice and the American way. Coming in second place is your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man, although Peter Parker is always a strong contender for the top spot. Rounding out the top five are Batman, Captain America and Iron Man.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>John Hancock, more simply known as just Hancock, is a superhero in the 2008 superhero film, Hancock. He is played by Will Smith, who also played Agent J, Mike Lowrey, and Steven Hiller. Hancock is over 3,000 years old, but lives in New York. He is unable to remember anything prior to 1928 due to suffering a bout of amnesia. At the beginning of the story, Hancock does not care about his public image. He often causes more damage than he prevents while performing heroic acts. He is often drunk or hungover which results in the public he attempts to help distrusting and disliking him. After saving the life of public relations spokesman Ray Embrey, Hancock works with Embrey to attempt to repair his tarnished public image and eventually Ray helps Hancock to become a respected hero. Unlike traditional superheroes like Superman who fly straight, Hancock flew awkwardly and even sideways at one point. The CGI team had a hard time rendering his flying effects because of that, and the wirework. Imagine having to hoist one of the biggest movie stars in the world up into the air, and haul him sixty feet off the ground at fifty miles an hour. Now imagine being told he has to do it sideways. It took a lot of practise and test flights to get it right. In the movie, there's no real explanation for where Hancock came from. It's said by Mary (his ex-wife) that he was created "by the gods," and that's about it. There's a persistent fan theory that Hancock is, in fact, an ancient Greek god: specifically, Zeus. Consider Hancock's love of eagles. An eagle served as Zeus' messenger and companion. And remember at the end of Hancock when he flies off with an eagle?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>My Hero Academia is a Japanese manga written and illustrated by Kohei Horikoshi and is published in Weekly Shonen Jump. The first chapter was published on July 7, 2014, in issue 32 of Weekly Shonen Jump. In January 2015, Viz Media announced that starting in February 2015, they would officially translate the series into English for release in Viz Shonen Jump. By August 2018, My Hero Academia had sold over 16 million copies. People are not born equal, a realisation that four-year-old Izuku Midoriya faced when bullied by his classmates who had unique special powers. Izuku was one of the rare cases where he was born with absolutely no unique powers. This did not stop Izuku from pursuing his dream, a dream of becoming a great hero like the legendary All Might. To become the great hero he hopelessly wants to become, he will now join the ranks of one of the highest rated "Hero Academies" in the country: U.A. High School. With the help of his idol, All Might, will he be able to claim the ranks and become a true hero? The manga takes various cues and styling from American comics. It also breaks away from the idea of the battle-manga main-protagonist cliché who is normally very powerful and wild from the start.</p>

            <p>My Hero Academia is a Japanese manga written and illustrated by Kohei Horikoshi and is published in Weekly Shonen Jump. The first chapter was published on July 7, 2014, in issue 32 of Weekly Shonen Jump. In January 2015, Viz Media announced that starting in February 2015, they would officially translate the series into English for release in Viz Shonen Jump. By August 2018, My Hero Academia had sold over 16 million copies. People are not born equal, a realisation that four-year-old Izuku Midoriya faced when bullied by his classmates who had unique special powers. Izuku was one of the rare cases where he was born with absolutely no unique powers. This did not stop Izuku from pursuing his dream, a dream of becoming a great hero like the legendary All Might. To become the great hero he hopelessly wants to become, he will now join the ranks of one of the highest rated "Hero Academies" in the country: U.A. High School. With the help of his idol, All Might, will he be able to claim the ranks and become a true hero? The manga takes various cues and styling from American comics. It also breaks away from the idea of the battle-manga main-protagonist cliché who is normally very powerful and wild from the start.</p>

            <p>In the past, the reason for superhero popularity has been fairly clear: driven by social crises, the costumed protectors have emerged to save our society. While part of the appeal of superhero films is their fantastical aspect, which we can use as a form of escapism from the troubles we face in reality, superhero films are also popular because of the opposite: they mirror the human experience and that makes them more relatable and closer to home. A new study may explain why you (and the rest of the world) love superheroes so much—it's an innate human characteristic. We love superheroes because they show us how a single person has the capacity to make the world a better place if he puts his powers to good use. They can also be viewed as the positive signs of our brain fighting the bad and the evil ones that can probably destroy you.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Superman has edged out Spider-Man as America’s most popular superhero. For the last two decades, superheroes have dominated American popular culture. Everyone has their preference. However, it looks like the Man of Steel is officially the country’s favourite superhero. A new survey conducted by OnePoll recently named the most popular superheroes in the U.S.A. And sitting proudly at the top of the list is the Last Son of&nbsp;Krypton himself, Superman. Clark Kent hasn’t had much luck on the big screen. But Superman did popularise the superhero genre back in 1938 as the original superhero. Plus, it doesn’t get more patriotic than fighting for truth, justice and the American way. Coming in second place is your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man, although Peter Parker is always a strong contender for the top spot. Rounding out the top five are Batman, Captain America and Iron Man.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>John Hancock, more simply known as just Hancock, is a superhero in the 2008 superhero film, Hancock. He is played by Will Smith, who also played Agent J, Mike Lowrey, and Steven Hiller. Hancock is over 3,000 years old, but lives in New York. He is unable to remember anything prior to 1928 due to suffering a bout of amnesia. At the beginning of the story, Hancock does not care about his public image. He often causes more damage than he prevents while performing heroic acts. He is often drunk or hungover which results in the public he attempts to help distrusting and disliking him. After saving the life of public relations spokesman Ray Embrey, Hancock works with Embrey to attempt to repair his tarnished public image and eventually Ray helps Hancock to become a respected hero. Unlike traditional superheroes like Superman who fly straight, Hancock flew awkwardly and even sideways at one point. The CGI team had a hard time rendering his flying effects because of that, and the wirework. Imagine having to hoist one of the biggest movie stars in the world up into the air, and haul him sixty feet off the ground at fifty miles an hour. Now imagine being told he has to do it sideways. It took a lot of practise and test flights to get it right. In the movie, there's no real explanation for where Hancock came from. It's said by Mary (his ex-wife) that he was created "by the gods," and that's about it. There's a persistent fan theory that Hancock is, in fact, an ancient Greek god: specifically, Zeus. Consider Hancock's love of eagles. An eagle served as Zeus' messenger and companion. And remember at the end of Hancock when he flies off with an eagle?&nbsp;</p>

By August 2018, My Hero Academia had sold over 16 million copies. People are not born equal, a realisation that four-year-old Izuku Midoriya faced when bullied by his classmates who had unique special powers. Izuku was one of the rare cases where he was born with absolutely no unique powers. This did not stop Izuku from pursuing his dream, a dream of becoming a great hero like the legendary All Might. To become the great hero he hopelessly wants to become, he will now join the ranks of one of the highest rated "Hero Academies" in the country: U.A. High School.

It also breaks away from the idea of the battle-manga main-protagonist cliché who is normally very powerful and wild from the start.</p>

            <p>In the past, the reason for superhero popularity has been fairly clear: driven by social crises, the costumed protectors have emerged to save our society. While part of the appeal of superhero films is their fantastical aspect, which we can use as a form of escapism from the troubles we face in reality, superhero films are also popular because of the opposite: they mirror the human experience and that makes them more relatable and closer to home. A new study may explain why you (and the rest of the world) love superheroes so much—it's an innate human characteristic. We love superheroes because they show us how a single person has the capacity to make the world a better place if he puts his powers to good use. They can also be viewed as the positive signs of our brain fighting the bad and the evil ones that can probably destroy you.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Superman has edged out Spider-Man as America’s most popular superhero. For the last two decades, superheroes have dominated American popular culture. Everyone has their preference. However, it looks like the Man of Steel is officially the country’s favourite superhero. A new survey conducted by OnePoll recently named the most popular superheroes in the U.S.A. And sitting proudly at the top of the list is the Last Son of&nbsp;Krypton himself, Superman. Clark Kent hasn’t had much luck on the big screen. But Superman did popularise the superhero genre back in 1938 as the original superhero. Plus, it doesn’t get more patriotic than fighting for truth, justice and the American way. Coming in second place is your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man, although Peter Parker is always a strong contender for the top spot. Rounding out the top five are Batman, Captain America and Iron Man.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>John Hancock, more simply known as just Hancock, is a superhero in the 2008 superhero film, Hancock. He is played by Will Smith, who also played Agent J, Mike Lowrey, and Steven Hiller. Hancock is over 3,000 years old, but lives in New York. He is unable to remember anything prior to 1928 due to suffering a bout of amnesia. At the beginning of the story, Hancock does not care about his public image. He often causes more damage than he prevents while performing heroic acts. He is often drunk or hungover which results in the public he attempts to help distrusting and disliking him. After saving the life of public relations spokesman Ray Embrey, Hancock works with Embrey to attempt to repair his tarnished public image and eventually Ray helps Hancock to become a respected hero. Unlike traditional superheroes like Superman who fly straight, Hancock flew awkwardly and even sideways at one point. The CGI team had a hard time rendering his flying effects because of that, and the wirework. Imagine having to hoist one of the biggest movie stars in the world up into the air, and haul him sixty feet off the ground at fifty miles an hour. Now imagine being told he has to do it sideways. It took a lot of practise and test flights to get it right. In the movie, there's no real explanation for where Hancock came from. It's said by Mary (his ex-wife) that he was created "by the gods," and that's about it. There's a persistent fan theory that Hancock is, in fact, an ancient Greek god: specifically, Zeus. Consider Hancock's love of eagles. An eagle served as Zeus' messenger and companion. And remember at the end of Hancock when he flies off with an eagle?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>My Hero Academia is a Japanese manga written and illustrated by Kohei Horikoshi and is published in Weekly Shonen Jump. The first chapter was published on July 7, 2014, in issue 32 of Weekly Shonen Jump. In January 2015, Viz Media announced that starting in February 2015, they would officially translate the series into English for release in Viz Shonen Jump. By August 2018, My Hero Academia had sold over 16 million copies. People are not born equal, a realisation that four-year-old Izuku Midoriya faced when bullied by his classmates who had unique special powers. Izuku was one of the rare cases where he was born with absolutely no unique powers. This did not stop Izuku from pursuing his dream, a dream of becoming a great hero like the legendary All Might. To become the great hero he hopelessly wants to become, he will now join the ranks of one of the highest rated "Hero Academies" in the country: U.A. High School. With the help of his idol, All Might, will he be able to claim the ranks and become a true hero? The manga takes various cues and styling from American comics. It also breaks away from the idea of the battle-manga main-protagonist cliché who is normally very powerful and wild from the start.</p>

            <p>In the past, the reason for superhero popularity has been fairly clear: driven by social crises, the costumed protectors have emerged to save our society. While part of the appeal of superhero films is their fantastical aspect, which we can use as a form of escapism from the troubles we face in reality, superhero films are also popular because of the opposite: they mirror the human experience and that makes them more relatable and closer to home. A new study may explain why you (and the rest of the world) love superheroes so much—it's an innate human characteristic. We love superheroes because they show us how a single person has the capacity to make the world a better place if he puts his powers to good use. They can also be viewed as the positive signs of our brain fighting the bad and the evil ones that can probably destroy you.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Superman has edged out Spider-Man as America’s most popular superhero. For the last two decades, superheroes have dominated American popular culture. Everyone has their preference. However, it looks like the Man of Steel is officially the country’s favourite superhero. A new survey conducted by OnePoll recently named the most popular superheroes in the U.S.A. And sitting proudly at the top of the list is the Last Son of&nbsp;Krypton himself, Superman. Clark Kent hasn’t had much luck on the big screen. But Superman did popularise the superhero genre back in 1938 as the original superhero. Plus, it doesn’t get more patriotic than fighting for truth, justice and the American way. Coming in second place is your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man, although Peter Parker is always a strong contender for the top spot. Rounding out the top five are Batman, Captain America and Iron Man.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>John Hancock, more simply known as just Hancock, is a superhero in the 2008 superhero film, Hancock. He is played by Will Smith, who also played Agent J, Mike Lowrey, and Steven Hiller. Hancock is over 3,000 years old, but lives in New York. He is unable to remember anything prior to 1928 due to suffering a bout of amnesia. At the beginning of the story, Hancock does not care about his public image. He often causes more damage than he prevents while performing heroic acts. He is often drunk or hungover which results in the public he attempts to help distrusting and disliking him. After saving the life of public relations spokesman Ray Embrey, Hancock works with Embrey to attempt to repair his tarnished public image and eventually Ray helps Hancock to become a respected hero. Unlike traditional superheroes like Superman who fly straight, Hancock flew awkwardly and even sideways at one point. The CGI team had a hard time rendering his flying effects because of that, and the wirework. Imagine having to hoist one of the biggest movie stars in the world up into the air, and haul him sixty feet off the ground at fifty miles an hour. Now imagine being told he has to do it sideways. It took a lot of practise and test flights to get it right. In the movie, there's no real explanation for where Hancock came from. It's said by Mary (his ex-wife) that he was created "by the gods," and that's about it. There's a persistent fan theory that Hancock is, in fact, an ancient Greek god: specifically, Zeus. Consider Hancock's love of eagles. An eagle served as Zeus' messenger and companion. And remember at the end of Hancock when he flies off with an eagle?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>My Hero Academia is a Japanese manga written and illustrated by Kohei Horikoshi and is published in Weekly Shonen Jump. The first chapter was published on July 7, 2014, in issue 32 of Weekly Shonen Jump. In January 2015, Viz Media announced that starting in February 2015, they would officially translate the series into English for release in Viz Shonen Jump. By August 2018, My Hero Academia had sold over 16 million copies. People are not born equal, a realisation that four-year-old Izuku Midoriya faced when bullied by his classmates who had unique special powers. Izuku was one of the rare cases where he was born with absolutely no unique powers. This did not stop Izuku from pursuing his dream, a dream of becoming a great hero like the legendary All Might. To become the great hero he hopelessly wants to become, he will now join the ranks of one of the highest rated "Hero Academies" in the country: U.A. High School. With the help of his idol, All Might, will he be able to claim the ranks and become a true hero? The manga takes various cues and styling from American comics. It also breaks away from the idea of the battle-manga main-protagonist cliché who is normally very powerful and wild from the start.</p>

            <p>Superman has edged out Spider-Man as America’s most popular superhero. For the last two decades, superheroes have dominated American popular culture. Everyone has their preference. However, it looks like the Man of Steel is officially the country’s favourite superhero. A new survey conducted by OnePoll recently named the most popular superheroes in the U.S.A. And sitting proudly at the top of the list is the Last Son of&nbsp;Krypton himself, Superman. Clark Kent hasn’t had much luck on the big screen. But Superman did popularise the superhero genre back in 1938 as the original superhero. Plus, it doesn’t get more patriotic than fighting for truth, justice and the American way. Coming in second place is your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man, although Peter Parker is always a strong contender for the top spot. Rounding out the top five are Batman, Captain America and Iron Man.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>John Hancock, more simply known as just Hancock, is a superhero in the 2008 superhero film, Hancock. He is played by Will Smith, who also played Agent J, Mike Lowrey, and Steven Hiller. Hancock is over 3,000 years old, but lives in New York. He is unable to remember anything prior to 1928 due to suffering a bout of amnesia. At the beginning of the story, Hancock does not care about his public image. He often causes more damage than he prevents while performing heroic acts. He is often drunk or hungover which results in the public he attempts to help distrusting and disliking him. After saving the life of public relations spokesman Ray Embrey, Hancock works with Embrey to attempt to repair his tarnished public image and eventually Ray helps Hancock to become a respected hero. Unlike traditional superheroes like Superman who fly straight, Hancock flew awkwardly and even sideways at one point. The CGI team had a hard time rendering his flying effects because of that, and the wirework. Imagine having to hoist one of the biggest movie stars in the world up into the air, and haul him sixty feet off the ground at fifty miles an hour. Now imagine being told he has to do it sideways. It took a lot of practise and test flights to get it right. In the movie, there's no real explanation for where Hancock came from. It's said by Mary (his ex-wife) that he was created "by the gods," and that's about it. There's a persistent fan theory that Hancock is, in fact, an ancient Greek god: specifically, Zeus. Consider Hancock's love of eagles. An eagle served as Zeus' messenger and companion. And remember at the end of Hancock when he flies off with an eagle?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>My Hero Academia is a Japanese manga written and illustrated by Kohei Horikoshi and is published in Weekly Shonen Jump. The first chapter was published on July 7, 2014, in issue 32 of Weekly Shonen Jump. In January 2015, Viz Media announced that starting in February 2015, they would officially translate the series into English for release in Viz Shonen Jump. By August 2018, My Hero Academia had sold over 16 million copies. People are not born equal, a realisation that four-year-old Izuku Midoriya faced when bullied by his classmates who had unique special powers. Izuku was one of the rare cases where he was born with absolutely no unique powers. This did not stop Izuku from pursuing his dream, a dream of becoming a great hero like the legendary All Might. To become the great hero he hopelessly wants to become, he will now join the ranks of one of the highest rated "Hero Academies" in the country: U.A. High School. With the help of his idol, All Might, will he be able to claim the ranks and become a true hero? The manga takes various cues and styling from American comics. It also breaks away from the idea of the battle-manga main-protagonist cliché who is normally very powerful and wild from the start.</p>

            <p>In the past, the reason for superhero popularity has been fairly clear: driven by social crises, the costumed protectors have emerged to save our society. While part of the appeal of superhero films is their fantastical aspect, which we can use as a form of escapism from the troubles we face in reality, superhero films are also popular because of the opposite: they mirror the human experience and that makes them more relatable and closer to home. A new study may explain why you (and the rest of the world) love superheroes so much—it's an innate human characteristic. We love superheroes because they show us how a single person has the capacity to make the world a better place if he puts his powers to good use. They can also be viewed as the positive signs of our brain fighting the bad and the evil ones that can probably destroy you.&nbsp;</p>
