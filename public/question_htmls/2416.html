          <strong>Thorns and Roses</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Margaret S. Frezon</em><br><br>
Sarah sat up in bed and rubbed her eyes. Where were all of her old familiar things? The framed picture of the cocker spaniel puppy was not hanging on the wall opposite her bed. The navy blue blanket that had always covered the foot of her bed seemed to have gone missing in the night. The curtains had magically changed from sky-blue to sea-green. Everything had changed. “All part of my new life,” she thought, frowning.</p>
        <p>When Sarah’s family had moved just a few weeks ago, everyone seemed happy. Their new house was located in a town next to a national forest, twenty miles closer to her mother’s job. There would be an extra bedroom in the new house for her great aunt, who had been living alone.</p>
        <p>Despite her family’s enthusiasm, Sarah was having a hard time getting used to the changes. She missed her old school and she missed the friends who had lived on her block. She missed all the things that had been left behind, from the curtains to the colors of the walls. Since it was summer, there was no opportunity to make friends at school. What was she supposed to do all day?</p>
        <p>Seeing Sarah moping around, her great aunt Felicia said, “You could always come out and help me get the garden whipped into shape.” Sarah was not exactly in the mood for gardening, but this offer was the only one she had. Besides, she loved her great aunt and wanted to be helpful. She shrugged and followed her into the yard.</p>
        <p>Sarah had to agree that the garden needed a lot of work. The plot itself was fairly large but few flowers could be seen, and the overgrown greenery was choked with weeds. The little fence around the perimeter of the garden was old and wobbly. Sarah began to wonder if it was worth weeding the plot at all. With a little sigh, she knelt down and began yanking clumps of weeds.</p>
        <p>“Ouch!”</p>
        <p>Sarah yanked her hand back and stared at a crimson drop on the tip of her finger. “Why do rosebushes have to have thorns?” she complained aloud.</p>
        <p>“Sorry, baby,” her great aunt called. “I should have brought us some gardening gloves. Working around roses can be prickly work.”</p>
        <p>“That’s okay, Aunt Felicia,” Sarah replied. “I’ll survive.”</p>
        <p>They worked through the afternoon and then decided to quit for the day.</p>
        <p>The next day, Sarah woke up before anyone else and slipped outside to the garden. She was especially careful to avoid the thorns of the rosebush. As she pulled weeds and grass, she noticed a bud just beginning to blossom. It looked delicate. Just a trace of pink peeked out from under the green covering. Sarah knew that it would soon open into a full and fragrant blossom. And then she noticed another bud and another—the bush was filled with them. She could not help but let out a happy shout.</p>
        <p>“I see you found the roses,” Aunt Felicia said from the back porch.</p>
        <p>Aunt Felicia came down the back porch steps and put her arms around Sarah. “Suppose we take a walk around our new neighborhood,” she said. “I’ll bet we can find more roses or other things just as nice.”</p>

        <p><strong>The Wise Fools of Gotham</strong><br>
A Story from Englandby<br>
<em>by Martha Hamilton and Mitch Weiss</em></p>
        <p>
                  <img width="27%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766021342/pnmuyj6rheufbpbgq9tn.png" alt="SCHTT40_ACER_RC_31">


        </p>
        <p>There’s a small town in the central part of England called Gotham. Some say it’s a town of fools. Others say all the villagers are wise. Let me tell you about the people of Gotham so you can decide for yourself.</p>
        <p>Long ago, England was ruled by a cruel king named John. One day, the people of Gotham heard that King John and his men would soon be riding through their town. This worried the villagers, for they knew the greedy king would demand food and lodging for his men. What’s more, if he saw anything to his liking, he would surely take it.</p>
        <p>A town meeting was called. After much discussion, the townspeople decided to cut down a number of huge trees to block the roads leading into Gotham. When King John and his men reached the outskirts of the village, they could not pass. Enraged, King John ordered his men to go into the town and punish the villagers.</p>
        <p>When the king’s officers finally made their way over the trees, they found a village of fools. Some say that was because the people of Gotham had a plan—they had decided to act like fools since they had never heard of anyone being punished for being a noodlehead. Others say that’s just the way they were.</p>
        <p>In the village, the king’s men encountered a man riding a donkey. The man was hunched over because he carried a huge sack of grain on his own shoulders. He looked exhausted. One of the king’s men approached him and asked, “Why, in heaven’s name, are you carrying that sack? Why don’t you just put it behind you on your donkey’s back?”</p>
        <p>“You see,” replied the man from Gotham, “my donkey is feeling poorly today. It’s bad enough that she has to carry me, so I decided to lighten her burden by carrying the sack myself.”</p>
        <p>The king’s men said, “But sir, don’t you see that if you’re riding on top of the donkey, she’s still carrying the weight of the sack?”</p>
        <p>The man didn’t reply. He just looked at the king’s men as if <em><strong>they </strong></em>were crazy and went on his way.</p>
        <p>The king’s officers giggled at the foolishness of the man. Before long, they passed a pond where they found a number of villagers in the midst of a great argument. Two of them were holding an enormous eel. “Quiet down,” commanded one of the king’s men. “What’s the problem here?”</p>
        <p>One of the villagers stepped forward and said, “Last year we took all the extra fish we caught and put them in this pond so they would multiply. But this year when we came back, all we caught was this one huge eel. Obviously it has eaten all of our fish!</p>
        <p>Since then, we have argued long and hard over how to punish this wicked eel. But we have finally agreed on the perfect punishment. We are just about to drown the eel in this very pond!”</p>
        <p>The king’s officers couldn’t believe their ears. Drown an eel whose home is in the water? These men were sillier than the first man they met!</p>
        <p>Before long, they reached the center of the village, where they were in for another surprise. There they found the rest of the townspeople building a towering stone wall. When the soldiers inquired what was going on, one of the villagers replied, “Every spring a cuckoo comes to live in our village. It always brings warm weather. When it leaves, the cold weather returns. Last year we decided that if we could get the cuckoo to stay here all year, we would always have warm weather. We built this stone wall, but it obviously wasn’t high enough because the bird flew away. This year we’re determined to build it so high that the cuckoo can’t escape.”</p>
        <p>The king’s officers had heard enough. They couldn’t bring themselves to punish such nincompoops. They returned to King John and told him all about the fools of Gotham. Whether it’s fair or not, the people of Gotham have been known as fools ever since.</p>
        <p>What do you think? Were the villagers of Gotham wise or foolish?</p>

        <p><strong>The Wise Fools of Gotham</strong><br>
A Story from Englandby<br>

        <p>
                  <img width="27%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766023107/ss1mpastk4hlsns1gzno.png" alt="SCHTT40_ACER_RC_31">


        </p>
        <p>There’s a small town in the central part of England called Gotham. Some say it’s a town of fools. Others say all the villagers are wise. Let me tell you about the people of Gotham so you can decide for yourself.</p>
        <p>Long ago, England was ruled by a cruel king named John. One day, the people of Gotham heard that King John and his men would soon be riding through their town. This worried the villagers, for they knew the greedy king would demand food and lodging for his men. What’s more, if he saw anything to his liking, he would surely take it.</p>
        <p>A town meeting was called. After much discussion, the townspeople decided to cut down a number of huge trees to block the roads leading into Gotham. When King John and his men reached the outskirts of the village, they could not pass. Enraged, King John ordered his men to go into the town and punish the villagers.</p>
        <p>When the king’s officers finally made their way over the trees, they found a village of fools. Some say that was because the people of Gotham had a plan—they had decided to act like fools since they had never heard of anyone being punished for being a noodlehead. Others say that’s just the way they were.</p>
        <p>In the village, the king’s men encountered a man riding a donkey. The man was hunched over because he carried a huge sack of grain on his own shoulders. He looked exhausted. One of the king’s men approached him and asked, “Why, in heaven’s name, are you carrying that sack? Why don’t you just put it behind you on your donkey’s back?”</p>
        <p>“You see,” replied the man from Gotham, “my donkey is feeling poorly today. It’s bad enough that she has to carry me, so I decided to lighten her burden by carrying the sack myself.”</p>
        <p>The king’s men said, “But sir, don’t you see that if you’re riding on top of the donkey, she’s still carrying the weight of the sack?”</p>
        <p>The man didn’t reply. He just looked at the king’s men as if <em><strong>they </strong></em>were crazy and went on his way.</p>
        <p>The king’s officers giggled at the foolishness of the man. Before long, they passed a pond where they found a number of villagers in the midst of a great argument. Two of them were holding an enormous eel. “Quiet down,” commanded one of the king’s men. “What’s the problem here?”</p>

        <p>Since then, we have argued long and hard over how to punish this wicked eel. But we have finally agreed on the perfect punishment. We are just about to drown the eel in this very pond!”</p>
        <p>The king’s officers couldn’t believe their ears. Drown an eel whose home is in the water? These men were sillier than the first man they met!</p>

        <p><strong>The Wise Fools of Gotham</strong><br>
A Story from Englandby<br>
<em>by Martha Hamilton and Mitch Weiss</em></p>
        <p>
                  <img width="27%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766038319/dbyipyww1k5t6toinbbw.png" alt="SCHTT40_ACER_RC_31">


        </p>
        <p>There’s a small town in the central part of England called Gotham. Some say it’s a town of fools. Others say all the villagers are wise. Let me tell you about the people of Gotham so you can decide for yourself.</p>
        <p>Long ago, England was ruled by a cruel king named John. One day, the people of Gotham heard that King John and his men would soon be riding through their town. This worried the villagers, for they knew the greedy king would demand food and lodging for his men. What’s more, if he saw anything to his liking, he would surely take it.</p>
        <p>A town meeting was called. After much discussion, the townspeople decided to cut down a number of huge trees to block the roads leading into Gotham. When King John and his men reached the outskirts of the village, they could not pass. Enraged, King John ordered his men to go into the town and punish the villagers.</p>
        <p>When the king’s officers finally made their way over the trees, they found a village of fools. Some say that was because the people of Gotham had a plan—they had decided to act like fools since they had never heard of anyone being punished for being a noodlehead. Others say that’s just the way they were.</p>
        <p>In the village, the king’s men encountered a man riding a donkey. The man was hunched over because he carried a huge sack of grain on his own shoulders. He looked exhausted. One of the king’s men approached him and asked, “Why, in heaven’s name, are you carrying that sack? Why don’t you just put it behind you on your donkey’s back?”</p>
        <p>“You see,” replied the man from Gotham, “my donkey is feeling poorly today. It’s bad enough that she has to carry me, so I decided to lighten her burden by carrying the sack myself.”</p>
        <p>The king’s men said, “But sir, don’t you see that if you’re riding on top of the donkey, she’s still carrying the weight of the sack?”</p>
        <p>The man didn’t reply. He just looked at the king’s men as if <em><strong>they </strong></em>were crazy and went on his way.</p>
        <p>The king’s officers giggled at the foolishness of the man. Before long, they passed a pond where they found a number of villagers in the midst of a great argument. Two of them were holding an enormous eel. “Quiet down,” commanded one of the king’s men. “What’s the problem here?”</p>
        <p>One of the villagers stepped forward and said, “Last year we took all the extra fish we caught and put them in this pond so they would multiply. But this year when we came back, all we caught was this one huge eel. Obviously it has eaten all of our fish!</p>
        <p>Since then, we have argued long and hard over how to punish this wicked eel. But we have finally agreed on the perfect punishment. We are just about to drown the eel in this very pond!”</p>
        <p>The king’s officers couldn’t believe their ears. Drown an eel whose home is in the water? These men were sillier than the first man they met!</p>
        <p>Before long, they reached the center of the village, where they were in for another surprise. There they found the rest of the townspeople building a towering stone wall. When the soldiers inquired what was going on, one of the villagers replied, “Every spring a cuckoo comes to live in our village. It always brings warm weather. When it leaves, the cold weather returns. Last year we decided that if we could get the cuckoo to stay here all year, we would always have warm weather. We built this stone wall, but it obviously wasn’t high enough because the bird flew away. This year we’re determined to build it so high that the cuckoo can’t escape.”</p>
        <p>The king’s officers had heard enough. They couldn’t bring themselves to punish such nincompoops. They returned to King John and told him all about the fools of Gotham. Whether it’s fair or not, the people of Gotham have been known as fools ever since.</p>
        <p>What do you think? Were the villagers of Gotham wise or foolish?</p>

        <p><strong>The Wise Fools of Gotham</strong><br>
A Story from Englandby<br>
<em>by Martha Hamilton and Mitch Weiss</em></p>
        <p>
                  <img width="27%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766025291/bitypkxemy8ctnmec0nm.png" alt="SCHTT40_ACER_RC_31">


        </p>
        <p>There’s a small town in the central part of England called Gotham. Some say it’s a town of fools. Others say all the villagers are wise. Let me tell you about the people of Gotham so you can decide for yourself.</p>
        <p>Long ago, England was ruled by a cruel king named John. One day, the people of Gotham heard that King John and his men would soon be riding through their town. This worried the villagers, for they knew the greedy king would demand food and lodging for his men. What’s more, if he saw anything to his liking, he would surely take it.</p>
        <p>A town meeting was called. After much discussion, the townspeople decided to cut down a number of huge trees to block the roads leading into Gotham. When King John and his men reached the outskirts of the village, they could not pass. Enraged, King John ordered his men to go into the town and punish the villagers.</p>
        <p>When the king’s officers finally made their way over the trees, they found a village of fools. Some say that was because the people of Gotham had a plan—they had decided to act like fools since they had never heard of anyone being punished for being a noodlehead. Others say that’s just the way they were.</p>
        <p>In the village, the king’s men encountered a man riding a donkey. The man was hunched over because he carried a huge sack of grain on his own shoulders. He looked exhausted. One of the king’s men approached him and asked, “Why, in heaven’s name, are you carrying that sack? Why don’t you just put it behind you on your donkey’s back?”</p>
        <p>“You see,” replied the man from Gotham, “my donkey is feeling poorly today. It’s bad enough that she has to carry me, so I decided to lighten her burden by carrying the sack myself.”</p>
        <p>The king’s men said, “But sir, don’t you see that if you’re riding on top of the donkey, she’s still carrying the weight of the sack?”</p>
        <p>The man didn’t reply. He just looked at the king’s men as if <em><strong>they </strong></em>were crazy and went on his way.</p>
        <p>The king’s officers giggled at the foolishness of the man. Before long, they passed a pond where they found a number of villagers in the midst of a great argument. Two of them were holding an enormous eel. “Quiet down,” commanded one of the king’s men. “What’s the problem here?”</p>
        <p>One of the villagers stepped forward and said, “Last year we took all the extra fish we caught and put them in this pond so they would multiply. But this year when we came back, all we caught was this one huge eel. Obviously it has eaten all of our fish!</p>
        <p>Since then, we have argued long and hard over how to punish this wicked eel. But we have finally agreed on the perfect punishment. We are just about to drown the eel in this very pond!”</p>
        <p>The king’s officers couldn’t believe their ears. Drown an eel whose home is in the water? These men were sillier than the first man they met!</p>
        <p>Before long, they reached the center of the village, where they were in for another surprise. There they found the rest of the townspeople building a towering stone wall. When the soldiers inquired what was going on, one of the villagers replied, “Every spring a cuckoo comes to live in our village. It always brings warm weather. When it leaves, the cold weather returns. Last year we decided that if we could get the cuckoo to stay here all year, we would always have warm weather. We built this stone wall, but it obviously wasn’t high enough because the bird flew away. This year we’re determined to build it so high that the cuckoo can’t escape.”</p>
        <p>The king’s officers had heard enough. They couldn’t bring themselves to punish such nincompoops. They returned to King John and told him all about the fools of Gotham. Whether it’s fair or not, the people of Gotham have been known as fools ever since.</p>
        <p>What do you think? Were the villagers of Gotham wise or foolish?</p>
