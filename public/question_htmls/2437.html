          <strong>The Coelacanth: The Gigantic Prehistoric Fish Still Alive Today</strong>
        </p>
        <p>The massive coelacanth was thought to have died out over 60 million years ago, but its 1938 discovery in South Africa shocked the scientific world. Fossilised remains had dated the species back to the time of the dinosaurs, so the appearance of a living specimen seemed impossible. <strong>(A)</strong>………….</p>
        <p>The rediscovery was made by Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer, a young museum curator who received a call from a fisherman about a strange catch. On inspecting the five-foot-long fish, she was struck by its shimmering blue-green scales and unusual fins. <strong>(B)</strong>…………. She sketched it and sent the drawing to her friend J.L.B. Smith, a fish scientist, who realised immediately that she had found a “living fossil.” The coelacanth was later named Latimeria chalumnae in her honour.</p>
        <p>The coelacanth is unique for several reasons. Its four lobe-like fins move in an alternating pattern like a trotting horse, giving scientists clues about how early fish may have evolved into four-legged amphibians. <strong>(C)</strong>…………. It also has a hinged joint in its head that allows its mouth to open extremely wide to swallow prey. In addition, its thick scales and electro-sensory organ for detecting prey add to its distinctiveness.</p>
        <p>After the initial discovery, scientists were desperate to find another specimen. In 1952, one was caught in the Comoro Islands, reigniting global excitement. Since then, dozens more have been located along Africa’s east coast. In 1997, a second living species, Latimeria menadoensis, was identified in Indonesia, proving the fish’s range was wider than previously thought. <strong>(D)</strong>………….</p>
        <p>Coelacanths are often referred to as “living fossils” because their closest fossil relatives are millions of years old. <strong>(E)</strong>…………. However, this is not entirely accurate, since they continue to evolve and adapt. They belong to the lobe-finned fishes, the same group that produced the ancestors of amphibians, reptiles and mammals. This evolutionary position makes them one of the most significant discoveries in zoology.<br>
Today, coelacanths are critically endangered. They live deep in volcanic underwater caves and are rarely caught intentionally.&nbsp;<strong>(F)</strong>………….&nbsp; Because they are of little value as food, scientists hope that releasing accidentally caught specimens will allow these ancient creatures to survive for many more centuries.</p>

<br>
Mountain climbing is the practice of ascending steep slopes and high peaks, either for recreation, sport, or exploration. At first glance, the attraction seems obvious: breath taking views, the exhilaration of standing where few have ever stood, and the physical satisfaction of testing one’s endurance. Yet the negatives are equally striking. High altitudes bring thin air, which can cause altitude sickness, while the steep terrain and unpredictable weather create dangers for even the most experienced climbers. Equipment such as ropes, crampons, and oxygen tanks help to mitigate risks, but accidents still occur with alarming frequency. There is also the heavy financial cost of organised expeditions. Despite these hazards, climbers often report a sense of renewal and perspective after their journey, claiming the hardship makes ordinary life’s challenges seem smaller. The positives and negatives are inseparable; to pursue the glory of mountain summits is to accept the shadow of risk. For this reason, mountain climbing continues to be viewed as both a daring pastime and a profound metaphor for human ambition itself.<br>

<br>
One cannot talk about mountain climbing without mentioning Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, the first climbers to reach the summit of Mount Everest in 1953. Their achievement was not only a physical triumph but also a symbol of human cooperation across cultures. Hillary, a beekeeper from New Zealand, and Norgay, a Sherpa from Nepal, forged an unlikely partnership in one of the most hostile environments on Earth. Facing blizzards, exhaustion, and near-freezing temperatures, they relied on one another’s strength and knowledge to succeed. The climb captured the imagination of the world, inspiring generations of adventurers. Yet their success also highlighted the vital, often overlooked role of Sherpas in Himalayan expeditions. For Norgay, the ascent was not just about planting a flag but about showing the dignity and skill of his people. Today, his story serves as a reminder that behind every famous mountaineer lies a team whose contribution makes the impossible possible. Their victory was personal, historic, and cultural all at once.<br>

<br>
The environmental consequences of modern mountain climbing are more troubling than many care to admit. Popular peaks, such as Everest, are littered with oxygen canisters, discarded tents, and even human waste. Tourism has created overcrowded trails where queues of climbers wait for hours in dangerous conditions simply to reach the summit. Local communities often feel the strain, as traditional ways of life are disrupted by the influx of visitors. Sherpa guides are exposed to far greater risks than those who pay for the climb, carrying heavy loads through avalanches and ice falls. Critics argue that what was once an act of discovery has become a commercial enterprise. A mountain, they&nbsp;say, should inspire reverence, not exploitation. And yet, climbing continues to attract adventurers who crave personal triumph more than they fear collective damage. Unless stricter regulations are enforced, the very landscapes that climbers admire may be irreparably harmed by their footsteps.<br>

<br>
I remember my first serious climb in the Australian Alps, though it was hardly the Himalayas. The mountain was Mount Bogong, Victoria’s highest peak. Our small group of students set out in the early morning, burdened with heavy backpacks and a mixture of anxiety and excitement. The climb was relentless: a winding path through snow gums that seemed to stretch upwards forever. I recall the way my legs trembled with each step and how the thin air burned my lungs. At one point, I wanted to give up entirely, but an older student urged me forward with a joke and a grin. Reaching the summit was not dramatic, but quiet and deeply rewarding. The view unfolded in rolling layers of blue and green, clouds drifting below our feet. It taught me that mountain climbing is as much about inner perseverance as it is about outer adventure. That moment still returns to me whenever I face difficulties in daily life: if I can climb Bogong, I tell myself, then I can overcome this too.<br>
