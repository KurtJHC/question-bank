No doubt a horse fair is a very amusing place to those who have nothing to lose; at any rate, there is plenty to see.<br>
Long strings of young horses out of the country, fresh from the marshes; and droves of shaggy little Welsh ponies, no higher than Merrylegs; and hundreds of cart horses of all sorts, some of them with their long tails braided up and tied with scarlet cord; and a good many like myself, handsome and high-bred, but fallen into the middle class, through some accident or blemish, unsoundness of wind, or some other complaint. There were some splendid animals quite in their prime, and fit for anything; they were throwing out their legs and showing off their paces in high style, as they were trotted out with a leading rein, the groom running by the side. But round in the background there were a number of poor things, sadly broken down with hard work, with their knees knuckling over and their hind legs swinging out at every step, and there were some very dejected-looking old horses, with the under lip hanging down and the ears lying back heavily, as if there were no more pleasure in life, and no more hope; there were some so thin you might see all their ribs, and some with old sores on their backs and hips.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>These were sad sights for a horse to look upon, who knows not but he may come to the same state.</p>
        <p>There was a great deal of bargaining, of running up and beating down; and if a horse may speak his mind so far as he understands, I should say there were more lies told and more trickery at that horse fair than a clever man could give an account of. I was put with two or three other strong, useful-looking horses, and a good many people came to look at us. The gentlemen always turned from me when they saw my broken knees; though the man who had me swore it was only a slip in the stall.</p>
        <p>The first thing was to pull my mouth open, then to look at my eyes, then feel all the way down my legs, and give me a hard feel of the skin and flesh, and then try my paces. It was wonderful what a difference there was in the way these things were done. Some did it in a rough, offhand way, as if one was only a piece of wood; while others would take their hands gently over one’s body, with a pat now and then, as much as to say, “By your leave.” Of course I judged a good deal of the buyers by their manners to myself.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was one man, I thought, if he would buy me, I should be happy. He was not a gentleman, nor yet one of the loud, flashy sort that call themselves so. He was rather a small man, but well made, and quick in all his motions. I knew in a moment by the way he handled me, that he was used to horses; he spoke gently, and his gray eye had a kindly, cheery look in it. It may seem strange to say—but it is true all the same—that the clean, fresh smell there was about him made me take to him; no smell of old beer and tobacco, which I hated, but a fresh smell as if he had come out of a hayloft. He offered twenty-three pounds for me, but that was refused, and he walked away. I looked after him, but he was gone, and a very hard-looking, loud-voiced man came.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I was dreadfully afraid he would have me; but he walked off.</p>
        <p>One or two more came who did not mean business. Then the hard-faced man came back again and offered twenty-three pounds. A very close bargain was being driven, for my salesman began to think he should not get all he asked, and must come down; but just then the gray-eyed man came back again. I could not help reaching out my head toward him. He stroked my face kindly.</p>
        <p>“Well, old chap,” he said, “I think we should suit each other. I’ll give twenty-four for him.”</p>
        <p>“Say twenty-five and you shall have him.”</p>
        <p>“Twenty-four ten,” said my friend, in a very decided tone, “and not another sixpence—yes or no?”</p>
        <p>“Done,” said the salesman; “and you may depend upon it there’s a monstrous deal of quality in that horse, and if you want him for cab work he’s a bargain.”</p>

        <p><em>Read the extract below then answer the questions.</em><br><br>
No doubt a horse fair is a very amusing place to those who have nothing to lose; at any rate, there is plenty to see.<br>
Long strings of young horses out of the country, fresh from the marshes; and droves of shaggy little Welsh ponies, no higher than Merrylegs; and hundreds of cart horses of all sorts, some of them with their long tails braided up and tied with scarlet cord; and a good many like myself, handsome and high-bred, but fallen into the middle class, through some accident or blemish, unsoundness of wind, or some other complaint. There were some splendid animals quite in their prime, and fit for anything; they were throwing out their legs and showing off their paces in high style, as they were trotted out with a leading rein, the groom running by the side. But round in the background there were a number of poor things, sadly broken down with hard work, with their knees knuckling over and their hind legs swinging out at every step, and there were some very dejected-looking old horses, with the under lip hanging down and the ears lying back heavily, as if there were no more pleasure in life, and no more hope; there were some so thin you might see all their ribs, and some with old sores on their backs and hips.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>These were sad sights for a horse to look upon, who knows not but he may come to the same state.</p>
        <p>There was a great deal of bargaining, of running up and beating down; and if a horse may speak his mind so far as he understands, I should say there were more lies told and more trickery at that horse fair than a clever man could give an account of. I was put with two or three other strong, useful-looking horses, and a good many people came to look at us. The gentlemen always turned from me when they saw my broken knees; though the man who had me swore it was only a slip in the stall.</p>
        <p>The first thing was to pull my mouth open, then to look at my eyes, then feel all the way down my legs, and give me a hard feel of the skin and flesh, and then try my paces. It was wonderful what a difference there was in the way these things were done. Some did it in a rough, offhand way, as if one was only a piece of wood; while others would take their hands gently over one’s body, with a pat now and then, as much as to say, “By your leave.” Of course I judged a good deal of the buyers by their manners to myself.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was one man, I thought, if he would buy me, I should be happy. He was not a gentleman, nor yet one of the loud, flashy sort that call themselves so. He was rather a small man, but well made, and quick in all his motions. I knew in a moment by the way he handled me, that he was used to horses; he spoke gently, and his gray eye had a kindly, cheery look in it. It may seem strange to say—but it is true all the same—that the clean, fresh smell there was about him made me take to him; no smell of old beer and tobacco, which I hated, but a fresh smell as if he had come out of a hayloft. He offered twenty-three pounds for me, but that was refused, and he walked away. I looked after him, but he was gone, and a very hard-looking, loud-voiced man came.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I was dreadfully afraid he would have me; but he walked off.</p>
        <p>One or two more came who did not mean business. Then the hard-faced man came back again and offered twenty-three pounds. A very close bargain was being driven, for my salesman began to think he should not get all he asked, and must come down; but just then the gray-eyed man came back again. I could not help reaching out my head toward him. He stroked my face kindly.</p>
        <p>“Well, old chap,” he said, “I think we should suit each other. I’ll give twenty-four for him.”</p>
        <p>“Say twenty-five and you shall have him.”</p>
        <p>“Twenty-four ten,” said my friend, in a very decided tone, “and not another sixpence—yes or no?”</p>
        <p>“Done,” said the salesman; “and you may depend upon it there’s a monstrous deal of quality in that horse, and if you want him for cab work he’s a bargain.”</p>

        <p><em>Read the extract below then answer the questions.</em><br><br>
No doubt a horse fair is a very amusing place to those who have nothing to lose; at any rate, there is plenty to see.<br>
Long strings of young horses out of the country, fresh from the marshes; and droves of shaggy little Welsh ponies, no higher than Merrylegs; and hundreds of cart horses of all sorts, some of them with their long tails braided up and tied with scarlet cord; and a good many like myself, handsome and high-bred, but fallen into the middle class, through some accident or blemish, unsoundness of wind, or some other complaint. There were some splendid animals quite in their prime, and fit for anything; they were throwing out their legs and showing off their paces in high style, as they were trotted out with a leading rein, the groom running by the side. But round in the background there were a number of poor things, sadly broken down with hard work, with their knees knuckling over and their hind legs swinging out at every step, and there were some very dejected-looking old horses, with the under lip hanging down and the ears lying back heavily, as if there were no more pleasure in life, and no more hope; there were some so thin you might see all their ribs, and some with old sores on their backs and hips.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>These were sad sights for a horse to look upon, who knows not but he may come to the same state.</p>
        <p>There was a great deal of bargaining, of running up and beating down; and if a horse may speak his mind so far as he understands, I should say there were more lies told and more trickery at that horse fair than a clever man could give an account of. I was put with two or three other strong, useful-looking horses, and a good many people came to look at us. The gentlemen always turned from me when they saw my broken knees; though the man who had me swore it was only a slip in the stall.</p>
        <p>The first thing was to pull my mouth open, then to look at my eyes, then feel all the way down my legs, and give me a hard feel of the skin and flesh, and then try my paces. It was wonderful what a difference there was in the way these things were done. Some did it in a rough, offhand way, as if one was only a piece of wood; while others would take their hands gently over one’s body, with a pat now and then, as much as to say, “By your leave.” Of course I judged a good deal of the buyers by their manners to myself.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was one man, I thought, if he would buy me, I should be happy. He was not a gentleman, nor yet one of the loud, flashy sort that call themselves so. He was rather a small man, but well made, and quick in all his motions. I knew in a moment by the way he handled me, that he was used to horses; he spoke gently, and his gray eye had a kindly, cheery look in it. It may seem strange to say—but it is true all the same—that the clean, fresh smell there was about him made me take to him; no smell of old beer and tobacco, which I hated, but a fresh smell as if he had come out of a hayloft. He offered twenty-three pounds for me, but that was refused, and he walked away. I looked after him, but he was gone, and a very hard-looking, loud-voiced man came.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I was dreadfully afraid he would have me; but he walked off.</p>
        <p>One or two more came who did not mean business. Then the hard-faced man came back again and offered twenty-three pounds. A very close bargain was being driven, for my salesman began to think he should not get all he asked, and must come down; but just then the gray-eyed man came back again. I could not help reaching out my head toward him. He stroked my face kindly.</p>
        <p>“Well, old chap,” he said, “I think we should suit each other. I’ll give twenty-four for him.”</p>
        <p>“Say twenty-five and you shall have him.”</p>
        <p>“Twenty-four ten,” said my friend, in a very decided tone, “and not another sixpence—yes or no?”</p>
        <p>“Done,” said the salesman; “and you may depend upon it there’s a monstrous deal of quality in that horse, and if you want him for cab work he’s a bargain.”</p>

        </p>
        <p>Just off the highway to Rochester, Minnesota,<br>
Twilight bounds softly forth on the grass.<br>
And the eyes of those two Indian ponies<br>
Darken with kindness.<br>
They have come gladly out of the willows<br>
To welcome my friend and me.<br>
We step over the barbed wire into the pasture<br>
Where they have been grazing all day, alone.<br>
They ripple tensely, they can hardly contain their happiness<br>
That we have come.<br>
They bow shyly as wet swans. They love each other.<br>
There is no loneliness like theirs.<br>
At home once more,<br>
They begin munching the young tufts of spring in the darkness.<br>
I would like to hold the slenderer one in my arms,<br>
For she has walked over to me<br>
And nuzzled my left hand.<br>
She is black and white,<br>
Her mane falls wild on her forehead,<br>
And the light breeze moves me to caress her long ear<br>
That is delicate as the skin over a girl’s wrist.<br>
Suddenly I realize<br>
That if I stepped out of my body I would break<br>
Into blossom.<br>

          <strong>A Blessing</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Just off the highway to Rochester, Minnesota,<br>
Twilight bounds softly forth on the grass.<br>
And the eyes of those two Indian ponies<br>
Darken with kindness.<br>
They have come gladly out of the willows<br>
To welcome my friend and me.<br>
We step over the barbed wire into the pasture<br>
Where they have been grazing all day, alone.<br>
They ripple tensely, they can hardly contain their happiness<br>
That we have come.<br>
They bow shyly as wet swans. They love each other.<br>
There is no loneliness like theirs.<br>
At home once more,<br>
They begin munching the young tufts of spring in the darkness.<br>
I would like to hold the slenderer one in my arms,<br>
For she has walked over to me<br>
And nuzzled my left hand.<br>
She is black and white,<br>
Her mane falls wild on her forehead,<br>
And the light breeze moves me to caress her long ear<br>
That is delicate as the skin over a girl’s wrist.<br>
Suddenly I realize<br>
That if I stepped out of my body I would break<br>
Into blossom.<br>
<br>

Antarctica: The Frozen Frontier of Wonders</strong>
        <p>
                  <img width="56%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766029467/iyxiynx8gwf8rptzwqsb.png" alt="HD_T4_L5_RS_U06_15 20">


        </p>
        <p>Antarctica is the coldest, driest, and windiest continent on Earth, yet it is also one of the most captivating. Unlike the Arctic, which is essentially a frozen ocean surrounded by continents, Antarctica is a frozen continent surrounded by the Southern Ocean. <strong>(A)</strong>………….&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Its ice is so thick that if it melted, global sea levels would rise by over 60 metres. Despite its hostility, Antarctica continues to draw scientists, explorers, and dreamers from around the world.</p>
        <p>Temperatures at the South Pole can plunge below -60°C in winter, and katabatic winds rush down the slopes of the ice sheet at terrifying speeds. Very little snow falls each year, making Antarctica a desert, yet the snow that does fall never melts. Over time it compacts into the colossal ice sheet covering 98% of the land. Glaciers constantly move toward the coast, breaking into massive icebergs that drift for years before melting. <strong>(B)</strong>………….</p>
        <p>Antarctica was once part of Gondwana, the supercontinent that included Africa, South America and Australia. Around 180 million years ago it began to drift southward to its present position. Beneath the ice lie jagged mountains, active volcanoes, and even lakes sealed off for millions of years, such as Lake Vostok, which may contain ancient microbial life. <strong>(C)</strong>………….</p>
        <p>Antarctica’s history is also shaped by legendary explorers. Norwegian Roald Amundsen was the first to reach the South Pole in December 1911, narrowly beating Robert Falcon Scott, whose team perished on the return journey. Sir Ernest Shackleton’s 1914 Endurance expedition failed to cross the continent but became a story of survival after his ship was crushed by pack ice. <strong>(D)</strong>………….</p>
        <p>No one owns Antarctica, and no one lives there permanently. Instead, research stations host 1,000 to 5,000 scientists and staff. In 1959, twelve nations signed the Antarctic Treaty, preserving the continent for peace and science. Today, over 50 nations have agreed to ban mining, nuclear testing, and military activity, making it a rare example of global cooperation. <strong>(E)</strong>………….</p>
        <p>Despite its harsh conditions, Antarctica teems with life. Whales, seals, penguins and seabirds migrate thousands of kilometres to breed and feed in its nutrient-rich waters. Yet no Antarctic animal captures the imagination like the Emperor Penguin. These birds are the only species to breed during the Antarctic winter, with males keeping eggs warm in brood pouches through darkness and blizzards. <strong>(F)</strong>…………. Their endurance and cooperation symbolise the resilience of life in this frozen wilderness.</p>
        <p>Antarctica remains crucial to the Earth’s climate system and holds many secrets about our past and future. It is both a natural wonder and a living laboratory, waiting for future scientists and explorers to unlock its mysteries.</p>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of Jealousy. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Jealousy is often defined as the fear of losing something valuable—whether affection, status, or success—to another person. Psychologists describe it as one of the most complex emotions, combining anxiety, anger, and insecurity. On the positive side, jealousy can signal deep attachment and motivate self-improvement. For example, feeling jealous of a classmate’s achievement might encourage someone to study harder. On the negative side, it can fuel suspicion, resentment, and destructive behaviour. In relationships, jealousy has been linked to arguments, mistrust, and even violence. It is sometimes described as a “social thermometer,” measuring how much people value certain connections. Yet it can also distort reality, convincing us of threats that do not exist. In small doses, jealousy sharpens awareness; in excess, it clouds judgement. This dual nature is what makes jealousy so troubling: it is at once a sign of care and a source of harm.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of Jealousy. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
In Shakespeare’s tragedy Othello, jealousy is portrayed as an overwhelming force that consumes even the noblest character. Othello, a respected general, is manipulated by Iago into believing his wife Desdemona is unfaithful. Though there is no proof, jealousy twists his mind until he murders the woman he loves. The play illustrates how jealousy can begin as a whisper of doubt but grow into an uncontrollable storm. Shakespeare famously calls jealousy the “green-eyed monster,” a vivid image of its destructive power. Othello’s downfall is tragic not only for himself but for those around him, reminding audiences that unchecked jealousy can ruin reputations, families, and lives. The play endures because it captures the frightening truth: reason often falters when jealousy takes hold. Othello is remembered less for his military triumphs than for the way jealousy turned his strengths into weaknesses.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of Jealousy. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
In modern society, jealousy has taken on new forms through social media. Platforms such as Instagram and TikTok allow people to broadcast carefully curated highlights of their lives—holidays, friendships, possessions—which can provoke envy in others. Psychologists call this “comparison culture,” where individuals measure their worth against the polished images of others. Studies show that heavy social media users often report higher levels of jealousy and lower self-esteem. Critics argue that these platforms thrive on envy, using it to keep people scrolling and consuming. Yet some argue social media can also inspire admiration or motivate personal growth. The danger lies in mistaking appearance for reality, forgetting that behind every perfect picture may lie struggle or sadness. Unlike private jealousy, which once remained unspoken, today’s online jealousy is widespread and constant, shaping how people see both themselves and others.<br>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of Jealousy. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
I still remember being twelve years old when my best friend won first place in the school art competition. I smiled and clapped, but inside I felt an ache that surprised me. My drawing, which I had worked on for weeks, received no mention at all. That evening, I sulked at home, convinced I would never be good enough. But over time, the jealousy became a lesson. I began practising harder, experimenting with new techniques, and even asked my friend for advice. By the next year, my artwork had improved so much that I earned a commendation. Looking back, I realise that jealousy was not entirely my enemy: it showed me how much I cared about art and pushed me to grow. Without that sting of envy, I might never have discovered how determination can turn jealousy into progress.<br>
