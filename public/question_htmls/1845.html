Cornrows are a type of braided hairstyle in which “the hair is braided very close to the scalp, using an underhand, upward motion to make a continuous, raised row.” Also known as canerows in the Caribbean, they can be styled in straight lines as well as in intricate geometric or curved patterns. They have been traced back to around 3,000 BCE where they were found in various cultures of West Africa and the Horn of Africa. The earliest documentation has been in Stone Age paintings in the Tassili Plateau of the Sahara. However, in more recent history, cornrows were used as a powerful tool of resistance against slavery and bondage. During the Middle Passage, millions of enslaved Africans were chained and transported across the Atlantic to the Americas. They were made to shave their heads for the purpose of “sanitation” and as a way to strip them of their culture and identity. But this wasn’t adhered to by everyone. Many of those enslaved grew out their hair and braided it into cornrows as an act of resistance, rebellion and reclamation of cultural identity.<br>

<p>A good, timely haircut is something we women prefer not to save on. It’s better to save on a dress or a new shirt – nobody would notice if you are rocking a trendy cut. Although hair styling is important, it’s often secondary, because even the messiest hairstyles need a proper base – a quality cut that has its shape and texture. In this case your hairstyle will be read appealing and harmonious even if it’s the shaggiest “unkempt” ‘do. Somehow when we see bed head hair we always guess right whether it’s a true hairstyle or lack of styling, right? Click here to find out what is new there in the haircut world, select the ideas for your new cut and anticipate your style reboot! For short haircuts, the classic cropped ‘dos have got a serious style update during the last couple of seasons. Contrasting textures and lengths, undercut sections and customized colors make them unique and bring to light the femininity of the wearer. Here are ideas of classy modern crops for every hair type. For medium haircuts, the midi length hair is the golden mean that lets you enjoy free-flowing locks or sweep your hair up in a cute updo whenever the mood strikes you. If you want to rest from the maintenance of longer locks, consider a trendy shoulder-grazing cut and enjoy the benefits that come along. We are ready to suggest numerous varieties of bobs, lobs and midi shags. For long haircuts, summer is the right time to unleash your fantasy and discover the potential of lengthy locks. A subtly feathered cut will let your strands flow nicely over the shoulders and won’t give many undesired fly-aways in an updo or a braid. The fans of edgier looks may go for shags, heavier layers or undercut styles.<br>

Throughout history and across various cultures, hair and hairstyles have had significance far beyond aesthetic beauty and protection from weather.</p>

<p>Hairstyles have symbolised one’s age, tribal affiliations, ethnicity, religion, social status, marital status and more, and have allowed ethnic and cultural groups to define and even reclaim their identities. Many of these styles have stood the test of time and remain prominent today within and without the unique cultures in which they originated. In the age of social media, however, many of these traditional hairstyles have been adopted—or appropriated rather—by celebrities, social media influencers and festival-goers as mere fashion statements without any thought given to their deep cultural significance or painful history. Thus, learning about the history and significance of hair is vital to fostering a more mindful and respectful attitude towards Black, Indigenous and People of Colour.<br>

Hair is a 1979 American musical anti-war comedy-drama film based on the 1968 Broadway musical Hair: The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical. Set against the backdrop of the long-haired hippie counterculture of the Vietnam era, the film focuses on a Vietnam War draftee who meets and befriends a "tribe" of hippies while en route to the army induction center. The hippies and their leader introduce him to illegal drug use and their environment of unorthodox relationships and draft evasion. The musical’s title song begins as character Claude slowly croons his reason for his long hair, as tribe-mate Berger joins in singing they "don't know." They lead the tribe, singing "Give me a head with hair," "as long as God can grow it," listing what they want in a head of hair and their uses for it. Later the song takes the tune of "The Star-Spangled Banner" with the tribe punning "Oh say can you see/ My eyes if you can/Then my hair’s too short!"</p>

        <p><em>Read the (slightly abridged) fable written by Paul White and then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>The Small Wisdom of Feeding Vultures</strong><br><br>
Underneath the buyu tree, outside the hospital clinic, Daudi was handing out medicines. The crows were quarrelling noisily and the shadows were getting long as the afternoon wore on. The patients were talking to each other.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; “I have a strong fear of lions”, said one with a bandaged leg. He shivered slightly.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A long, thin boy coughed and then said, “Heh, the very thought of Nzoka the snake makes my skin go pimply.”<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A man who was recovering from malaria said in a tired voice, “Heh, Kifaru the rhino with his feet that shake the ground, his fierce horn, his …” Words failed him after that.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“No, the creatures to really fear” Daudi said, in a voice that carried, “are Mbu the mosquito and Papasi the tick and Hazi the fly. Small things, yes, but they kill a thousand more people than all the fierce ones of the jungle. Daudi stopped, absolutely still. “But there is another thing more deadly, more dangerous …”<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A visible shudder went through those that listened.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“I shall tell of it”, said Daudi. “It is the tale of the small wisdom of feeding vultures.”</p>
        <p>“Nyani the monkey hated vultures.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But his second wife’s first cousin, Tichi was a creature of the smallest intelligence. He merely said he hated vultures, but he was fascinated by their sharp beaks, their featherless necks, the way their tails swayed and the curve of their dangerous claws.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;One day a vulture alighted on the ground near Tichi’s family tree. <span class="txt-underline"><strong>His eyes drank in every movement of the foul bird</strong></span>. He looked this way and that way. No one was looking and he threw it food. Then, because of the voice within him which spoke loudly against vultures, he shouted in a harsh voice. With many gestures, he ordered it to be gone.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Next day, two vultures came. His eyes were hot as he looked at them, peering through a hole in the tree. His mouth was dry. Furtively he looked to see if he was observed, but those of the jungle were not looking in his direction. Again he threw food to the evil birds who came closer, squawking in a way that was not food for the ears.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Soon more vultures came and came closer, for Tichi repeatedly fed them. Then in a voice that could be heard even in the far thornbush, he uttered threats to throw stones, which would have been terrifying had he not thrown food instead. The vultures fluttered but stood their ground.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Twiga, the giraffe, from his vantage point above the thornbush saw all this and shook his head sadly, for he knew those who fed vultures sought trouble.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A week went by.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The vultures not longer stood at a distance. They came to the very foot of the tree, eating disgustingly the food which the small monkey furtively threw them. He watched them avidly, although fear stirred in his stomach.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In the noon heat of the next day, the bolder vultures were hovering above the buyu tree, pecking savagely at the food he was about to offer.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;High above them circled other vultures. All the time more and more of them arrived. They kept on landing and crowding closer and closer to him.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In real fear, Tichi beat about him with a knobbed stick, but to small purpose. The vultures he had encouraged were quickly overwhelming him. More and more vultures alighted.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;They pressed upon him with their ugly heads and their tearing beaks, viciously pecking at his eyes, his body and his limbs. A shrill monkey scream was drowned by the squawking of vultures.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; At sunset Nyani returned from a journey. He was filled with horror to find the bones of his second wife’s cousin picked clean by the unclean beaks of the filthy birds” “Koh” said one of those who listened, “I will sleep with dreams tonight”<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; “Eh-heh,” said another, grasping the stool on which he sat, “I can see the head with its featherless neck pecking at me. “Yoh!”<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Daudi smiled and then became serious. “So remember not to feed the destructive, and dangerous influences that come hovering over you and want to alight on your life.”&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the (slightly abridged) fable written by Paul White and then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>The Small Wisdom of Feeding Vultures</strong><br><br>
Underneath the buyu tree, outside the hospital clinic, Daudi was handing out medicines. The crows were quarrelling noisily and the shadows were getting long as the afternoon wore on. The patients were talking to each other.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; “I have a strong fear of lions”, said one with a bandaged leg. He shivered slightly.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A long, thin boy coughed and then said, “Heh, the very thought of Nzoka the snake makes my skin go pimply.”<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A man who was recovering from malaria said in a tired voice, “Heh, Kifaru the rhino with his feet that shake the ground, his fierce horn, his …” Words failed him after that.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“No, the creatures to really fear” Daudi said, in a voice that carried, “are Mbu the mosquito and Papasi the tick and Hazi the fly. Small things, yes, but they kill a thousand more people than all the fierce ones of the jungle. Daudi stopped, absolutely still. “But there is another thing more deadly, more dangerous …”<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A visible shudder went through those that listened.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“I shall tell of it”, said Daudi. “It is the tale of the small wisdom of feeding vultures.”</p>
        <p>“Nyani the monkey hated vultures.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But his second wife’s first cousin, Tichi was a creature of the smallest intelligence. He merely said he hated vultures, but he was fascinated by their sharp beaks, their featherless necks, the way their tails swayed and the curve of their dangerous claws.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;One day a vulture alighted on the ground near Tichi’s family tree. <span class="txt-underline"><strong>His eyes drank in every movement of the foul bird</strong></span>. He looked this way and that way. No one was looking and he threw it food. Then, because of the voice within him which spoke loudly against vultures, he shouted in a harsh voice. With many gestures, he ordered it to be gone.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Next day, two vultures came. His eyes were hot as he looked at them, peering through a hole in the tree. His mouth was dry. Furtively he looked to see if he was observed, but those of the jungle were not looking in his direction. Again he threw food to the evil birds who came closer, squawking in a way that was not food for the ears.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Soon more vultures came and came closer, for Tichi repeatedly fed them. Then in a voice that could be heard even in the far thornbush, he uttered threats to throw stones, which would have been terrifying had he not thrown food instead. The vultures fluttered but stood their ground.&nbsp;<br>

        <p><em>Read the (slightly abridged) fable written by Paul White and then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>The Small Wisdom of Feeding Vultures</strong><br><br>
Underneath the buyu tree, outside the hospital clinic, Daudi was handing out medicines. The crows were quarrelling noisily and the shadows were getting long as the afternoon wore on. The patients were talking to each other.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; “I have a strong fear of lions”, said one with a bandaged leg. He shivered slightly.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A long, thin boy coughed and then said, “Heh, the very thought of Nzoka the snake makes my skin go pimply.”<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A man who was recovering from malaria said in a tired voice, “Heh, Kifaru the rhino with his feet that shake the ground, his fierce horn, his …” Words failed him after that.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“No, the creatures to really fear” Daudi said, in a voice that carried, “are Mbu the mosquito and Papasi the tick and Hazi the fly. Small things, yes, but they kill a thousand more people than all the fierce ones of the jungle. Daudi stopped, absolutely still. “But there is another thing more deadly, more dangerous …”<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A visible shudder went through those that listened.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“I shall tell of it”, said Daudi. “It is the tale of the small wisdom of feeding vultures.”</p>
        <p>“Nyani the monkey hated vultures.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But his second wife’s first cousin, Tichi was a creature of the smallest intelligence. He merely said he hated vultures, but he was fascinated by their sharp beaks, their featherless necks, the way their tails swayed and the curve of their dangerous claws.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;One day a vulture alighted on the ground near Tichi’s family tree. <span class="txt-underline"><strong>His eyes drank in every movement of the foul bird</strong></span>. He looked this way and that way. No one was looking and he threw it food. Then, because of the voice within him which spoke loudly against vultures, he shouted in a harsh voice. With many gestures, he ordered it to be gone.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Next day, two vultures came. His eyes were hot as he looked at them, peering through a hole in the tree. His mouth was dry. Furtively he looked to see if he was observed, but those of the jungle were not looking in his direction. Again he threw food to the evil birds who came closer, squawking in a way that was not food for the ears.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Soon more vultures came and came closer, for Tichi repeatedly fed them. Then in a voice that could be heard even in the far thornbush, he uttered threats to throw stones, which would have been terrifying had he not thrown food instead. The vultures fluttered but stood their ground.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Twiga, the giraffe, from his vantage point above the thornbush saw all this and shook his head sadly, for he knew those who fed vultures sought trouble.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A week went by.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The vultures not longer stood at a distance. They came to the very foot of the tree, eating disgustingly the food which the small monkey furtively threw them. He watched them avidly, although fear stirred in his stomach.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In the noon heat of the next day, the bolder vultures were hovering above the buyu tree, pecking savagely at the food he was about to offer.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;High above them circled other vultures. All the time more and more of them arrived. They kept on landing and crowding closer and closer to him.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In real fear, Tichi beat about him with a knobbed stick, but to small purpose. The vultures he had encouraged were quickly overwhelming him. More and more vultures alighted.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;They pressed upon him with their ugly heads and their tearing beaks, viciously pecking at his eyes, his body and his limbs. A shrill monkey scream was drowned by the squawking of vultures.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; At sunset Nyani returned from a journey. He was filled with horror to find the bones of his second wife’s cousin picked clean by the unclean beaks of the filthy birds” “Koh” said one of those who listened, “I will sleep with dreams tonight”<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; “Eh-heh,” said another, grasping the stool on which he sat, “I can see the head with its featherless neck pecking at me. “Yoh!”<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Daudi smiled and then became serious. “So remember not to feed the destructive, and dangerous influences that come hovering over you and want to alight on your life.”&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the (slightly abridged) fable written by Paul White and then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>The Small Wisdom of Feeding Vultures</strong><br><br>
Underneath the buyu tree, outside the hospital clinic, Daudi was handing out medicines. The crows were quarrelling noisily and the shadows were getting long as the afternoon wore on. The patients were talking to each other.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; “I have a strong fear of lions”, said one with a bandaged leg. He shivered slightly.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A long, thin boy coughed and then said, “Heh, the very thought of Nzoka the snake makes my skin go pimply.”<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A man who was recovering from malaria said in a tired voice, “Heh, Kifaru the rhino with his feet that shake the ground, his fierce horn, his …” Words failed him after that.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“No, the creatures to really fear” Daudi said, in a voice that carried, “are Mbu the mosquito and Papasi the tick and Hazi the fly. Small things, yes, but they kill a thousand more people than all the fierce ones of the jungle. Daudi stopped, absolutely still. “But there is another thing more deadly, more dangerous …”<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A visible shudder went through those that listened.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“I shall tell of it”, said Daudi. “It is the tale of the small wisdom of feeding vultures.”</p>
        <p>“Nyani the monkey hated vultures.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But his second wife’s first cousin, Tichi was a creature of the smallest intelligence. He merely said he hated vultures, but he was fascinated by their sharp beaks, their featherless necks, the way their tails swayed and the curve of their dangerous claws.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;One day a vulture alighted on the ground near Tichi’s family tree. <span class="txt-underline"><strong>His eyes drank in every movement of the foul bird</strong></span>. He looked this way and that way. No one was looking and he threw it food. Then, because of the voice within him which spoke loudly against vultures, he shouted in a harsh voice. With many gestures, he ordered it to be gone.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Next day, two vultures came. His eyes were hot as he looked at them, peering through a hole in the tree. His mouth was dry. Furtively he looked to see if he was observed, but those of the jungle were not looking in his direction. Again he threw food to the evil birds who came closer, squawking in a way that was not food for the ears.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Soon more vultures came and came closer, for Tichi repeatedly fed them. Then in a voice that could be heard even in the far thornbush, he uttered threats to throw stones, which would have been terrifying had he not thrown food instead. The vultures fluttered but stood their ground.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Twiga, the giraffe, from his vantage point above the thornbush saw all this and shook his head sadly, for he knew those who fed vultures sought trouble.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A week went by.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The vultures not longer stood at a distance. They came to the very foot of the tree, eating disgustingly the food which the small monkey furtively threw them. He watched them avidly, although fear stirred in his stomach.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In the noon heat of the next day, the bolder vultures were hovering above the buyu tree, pecking savagely at the food he was about to offer.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;High above them circled other vultures. All the time more and more of them arrived. They kept on landing and crowding closer and closer to him.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In real fear, Tichi beat about him with a knobbed stick, but to small purpose. The vultures he had encouraged were quickly overwhelming him. More and more vultures alighted.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;They pressed upon him with their ugly heads and their tearing beaks, viciously pecking at his eyes, his body and his limbs. A shrill monkey scream was drowned by the squawking of vultures.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; At sunset Nyani returned from a journey. He was filled with horror to find the bones of his second wife’s cousin picked clean by the unclean beaks of the filthy birds” “Koh” said one of those who listened, “I will sleep with dreams tonight”<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; “Eh-heh,” said another, grasping the stool on which he sat, “I can see the head with its featherless neck pecking at me. “Yoh!”<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Daudi smiled and then became serious. “So remember not to feed the destructive, and dangerous influences that come hovering over you and want to alight on your life.”&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the (slightly abridged) fable written by Paul White and then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>The Small Wisdom of Feeding Vultures</strong><br><br>
Underneath the buyu tree, outside the hospital clinic, Daudi was handing out medicines. The crows were quarrelling noisily and the shadows were getting long as the afternoon wore on. The patients were talking to each other.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; “I have a strong fear of lions”, said one with a bandaged leg. He shivered slightly.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A long, thin boy coughed and then said, “Heh, the very thought of Nzoka the snake makes my skin go pimply.”<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A man who was recovering from malaria said in a tired voice, “Heh, Kifaru the rhino with his feet that shake the ground, his fierce horn, his …” Words failed him after that.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“No, the creatures to really fear” Daudi said, in a voice that carried, “are Mbu the mosquito and Papasi the tick and Hazi the fly. Small things, yes, but they kill a thousand more people than all the fierce ones of the jungle. Daudi stopped, absolutely still. “But there is another thing more deadly, more dangerous …”<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A visible shudder went through those that listened.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“I shall tell of it”, said Daudi. “It is the tale of the small wisdom of feeding vultures.”</p>
        <p>“Nyani the monkey hated vultures.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But his second wife’s first cousin, Tichi was a creature of the smallest intelligence. He merely said he hated vultures, but he was fascinated by their sharp beaks, their featherless necks, the way their tails swayed and the curve of their dangerous claws.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;One day a vulture alighted on the ground near Tichi’s family tree. <span class="txt-underline"><strong>His eyes drank in every movement of the foul bird</strong></span>. He looked this way and that way. No one was looking and he threw it food. Then, because of the voice within him which spoke loudly against vultures, he shouted in a harsh voice. With many gestures, he ordered it to be gone.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Next day, two vultures came. His eyes were hot as he looked at them, peering through a hole in the tree. His mouth was dry. Furtively he looked to see if he was observed, but those of the jungle were not looking in his direction. Again he threw food to the evil birds who came closer, squawking in a way that was not food for the ears.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Soon more vultures came and came closer, for Tichi repeatedly fed them. Then in a voice that could be heard even in the far thornbush, he uttered threats to throw stones, which would have been terrifying had he not thrown food instead. The vultures fluttered but stood their ground.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Twiga, the giraffe, from his vantage point above the thornbush saw all this and shook his head sadly, for he knew those who fed vultures sought trouble.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A week went by.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The vultures not longer stood at a distance. They came to the very foot of the tree, eating disgustingly the food which the small monkey furtively threw them. He watched them avidly, although fear stirred in his stomach.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In the noon heat of the next day, the bolder vultures were hovering above the buyu tree, pecking savagely at the food he was about to offer.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;High above them circled other vultures. All the time more and more of them arrived. They kept on landing and crowding closer and closer to him.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In real fear, Tichi beat about him with a knobbed stick, but to small purpose. The vultures he had encouraged were quickly overwhelming him. More and more vultures alighted.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;They pressed upon him with their ugly heads and their tearing beaks, viciously pecking at his eyes, his body and his limbs. A shrill monkey scream was drowned by the squawking of vultures.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; At sunset Nyani returned from a journey. He was filled with horror to find the bones of his second wife’s cousin picked clean by the unclean beaks of the filthy birds” “Koh” said one of those who listened, “I will sleep with dreams tonight”<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; “Eh-heh,” said another, grasping the stool on which he sat, “I can see the head with its featherless neck pecking at me. “Yoh!”<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Daudi smiled and then became serious. “So remember not to feed the destructive, and dangerous influences that come hovering over you and want to alight on your life.”&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

This is the turning of the year<br>
The final scene before the curtain falls<br>
The squirrel, warm within his bed<br>
Of leaves cannot hear the wind<br>
That blows around the chimney pots<br>
For like the pilgrim of the year gone by</p>
        <p>Once he was a young man<br>
Who laughed in the spring<br>
And lay beneath an upturned sky<br>
On long hot summer days</p>
        <p>But with autumn he grows mellow<br>
He looks over his shoulder<br>
Down the long year path of no return</p>
        <p>Already he is but a memory<br>
Fading like a shadow on the wall<br>
But time with restless footsteps<br>
Hurries by and now beside the road<br>
There stands the pilgrim<br>
Of the year to be</p>
        <p>Falling leaves turn to gold<br>
Silver flowers on my window<br>
Spirit of the fading year<br>
He knows not where<br>
He cannot say, oh no</p>
        <p>Naked trees in the sky<br>
Stars are shining clear and cold<br>
The minstrel of the ages<br>
Sings of oh so long ago<br>
An age-old tune without a name<br>
No one knows</p>
        <p>In the white falling snow<br>
The pilgrim travels on<br>
His face towards the sun<br>
Beyond the open road he travels on</p>
        <p>Past the lamp shining windows<br>
And faces by the fire<br>
Before the midnight hour<br>
For Christmas time<br>
Has come around again</p>

This is the turning of the year<br>
The final scene before the curtain falls<br>
The squirrel, warm within his bed<br>
Of leaves cannot hear the wind<br>
That blows around the chimney pots<br>
For like the pilgrim of the year gone by</p>
        <p>Once he was a young man<br>
Who laughed in the spring<br>
And lay beneath an upturned sky<br>
On long hot summer days</p>
        <p>But with autumn he grows mellow<br>
He looks over his shoulder<br>
Down the long year path of no return</p>
        <p>Already he is but a memory<br>
Fading like a shadow on the wall<br>
But time with restless footsteps<br>
Hurries by and now beside the road<br>
There stands the pilgrim<br>
Of the year to be</p>
        <p>Falling leaves turn to gold<br>
Silver flowers on my window<br>
Spirit of the fading year<br>
He knows not where<br>
He cannot say, oh no</p>
        <p>Naked trees in the sky<br>
Stars are shining clear and cold<br>
The minstrel of the ages<br>
Sings of oh so long ago<br>
An age-old tune without a name<br>
No one knows</p>
        <p>In the white falling snow<br>
The pilgrim travels on<br>
His face towards the sun<br>
Beyond the open road he travels on</p>
        <p>Past the lamp shining windows<br>
And faces by the fire<br>
Before the midnight hour<br>
For Christmas time<br>
Has come around again</p>

This is the turning of the year<br>
The final scene before the curtain falls<br>
The squirrel, warm within his bed<br>
Of leaves cannot hear the wind<br>
That blows around the chimney pots<br>
For like the pilgrim of the year gone by</p>
        <p>Once he was a young man<br>
Who laughed in the spring<br>
And lay beneath an upturned sky<br>
On long hot summer days</p>
        <p>But with autumn he grows mellow<br>
He looks over his shoulder<br>
Down the long year path of no return</p>
        <p>Already he is but a memory<br>
Fading like a shadow on the wall<br>
But time with restless footsteps<br>
Hurries by and now beside the road<br>
There stands the pilgrim<br>
Of the year to be</p>
        <p>Falling leaves turn to gold<br>
Silver flowers on my window<br>
Spirit of the fading year<br>
He knows not where<br>
He cannot say, oh no</p>
        <p>Naked trees in the sky<br>
Stars are shining clear and cold<br>
The minstrel of the ages<br>
Sings of oh so long ago<br>
An age-old tune without a name<br>
No one knows</p>
        <p>In the white falling snow<br>
The pilgrim travels on<br>
His face towards the sun<br>
Beyond the open road he travels on</p>
        <p>Past the lamp shining windows<br>
And faces by the fire<br>
Before the midnight hour<br>
For Christmas time<br>
Has come around again</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>The Namib Desert<br>
<br>
15</strong> ……….. Covering an area of 31,274 sq. mi (81,000 sq. km), the Namib is a coastal desert, situated along the south-western coast of the African continent. Stretching over 1200mi (2000km), the Namib crosses Angola, Namibia and South Africa. Characterised by red sand dunes that can reach impressive heights, the Namib is considered to be particularly old, even by geological standard.</p>
        <p><strong>16 </strong>……….. The word ‘Namib’ is of Nama origin, and means ‘open space’. Geologists believe that the Namib Desert is the world’s oldest desert. It is thought that an arid climate began to dominate in the region approximately 55 million years old, before changing to a semi-arid climate 14-18 million years ago. The Namib is home to the highest sand dunes in the world; some of which can reach over 1280ft (390m) high and can even be seen from space. Diamonds are the most important mineral asset found in the Namib Desert. Due to the lightweight nature of diamonds and the ease of theft, the entire region where the diamonds are situated has been declared a Prohibited Area, totally closed to public access.</p>
        <p><strong>17 </strong>……….. The Namib experiences less than 1cm of rain annually and is almost entirely barren. Strangely, whilst the region is virtually rainless, its air is typically at or near to saturation point, and fog is very common. The coastal regions have a steady temperature throughout the day and seasons of 9-20°C.The wind blows inland pushing moisture ladened air from the sea inland forming thick fog and providing plants and wildlife with a rare reliable water source. Inland temperatures vary much more and they can be freezing overnight and reach 45°C during daylight hours. Rainfall is rare along the coast and central regions of the desert but it increases as the desert rises towards the towering Great Escarpment at its rear. Many streams run from this rock formation back through the desert towards the sea. Few reach it as they evaporate or soak below the desert. These water reserves are tapped to support the desert’s few towns.</p>
        <p><strong>18 </strong>……….. Whilst there are other coastal deserts (such as the Atacama) bounded by cool ocean currents, the Namib is the only one in which endemic plants and animals have evolved in virtually barren dunes. In fact, the Namib is teeming with animals, including elephants, rhinos, Hartmann’s zebra, lions, gemsbok and the black-faced impala.</p>
        <p><strong>19 </strong>……….. A number of rare and interesting plants are present in the Namib Desert, such as the Welwitschia Mirabilis, which consists only of 2 leaves and a stem, and is estimated to reach up to 2000 years old. It can grow up to 6-feet high, and 24-feet wide, and was referred to by Darwin as the ‘the platypus of the plant kingdom. Another bizarre plant is the Quiver Tree, which effectively cuts off its own branches in times of severe drought in order to save moisture loss through its leaves.</p>
        <p><strong>20 </strong>……….. The Namib is well-protected by a range of national parks, such as the Namib-Naukluft National Park (19,215 sq. mi / 49,768 sq. km) which protects the central area of the region. In fact, most of the desert is covered by some level of protection as can be seen by the map below. In 2012 a stretch of the coastal desert was designated a World Heritage site.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>The Namib Desert<br>
<br>
15</strong> ……….. Covering an area of 31,274 sq. mi (81,000 sq. km), the Namib is a coastal desert, situated along the south-western coast of the African continent. Stretching over 1200mi (2000km), the Namib crosses Angola, Namibia and South Africa. Characterised by red sand dunes that can reach impressive heights, the Namib is considered to be particularly old, even by geological standard.</p>
        <p><strong>16 </strong>……….. The word ‘Namib’ is of Nama origin, and means ‘open space’. Geologists believe that the Namib Desert is the world’s oldest desert. It is thought that an arid climate began to dominate in the region approximately 55 million years old, before changing to a semi-arid climate 14-18 million years ago. The Namib is home to the highest sand dunes in the world; some of which can reach over 1280ft (390m) high and can even be seen from space. Diamonds are the most important mineral asset found in the Namib Desert. Due to the lightweight nature of diamonds and the ease of theft, the entire region where the diamonds are situated has been declared a Prohibited Area, totally closed to public access.</p>
        <p><strong>17 </strong>……….. The Namib experiences less than 1cm of rain annually and is almost entirely barren. Strangely, whilst the region is virtually rainless, its air is typically at or near to saturation point, and fog is very common. The coastal regions have a steady temperature throughout the day and seasons of 9-20°C.The wind blows inland pushing moisture ladened air from the sea inland forming thick fog and providing plants and wildlife with a rare reliable water source. Inland temperatures vary much more and they can be freezing overnight and reach 45°C during daylight hours. Rainfall is rare along the coast and central regions of the desert but it increases as the desert rises towards the towering Great Escarpment at its rear. Many streams run from this rock formation back through the desert towards the sea. Few reach it as they evaporate or soak below the desert. These water reserves are tapped to support the desert’s few towns.</p>
        <p><strong>18 </strong>……….. Whilst there are other coastal deserts (such as the Atacama) bounded by cool ocean currents, the Namib is the only one in which endemic plants and animals have evolved in virtually barren dunes. In fact, the Namib is teeming with animals, including elephants, rhinos, Hartmann’s zebra, lions, gemsbok and the black-faced impala.</p>
        <p><strong>19 </strong>……….. A number of rare and interesting plants are present in the Namib Desert, such as the Welwitschia Mirabilis, which consists only of 2 leaves and a stem, and is estimated to reach up to 2000 years old. It can grow up to 6-feet high, and 24-feet wide, and was referred to by Darwin as the ‘the platypus of the plant kingdom. Another bizarre plant is the Quiver Tree, which effectively cuts off its own branches in times of severe drought in order to save moisture loss through its leaves.</p>
        <p><strong>20 </strong>……….. The Namib is well-protected by a range of national parks, such as the Namib-Naukluft National Park (19,215 sq. mi / 49,768 sq. km) which protects the central area of the region. In fact, most of the desert is covered by some level of protection as can be seen by the map below. In 2012 a stretch of the coastal desert was designated a World Heritage site.</p>

<br>
15</strong> ……….. Covering an area of 31,274 sq. mi (81,000 sq. km), the Namib is a coastal desert, situated along the south-western coast of the African continent. Stretching over 1200mi (2000km), the Namib crosses Angola, Namibia and South Africa. Characterised by red sand dunes that can reach impressive heights, the Namib is considered to be particularly old, even by geological standard.</p>
        <p><strong>16 </strong>……….. The word ‘Namib’ is of Nama origin, and means ‘open space’. Geologists believe that the Namib Desert is the world’s oldest desert. It is thought that an arid climate began to dominate in the region approximately 55 million years old, before changing to a semi-arid climate 14-18 million years ago. The Namib is home to the highest sand dunes in the world; some of which can reach over 1280ft (390m) high and can even be seen from space. Diamonds are the most important mineral asset found in the Namib Desert. Due to the lightweight nature of diamonds and the ease of theft, the entire region where the diamonds are situated has been declared a Prohibited Area, totally closed to public access.</p>
        <p><strong>17 </strong>……….. The Namib experiences less than 1cm of rain annually and is almost entirely barren. Strangely, whilst the region is virtually rainless, its air is typically at or near to saturation point, and fog is very common. The coastal regions have a steady temperature throughout the day and seasons of 9-20°C.The wind blows inland pushing moisture ladened air from the sea inland forming thick fog and providing plants and wildlife with a rare reliable water source. Inland temperatures vary much more and they can be freezing overnight and reach 45°C during daylight hours. Rainfall is rare along the coast and central regions of the desert but it increases as the desert rises towards the towering Great Escarpment at its rear. Many streams run from this rock formation back through the desert towards the sea. Few reach it as they evaporate or soak below the desert. These water reserves are tapped to support the desert’s few towns.</p>
        <p><strong>18 </strong>……….. Whilst there are other coastal deserts (such as the Atacama) bounded by cool ocean currents, the Namib is the only one in which endemic plants and animals have evolved in virtually barren dunes. In fact, the Namib is teeming with animals, including elephants, rhinos, Hartmann’s zebra, lions, gemsbok and the black-faced impala.</p>
        <p><strong>19 </strong>……….. A number of rare and interesting plants are present in the Namib Desert, such as the Welwitschia Mirabilis, which consists only of 2 leaves and a stem, and is estimated to reach up to 2000 years old. It can grow up to 6-feet high, and 24-feet wide, and was referred to by Darwin as the ‘the platypus of the plant kingdom. Another bizarre plant is the Quiver Tree, which effectively cuts off its own branches in times of severe drought in order to save moisture loss through its leaves.</p>
        <p><strong>20 </strong>……….. The Namib is well-protected by a range of national parks, such as the Namib-Naukluft National Park (19,215 sq. mi / 49,768 sq. km) which protects the central area of the region. In fact, most of the desert is covered by some level of protection as can be seen by the map below. In 2012 a stretch of the coastal desert was designated a World Heritage site.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>The Namib Desert<br>
<br>
15</strong> ……….. Covering an area of 31,274 sq. mi (81,000 sq. km), the Namib is a coastal desert, situated along the south-western coast of the African continent. Stretching over 1200mi (2000km), the Namib crosses Angola, Namibia and South Africa. Characterised by red sand dunes that can reach impressive heights, the Namib is considered to be particularly old, even by geological standard.</p>
        <p><strong>16 </strong>……….. The word ‘Namib’ is of Nama origin, and means ‘open space’. Geologists believe that the Namib Desert is the world’s oldest desert. It is thought that an arid climate began to dominate in the region approximately 55 million years old, before changing to a semi-arid climate 14-18 million years ago. The Namib is home to the highest sand dunes in the world; some of which can reach over 1280ft (390m) high and can even be seen from space. Diamonds are the most important mineral asset found in the Namib Desert. Due to the lightweight nature of diamonds and the ease of theft, the entire region where the diamonds are situated has been declared a Prohibited Area, totally closed to public access.</p>
        <p><strong>17 </strong>……….. The Namib experiences less than 1cm of rain annually and is almost entirely barren. Strangely, whilst the region is virtually rainless, its air is typically at or near to saturation point, and fog is very common. The coastal regions have a steady temperature throughout the day and seasons of 9-20°C.The wind blows inland pushing moisture ladened air from the sea inland forming thick fog and providing plants and wildlife with a rare reliable water source. Inland temperatures vary much more and they can be freezing overnight and reach 45°C during daylight hours. Rainfall is rare along the coast and central regions of the desert but it increases as the desert rises towards the towering Great Escarpment at its rear. Many streams run from this rock formation back through the desert towards the sea. Few reach it as they evaporate or soak below the desert. These water reserves are tapped to support the desert’s few towns.</p>
        <p><strong>18 </strong>……….. Whilst there are other coastal deserts (such as the Atacama) bounded by cool ocean currents, the Namib is the only one in which endemic plants and animals have evolved in virtually barren dunes. In fact, the Namib is teeming with animals, including elephants, rhinos, Hartmann’s zebra, lions, gemsbok and the black-faced impala.</p>
        <p><strong>19 </strong>……….. A number of rare and interesting plants are present in the Namib Desert, such as the Welwitschia Mirabilis, which consists only of 2 leaves and a stem, and is estimated to reach up to 2000 years old. It can grow up to 6-feet high, and 24-feet wide, and was referred to by Darwin as the ‘the platypus of the plant kingdom. Another bizarre plant is the Quiver Tree, which effectively cuts off its own branches in times of severe drought in order to save moisture loss through its leaves.</p>
        <p><strong>20 </strong>……….. The Namib is well-protected by a range of national parks, such as the Namib-Naukluft National Park (19,215 sq. mi / 49,768 sq. km) which protects the central area of the region. In fact, most of the desert is covered by some level of protection as can be seen by the map below. In 2012 a stretch of the coastal desert was designated a World Heritage site.</p>

Cornrows are a type of braided hairstyle in which “the hair is braided very close to the scalp, using an underhand, upward motion to make a continuous, raised row.” Also known as canerows in the Caribbean, they can be styled in straight lines as well as in intricate geometric or curved patterns. They have been traced back to around 3,000 BCE where they were found in various cultures of West Africa and the Horn of Africa. The earliest documentation has been in Stone Age paintings in the Tassili Plateau of the Sahara. However, in more recent history, cornrows were used as a powerful tool of resistance against slavery and bondage. During the Middle Passage, millions of enslaved Africans were chained and transported across the Atlantic to the Americas. They were made to shave their heads for the purpose of “sanitation” and as a way to strip them of their culture and identity. But this wasn’t adhered to by everyone. Many of those enslaved grew out their hair and braided it into cornrows as an act of resistance, rebellion and reclamation of cultural identity.<br>

<p>A good, timely haircut is something we women prefer not to save on. It’s better to save on a dress or a new shirt – nobody would notice if you are rocking a trendy cut. Although hair styling is important, it’s often secondary, because even the messiest hairstyles need a proper base – a quality cut that has its shape and texture. In this case your hairstyle will be read appealing and harmonious even if it’s the shaggiest “unkempt” ‘do. Somehow when we see bed head hair we always guess right whether it’s a true hairstyle or lack of styling, right? Click here to find out what is new there in the haircut world, select the ideas for your new cut and anticipate your style reboot! For short haircuts, the classic cropped ‘dos have got a serious style update during the last couple of seasons. Contrasting textures and lengths, undercut sections and customized colors make them unique and bring to light the femininity of the wearer. Here are ideas of classy modern crops for every hair type. For medium haircuts, the midi length hair is the golden mean that lets you enjoy free-flowing locks or sweep your hair up in a cute updo whenever the mood strikes you. If you want to rest from the maintenance of longer locks, consider a trendy shoulder-grazing cut and enjoy the benefits that come along. We are ready to suggest numerous varieties of bobs, lobs and midi shags. For long haircuts, summer is the right time to unleash your fantasy and discover the potential of lengthy locks. A subtly feathered cut will let your strands flow nicely over the shoulders and won’t give many undesired fly-aways in an updo or a braid. The fans of edgier looks may go for shags, heavier layers or undercut styles.<br>

Throughout history and across various cultures, hair and hairstyles have had significance far beyond aesthetic beauty and protection from weather.</p>

<p>Hairstyles have symbolised one’s age, tribal affiliations, ethnicity, religion, social status, marital status and more, and have allowed ethnic and cultural groups to define and even reclaim their identities. Many of these styles have stood the test of time and remain prominent today within and without the unique cultures in which they originated. In the age of social media, however, many of these traditional hairstyles have been adopted—or appropriated rather—by celebrities, social media influencers and festival-goers as mere fashion statements without any thought given to their deep cultural significance or painful history. Thus, learning about the history and significance of hair is vital to fostering a more mindful and respectful attitude towards Black, Indigenous and People of Colour.<br>

Hair is a 1979 American musical anti-war comedy-drama film based on the 1968 Broadway musical Hair: The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical. Set against the backdrop of the long-haired hippie counterculture of the Vietnam era, the film focuses on a Vietnam War draftee who meets and befriends a "tribe" of hippies while en route to the army induction center. The hippies and their leader introduce him to illegal drug use and their environment of unorthodox relationships and draft evasion. The musical’s title song begins as character Claude slowly croons his reason for his long hair, as tribe-mate Berger joins in singing they "don't know." They lead the tribe, singing "Give me a head with hair," "as long as God can grow it," listing what they want in a head of hair and their uses for it. Later the song takes the tune of "The Star-Spangled Banner" with the tribe punning "Oh say can you see/ My eyes if you can/Then my hair’s too short!"</p>

Set against the backdrop of the long-haired hippie counterculture of the Vietnam era, the film focuses on a Vietnam War draftee who meets and befriends a "tribe" of hippies while en route to the army induction center. The hippies and their leader introduce him to illegal drug use and their environment of unorthodox relationships and draft evasion. The musical’s title song begins as character Claude slowly croons his reason for his long hair, as tribe-mate Berger joins in singing they "don't know." They lead the tribe, singing "Give me a head with hair," "as long as God can grow it," listing what they want in a head of hair and their uses for it. Later the song takes the tune of "The Star-Spangled Banner" with the tribe punning "Oh say can you see/ My eyes if you can/Then my hair’s too short!"</p>

Cornrows are a type of braided hairstyle in which “the hair is braided very close to the scalp, using an underhand, upward motion to make a continuous, raised row.” Also known as canerows in the Caribbean, they can be styled in straight lines as well as in intricate geometric or curved patterns. They have been traced back to around 3,000 BCE where they were found in various cultures of West Africa and the Horn of Africa. The earliest documentation has been in Stone Age paintings in the Tassili Plateau of the Sahara. However, in more recent history, cornrows were used as a powerful tool of resistance against slavery and bondage. During the Middle Passage, millions of enslaved Africans were chained and transported across the Atlantic to the Americas. They were made to shave their heads for the purpose of “sanitation” and as a way to strip them of their culture and identity. But this wasn’t adhered to by everyone. Many of those enslaved grew out their hair and braided it into cornrows as an act of resistance, rebellion and reclamation of cultural identity.<br>

<p>A good, timely haircut is something we women prefer not to save on. It’s better to save on a dress or a new shirt – nobody would notice if you are rocking a trendy cut. Although hair styling is important, it’s often secondary, because even the messiest hairstyles need a proper base – a quality cut that has its shape and texture. In this case your hairstyle will be read appealing and harmonious even if it’s the shaggiest “unkempt” ‘do. Somehow when we see bed head hair we always guess right whether it’s a true hairstyle or lack of styling, right? Click here to find out what is new there in the haircut world, select the ideas for your new cut and anticipate your style reboot! For short haircuts, the classic cropped ‘dos have got a serious style update during the last couple of seasons. Contrasting textures and lengths, undercut sections and customized colors make them unique and bring to light the femininity of the wearer. Here are ideas of classy modern crops for every hair type. For medium haircuts, the midi length hair is the golden mean that lets you enjoy free-flowing locks or sweep your hair up in a cute updo whenever the mood strikes you. If you want to rest from the maintenance of longer locks, consider a trendy shoulder-grazing cut and enjoy the benefits that come along. We are ready to suggest numerous varieties of bobs, lobs and midi shags. For long haircuts, summer is the right time to unleash your fantasy and discover the potential of lengthy locks. A subtly feathered cut will let your strands flow nicely over the shoulders and won’t give many undesired fly-aways in an updo or a braid. The fans of edgier looks may go for shags, heavier layers or undercut styles.<br>

Throughout history and across various cultures, hair and hairstyles have had significance far beyond aesthetic beauty and protection from weather.</p>

<p>Hairstyles have symbolised one’s age, tribal affiliations, ethnicity, religion, social status, marital status and more, and have allowed ethnic and cultural groups to define and even reclaim their identities. Many of these styles have stood the test of time and remain prominent today within and without the unique cultures in which they originated. In the age of social media, however, many of these traditional hairstyles have been adopted—or appropriated rather—by celebrities, social media influencers and festival-goers as mere fashion statements without any thought given to their deep cultural significance or painful history. Thus, learning about the history and significance of hair is vital to fostering a more mindful and respectful attitude towards Black, Indigenous and People of Colour.<br>
