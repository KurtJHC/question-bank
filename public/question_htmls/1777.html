          <strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Walking the Yukon Trail</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>15</strong>&nbsp; ………..&nbsp; The name "Yukon Trail" conjures images of a rugged, pristine vastness, lying deep in the wilderness along the border between Alaska and the mountains of western Canada. It should because they were carved into the Yukon to give gold prospectors access to the previously inaccessible reaches of that beautiful but forbidding country. Some of these trails still exist, giving hikers the opportunity to explore the landscape of the Yukon.</p>
        <p><strong>16</strong>&nbsp; ………..&nbsp; Strictly speaking, there are multiple "Yukon Trails," or routes used by prospectors and settlers seeking access to the depths of the Yukon during the Klondike Gold Rush. These include the Overland Trail in Canada and the international Chilkoot Trail. No modern trail in the Yukon actually bears the name "The Yukon Trail."</p>
        <p><strong>17</strong>&nbsp; ………..&nbsp; Chilkoot Trail is possibly the most accessible because it connects the US Klondike Gold Rush National Historic Park with Canada's Chilkoot Trail National Historic Site – both ends of the trail are in a national park facility. Although the trail is only 33 miles long, its difficult terrain and strenuous nature make hiking it a backpacking and camping expedition. According to the Parks Canada, just hiking the almost 8 miles from Sheep Camp to Happy Camp takes 12 hours.</p>
        <p><strong>18</strong>&nbsp; ………..&nbsp; Another Yukon trail is the Dawson Overland Trail, perhaps best known for its part of the famed Yukon Quest dog-sledding race. The modern trail runs 70 miles from Whitehorse and Braeburn Lodge, entirely within the Canadian Yukon. However, the classic Overland Trail ran all the way to Dawson City, near the US-Canadian border, and from there into Alaska. This route started as a dog-sledding freight path and is now used by hikers, horseback riders, dog-sledders and snowmobilers.</p>
        <p><strong>19</strong>&nbsp; ………..&nbsp; The Yukon is a habitat for both grizzly and black bears, so safety precautions must be followed. The National Park Service requests that all hikers on Chilkoot Trail use their bear-safe food containers and camp only in designated areas. If this is not possible, hang your food in its container some distance from the camp using a rope and a bear pole, so it is both out of reach and a safe distance away. Make plenty of noise while hiking to give bears warning of your approach.</p>
        <p>Some of the Yukon Trails are slowly being visited more often.<br>
Accommodating natural creatures and humans in the same environment is not always easy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Isolated and relatively untouched is the best way to describe the Yukon Trails.<br>
The Yukon is often considered to be part of the Rocky Mountains but it is not.&nbsp;<br>
Sub-zero hiking in the Yukon is not for the faint-hearted or inexperienced.<br>
The Yukon Trail should be spoken of in the plural form.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Largely through Jack London’s stories, the Yukon has been associated with dogs and sleds.</p>
        <p><strong>20</strong> &nbsp;………..&nbsp; Due to frigid temperatures, heavy snowfall and the risk of avalanche, hiking on the Chilkoot Trail in winter is not recommended by either US or Canadian park authorities. Snows persist in the upper reaches of the trail well into June, so the Chilkoot hiking season is between mid-June and late September. The Dawson route, on the other hand, is open all year to hikers using snowshoes.</p>

        <p>Science fiction is a genre of speculative fiction that contains imagined elements that don’t exist in the real world. Science fiction spans a wide range of themes that often explore time travel, space travel, are set in the future, and deal with the consequences of technological and scientific advance. The science fiction genre dates back to the second century. A True Story, written by the Syrian satirist Lucian, is thought to be the first sci-fi story, which explored other universes and extraterrestrial lifeforms. Modern science developed during the Age of Enlightenment, and writers reacted to scientific and technological advancements with a wave of sci-fi stories like New Atlantis by Francis Bacon (1627), Somnium by Johannes Kepler (1634), and Comical History of the States and Empires of the Moon by Cyrano de Bergerac (1657). Science fiction is often called the “literature of ideas.” Sci-fi novels include a wide variety of futuristic concepts. Since they’re so imaginative, anything is possible, especially in soft sci-fi novels. A sci-fi novel can be about space, time travel, aliens, or time-traveling aliens in space. Regardless of the setting and characters, all sci-fi stories are complex, contain nuanced detail, and explore larger themes and commentary—sometimes satirically—about society beneath the surface.</p>

        <p>Brave New World is a classic - it is a dystopian novel similar in theme to George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. I was recommended to read this book, by my cousin, as I enjoy dystopian novels. Brave New World revolves around the idea of totalitarianism and is set in a futuristic world where a combination of science and pleasure form a rather feudalistic society. This idea of totalitarianism is achieved through test tube babies, and hypnotism, resulting in a pre-ordained caste system consisting of intelligent humans suited to the highest positions and conversely, serf-like beings genetically programmed to carry out menial works. In this world of Alphas, Betas, Gammas, Deltas and the unfortunate Epsilons, exists drug-induced happiness, caused by what is known as soma. Here, "everyone belongs to everyone else" emphasising the system of forced promiscuity, brainwashed into the people from the moment of birth. At the core of this book is the horrific idea of eugenics and despite being written several decades ago, its message remains valid for our generation.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}</p>
        <p>Here are a few tips on how to write science fiction. Draw inspiration for your story from real life. Take an idea from current society and move it a little further down the road. Even if human beings are short-term thinkers, fiction can anticipate and extrapolate into multiple versions of the future. Do some research. It may seem paradoxical, but research will strengthen your project, no matter how far you end up straying from historical facts. Conducting research too early in the drafting process can sidetrack or slow down the plot, but it’s critical to keep your reader immersed in and believing the world you’ve created. Getting the details wrong can throw off their belief in your story. Create a set of rules for the world of your novel—and stick to them. Sci-fi is not automatically interesting; it must be made compelling, plausible, and accurate within its own set of rules. Rules add weight to the material or change the stakes for your characters and/or readers. Once you establish a rule, if you break it, you break the illusion of a believable and compelling world. Keep it grounded in reality. Any technological or fantastical element in sci-fi should have roots in what our current species can already do or is on the road to being able to do.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>{^ <strong>Extract D</strong> ^}</p>
        <p>Science Fiction doesn’t have to be filled with strange aliens, amazing action, and unusual locales. Sometimes the best sci-fi is contemplative, asking the audience to explore themselves and the nature of the universe without even leaving the planet. Contact is one of the best Earth-set, modern sci-fi dramas ever made simply because of the weighty questions it poses and partially answers. Based on a novel by one of the foremost scientific minds of the 20th Century, Carl Sagan, Contact stars Jodie Foster in her most introspective role as a SETI (search for extraterrestrial intelligence) scientist working at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico where she makes what she believes is contact with aliens who provide her a series of coded messages that, when deciphered, form a series of blueprints that will enable her to travel vast distances to meet these strange aliens. Ellie struggles not just to get her machine built, but against a government wanting to remove her from her own discovery and a religious leader (Matthew McConaughey) asking her to question the implications of her decisions. The only person in her corner is a wealthy benefactor (John Hurt) wanting to give her all the opportunities he can.</p>

Sometimes the best sci-fi is contemplative, asking the audience to explore themselves and the nature of the universe without even leaving the planet. Contact is one of the best Earth-set, modern sci-fi dramas ever made simply because of the weighty questions it poses and partially answers. Based on a novel by one of the foremost scientific minds of the 20th Century, Carl Sagan, Contact stars Jodie Foster in her most introspective role as a SETI (search for extraterrestrial intelligence) scientist working at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico where she makes what she believes is contact with aliens who provide her a series of coded messages that, when deciphered, form a series of blueprints that will enable her to travel vast distances to meet these strange aliens. Ellie struggles not just to get her machine built, but against a government wanting to remove her from her own discovery and a religious leader (Matthew McConaughey) asking her to question the implications of her decisions. The only person in her corner is a wealthy benefactor (John Hurt) wanting to give her all the opportunities he can.</p>

        <p>Science fiction is a genre of speculative fiction that contains imagined elements that don’t exist in the real world. Science fiction spans a wide range of themes that often explore time travel, space travel, are set in the future, and deal with the consequences of technological and scientific advance. The science fiction genre dates back to the second century. A True Story, written by the Syrian satirist Lucian, is thought to be the first sci-fi story, which explored other universes and extraterrestrial lifeforms. Modern science developed during the Age of Enlightenment, and writers reacted to scientific and technological advancements with a wave of sci-fi stories like New Atlantis by Francis Bacon (1627), Somnium by Johannes Kepler (1634), and Comical History of the States and Empires of the Moon by Cyrano de Bergerac (1657). Science fiction is often called the “literature of ideas.” Sci-fi novels include a wide variety of futuristic concepts. Since they’re so imaginative, anything is possible, especially in soft sci-fi novels. A sci-fi novel can be about space, time travel, aliens, or time-traveling aliens in space. Regardless of the setting and characters, all sci-fi stories are complex, contain nuanced detail, and explore larger themes and commentary—sometimes satirically—about society beneath the surface.</p>

        <p>{^ <strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}</p>
        <p>Brave New World is a classic - it is a dystopian novel similar in theme to George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. I was recommended to read this book, by my cousin, as I enjoy dystopian novels. Brave New World revolves around the idea of totalitarianism and is set in a futuristic world where a combination of science and pleasure form a rather feudalistic society. This idea of totalitarianism is achieved through test tube babies, and hypnotism, resulting in a pre-ordained caste system consisting of intelligent humans suited to the highest positions and conversely, serf-like beings genetically programmed to carry out menial works. In this world of Alphas, Betas, Gammas, Deltas and the unfortunate Epsilons, exists drug-induced happiness, caused by what is known as soma. Here, "everyone belongs to everyone else" emphasising the system of forced promiscuity, brainwashed into the people from the moment of birth. At the core of this book is the horrific idea of eugenics and despite being written several decades ago, its message remains valid for our generation.</p>

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}</p>
        <p>Here are a few tips on how to write science fiction. Draw inspiration for your story from real life. Take an idea from current society and move it a little further down the road. Even if human beings are short-term thinkers, fiction can anticipate and extrapolate into multiple versions of the future. Do some research. It may seem paradoxical, but research will strengthen your project, no matter how far you end up straying from historical facts. Conducting research too early in the drafting process can sidetrack or slow down the plot, but it’s critical to keep your reader immersed in and believing the world you’ve created. Getting the details wrong can throw off their belief in your story. Create a set of rules for the world of your novel—and stick to them. Sci-fi is not automatically interesting; it must be made compelling, plausible, and accurate within its own set of rules. Rules add weight to the material or change the stakes for your characters and/or readers. Once you establish a rule, if you break it, you break the illusion of a believable and compelling world. Keep it grounded in reality. Any technological or fantastical element in sci-fi should have roots in what our current species can already do or is on the road to being able to do.</p>

        <p>Science fiction is a genre of speculative fiction that contains imagined elements that don’t exist in the real world. Science fiction spans a wide range of themes that often explore time travel, space travel, are set in the future, and deal with the consequences of technological and scientific advance. The science fiction genre dates back to the second century. A True Story, written by the Syrian satirist Lucian, is thought to be the first sci-fi story, which explored other universes and extraterrestrial lifeforms. Modern science developed during the Age of Enlightenment, and writers reacted to scientific and technological advancements with a wave of sci-fi stories like New Atlantis by Francis Bacon (1627), Somnium by Johannes Kepler (1634), and Comical History of the States and Empires of the Moon by Cyrano de Bergerac (1657). Science fiction is often called the “literature of ideas.” Sci-fi novels include a wide variety of futuristic concepts. Since they’re so imaginative, anything is possible, especially in soft sci-fi novels. A sci-fi novel can be about space, time travel, aliens, or time-traveling aliens in space. Regardless of the setting and characters, all sci-fi stories are complex, contain nuanced detail, and explore larger themes and commentary—sometimes satirically—about society beneath the surface.</p>

        <p>Brave New World is a classic - it is a dystopian novel similar in theme to George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. I was recommended to read this book, by my cousin, as I enjoy dystopian novels. Brave New World revolves around the idea of totalitarianism and is set in a futuristic world where a combination of science and pleasure form a rather feudalistic society. This idea of totalitarianism is achieved through test tube babies, and hypnotism, resulting in a pre-ordained caste system consisting of intelligent humans suited to the highest positions and conversely, serf-like beings genetically programmed to carry out menial works. In this world of Alphas, Betas, Gammas, Deltas and the unfortunate Epsilons, exists drug-induced happiness, caused by what is known as soma. Here, "everyone belongs to everyone else" emphasising the system of forced promiscuity, brainwashed into the people from the moment of birth. At the core of this book is the horrific idea of eugenics and despite being written several decades ago, its message remains valid for our generation.</p>

        <p>Here are a few tips on how to write science fiction. Draw inspiration for your story from real life. Take an idea from current society and move it a little further down the road. Even if human beings are short-term thinkers, fiction can anticipate and extrapolate into multiple versions of the future. Do some research. It may seem paradoxical, but research will strengthen your project, no matter how far you end up straying from historical facts. Conducting research too early in the drafting process can sidetrack or slow down the plot, but it’s critical to keep your reader immersed in and believing the world you’ve created. Getting the details wrong can throw off their belief in your story. Create a set of rules for the world of your novel—and stick to them. Sci-fi is not automatically interesting; it must be made compelling, plausible, and accurate within its own set of rules. Rules add weight to the material or change the stakes for your characters and/or readers. Once you establish a rule, if you break it, you break the illusion of a believable and compelling world. Keep it grounded in reality. Any technological or fantastical element in sci-fi should have roots in what our current species can already do or is on the road to being able to do.</p>

        <p>Science Fiction doesn’t have to be filled with strange aliens, amazing action, and unusual locales. Sometimes the best sci-fi is contemplative, asking the audience to explore themselves and the nature of the universe without even leaving the planet. Contact is one of the best Earth-set, modern sci-fi dramas ever made simply because of the weighty questions it poses and partially answers. Based on a novel by one of the foremost scientific minds of the 20th Century, Carl Sagan, Contact stars Jodie Foster in her most introspective role as a SETI (search for extraterrestrial intelligence) scientist working at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico where she makes what she believes is contact with aliens who provide her a series of coded messages that, when deciphered, form a series of blueprints that will enable her to travel vast distances to meet these strange aliens. Ellie struggles not just to get her machine built, but against a government wanting to remove her from her own discovery and a religious leader (Matthew McConaughey) asking her to question the implications of her decisions. The only person in her corner is a wealthy benefactor (John Hurt) wanting to give her all the opportunities he can.</p>
