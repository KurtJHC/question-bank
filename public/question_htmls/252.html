        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp;Lightning ripped across the night sky and thunderclaps shook the farmhouse windows where&nbsp; Kate Shelley sat watching the summer storm. Kate and her mother were the only people awake at the Shelley home that July night in 1881.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;Nearby, floodwaters of Iowa’s Honey Creek and Des Moines River swirled dangerously beneath the railroad bridges stretching over them. Kate was fifteen. She loved the trains that passed by her house, and she knew their schedules by heart.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;“The Midnight Express might be late tonight,” Kate said to her mother. Old Number 11 was the “pusher” engine that helped trains up the steep curve near Kate’s home. Sometimes it was sent out during storms to see if the tracks were safe before other locomotives were allowed through.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;Kate was right. Number 11 was chugging toward Kate’s home, pushing through the storm to inspect the tracks. The engine slowed near the Honey Creek Bridge, and the section boss held his lantern high to see if the bridge was intact. The track and timbers seemed to be in place. He signalled for the engineer to continue.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;Number 11 rang its bell and lurched forward. Then came the terrible cracking of wooden beams. The weakened bridge collapsed under the engine’s weight.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;Back at their farmhouse, Kate and her mother jumped, startled by the sudden crash. A moment later they heard cries for help and the loud hiss of steam from the engine’s hot boilers, which had plunged into the cold creek water.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;Mrs. Shelley asked Kate to stay inside, but Kate pleaded for a chance to help the downed engine. Together they fixed up an old railroad lantern, filling the oil cup and making a new wick from a piece of flannel. Mrs. Shelley lit the lantern and gave it to Kate, sending her off into the night.</p>
        <p>8<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Traveling a familiar path, Kate followed the cries for help. Past the shattered bridge timbers she spotted two men in the water clinging to large branches. Kate knew she wouldn’t be able to save them alone.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;It was then that she remembered the Midnight Express. It would be carrying hundreds of passengers toward the broken bridge. To find help, Kate would have to cross the long Des Moines River railroad bridge to the nearest station.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;Running hard, she reached the bridge and suddenly slipped and fell on the wet wooden ties. The lantern banged against the wood, broke, and went out.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;The night suddenly became very dark and frightening, but Kate did not stop. Rain and wind lashed her face as she crawled blindly from one slippery tie to the next.&nbsp; &nbsp;Every lightning flash lit up the swirling, muddy water far below. The spaces between the ties were wide — she could easily fall through and be swept away.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;But Kate knew she must not think of that now — she must get across. Lightning flashed, illuminating a large uprooted tree that was barrelling downriver toward her. She froze in fear, imagining that the huge tree would destroy the bridge. But, at the last moment, the mammoth swerved and darted underneath, spraying her with mud and foam.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;Kate clutched the rails and steadied herself, then continued on. Her skirt tore on the railroad spikes. She gritted her teeth and inched along for what seemed like hours.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;Finally Kate felt the mud and cinders of the far bank under her. She scrambled to her feet and ran to the station. Breathless, she stumbled inside. The group of men inside were startled by the sight of the wet, frantic girl who had burst through the door.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;“Stop the Express!” she exclaimed. “Honey Creek Bridge is out!” Then, pale and exhausted, Kate fell to the floor.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;Unknown to Kate, the Midnight Express had already been stopped. But now, with help, Kate revived and told about the two survivors of Engine Number 11 trapped in Honey Creek.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp;An engine’s whistle roused the villagers around the station. Volunteers with shovels and ropes boarded a nearby locomotive. Kate rode along and guided the rescuers down a path to the stranded brakeman and engineer.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp;Because of her heroic efforts, Kate was awarded with a beautiful gold medal, a&nbsp;long gold chain, and a free train pass to last her lifetime. Trains even stopped at her house whenever she wanted to ride.</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp;The old bridge that Kate crossed that stormy night of July 6, 1881, is gone now. Today, the Chicago &amp; North-western trains ride over the Des Moines River on a sturdy iron bridge. It’s called the Kate Shelley Memorial High Bridge, named after the girl who risked her life to save the Midnight Express and the men of Engine Number 11.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp;Lightning ripped across the night sky and thunderclaps shook the farmhouse windows where&nbsp; Kate Shelley sat watching the summer storm. Kate and her mother were the only people awake at the Shelley home that July night in 1881.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;Nearby, floodwaters of Iowa’s Honey Creek and Des Moines River swirled dangerously beneath the railroad bridges stretching over them. Kate was fifteen. She loved the trains that passed by her house, and she knew their schedules by heart.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;“The Midnight Express might be late tonight,” Kate said to her mother. Old Number 11 was the “pusher” engine that helped trains up the steep curve near Kate’s home. Sometimes it was sent out during storms to see if the tracks were safe before other locomotives were allowed through.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;Kate was right. Number 11 was chugging toward Kate’s home, pushing through the storm to inspect the tracks. The engine slowed near the Honey Creek Bridge, and the section boss held his lantern high to see if the bridge was intact. The track and timbers seemed to be in place. He signalled for the engineer to continue.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;Number 11 rang its bell and lurched forward. Then came the terrible cracking of wooden beams. The weakened bridge collapsed under the engine’s weight.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;Back at their farmhouse, Kate and her mother jumped, startled by the sudden crash. A moment later they heard cries for help and the loud hiss of steam from the engine’s hot boilers, which had plunged into the cold creek water.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;Mrs. Shelley asked Kate to stay inside, but Kate pleaded for a chance to help the downed engine. Together they fixed up an old railroad lantern, filling the oil cup and making a new wick from a piece of flannel. Mrs. Shelley lit the lantern and gave it to Kate, sending her off into the night.</p>
        <p>8<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Traveling a familiar path, Kate followed the cries for help. Past the shattered bridge timbers she spotted two men in the water clinging to large branches. Kate knew she wouldn’t be able to save them alone.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;It was then that she remembered the Midnight Express. It would be carrying hundreds of passengers toward the broken bridge. To find help, Kate would have to cross the long Des Moines River railroad bridge to the nearest station.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
                  <img width="100%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dmgrgrhfu/image/upload/v1767442673/vcluui5fy2becbsqdmce.png" alt="OCTT19_P2_25_2">


        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;Running hard, she reached the bridge and suddenly slipped and fell on the wet wooden ties. The lantern banged against the wood, broke, and went out.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;The night suddenly became very dark and frightening, but Kate did not stop. Rain and wind lashed her face as she crawled blindly from one slippery tie to the next.&nbsp; &nbsp;Every lightning flash lit up the swirling, muddy water far below. The spaces between the ties were wide — she could easily fall through and be swept away.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;But Kate knew she must not think of that now — she must get across. Lightning flashed, illuminating a large uprooted tree that was barrelling downriver toward her. She froze in fear, imagining that the huge tree would destroy the bridge. But, at the last moment, the mammoth swerved and darted underneath, spraying her with mud and foam.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;Kate clutched the rails and steadied herself, then continued on. Her skirt tore on the railroad spikes. She gritted her teeth and inched along for what seemed like hours.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;Finally Kate felt the mud and cinders of the far bank under her. She scrambled to her feet and ran to the station. Breathless, she stumbled inside. The group of men inside were startled by the sight of the wet, frantic girl who had burst through the door.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;“Stop the Express!” she exclaimed. “Honey Creek Bridge is out!” Then, pale and exhausted, Kate fell to the floor.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;Unknown to Kate, the Midnight Express had already been stopped. But now, with help, Kate revived and told about the two survivors of Engine Number 11 trapped in Honey Creek.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp;An engine’s whistle roused the villagers around the station. Volunteers with shovels and ropes boarded a nearby locomotive. Kate rode along and guided the rescuers down a path to the stranded brakeman and engineer.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp;Because of her heroic efforts, Kate was awarded with a beautiful gold medal, a&nbsp;long gold chain, and a free train pass to last her lifetime. Trains even stopped at her house whenever she wanted to ride.</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp;The old bridge that Kate crossed that stormy night of July 6, 1881, is gone now. Today, the Chicago &amp; North-western trains ride over the Des Moines River on a sturdy iron bridge. It’s called the Kate Shelley Memorial High Bridge, named after the girl who risked her life to save the Midnight Express and the men of Engine Number 11.</p>

          <strong>The Call of the Wild</strong>
          <br>
          <em>By Jack London</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Buck did not read the newspapers, or he would have known that trouble was brewing, not alone for himself, but for every tidewater dog, strong of muscle and with warm, long hair, from Puget Sound to San Diego. Because men, groping in the Arctic darkness, had found a yellow metal, and because steamship and transportation companies were booming the find, thousands of men were rushing into the Northland. These men wanted dogs, and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs, with strong muscles by which to toil, and furry coats to protect them from the frost.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Buck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley. Judge Miller's place, it was called. It stood back from the road, half-hidden among the trees, through which glimpses could be caught of the wide cool veranda that ran around its four sides. The house was approached by gravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns and under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars. At the rear things were on even a more spacious scale than at the front. There were great stables, where a dozen grooms and boys held forth, rows of vine-clad servants' cottages, an endless and orderly array of outhouses, long grape arbores, green pastures, orchards, and berry patches. Then there was the pumping plant for the artesian well, and the big cement tank where Judge Miler's boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot afternoon.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And over this great demesne<strong> </strong>Buck ruled. Here he was born, and here he had lived the four years of his life. It was true, there were other dogs. There could not but be other dogs on so vast a place, but they did not count. They came and went, resided in the populous kennels, or lived <strong>obscurely </strong>in the recesses of the house after the fashion of Toots, the Japanese pug, or Ysabel, the Mexican hairless, strange creatures that rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground. On the other hand, there were the fox terriers, a score of them at least, who yelped fearful promises at Toots and Ysabel looking out of the windows at them and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with brooms and mops.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But Buck was neither house dog nor kennel dog. The whole realm was his. He plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the Judge's sons; he escorted Mollie and Alice, the Judge's daughters, on long twilight or early morning rambles; on wintry nights he lay at the Judge's feet before the roaring library fire; he carried the Judge's grandsons on his back, or rolled them in the grass, and guarded their footsteps through wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable yard, and even beyond, where the paddocks were, and the berry patches. Among the terriers he stalked imperiously, and Toots and Ysabel he utterly ignored, for he was king-king over all creeping, crawling, flying things of Judge Miller's place, humans included.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>His father, Elmo, a huge St. Bernard, had been the Judge's inseparable companion, and Buck bid fair to follow in the way of his father. He was not so large--he weighed only one hundred and forty pounds--for his mother, She, had been a Scotch shepherd dog. Nevertheless, one hundred and forty pounds, to which was added the dignity that comes of good living and universal respect, enabled him to carry himself in right royal fashion. During the four years since his puppyhood he had lived the life of a <strong>sated </strong>aristocrat; he had a fine pride in himself, was even a trifle egotistical, as country gentlemen sometimes become because of their insular situation. But he had saved himself by not becoming a mere pampered house dog. Hunting and kindred outdoor delights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles; and to him, as to the cold-tubbing races, the love of water had been a tonic and a health preserver.</p>

          <strong>Kids Are Inventors, Too</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Arlene Erlbach</em>
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Do you know what’s unusual about earmuffs? They were invented by a kid!</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Chester Greenwood wanted to keep his ears warm, so he invented earmuffs. They solved a problem for him. That’s what inventions are supposed to do. Chester’s invention made life easier for millions of other people.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Anyone Can Invent</strong><br>
3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;You may already be an inventor, too, without even knowing it. You’re an inventor every time you find a way of doing something.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Have you ever made up new rules for a game? Or maybe you’ve wiped your mouth on your sleeve when you couldn’t find a napkin. Your parents may not have been thrilled when they saw you do that, but you solved a problem for yourself.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Inventions are discoveries. An invention might be a new item, like the Koosh® Ball or Slinky® were when they first appeared in stores, years ago. Or an invention may improve something that already exists.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Think about your TV. You probably see colour pictures on the screen. But the first TV sets showed only black-and-white pictures. The person who invented colour television improved something that people were already using.</p>
        <p><br><strong>Chester’s Invention</strong><br>
7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Let’s go back to earmuffs. They were invented in 1873, when Chester Greenwood was only 15 years old.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Chester lived in Farmington, Maine, and he loved to ice skate. Anyone familiar with northeastern winters knows how hard they can be on your ears — even when you wear a hat. So Chester took a piece of wire and asked his grandmother to sew cloth pads on the ends.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At first Chester’s friends thought his earmuffs looked weird, but they soon changed their minds. Chester could stay outside and skate longer than they did. His ears didn’t get cold!</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Soon Chester’s friends wanted earmuffs, too. So he started making earmuffs and selling them. He also applied for a patent. A patent is a document issued by the U.S. government. It protects an inventor’s idea so nobody else can make money from it.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Chester began manufacturing earmuffs and eventually became rich. He became famous, too. Farmington, Maine, celebrates Chester Greenwood Day each December.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lots of kids — about 500,000 each year — invent things. Most kids don’t sell their inventions or become rich. But they do have fun creating things and seeing them work.</p>

          <strong>Kids Are Inventors, Too</strong>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Do you know what’s unusual about earmuffs? They were invented by a kid!</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Chester Greenwood wanted to keep his ears warm, so he invented earmuffs. They solved a problem for him. That’s what inventions are supposed to do. Chester’s invention made life easier for millions of other people.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Anyone Can Invent</strong><br>
3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;You may already be an inventor, too, without even knowing it. You’re an inventor every time you find a way of doing something.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Have you ever made up new rules for a game? Or maybe you’ve wiped your mouth on your sleeve when you couldn’t find a napkin. Your parents may not have been thrilled when they saw you do that, but you solved a problem for yourself.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Inventions are discoveries. An invention might be a new item, like the Koosh® Ball or Slinky® were when they first appeared in stores, years ago. Or an invention may improve something that already exists.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Think about your TV. You probably see colour pictures on the screen. But the first TV sets showed only black-and-white pictures. The person who invented colour television improved something that people were already using.</p>
        <p><br><strong>Chester’s Invention</strong><br>
7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Let’s go back to earmuffs. They were invented in 1873, when Chester Greenwood was only 15 years old.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Chester lived in Farmington, Maine, and he loved to ice skate. Anyone familiar with northeastern winters knows how hard they can be on your ears — even when you wear a hat. So Chester took a piece of wire and asked his grandmother to sew cloth pads on the ends.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At first Chester’s friends thought his earmuffs looked weird, but they soon changed their minds. Chester could stay outside and skate longer than they did. His ears didn’t get cold!</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Soon Chester’s friends wanted earmuffs, too. So he started making earmuffs and selling them. He also applied for a patent. A patent is a document issued by the U.S. government. It protects an inventor’s idea so nobody else can make money from it.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Chester began manufacturing earmuffs and eventually became rich. He became famous, too. Farmington, Maine, celebrates Chester Greenwood Day each December.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lots of kids — about 500,000 each year — invent things. Most kids don’t sell their inventions or become rich. But they do have fun creating things and seeing them work.</p>

          <strong>Kids Are Inventors, Too</strong>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Do you know what’s unusual about earmuffs? They were invented by a kid!</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Chester Greenwood wanted to keep his ears warm, so he invented earmuffs. They solved a problem for him. That’s what inventions are supposed to do. Chester’s invention made life easier for millions of other people.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Anyone Can Invent</strong><br>
3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;You may already be an inventor, too, without even knowing it. You’re an inventor every time you find a way of doing something.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Have you ever made up new rules for a game? Or maybe you’ve wiped your mouth on your sleeve when you couldn’t find a napkin. Your parents may not have been thrilled when they saw you do that, but you solved a problem for yourself.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Inventions are discoveries. An invention might be a new item, like the Koosh® Ball or Slinky® were when they first appeared in stores, years ago. Or an invention may improve something that already exists.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Think about your TV. You probably see colour pictures on the screen. But the first TV sets showed only black-and-white pictures. The person who invented colour television improved something that people were already using.</p>
        <p><br><strong>Chester’s Invention</strong><br>
7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Let’s go back to earmuffs. They were invented in 1873, when Chester Greenwood was only 15 years old.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Chester lived in Farmington, Maine, and he loved to ice skate. Anyone familiar with northeastern winters knows how hard they can be on your ears — even when you wear a hat. So Chester took a piece of wire and asked his grandmother to sew cloth pads on the ends.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At first Chester’s friends thought his earmuffs looked weird, but they soon changed their minds. Chester could stay outside and skate longer than they did. His ears didn’t get cold!</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Soon Chester’s friends wanted earmuffs, too. So he started making earmuffs and selling them. He also applied for a patent. A patent is a document issued by the U.S. government. It protects an inventor’s idea so nobody else can make money from it.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Chester began manufacturing earmuffs and eventually became rich. He became famous, too. Farmington, Maine, celebrates Chester Greenwood Day each December.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lots of kids — about 500,000 each year — invent things. Most kids don’t sell their inventions or become rich. But they do have fun creating things and seeing them work.</p>
