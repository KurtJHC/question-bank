<strong>What makes Coca-Cola the world’s most recognisable brand?</strong><br>
<br>
“Thirsty consumers around the globe now enjoy Coca-Cola Company products 1.7 billion times every single day, with about 19,400 beverages every second.” Coca-Cola’s history began in 1886 when Atlanta pharmacist, Dr. John S. Pemberton, created a distinctive tasting soft drink that could be sold at soda fountains. <strong>15</strong> ………. Dr. Pemberton’s partner and bookkeeper, Frank M. Robinson, is credited with naming the beverage “Coca-Cola”.<br>
<br>
Coca-Cola is a beverage that people enjoy most of all, but is not the only thing that made Coca-Cola the world’s most valuable company. Coca-Cola used unique marketing strategies to achieve its goals. Let’s become familiar with Coca-Cola’s most important marketing strategies. The first is its logo. From 1886 till now Coca-Cola changed its logo almost 10 times. Frank Mason Robinson then decided that Coca-Cola’s logo should be written in the Spencerian script to differentiate it from its competitors. <strong>16</strong> ………. Frank M. Robinson also suggested the name “Coca-Cola”, thinking that “the two Cs would look well in advertising”. The Coca-Cola logo is recognised internationally. The white swirl of the logo stimulates passion and zeal of the youth today. The colours used in the Coca-Cola logo are red and white, both are pulsating and simple in design, which makes the logo appealing in the eyes of youngsters. The font of the logo is printed in white, with a vibrant red background.<br>
<br>
The second strategy is its unique bottle. Coca-Cola’s history has revolved a lot around the bottle – more than 115 years’ worth, in fact. The Coca-Cola bottle remains unique in its design. It was created in 1915, by Earl R. Dean; the Coca-Cola bottle was first introduced as a ‘contour bottle’ or ‘hobble-skirt’ bottle, wide from the center and slender from below. By 1915, CEO, Candler was losing market share to hundreds of competitors. He launched a national contest for a new bottle design that would signal to consumers that Coke was a premium product. The Root Glass Company in Indiana decided to enter the contest and base its design off the product’s name. The cocoa pod has a strange but appealing shape. They were declared the contest winners the next year. Coca-Cola commissioned the bottle design as a piece of defensive marketing, but began promoting the shape as much as the logo and product. <strong>17</strong> ……….<br>
<br>
The third strategy is that Coke sells “happiness” in a bottle. Coke doesn’t sell a drink in a bottle, it sells “happiness” in a bottle. <strong>18</strong> ………. A lot of companies focus on the products themselves, but Coke aims to sell consumers the experience and lifestyle associated with its brand. For example, in 2009, the “Open Happiness” campaign was unveiled globally. The central message of “Open Happiness” is an invitation to billions around the world to pause, refresh with a Coca-Cola, and continue to enjoy one of life’s simple pleasures. The&nbsp;“Open Happiness” message was seen in stores, on billboards, in TV spots and printed advertising along with digital mediums.<br>
<br>
Another strategy is Coca-Cola’s slogans. Since Coca-Cola was born in 1886, it has been using various advertising campaign slogans. The first official advertising slogan said that Coke was “Delicious! Refreshing! Exhilarating! Invigorating!” The 1980s featured such memorable slogans as “Coke is It!”, “Catch the Wave” and “Can’t Beat the Feeling”. In 1993, Coca-Cola experimented with computer animation, and the popular “Always Coca-Cola” campaign was launched in a series of ads featuring animated polar bears. Later it used one global creative campaign: “Taste the Feeling.” “Taste the Feeling” will bring to life the idea that drinking a Coca-Cola – any Coca-Cola – is a simple pleasure that makes everyday moments more special. <strong>19</strong> ……….<br>
<br>
Then there is Coca-Cola’s pricing strategy. It’s common today for tech start-ups to begin by offering a service for free and then charging a higher price to consumers and/or advertisers once they’ve become hooked. Coca-Cola used a similar approach to scale across the US and then throughout the world. <strong>20</strong> ………. The Coca-Cola products prices are set around the same level as its competitors, so Coca-Cola has to be perceived as different but still affordable.</p>

<br>
<br>
<strong>What makes Coca-Cola the world’s most recognisable brand?</strong><br>
<br>
“Thirsty consumers around the globe now enjoy Coca-Cola Company products 1.7 billion times every single day, with about 19,400 beverages every second.” Coca-Cola’s history began in 1886 when Atlanta pharmacist, Dr. John S. Pemberton, created a distinctive tasting soft drink that could be sold at soda fountains. <strong>15</strong> ………. Dr. Pemberton’s partner and bookkeeper, Frank M. Robinson, is credited with naming the beverage “Coca-Cola”.<br>
<br>
Coca-Cola is a beverage that people enjoy most of all, but is not the only thing that made Coca-Cola the world’s most valuable company. Coca-Cola used unique marketing strategies to achieve its goals. Let’s become familiar with Coca-Cola’s most important marketing strategies. The first is its logo. From 1886 till now Coca-Cola changed its logo almost 10 times. Frank Mason Robinson then decided that Coca-Cola’s logo should be written in the Spencerian script to differentiate it from its competitors. <strong>16</strong> ………. Frank M. Robinson also suggested the name “Coca-Cola”, thinking that “the two Cs would look well in advertising”. The Coca-Cola logo is recognised internationally. The white swirl of the logo stimulates passion and zeal of the youth today. The colours used in the Coca-Cola logo are red and white, both are pulsating and simple in design, which makes the logo appealing in the eyes of youngsters. The font of the logo is printed in white, with a vibrant red background.<br>
<br>
The second strategy is its unique bottle. Coca-Cola’s history has revolved a lot around the bottle – more than 115 years’ worth, in fact. The Coca-Cola bottle remains unique in its design. It was created in 1915, by Earl R. Dean; the Coca-Cola bottle was first introduced as a ‘contour bottle’ or ‘hobble-skirt’ bottle, wide from the center and slender from below. By 1915, CEO, Candler was losing market share to hundreds of competitors. He launched a national contest for a new bottle design that would signal to consumers that Coke was a premium product. The Root Glass Company in Indiana decided to enter the contest and base its design off the product’s name. The cocoa pod has a strange but appealing shape. They were declared the contest winners the next year. Coca-Cola commissioned the bottle design as a piece of defensive marketing, but began promoting the shape as much as the logo and product. <strong>17</strong> ……….<br>
<br>
The third strategy is that Coke sells “happiness” in a bottle. Coke doesn’t sell a drink in a bottle, it sells “happiness” in a bottle. <strong>18</strong> ………. A lot of companies focus on the products themselves, but Coke aims to sell consumers the experience and lifestyle associated with its brand. For example, in 2009, the “Open Happiness” campaign was unveiled globally. The central message of “Open Happiness” is an invitation to billions around the world to pause, refresh with a Coca-Cola, and continue to enjoy one of life’s simple pleasures. The&nbsp;“Open Happiness” message was seen in stores, on billboards, in TV spots and printed advertising along with digital mediums.<br>
<br>
Another strategy is Coca-Cola’s slogans. Since Coca-Cola was born in 1886, it has been using various advertising campaign slogans. The first official advertising slogan said that Coke was “Delicious! Refreshing! Exhilarating! Invigorating!” The 1980s featured such memorable slogans as “Coke is It!”, “Catch the Wave” and “Can’t Beat the Feeling”. In 1993, Coca-Cola experimented with computer animation, and the popular “Always Coca-Cola” campaign was launched in a series of ads featuring animated polar bears. Later it used one global creative campaign: “Taste the Feeling.” “Taste the Feeling” will bring to life the idea that drinking a Coca-Cola – any Coca-Cola – is a simple pleasure that makes everyday moments more special. <strong>19</strong> ……….<br>
<br>
Then there is Coca-Cola’s pricing strategy. It’s common today for tech start-ups to begin by offering a service for free and then charging a higher price to consumers and/or advertisers once they’ve become hooked. Coca-Cola used a similar approach to scale across the US and then throughout the world. <strong>20</strong> ………. The Coca-Cola products prices are set around the same level as its competitors, so Coca-Cola has to be perceived as different but still affordable.</p>

Six sentences have been removed from the text. Choose from the sentences (<strong>A – G</strong>) the one which fits each gap (<strong>15 – 20</strong>). There is one extra sentence which you do not need to use.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>What makes Coca-Cola the world’s most recognisable brand?</strong><br>
<br>
“Thirsty consumers around the globe now enjoy Coca-Cola Company products 1.7 billion times every single day, with about 19,400 beverages every second.” Coca-Cola’s history began in 1886 when Atlanta pharmacist, Dr. John S. Pemberton, created a distinctive tasting soft drink that could be sold at soda fountains. <strong>15</strong> ………. Dr. Pemberton’s partner and bookkeeper, Frank M. Robinson, is credited with naming the beverage “Coca-Cola”.<br>
<br>
Coca-Cola is a beverage that people enjoy most of all, but is not the only thing that made Coca-Cola the world’s most valuable company. Coca-Cola used unique marketing strategies to achieve its goals. Let’s become familiar with Coca-Cola’s most important marketing strategies. The first is its logo. From 1886 till now Coca-Cola changed its logo almost 10 times. Frank Mason Robinson then decided that Coca-Cola’s logo should be written in the Spencerian script to differentiate it from its competitors. <strong>16</strong> ………. Frank M. Robinson also suggested the name “Coca-Cola”, thinking that “the two Cs would look well in advertising”. The Coca-Cola logo is recognised internationally. The white swirl of the logo stimulates passion and zeal of the youth today. The colours used in the Coca-Cola logo are red and white, both are pulsating and simple in design, which makes the logo appealing in the eyes of youngsters. The font of the logo is printed in white, with a vibrant red background.<br>
<br>
The second strategy is its unique bottle. Coca-Cola’s history has revolved a lot around the bottle – more than 115 years’ worth, in fact. The Coca-Cola bottle remains unique in its design. It was created in 1915, by Earl R. Dean; the Coca-Cola bottle was first introduced as a ‘contour bottle’ or ‘hobble-skirt’ bottle, wide from the center and slender from below. By 1915, CEO, Candler was losing market share to hundreds of competitors. He launched a national contest for a new bottle design that would signal to consumers that Coke was a premium product. The Root Glass Company in Indiana decided to enter the contest and base its design off the product’s name. The cocoa pod has a strange but appealing shape. They were declared the contest winners the next year. Coca-Cola commissioned the bottle design as a piece of defensive marketing, but began promoting the shape as much as the logo and product. <strong>17</strong> ……….<br>
<br>
The third strategy is that Coke sells “happiness” in a bottle. Coke doesn’t sell a drink in a bottle, it sells “happiness” in a bottle. <strong>18</strong> ………. A lot of companies focus on the products themselves, but Coke aims to sell consumers the experience and lifestyle associated with its brand. For example, in 2009, the “Open Happiness” campaign was unveiled globally. The central message of “Open Happiness” is an invitation to billions around the world to pause, refresh with a Coca-Cola, and continue to enjoy one of life’s simple pleasures. The&nbsp;“Open Happiness” message was seen in stores, on billboards, in TV spots and printed advertising along with digital mediums.<br>
<br>
Another strategy is Coca-Cola’s slogans. Since Coca-Cola was born in 1886, it has been using various advertising campaign slogans. The first official advertising slogan said that Coke was “Delicious! Refreshing! Exhilarating! Invigorating!” The 1980s featured such memorable slogans as “Coke is It!”, “Catch the Wave” and “Can’t Beat the Feeling”. In 1993, Coca-Cola experimented with computer animation, and the popular “Always Coca-Cola” campaign was launched in a series of ads featuring animated polar bears. Later it used one global creative campaign: “Taste the Feeling.” “Taste the Feeling” will bring to life the idea that drinking a Coca-Cola – any Coca-Cola – is a simple pleasure that makes everyday moments more special. <strong>19</strong> ……….<br>
<br>
Then there is Coca-Cola’s pricing strategy. It’s common today for tech start-ups to begin by offering a service for free and then charging a higher price to consumers and/or advertisers once they’ve become hooked. Coca-Cola used a similar approach to scale across the US and then throughout the world. <strong>20</strong> ………. The Coca-Cola products prices are set around the same level as its competitors, so Coca-Cola has to be perceived as different but still affordable.</p>

<br>
<br>
<strong>What makes Coca-Cola the world’s most recognisable brand?</strong><br>
<br>
“Thirsty consumers around the globe now enjoy Coca-Cola Company products 1.7 billion times every single day, with about 19,400 beverages every second.” Coca-Cola’s history began in 1886 when Atlanta pharmacist, Dr. John S. Pemberton, created a distinctive tasting soft drink that could be sold at soda fountains. <strong>15</strong> ………. Dr. Pemberton’s partner and bookkeeper, Frank M. Robinson, is credited with naming the beverage “Coca-Cola”.<br>
<br>
Coca-Cola is a beverage that people enjoy most of all, but is not the only thing that made Coca-Cola the world’s most valuable company. Coca-Cola used unique marketing strategies to achieve its goals. Let’s become familiar with Coca-Cola’s most important marketing strategies. The first is its logo. From 1886 till now Coca-Cola changed its logo almost 10 times. Frank Mason Robinson then decided that Coca-Cola’s logo should be written in the Spencerian script to differentiate it from its competitors. <strong>16</strong> ………. Frank M. Robinson also suggested the name “Coca-Cola”, thinking that “the two Cs would look well in advertising”. The Coca-Cola logo is recognised internationally. The white swirl of the logo stimulates passion and zeal of the youth today. The colours used in the Coca-Cola logo are red and white, both are pulsating and simple in design, which makes the logo appealing in the eyes of youngsters. The font of the logo is printed in white, with a vibrant red background.<br>
<br>
The second strategy is its unique bottle. Coca-Cola’s history has revolved a lot around the bottle – more than 115 years’ worth, in fact. The Coca-Cola bottle remains unique in its design. It was created in 1915, by Earl R. Dean; the Coca-Cola bottle was first introduced as a ‘contour bottle’ or ‘hobble-skirt’ bottle, wide from the center and slender from below. By 1915, CEO, Candler was losing market share to hundreds of competitors. He launched a national contest for a new bottle design that would signal to consumers that Coke was a premium product. The Root Glass Company in Indiana decided to enter the contest and base its design off the product’s name. The cocoa pod has a strange but appealing shape. They were declared the contest winners the next year. Coca-Cola commissioned the bottle design as a piece of defensive marketing, but began promoting the shape as much as the logo and product. <strong>17</strong> ……….<br>
<br>
The third strategy is that Coke sells “happiness” in a bottle. Coke doesn’t sell a drink in a bottle, it sells “happiness” in a bottle. <strong>18</strong> ………. A lot of companies focus on the products themselves, but Coke aims to sell consumers the experience and lifestyle associated with its brand. For example, in 2009, the “Open Happiness” campaign was unveiled globally. The central message of “Open Happiness” is an invitation to billions around the world to pause, refresh with a Coca-Cola, and continue to enjoy one of life’s simple pleasures. The&nbsp;“Open Happiness” message was seen in stores, on billboards, in TV spots and printed advertising along with digital mediums.<br>
<br>
Another strategy is Coca-Cola’s slogans. Since Coca-Cola was born in 1886, it has been using various advertising campaign slogans. The first official advertising slogan said that Coke was “Delicious! Refreshing! Exhilarating! Invigorating!” The 1980s featured such memorable slogans as “Coke is It!”, “Catch the Wave” and “Can’t Beat the Feeling”. In 1993, Coca-Cola experimented with computer animation, and the popular “Always Coca-Cola” campaign was launched in a series of ads featuring animated polar bears. Later it used one global creative campaign: “Taste the Feeling.” “Taste the Feeling” will bring to life the idea that drinking a Coca-Cola – any Coca-Cola – is a simple pleasure that makes everyday moments more special. <strong>19</strong> ……….<br>

Then there is Coca-Cola’s pricing strategy. It’s common today for tech start-ups to begin by offering a service for free and then charging a higher price to consumers and/or advertisers once they’ve become hooked. Coca-Cola used a similar approach to scale across the US and then throughout the world. <strong>20</strong> ………. The Coca-Cola products prices are set around the same level as its competitors, so Coca-Cola has to be perceived as different but still affordable.</p>

With new video game consoles out, Microsoft and Sony are decades-long incumbents in the industry. But that wasn't always the case. More than 25 years ago, Sony unleashed its first PlayStation, barging into a marketplace dominated by Nintendo and, to a lesser extent, Sega. Seven years later, Microsoft brought forth its Xbox. Whether you are voting with your wallet this holiday season for a new Xbox Series X or S, or PlayStation 5, you must agree that these two tech giants have made countless contributions to advance video gaming over the years.<br>
<br>
Sony and Microsoft also expanded the audience. The PlayStation was released in the U.S. in September 1995, and would sell more than 102 million units, blasting past sales figures for previous video game consoles that connected to TVs. Nintendo continued to dominate in portable game systems, but it would be a decade until one of its consoles cracked the&nbsp;100 million sales mark: The Wii, released in November 2006, would go on to sell 101.6 million consoles.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Sony solidified its position with the PlayStation 2, a console that remains the biggest top-seller ever at more than 155 million systems sold. In comparison, the PlayStation 4 has sold more than 113.5 million since its arrival seven years ago. As the latest consoles arrive in homes, Microsoft is gaining on Sony for dominance. And the tech titans are building out cloud-based game services – as are competitors Google, Amazon and Facebook.<br>

As we watch our children and teens use screens more often to play video games during the COVID-19 pandemic, many parents wonder: How much is too much? People are spending a lot more time staring at digital screens. But after your kids log off from school and homework for the day, is it okay if they spend a few hours gaming with their friends? When video game lives replace real-life time with family and friends, is it a sign of addiction? There is growing research on the effects of video games on children.<br>
<br>
Too much video gaming can lead to poor social skills, time away from family, schoolwork and other hobbies, lower grades, reading less, exercising less, becoming overweight, and having aggressive thoughts and behaviours. Children play video games at the expense of homework, sleep, exercise or relationships with family and friends. Children may end up having depression, anxiety, shyness, aggression, and problems with too much cell phone use. Children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) may be particularly vulnerable.<br>

Which are the most popular video games at present? Let’s take a look. In third place is Wow. Who would have thought that World of Warcraft would make the list? This is another genre-defining game. Unfathomable amounts of total in-game hours, millions of subscribers, and never enough loot. This MMORPG has really made a name for itself, and that name is Popular. In CounterStrike, Counter-Terrorists win the 2nd place price in the popularity contest! We had to put a real old school, original gangster game up here near the peak of video game popularity. In its age and its continued popularity, it’s earned this spot. We heard the Xbox version was getting remastered for Xbox One (just kidding, don’t believe us, we aren’t telling the truth). But top of the popularity pile is Minecraft. Companies are building office buildings inside Minecraft on private servers! And they actually use the building to meet with clients and discuss business! That doesn’t happen if you’re an unpopular game. Minecraft exploded onto the scene and has continued to snowball ever since. It’s everywhere. Adults are playing it, tiny baby kids are playing it, and we’ll get in there and carve out the occasional secret hobbit hole. It’s so charming and fun, and it’s comfortable in any social setting or social circle. Yeah, Minecraft is the king of the school this time around.<br>

Should a video game be enjoyable from the beginning? My answer is a resounding yes. Similar to books and movies, you need to open strong and finish stronger. Super Mario 3D Land, for example, is great from beginning to end. On the console side, the same can be said of Mass Effect 2. The best game designers are not only aware of this, but know how to execute. The rest stumble around hoping to have epiphanies of their own. In most cases, I give a video game a good 30 minutes to grab my attention, and for smart phone games, it's considerably less, more like five to ten minutes. After that, my eyes start to glaze over, I begin fumbling around and there may even be a yawn or two.<br>

Children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) may be particularly vulnerable.<br>

Which are the most popular video games at present? Let’s take a look. In third place is Wow. Who would have thought that World of Warcraft would make the list? This is another genre-defining game. Unfathomable amounts of total in-game hours, millions of subscribers, and never enough loot. This MMORPG has really made a name for itself, and that name is Popular. In CounterStrike, Counter-Terrorists win the 2nd place price in the popularity contest! We had to put a real old school, original gangster game up here near the peak of video game popularity. In its age and its continued popularity, it’s earned this spot. We heard the Xbox version was getting remastered for Xbox One (just kidding, don’t believe us, we aren’t telling the truth). But top of the popularity pile is Minecraft. Companies are building office buildings inside Minecraft on private servers! And they actually use the building to meet with clients and discuss business! That doesn’t happen if you’re an unpopular game. Minecraft exploded onto the scene and has continued to snowball ever since. It’s everywhere. Adults are playing it, tiny baby kids are playing it, and we’ll get in there and carve out the occasional secret hobbit hole. It’s so charming and fun, and it’s comfortable in any social setting or social circle. Yeah, Minecraft is the king of the school this time around.<br>

Should a video game be enjoyable from the beginning? My answer is a resounding yes. Similar to books and movies, you need to open strong and finish stronger. Super Mario 3D Land, for example, is great from beginning to end. On the console side, the same can be said of Mass Effect 2. The best game designers are not only aware of this, but know how to execute. The rest stumble around hoping to have epiphanies of their own. In most cases, I give a video game a good 30 minutes to grab my attention, and for smart phone games, it's considerably less, more like five to ten minutes. After that, my eyes start to glaze over, I begin fumbling around and there may even be a yawn or two.<br>

With new video game consoles out, Microsoft and Sony are decades-long incumbents in the industry. But that wasn't always the case. More than 25 years ago, Sony unleashed its first PlayStation, barging into a marketplace dominated by Nintendo and, to a lesser extent, Sega. Seven years later, Microsoft brought forth its Xbox. Whether you are voting with your wallet this holiday season for a new Xbox Series X or S, or PlayStation 5, you must agree that these two tech giants have made countless contributions to advance video gaming over the years.<br>
<br>
Sony and Microsoft also expanded the audience. The PlayStation was released in the U.S. in September 1995, and would sell more than 102 million units, blasting past sales figures for previous video game consoles that connected to TVs. Nintendo continued to dominate in portable game systems, but it would be a decade until one of its consoles cracked the&nbsp;100 million sales mark: The Wii, released in November 2006, would go on to sell 101.6 million consoles.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Sony solidified its position with the PlayStation 2, a console that remains the biggest top-seller ever at more than 155 million systems sold. In comparison, the PlayStation 4 has sold more than 113.5 million since its arrival seven years ago. As the latest consoles arrive in homes, Microsoft is gaining on Sony for dominance. And the tech titans are building out cloud-based game services – as are competitors Google, Amazon and Facebook.<br>

As we watch our children and teens use screens more often to play video games during the COVID-19 pandemic, many parents wonder: How much is too much? People are spending a lot more time staring at digital screens. But after your kids log off from school and homework for the day, is it okay if they spend a few hours gaming with their friends? When video game lives replace real-life time with family and friends, is it a sign of addiction? There is growing research on the effects of video games on children.<br>
<br>
Too much video gaming can lead to poor social skills, time away from family, schoolwork and other hobbies, lower grades, reading less, exercising less, becoming overweight, and having aggressive thoughts and behaviours. Children play video games at the expense of homework, sleep, exercise or relationships with family and friends. Children may end up having depression, anxiety, shyness, aggression, and problems with too much cell phone use. Children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) may be particularly vulnerable.<br>

With new video game consoles out, Microsoft and Sony are decades-long incumbents in the industry. But that wasn't always the case. More than 25 years ago, Sony unleashed its first PlayStation, barging into a marketplace dominated by Nintendo and, to a lesser extent, Sega. Seven years later, Microsoft brought forth its Xbox. Whether you are voting with your wallet this holiday season for a new Xbox Series X or S, or PlayStation 5, you must agree that these two tech giants have made countless contributions to advance video gaming over the years.<br>
<br>
Sony and Microsoft also expanded the audience. The PlayStation was released in the U.S. in September 1995, and would sell more than 102 million units, blasting past sales figures for previous video game consoles that connected to TVs. Nintendo continued to dominate in portable game systems, but it would be a decade until one of its consoles cracked the&nbsp;100 million sales mark: The Wii, released in November 2006, would go on to sell 101.6 million consoles.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Sony solidified its position with the PlayStation 2, a console that remains the biggest top-seller ever at more than 155 million systems sold. In comparison, the PlayStation 4 has sold more than 113.5 million since its arrival seven years ago. As the latest consoles arrive in homes, Microsoft is gaining on Sony for dominance. And the tech titans are building out cloud-based game services – as are competitors Google, Amazon and Facebook.<br>

As we watch our children and teens use screens more often to play video games during the COVID-19 pandemic, many parents wonder: How much is too much? People are spending a lot more time staring at digital screens. But after your kids log off from school and homework for the day, is it okay if they spend a few hours gaming with their friends? When video game lives replace real-life time with family and friends, is it a sign of addiction? There is growing research on the effects of video games on children.<br>
<br>
Too much video gaming can lead to poor social skills, time away from family, schoolwork and other hobbies, lower grades, reading less, exercising less, becoming overweight, and having aggressive thoughts and behaviours. Children play video games at the expense of homework, sleep, exercise or relationships with family and friends. Children may end up having depression, anxiety, shyness, aggression, and problems with too much cell phone use. Children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) may be particularly vulnerable.<br>

Which are the most popular video games at present? Let’s take a look. In third place is Wow. Who would have thought that World of Warcraft would make the list? This is another genre-defining game. Unfathomable amounts of total in-game hours, millions of subscribers, and never enough loot. This MMORPG has really made a name for itself, and that name is Popular. In CounterStrike, Counter-Terrorists win the 2nd place price in the popularity contest! We had to put a real old school, original gangster game up here near the peak of video game popularity. In its age and its continued popularity, it’s earned this spot. We heard the Xbox version was getting remastered for Xbox One (just kidding, don’t believe us, we aren’t telling the truth). But top of the popularity pile is Minecraft. Companies are building office buildings inside Minecraft on private servers! And they actually use the building to meet with clients and discuss business! That doesn’t happen if you’re an unpopular game. Minecraft exploded onto the scene and has continued to snowball ever since. It’s everywhere. Adults are playing it, tiny baby kids are playing it, and we’ll get in there and carve out the occasional secret hobbit hole. It’s so charming and fun, and it’s comfortable in any social setting or social circle. Yeah, Minecraft is the king of the school this time around.<br>

Should a video game be enjoyable from the beginning? My answer is a resounding yes. Similar to books and movies, you need to open strong and finish stronger. Super Mario 3D Land, for example, is great from beginning to end. On the console side, the same can be said of Mass Effect 2. The best game designers are not only aware of this, but know how to execute. The rest stumble around hoping to have epiphanies of their own. In most cases, I give a video game a good 30 minutes to grab my attention, and for smart phone games, it's considerably less, more like five to ten minutes. After that, my eyes start to glaze over, I begin fumbling around and there may even be a yawn or two.<br>
