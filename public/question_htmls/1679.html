Facemasks could see magpies swoop more Canberrans than ever before this spring breeding season, an expert warns. While facemasks help prevent the spread of COVID- 19, an unintended side-effect is they may provoke more magpies to swoop you. The iconic birds recognise people by their facial features and if our faces are obscured, they can’t tell friend from foe.<br>
<br>
Griffith University magpie expert Emeritus Professor Darryl Jones says we’d all become targets. “Because they can’t distinguish between who they think is a real problem they start to think, ‘it’s one of these people hiding behind a mask, okay I’ll hit the lot of them,” he said.<br>
<br>
Being the ‘Bush Capital ’only makes the swooping situation worse. “The density of magpies in Canberra is higher than anywhere else [in Australia], it follows that more magpies means more attacks.” “Canberra congratulations, you are the swooping capital of Australia.”<br>

After seven months in the Spinal Unit at Sydney’s&nbsp; Royal North Shore Hospital and rehabilitation at Royal Rehab in Ryde, Sam was back home when her son Noah came in one afternoon with a battered magpie chick in his arms. The bird was badly hurt after falling from a tree in a violent coastal storm.<br>
“I’ll never forget her wobbly head, the funny angle of her damaged wing or feeling her tiny heart beating against the palm of my hand,” says Sam. The boys named the magpie Penguin.<br>
“Here was a broken, fragile creature that needed our help and, in that instant, I stopped thinking about myself.”<br>
“Initially Penguin had to be fed every two hours,” says Sam. “Some evenings, as we tucked her into bed, we wondered if she would survive the night.”<br>
Penguin couldn’t fly. But, even with her damaged wing she’d launch herself endlessly from the furniture, trying to do what instinct told her to do.<br>
Sam’s eyes sparkle all the time so it’s difficult to know if she’s tearing up when she says “The day Penguin made her maiden flight in our living room, my heart soared. Shortly after that she flew outside and took to the wild skies – it was the happiest I’d felt in a long time.”<br>

Australian Magpies (Cracticus tibicen) are very widespread and live in suburbs across Australia where there are trees and adjacent open areas such as lawns, golf courses and playing fields. For most of the year, Magpies are friendly and sociable, and may even venture into your house to beg for food. But for four to six weeks a year during August to September, the male Magpie will defend his home vigorously. For the rest of the year, people are completely safe from swooping Magpies!<br>
<br>
Most Magpies don’t swoop people. Females don’t swoop at all because they are busy sitting on the eggs, and only 12% of male Magpies are aggressive. These few males only swoop for six weeks while their chicks are in the nest. Understandably, these dads are just being protective of their babies.<br>
<br>
Male Magpies swoop people because they are protecting their chicks, but also because the person walking or riding by reminds the bird of someone who disturbed them in the past. Magpies have very long memories.<br>
<br>

<strong>The Collingwood Magpies have started their season 0-2, with a 17-goal loss at home to West Coast Fever on Sunday afternoon.</strong><br>
West Coast Fever have kept their unbeaten Super Netball record intact, riding a blistering start to a convincing 70-53 victory over Collingwood at John Cain Arena. Jhaniele Fowler (58 goals) was again a powerhouse in the shooting circle, Verity Simmons was at her sizzling best in the middle and captain Courtney Bruce shrugged off an ankle concern to dominate in defence. "That game really tested us," said Bruce, celebrating her milestone 100th match in style on "We weren't having a great start in every quarter and in that last quarter we came out firing.” "Little things to work on but happy with that."<br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Fever were sluggish out of the blocks, trailing 7-4 early as the Magpies came out flying, before the Fever blew the contest apart with a 12-0 run either side of the quarter- time break amid an overall 16-2 blitz to leave the Magpies reeling. Despite Collingwood becoming turnover and penalty-riddled, wing attack Kelsey Browne offered plenty of resistance with 20 goal assists to her name.<br>
