On December 5, 1945, five Navy planes took off from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, USA, on a training mission. They flew over the Bermuda Triangle. The men, along with the planes, disappeared and were never seen again. From that day forward, people became fascinated with the Bermuda Triangle. Over the years, numerous ships and aircraft have vanished with no apparent explanation.&nbsp;<br>
Are you wondering what the Bermuda Triangle is all about? Can humans ever survive a trip to the Bermuda Triangle? There are many theories that try to explain the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle.&nbsp;<br>
The Bermuda Triangle is an area in the Atlantic Ocean that is twice the size of Texas. That's about 500,000 square miles. The Bermuda Triangle has a triangular shape with ends — geometry teachers would call them vertices — in Miami, Florida, Bermuda and Puerto Rico. Within this triangle of water, compasses often act strangely. Most compasses don't point directly north toward the North Pole. Instead, they point to something called “magnetic north", which is in Canada. In the Bermuda Triangle, however, a compass will often point directly to the North Pole. That's mysterious! There are many more mysterious incidents and unexplained disappearances besides these tragic stories. So far, scientists have not come up with clear reasons to explain the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle.<br>

Why do oceans and seas matter? We live on a blue planet, with oceans and seas covering more than 70 per cent of the Earth’s surface. Oceans feed us, regulate our climate and generate most of the oxygen we breathe. They also serve as the foundation for much of the world’s economy, supporting sectors from tourism to fisheries to international shipping.<br>
But despite their importance, oceans are facing unprecedented threats as a result of human activity. Every year, an estimated 8 million tonnes of plastic waste end up in the world’s oceans. At the same time, climate change is damaging coral reefs and other key ecosystems; overfishing is threatening the stability of fish stocks; nutrient pollution is contributing to the creation of dead zones; and nearly 80 per cent of the world’s wastewater is discharged without treatment. UN Environment is tackling these challenges head-on. They have initiated several campaigns and work with governments, businesses, universities and civil society groups around the world to promote the protection and sustainable management of our precious marine and coastal environments.&nbsp;<br>

What lies at the lowest point of the ocean? At the deepest point of the ocean, strange creatures, you have never seen before, thrive. As vast as the planet and undiscovered like space, are the depths of the ocean. While we continue to make progress in biological discoveries, some parts of the ocean are so inaccessible, that we have only discovered a sliver of the truth. But we do know something about the Mariana Trench, the lowest part of the ocean, which surrounds the Mariana islands near Japan.&nbsp;<br>
So, what lies in these treacherously deep, dark waters. Find out if you can afford a scare. Flappy ears, deep-set eyes and eight tiny tentacles; named after the Disney favourite, the Dumbo Octopus is arguably the most eye-soothing sight, found at least 9,800 metres under the sea in the Mariana trench. Hardly spooky, these adorable 8–12-inch creatures stream through the ocean by flapping their ears. Charming as they may be, the dumbo octopus is a predator that can swallow its prey in one gulp. Then, there’s the Black Seadevil Fish. Any fan of ‘Finding Nemo’ might quickly recognise this fish. Featured as a scary creature in the film, the Black Seadevil is just as terrifying in real life. Sharp teeth, gaping mouth and eyes exploding out of their sockets; this angler fish is known for its luminous antenna-like muscle protruding from its head. This light attracts its prey into close vicinity for an easy catch. These are only two of the amazing creatures of the deepest parts of the ocean.<br>

In our recent National Poetry Day poll, Samuel Coleridge's poetic ballad, "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" was enthusiastically mentioned by several pollsters. It's a poem most people read when young; quickly falling under the powerful spell of its simple ballad rhyme and rhythm, its dramatic storytelling and ever-shifting imagery. The Rime of the Ancient Mariner recounts the experiences of a sailor who has returned from a long sea voyage. The mariner (sailor) stops a man who is on his way to a wedding ceremony and begins to narrate a story. The story is about a man on a voyage by ship, who in one impulsive and terrible act, changes the course of his life – and death. The Mariner faces an inner struggle over the crime he has committed and he must understand his actions and perform his penance.&nbsp;<br>

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
It is generally believed that the entire alien encounter phenomenon began with the startling sighting of ‘flying saucers’ or unidentified flying objects (UFOs) by American pilot, Kenneth Arnold in 1947. Most studies of UFOs, or books on the subject, feature the Arnold sighting and describe it as the first UFO sighting. In fact, this is very much a matter of using the wisdom of hindsight. At the time, neither Arnold nor anyone else even thought about aliens or UFOs. It was assumed that what he had seen was some kind of top secret military aircraft of revolutionary design.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
The press and public had not lost interest. Reports of sightings continued to be made and were featured by the press and broadcast media. Some reporters took a particular interest in flying saucers, as did some air professionals and members of the public. Since it was now becoming clear that only some of the strange aircraft were disc-shaped – Arnold’s originals had been crescent-shaped – these researchers began to drop the popular name of flying saucers. Instead, they adopted the term unidentified flying objects (UFOs). This was thought to lend an air of scientific rigour to the various investigations and meant that the investigators were not prejudging the eventual solution to the riddle.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
US Marines officer, Major Donald Kehoe believed that Earth had been under observation by beings from another planet, or series of planets, for some 200 years or more. He believed that the sudden upsurge in sightings after 1947 was linked to the detonation of the first atomic bomb in 1945. Keyhoe argued that the invention of atomic power was a key moment in the progress of a civilisation and that any more advanced culture would be bound to take notice of the crossing of this threshold. In due course, Keyhoe argued, aliens would make contact, though when, where or how would be up to them.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Just four months later, the flying saucer story took a dramatic new turn, when a formation of the mysterious craft flew over Washington, DC, the capital of the USA. On 19 July 1952, a dozen or more saucers flew over central Washington, including the White House and Capitol. The objects were tracked on radar and jet fighters sent up to intercept, but they had vanished by the time the jets arrived. The UFOs were back on 26 July, again flying over the very heart of US power and prestige.</p>

It is generally believed that the entire alien encounter phenomenon began with the startling sighting of ‘flying saucers’ or unidentified flying objects (UFOs) by American pilot, Kenneth Arnold in 1947. Most studies of UFOs, or books on the subject, feature the Arnold sighting and describe it as the first UFO sighting. In fact, this is very much a matter of using the wisdom of hindsight. At the time, neither Arnold nor anyone else even thought about aliens or UFOs. It was assumed that what he had seen was some kind of top secret military aircraft of revolutionary design.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
The press and public had not lost interest. Reports of sightings continued to be made and were featured by the press and broadcast media. Some reporters took a particular interest in flying saucers, as did some air professionals and members of the public. Since it was now becoming clear that only some of the strange aircraft were disc-shaped – Arnold’s originals had been crescent-shaped – these researchers began to drop the popular name of flying saucers. Instead, they adopted the term unidentified flying objects (UFOs). This was thought to lend an air of scientific rigour to the various investigations and meant that the investigators were not prejudging the eventual solution to the riddle.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
US Marines officer, Major Donald Kehoe believed that Earth had been under observation by beings from another planet, or series of planets, for some 200 years or more. He believed that the sudden upsurge in sightings after 1947 was linked to the detonation of the first atomic bomb in 1945. Keyhoe argued that the invention of atomic power was a key moment in the progress of a civilisation and that any more advanced culture would be bound to take notice of the crossing of this threshold. In due course, Keyhoe argued, aliens would make contact, though when, where or how would be up to them.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Just four months later, the flying saucer story took a dramatic new turn, when a formation of the mysterious craft flew over Washington, DC, the capital of the USA. On 19 July 1952, a dozen or more saucers flew over central Washington, including the White House and Capitol. The objects were tracked on radar and jet fighters sent up to intercept, but they had vanished by the time the jets arrived. The UFOs were back on 26 July, again flying over the very heart of US power and prestige.</p>
