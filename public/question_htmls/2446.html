One day late in the autumn my master had a long journey to go on business. I was put into the dogcart, and John went with his master. I always liked to go in the dogcart, it was so light and the high wheels ran along so pleasantly. There had been a great deal of rain, and now the wind was very high and blew the dry leaves across the road in a shower. We went along merrily till we came to the tollbar and the low wooden bridge. The riverbanks were rather high, and the bridge, instead of rising, went across just level, so that in the middle, if the river was full, the water would be nearly up to the woodwork and planks; but as there were good substantial rails on each side, people did not mind it.</p>
        <p>The man at the gate said the river was rising fast, and he feared it would be a bad night. Many of the meadows were under water, and in one low part of the road the water was halfway up to my knees; the bottom was good, and master drove gently, so it was no matter.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When we got to the town of course I had a good bait, but as the master’s business engaged him a long time we did not start for home till rather late in the afternoon. The wind was then much higher, and I heard the master say to John that he had never been out in such a storm; and so I thought, as we went along the skirts of a wood, where the great branches were swaying about like twigs, and the rushing sound was terrible.</p>
        <p>“I wish we were well out of this wood,” said my master.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Yes, sir,” said John, “it would be rather awkward if one of these branches came down upon us.”</p>
        <p>The words were scarcely out of his mouth when there was a groan, and a crack, and a splitting sound, and tearing, crashing down among the other trees came an oak, torn up by the roots, and it fell right across the road just before us. I will never say I was not frightened, for I was. I stopped still, and I believe I trembled; of course I did not turn round or run away; I was not brought up to that. John jumped out and was in a moment at my head.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“That was a very near touch,” said my master. “What’s to be done now?”</p>
        <p>“Well, sir, we can’t drive over that tree, nor yet get round it; there will be nothing for it, but to go back to the four crossways, and that will be a good six miles before we get round to the wooden bridge again; it will make us late, but the horse is fresh.”</p>
        <p>So back we went and round by the crossroads, but by the time we got to the bridge it was very nearly dark; we could just see that the water was over the middle of it; but as that happened sometimes when the floods were out, master did not stop. We were going along at a good pace, but the moment my feet touched the first part of the bridge I felt sure there was something wrong. I dare not go forward, and I made a dead stop. “Go on, Beauty,” said my master, and he gave me a touch with the whip, but I dare not stir; he gave me a sharp cut; I jumped, but I dare not go forward.</p>
        <p>“There’s something wrong, sir,” said John, and he sprang out of the dogcart and came to my head and looked all about. He tried to lead me forward. “Come on, Beauty, what’s the matter?” Of course I could not tell him, but I knew very well that the bridge was not safe.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Just then the man at the tollgate on the other side ran out of the house, tossing a torch about like one mad.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Hoy, hoy, hoy! halloo! stop!” he cried.</p>
        <p>“What’s the matter?” shouted my master.</p>
        <p>“The bridge is broken in the middle, and part of it is carried away; if you come on you’ll be into the river.”</p>
        <p>“Thank God!” said my master. “You Beauty!” said John and took the bridle and gently turned me round to the righthand road by the river side. The sun had set some time; the wind seemed to have lulled off after that furious blast which tore up the tree. It grew darker and darker, stiller and stiller.</p>
        <p>I trotted quietly along, the wheels hardly making a sound on the soft road.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We saw a light at the hall-door and at the upper windows, and as we came up mistress ran out, saying, “Are you really safe, my dear? Oh! I have been so anxious, fancying all sorts of things. Have you had no accident?”</p>
        <p>“No, my dear; but if your Black Beauty had not been wiser than we were we should all have been carried down the river at the wooden bridge.” I heard no more, as they went into the house, and John took me to the stable. Oh, what a good supper he gave me that night, a good bran mash and some crushed beans with my oats, and such a thick bed of straw! and I was glad of it, for I was tired.</p>

          <em>Read the poem by Michael Hettich below then answer the questions</em>
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Bats</strong>
        </p>
        <p>They emerge when day has bleached from the sky<br>
through a sliver of space beneath the roof:<br>
two, I think, but they’re so fast they vanish<br>
and reappear from somewhere else,<br>
each a shallow wave where they jerk<br>
the membrane that serves for wings,<br>
tiny mouths screaming to map the landscape.</p>
        <p>They’re bad luck, darkness, winged rats<br>
flitting through crowded tenements,<br>
or flying souls, our last spark<br>
given form in the dusk as it leaves us.<br>
In Levens a whole colony funneled<br>
between the trees and we stood beneath,<br>
altered by their sudden current.</p>
        <p>I remember the dead one on the gravel:<br>
brown fur coarse as wire wool, wings a cape,<br>
face wizened and faintly human,<br>
the oldest man that ever was.<br>
It had dropped from another world, as if<br>
what we see in flight is a privileged glimpse<br>
of something we must fail to understand.</p>

        <p>They emerge when day has bleached from the sky<br>
through a sliver of space beneath the roof:<br>
two, I think, but they’re so fast they vanish<br>
and reappear from somewhere else,<br>

the membrane that serves for wings,<br>
tiny mouths screaming to map the landscape.</p>
        <p>They’re bad luck, darkness, winged rats<br>
flitting through crowded tenements,<br>
or flying souls, our last spark<br>
given form in the dusk as it leaves us.<br>
In Levens a whole colony funneled<br>
between the trees and we stood beneath,<br>
altered by their sudden current.</p>
        <p>I remember the dead one on the gravel:<br>
brown fur coarse as wire wool, wings a cape,<br>
face wizened and faintly human,<br>
the oldest man that ever was.<br>
It had dropped from another world, as if<br>
what we see in flight is a privileged glimpse<br>
of something we must fail to understand.</p>

        <p>“Had I been a man I might have explored the Poles or climbed Mount Everest, but as it was my spirit found outlet in the air….” This quote from English aviatrix Amy Johnson reflects the powerful determination of a woman who was not content with the typical life of the 1920s. Born in Hull in 1903, Amy graduated from the University of Sheffield with an economics degree, a rare achievement for a woman at the time. <strong>(A)</strong>…………. She found a new passion after taking a bus ride to a local aerodrome, where she watched planes take off and land. In 1928, she began flying lessons and soon became the first British woman to earn a ground engineer’s license. <strong>(B)</strong>………….</p>
        <p>In 1929, Amy announced her plan to become the first woman to fly solo from England to Australia. With financial help, she bought a second-hand aircraft, which she named Jason. On May 5, 1930, she set off on a low-key departure from England. Flying roughly 18,000 km over 20 days with no radio, guided only by a compass and wristwatch, she faced numerous challenges, including a dust storm in Baghdad and trouble in Rangoon. Her arrival in Brisbane was met with thousands of well-wishers, and she became an overnight celebrity, affectionately known as ‘Our Aeroplane Girl.’ Her accomplishments inspired many songs and smashed long-held stereotypes, paving the way for other young women in aviation. <strong>(C)</strong>…………. Australian women, in particular, were spurred on by her flight and began pressuring flight clubs to allow them as members.</p>
        <p>A contemporary of Johnson was the American aviator, Amelia Earhart. Born in Kansas in 1897, Earhart was known for her adventurous spirit from a young age. <strong>(D)</strong>…………. She developed an interest in caring for soldiers wounded in World War I, and later entered a pre-med program, but eventually pursued her true passion for flying. After her first airplane ride in 1920, she took flying lessons, bought her own plane, and earned her pilot’s license in 1923. In 1928, she became the first woman to fly across the Atlantic Ocean, though she was a passenger on the flight. Determined to prove herself, she crossed the Atlantic alone on May 20, 1932, a flight of 14 hours and 56 minutes. <strong>(E)</strong>…………. She continued to break records, becoming the first person to fly solo from Hawaii to California in 1935, a route considered even more hazardous than her Atlantic crossing.</p>
        <p>In 1937, Earhart set out on her most ambitious flight yet: to circumnavigate the globe. With navigator Fred Noonan, she travelled some 22,000 miles before departing from New Guinea for Howland Island, a tiny, hard-to-find atoll. <strong>(F)</strong>…………. A massive search-and-rescue operation was launched, but after weeks of searching, her plane was never found. While the mystery surrounding her disappearance remains, her legacy as a pioneer and advocate for women’s opportunities lives on. She once said, “Some of us have great runways already built for us. If you have one, take off. But if you don’t have one, realize it is your responsibility to grab a shovel and build one for yourself and for those who will follow after you.”</p>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of Horses. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Horses are among the most influential animals in human history, valued for their speed, strength and loyalty. From ploughing fields to carrying soldiers into battle, their contribution has been immense. Today, they are primarily seen in sport, leisure riding, and therapy. Riding can build confidence and provide companionship, while equestrian sports demonstrate extraordinary skill. Yet there are drawbacks. Horses are expensive to own and maintain, needing constant care, large grazing areas, and costly veterinary treatment. Their use in racing has also raised concerns about animal welfare, with injuries and over-breeding questioned by critics. Supporters argue that horses thrive when given purposeful training and form bonds with humans, but the balance between tradition and ethics is debated. The positives and negatives remain firmly intertwined. To some, the horse is a majestic partner; to others, it is a creature often pressed into human service. This duality makes the horse both a point for admiration and contention in our society.<br>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of Horses. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
No story about horses is more famous than that of Black Beauty, the fictional horse created by Anna Sewell in the nineteenth century. Sewell’s novel gave voice to the experiences of working horses, describing the cruelty of hard labour, the misery of poor treatment, and the relief of kindness. Though fictional, Black Beauty’s tale influenced real change in how animals were regarded. The book became an early force in the animal welfare movement, urging readers to consider the perspective of the horse. One striking scene describes the pain of the bearing rein, a fashionable but cruel device that forced a horse’s head unnaturally high. Sewell’s work helped to reduce the rein’s popularity and created wider awareness about humane care. Generations of children and adults alike have learned empathy from the novel, which continues to be read around the world. Black Beauty remains an example of how literature can inspire compassion and reform.<br>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of Horses. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Modern horse racing is one of the world’s most lucrative industries. In countries such as Australia, Britain and the United States, race meetings attract huge crowds and billions in betting revenue. Supporters call it the “sport of kings,” highlighting the skill of jockeys, the breeding of champion thoroughbreds, and the excitement of the racecourse. Critics, however, see a different picture: young horses pushed to compete before their bodies are fully developed, gruelling training regimes, and injuries that sometimes end in destruction. The debate has grown louder in recent years as animal rights groups campaign for reforms, such as banning the whip or reducing the racing age. Economically, the industry supports thousands of jobs and fuels local economies, but the moral cost divides opinion. For many, the thunder of hooves down the straight is thrilling. For others, it is the sound of exploitation echoing around a track built on tradition and profit.<br>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of Horses. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
I still remember the first time I rode a horse. It was on a family holiday in rural New South Wales, and I was just ten years old. The horse, a gentle grey mare called Misty, towered above me, her ears flicking back and forth as if reading my nerves. The instructor placed me carefully in the saddle, gave Misty a pat, and told me to relax. At first, every movement felt exaggerated, as though the ground was rocking beneath me. Slowly, though, I began to sense the rhythm of the animal beneath my legs. We trotted down a dusty track lined with gum trees, the air filled with birdsong. By the end of the hour, I had stopped gripping the reins so tightly and had started to laugh. That ride gave me an enduring love of horses. Even now, whenever life feels overwhelming, I picture that moment: the quiet strength of Misty carrying me forward, step by step.<br>
