        <p><em>Read the extract from the short story written by Roald Dahl and then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>The Hitchhiker</strong><br><br>
I had a new car. It was an exciting toy, a big BMW 3.3 Li, which means 3.3 litre, long wheelbase, fuel injection. It had a top speed of 129 mph and terrific acceleration. The body was pale blue. The seats inside were darker blue and they were made of leather, genuine soft leather of the finest quality. The windows were electrically operated and so was the sunroof. The radio aerial popped up when I switched on the radio, and disappeared when I switched it off. The powerful engine growled and grunted impatiently at slow speeds, but at sixty miles an hour the growling stopped and the motor began to purr with pleasure. I was driving up to London by myself. It was a lovely June day. They were haymaking in the fields and there were buttercups along both sides of the road. I was whispering along at 70 mph, leaning back comfortably in my seat, with no more than a couple of fingers resting lightly on the wheel to keep her steady.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ahead of me I saw a man thumbing a lift. I touched the brake and brought the car to a stop beside him. I always stopped for hitchhikers. I knew just how it used to feel to be standing on the side of a country road watching the cars go by, I hated the drivers for pretending they didn't see me, especially the ones in big cars with three empty seats. The large expensive cars seldom stopped. It was always the smaller ones that offered you a lift, or the old rusty ones or the ones that were already crammed full of children and the driver would say, "I think we can squeeze in one more.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The hitchhiker poked his head through the open window and said, "Going to London, guv'nor?"</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes," I said. "Jump in." He got in and I drove on. He was a small ratty-faced man with grey teeth. His eyes were dark and quick and clever, like rat's eyes, and his ears were slightly pointed at the top. He had a cloth cap on his head and he was wearing a greyish-coloured jacket with enormous pockets. The grey jacket, together with the quick eyes and the pointed ears, made him look more than anything like some sort of a huge human rat.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What part of London are you headed for?" I asked him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I'm goin' right through London and out the other side” he said. "I'm goin' to Epsom, for the races. It's Derby Day today."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"So it is," I said. "I wish I were going with you. I love betting on horses."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I never bet on horses," he said. "I don't even watch 'em run. That's a stupid silly business.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Then why do you go?" I asked. He didn't seem to like that question. His little ratty face went absolutely blank and he sat there staring straight ahead at the road, saying nothing.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I expect you help to work the betting machines or something like that," I said. "That's even sillier," he answered. "There's no fun working them lousy machines and selling tickets to mugs. Any fool could do that."<br>
<br>
There was a long silence. I decided not to question him any more. I remembered how irritated I used to get in my hitchhiking years when drivers kept asking me questions. Where are you going? Why are you going there? What's your job? Are you married? Do you have a girl friend? What's her name? How old are you? And so forth and so forth. I used to hate it.. "I’m sorry," I said "It's none of my business what you do. The trouble is I’m a writer, and most writers are terribly nosy.” "You write books?" he asked. "Yes." "Writing books is okay," he said. "It's what I call a skilled trade. I’m in a skilled trade too. The folks I despise is them that spend all their lives doin' crummy old routine jobs with no skill in 'em at all. You see what I mean?" "Yes." "The secret of life," he said "is to become very good at somethin' that's very very 'ard to do."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Like you, " I said</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Exactly. You and me both".</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What makes you think that I’m any good at my job?" I asked. "There's an awful lot of bad writers around."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You wouldn't be drivin' about in a car like this if you weren't no good at it," he answered. "It must've cost a tidy packet, this little job."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"It wasn't cheap."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What can she do flat out?" he asked</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"One hundred and twenty-nine miles an hour," I told him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I'll bet she won't do it."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I'll bet she will."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"All car-makers is liars," he said. "You can buy any car you like and it’ll never do what the makers say it will in the ads."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"This one will."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Open 'er up and prove it," he said. "Go on, guv'nor, open 'er right up and let's see what she'll do."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is a traffic circle at Chalfont St. Peter and immediately beyond it there's a long straight section of divided highway. We came out of the circle onto the highway and I pressed my foot hard down on the accelerator. The big car leaped forward as though she'd been stung. In ten seconds or so, we were doing ninety.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Lovely!" he cried. "Beautiful! Keep goin’!"</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I had the accelerator jammed right down against the floor and I held it there.</p>
        <p>"One hundred!" he shouted. "A hundred and five! A hundred and ten! A hundred and fifteen! Go on! Don't slack off!"</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was in the outside lane and we flashed past several cars as though they were standing still -a green Mini, a big cream-coloured Citroen, a white Land Rover, a huge truck with a container on the back, an orange-coloured Volkswagen Minibus. . . .&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"A hundred and twenty!" my passenger shouted, jumping up and down. "Go on! Go on! Get 'er up to one-two-nine!"</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At that moment, I heard the scream of a police siren. It was so loud it seemed to be right inside the car, and then a cop on a motorcycle loomed up alongside us on the inside lane and went past us and raised a hand for us to stop.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh, my sainted aunt!" I said. "That's torn it!"</p>

        <p>Dad would come home after too long at work<br>
and I’d sit on his lap to hear<br>
the story of Ferdinand the Bull<sup>1</sup>; every night,<br>
me handing him the red book until I knew<br>
every word, couldn’t read,<br>
just recite along with drawings<br>
of a gentle bull, frustrated matadors<sup>2</sup>,<br>
the all-important bee, and flowers—<br>
flowers in meadows and flowers<br>
thrown by the Spanish ladies.<br>
Its lesson, really,<br>
about not being what you’re born into<br>
but what you’re born to be,<br>
even if that means<br>
not caring about the capes they wave in your face<br>
or the spears they cut into your shoulders.<br>
And Dad, wonderful Dad, came home<br>
after too long at work<br>
and read to me<br>
the same story every night<br>
until I knew every word, couldn’t read,<br>
just recite.</p>

every word, couldn’t read,<br>
just recite along with drawings<br>
of a gentle bull, frustrated matadors<sup>2</sup>,<br>
the all-important bee, and flowers—<br>
flowers in meadows and flowers<br>
thrown by the Spanish ladies.<br>
Its lesson, really,<br>
about not being what you’re born into<br>
but what you’re born to be,<br>
even if that means<br>
not caring about the capes they wave in your face<br>
or the spears they cut into your shoulders.<br>
And Dad, wonderful Dad, came home<br>
after too long at work<br>
and read to me<br>
the same story every night<br>
until I knew every word, couldn’t read,<br>
just recite.</p>

        <p>Dad would come home after too long at work<br>

me handing him the red book until I knew<br>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Spanish Bullfighting<br>
<br>
15 </strong>&nbsp;……….&nbsp; The Spanish people consider types of bullfighting as art forms which are intimately linked with their country’s history, art and culture.&nbsp; Pressure groups attempt to lobby against bullfighting yet the King of Spain himself has allegedly stated that the day the EU bans bullfighting is the day Spain leaves the EU.</p>
        <p><strong>16 &nbsp;</strong>……….&nbsp; They were popular spectacles in ancient Rome, but it was in the Iberian Peninsula that these contests were fully developed by the Moors from North Africa who overran Andalucia in AD 711. Bullfighting developed into a ritualistic occasion observed in connection with feast days, on which the conquering Moors, mounted on highly trained horses, confronted and killed the bulls. Whilst bullfighting maintains strong support in its heartlands of Madrid, Andalucia and Extremadura it has been banned in Catalonia.</p>
        <p><strong>17 &nbsp;</strong>……….&nbsp; All major Spanish cities have impressive bullrings but probably the most outstanding are those in Madrid, Seville, and Ronda. The Madrid’s Bullring is La Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas which was built in 1929 and was first used in 1931. It is the most important bullring in the world with a capacity of 25,000. Every seat is taken every evening during the world-renowned San Isidro Bullfighting festival in June. The Seville Bullring is very old Building of the Maestranza Bullring in Seville began in 1758 making it Spain’s oldest Plaza de Toros. The origin of modern-day bullfighting on foot (rather than horseback) can be traced back to here and Ronda. It is one of the most charming bullrings in the country and although its capacity is only 12,500, it attracts the top bullfighters.&nbsp; You can see bullfights in Seville from April (during Seville’s Feria de Abril) through to October. Check the bullfight calendar as they don’t take place every weekend.</p>
        <p><strong>18 &nbsp;</strong>……….&nbsp; It is one of the oldest and most beautiful in Spain. Previously it had been Philip II’s centre for horsemanship training (Real Maestranza de Caballeria). Bulls were used in this training and when one day an aristocrat fell from his horse one Francisco Romero came to his help by using his hat to distract it. The hat was replaced by a cape and modern day bullfighting was born. Romero’s grandson, Pedro Romero, developed all the passes and moves which to this day are seen at a bullfight. He retired in his eighties after killing more than 5,600 bulls without ever being hurt. Thus Ronda is considered the home of bullfighting. You can visit the bullring in Ronda which houses a small bullfighting museum. The bullfighting season in Ronda is from April to October though fights are quite infrequent. Check with the tourist office next to the bullring.</p>
        <p><strong>19 &nbsp;</strong>……….&nbsp; It depends on their position in the bullfighting arena. The ones in the shade (sombra) are more expensive than the ones in the sun (sol). Some seats are designated as sun and shade (sol y sombra) because they begin in the sun but move to shade as the afternoon progresses. Seats located closest to the bullfight are also more expensive than those near the back. So ones near the ringside barrier (barrera) which are also in the shade are the most expensive. Buying tickets at the actual arena can prove a major hassle as it is difficult to work out which ticket window (taquilla) you should go to and without a very good level of Spanish it is almost impossible to explain or find out which tickets you wish to buy. Just study the poster of the event in advance to decide where you want to sit then ask for those seats or simply copy the name of the seating area and show it to the ticket seller.</p>
        <p><strong>20 &nbsp;</strong>……….&nbsp; Bulls can suffer a severe and tortuous death. Many animal rights activists often protest bullfighting in Spain and other countries, citing the needless endangerment of the bull and bullfighter. Some cities around the world where bullfighting was once popular, including Coslada (Spain), Mouans-Sartoux (France), and Teocelo (Mexico), have even declared themselves to be anti-bullfighting cities. Other places, including some towns in Catalonia (Spain), have ceased killing the bull in the fight, but continue bullfighting.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Spanish Bullfighting<br>
<br>
15 </strong>&nbsp;……….&nbsp; The Spanish people consider types of bullfighting as art forms which are intimately linked with their country’s history, art and culture.&nbsp; Pressure groups attempt to lobby against bullfighting yet the King of Spain himself has allegedly stated that the day the EU bans bullfighting is the day Spain leaves the EU.</p>
        <p><strong>16 &nbsp;</strong>……….&nbsp; They were popular spectacles in ancient Rome, but it was in the Iberian Peninsula that these contests were fully developed by the Moors from North Africa who overran Andalucia in AD 711. Bullfighting developed into a ritualistic occasion observed in connection with feast days, on which the conquering Moors, mounted on highly trained horses, confronted and killed the bulls. Whilst bullfighting maintains strong support in its heartlands of Madrid, Andalucia and Extremadura it has been banned in Catalonia.</p>
        <p><strong>17 &nbsp;</strong>……….&nbsp; All major Spanish cities have impressive bullrings but probably the most outstanding are those in Madrid, Seville, and Ronda. The Madrid’s Bullring is La Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas which was built in 1929 and was first used in 1931. It is the most important bullring in the world with a capacity of 25,000. Every seat is taken every evening during the world-renowned San Isidro Bullfighting festival in June. The Seville Bullring is very old Building of the Maestranza Bullring in Seville began in 1758 making it Spain’s oldest Plaza de Toros. The origin of modern-day bullfighting on foot (rather than horseback) can be traced back to here and Ronda. It is one of the most charming bullrings in the country and although its capacity is only 12,500, it attracts the top bullfighters.&nbsp; You can see bullfights in Seville from April (during Seville’s Feria de Abril) through to October. Check the bullfight calendar as they don’t take place every weekend.</p>
        <p><strong>18 &nbsp;</strong>……….&nbsp; It is one of the oldest and most beautiful in Spain. Previously it had been Philip II’s centre for horsemanship training (Real Maestranza de Caballeria). Bulls were used in this training and when one day an aristocrat fell from his horse one Francisco Romero came to his help by using his hat to distract it. The hat was replaced by a cape and modern day bullfighting was born. Romero’s grandson, Pedro Romero, developed all the passes and moves which to this day are seen at a bullfight. He retired in his eighties after killing more than 5,600 bulls without ever being hurt. Thus Ronda is considered the home of bullfighting. You can visit the bullring in Ronda which houses a small bullfighting museum. The bullfighting season in Ronda is from April to October though fights are quite infrequent. Check with the tourist office next to the bullring.</p>
        <p><strong>19 &nbsp;</strong>……….&nbsp; It depends on their position in the bullfighting arena. The ones in the shade (sombra) are more expensive than the ones in the sun (sol). Some seats are designated as sun and shade (sol y sombra) because they begin in the sun but move to shade as the afternoon progresses. Seats located closest to the bullfight are also more expensive than those near the back. So ones near the ringside barrier (barrera) which are also in the shade are the most expensive. Buying tickets at the actual arena can prove a major hassle as it is difficult to work out which ticket window (taquilla) you should go to and without a very good level of Spanish it is almost impossible to explain or find out which tickets you wish to buy. Just study the poster of the event in advance to decide where you want to sit then ask for those seats or simply copy the name of the seating area and show it to the ticket seller.</p>
        <p><strong>20 &nbsp;</strong>……….&nbsp; Bulls can suffer a severe and tortuous death. Many animal rights activists often protest bullfighting in Spain and other countries, citing the needless endangerment of the bull and bullfighter. Some cities around the world where bullfighting was once popular, including Coslada (Spain), Mouans-Sartoux (France), and Teocelo (Mexico), have even declared themselves to be anti-bullfighting cities. Other places, including some towns in Catalonia (Spain), have ceased killing the bull in the fight, but continue bullfighting.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Spanish Bullfighting<br>
<br>
15 </strong>&nbsp;……….&nbsp; The Spanish people consider types of bullfighting as art forms which are intimately linked with their country’s history, art and culture.&nbsp; Pressure groups attempt to lobby against bullfighting yet the King of Spain himself has allegedly stated that the day the EU bans bullfighting is the day Spain leaves the EU.</p>
        <p><strong>16 &nbsp;</strong>……….&nbsp; They were popular spectacles in ancient Rome, but it was in the Iberian Peninsula that these contests were fully developed by the Moors from North Africa who overran Andalucia in AD 711. Bullfighting developed into a ritualistic occasion observed in connection with feast days, on which the conquering Moors, mounted on highly trained horses, confronted and killed the bulls. Whilst bullfighting maintains strong support in its heartlands of Madrid, Andalucia and Extremadura it has been banned in Catalonia.</p>
        <p><strong>17 &nbsp;</strong>……….&nbsp; All major Spanish cities have impressive bullrings but probably the most outstanding are those in Madrid, Seville, and Ronda. The Madrid’s Bullring is La Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas which was built in 1929 and was first used in 1931. It is the most important bullring in the world with a capacity of 25,000. Every seat is taken every evening during the world-renowned San Isidro Bullfighting festival in June. The Seville Bullring is very old Building of the Maestranza Bullring in Seville began in 1758 making it Spain’s oldest Plaza de Toros. The origin of modern-day bullfighting on foot (rather than horseback) can be traced back to here and Ronda. It is one of the most charming bullrings in the country and although its capacity is only 12,500, it attracts the top bullfighters.&nbsp; You can see bullfights in Seville from April (during Seville’s Feria de Abril) through to October. Check the bullfight calendar as they don’t take place every weekend.</p>
        <p><strong>18 &nbsp;</strong>……….&nbsp; It is one of the oldest and most beautiful in Spain. Previously it had been Philip II’s centre for horsemanship training (Real Maestranza de Caballeria). Bulls were used in this training and when one day an aristocrat fell from his horse one Francisco Romero came to his help by using his hat to distract it. The hat was replaced by a cape and modern day bullfighting was born. Romero’s grandson, Pedro Romero, developed all the passes and moves which to this day are seen at a bullfight. He retired in his eighties after killing more than 5,600 bulls without ever being hurt. Thus Ronda is considered the home of bullfighting. You can visit the bullring in Ronda which houses a small bullfighting museum. The bullfighting season in Ronda is from April to October though fights are quite infrequent. Check with the tourist office next to the bullring.</p>
        <p><strong>19 &nbsp;</strong>……….&nbsp; It depends on their position in the bullfighting arena. The ones in the shade (sombra) are more expensive than the ones in the sun (sol). Some seats are designated as sun and shade (sol y sombra) because they begin in the sun but move to shade as the afternoon progresses. Seats located closest to the bullfight are also more expensive than those near the back. So ones near the ringside barrier (barrera) which are also in the shade are the most expensive. Buying tickets at the actual arena can prove a major hassle as it is difficult to work out which ticket window (taquilla) you should go to and without a very good level of Spanish it is almost impossible to explain or find out which tickets you wish to buy. Just study the poster of the event in advance to decide where you want to sit then ask for those seats or simply copy the name of the seating area and show it to the ticket seller.</p>
        <p><strong>20 &nbsp;</strong>……….&nbsp; Bulls can suffer a severe and tortuous death. Many animal rights activists often protest bullfighting in Spain and other countries, citing the needless endangerment of the bull and bullfighter. Some cities around the world where bullfighting was once popular, including Coslada (Spain), Mouans-Sartoux (France), and Teocelo (Mexico), have even declared themselves to be anti-bullfighting cities. Other places, including some towns in Catalonia (Spain), have ceased killing the bull in the fight, but continue bullfighting.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Spanish Bullfighting<br>
<br>
15 </strong>&nbsp;……….&nbsp; The Spanish people consider types of bullfighting as art forms which are intimately linked with their country’s history, art and culture.&nbsp; Pressure groups attempt to lobby against bullfighting yet the King of Spain himself has allegedly stated that the day the EU bans bullfighting is the day Spain leaves the EU.</p>
        <p><strong>16 &nbsp;</strong>……….&nbsp; They were popular spectacles in ancient Rome, but it was in the Iberian Peninsula that these contests were fully developed by the Moors from North Africa who overran Andalucia in AD 711. Bullfighting developed into a ritualistic occasion observed in connection with feast days, on which the conquering Moors, mounted on highly trained horses, confronted and killed the bulls. Whilst bullfighting maintains strong support in its heartlands of Madrid, Andalucia and Extremadura it has been banned in Catalonia.</p>
        <p><strong>17 &nbsp;</strong>……….&nbsp; All major Spanish cities have impressive bullrings but probably the most outstanding are those in Madrid, Seville, and Ronda. The Madrid’s Bullring is La Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas which was built in 1929 and was first used in 1931. It is the most important bullring in the world with a capacity of 25,000. Every seat is taken every evening during the world-renowned San Isidro Bullfighting festival in June. The Seville Bullring is very old Building of the Maestranza Bullring in Seville began in 1758 making it Spain’s oldest Plaza de Toros. The origin of modern-day bullfighting on foot (rather than horseback) can be traced back to here and Ronda. It is one of the most charming bullrings in the country and although its capacity is only 12,500, it attracts the top bullfighters.&nbsp; You can see bullfights in Seville from April (during Seville’s Feria de Abril) through to October. Check the bullfight calendar as they don’t take place every weekend.</p>
        <p><strong>18 &nbsp;</strong>……….&nbsp; It is one of the oldest and most beautiful in Spain. Previously it had been Philip II’s centre for horsemanship training (Real Maestranza de Caballeria). Bulls were used in this training and when one day an aristocrat fell from his horse one Francisco Romero came to his help by using his hat to distract it. The hat was replaced by a cape and modern day bullfighting was born. Romero’s grandson, Pedro Romero, developed all the passes and moves which to this day are seen at a bullfight. He retired in his eighties after killing more than 5,600 bulls without ever being hurt. Thus Ronda is considered the home of bullfighting. You can visit the bullring in Ronda which houses a small bullfighting museum. The bullfighting season in Ronda is from April to October though fights are quite infrequent. Check with the tourist office next to the bullring.</p>
        <p><strong>19 &nbsp;</strong>……….&nbsp; It depends on their position in the bullfighting arena. The ones in the shade (sombra) are more expensive than the ones in the sun (sol). Some seats are designated as sun and shade (sol y sombra) because they begin in the sun but move to shade as the afternoon progresses. Seats located closest to the bullfight are also more expensive than those near the back. So ones near the ringside barrier (barrera) which are also in the shade are the most expensive. Buying tickets at the actual arena can prove a major hassle as it is difficult to work out which ticket window (taquilla) you should go to and without a very good level of Spanish it is almost impossible to explain or find out which tickets you wish to buy. Just study the poster of the event in advance to decide where you want to sit then ask for those seats or simply copy the name of the seating area and show it to the ticket seller.</p>
        <p><strong>20 &nbsp;</strong>……….&nbsp; Bulls can suffer a severe and tortuous death. Many animal rights activists often protest bullfighting in Spain and other countries, citing the needless endangerment of the bull and bullfighter. Some cities around the world where bullfighting was once popular, including Coslada (Spain), Mouans-Sartoux (France), and Teocelo (Mexico), have even declared themselves to be anti-bullfighting cities. Other places, including some towns in Catalonia (Spain), have ceased killing the bull in the fight, but continue bullfighting.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Spanish Bullfighting<br>
<br>
15 </strong>&nbsp;……….&nbsp; The Spanish people consider types of bullfighting as art forms which are intimately linked with their country’s history, art and culture.&nbsp; Pressure groups attempt to lobby against bullfighting yet the King of Spain himself has allegedly stated that the day the EU bans bullfighting is the day Spain leaves the EU.</p>
        <p><strong>16 &nbsp;</strong>……….&nbsp; They were popular spectacles in ancient Rome, but it was in the Iberian Peninsula that these contests were fully developed by the Moors from North Africa who overran Andalucia in AD 711. Bullfighting developed into a ritualistic occasion observed in connection with feast days, on which the conquering Moors, mounted on highly trained horses, confronted and killed the bulls. Whilst bullfighting maintains strong support in its heartlands of Madrid, Andalucia and Extremadura it has been banned in Catalonia.</p>
        <p><strong>17 &nbsp;</strong>……….&nbsp; All major Spanish cities have impressive bullrings but probably the most outstanding are those in Madrid, Seville, and Ronda. The Madrid’s Bullring is La Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas which was built in 1929 and was first used in 1931. It is the most important bullring in the world with a capacity of 25,000. Every seat is taken every evening during the world-renowned San Isidro Bullfighting festival in June. The Seville Bullring is very old Building of the Maestranza Bullring in Seville began in 1758 making it Spain’s oldest Plaza de Toros. The origin of modern-day bullfighting on foot (rather than horseback) can be traced back to here and Ronda. It is one of the most charming bullrings in the country and although its capacity is only 12,500, it attracts the top bullfighters.&nbsp; You can see bullfights in Seville from April (during Seville’s Feria de Abril) through to October. Check the bullfight calendar as they don’t take place every weekend.</p>
        <p><strong>18 &nbsp;</strong>……….&nbsp; It is one of the oldest and most beautiful in Spain. Previously it had been Philip II’s centre for horsemanship training (Real Maestranza de Caballeria). Bulls were used in this training and when one day an aristocrat fell from his horse one Francisco Romero came to his help by using his hat to distract it. The hat was replaced by a cape and modern day bullfighting was born. Romero’s grandson, Pedro Romero, developed all the passes and moves which to this day are seen at a bullfight. He retired in his eighties after killing more than 5,600 bulls without ever being hurt. Thus Ronda is considered the home of bullfighting. You can visit the bullring in Ronda which houses a small bullfighting museum. The bullfighting season in Ronda is from April to October though fights are quite infrequent. Check with the tourist office next to the bullring.</p>
        <p><strong>19 &nbsp;</strong>……….&nbsp; It depends on their position in the bullfighting arena. The ones in the shade (sombra) are more expensive than the ones in the sun (sol). Some seats are designated as sun and shade (sol y sombra) because they begin in the sun but move to shade as the afternoon progresses. Seats located closest to the bullfight are also more expensive than those near the back. So ones near the ringside barrier (barrera) which are also in the shade are the most expensive. Buying tickets at the actual arena can prove a major hassle as it is difficult to work out which ticket window (taquilla) you should go to and without a very good level of Spanish it is almost impossible to explain or find out which tickets you wish to buy. Just study the poster of the event in advance to decide where you want to sit then ask for those seats or simply copy the name of the seating area and show it to the ticket seller.</p>
        <p><strong>20 &nbsp;</strong>……….&nbsp; Bulls can suffer a severe and tortuous death. Many animal rights activists often protest bullfighting in Spain and other countries, citing the needless endangerment of the bull and bullfighter. Some cities around the world where bullfighting was once popular, including Coslada (Spain), Mouans-Sartoux (France), and Teocelo (Mexico), have even declared themselves to be anti-bullfighting cities. Other places, including some towns in Catalonia (Spain), have ceased killing the bull in the fight, but continue bullfighting.</p>

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
One of Australia’s most remarkable natural gifts, the Great Barrier Reef is blessed with the breathtaking beauty of the world’s largest coral reef. The reef contains an abundance of marine life and comprises of over 3000 individual reef systems and coral cays and literally hundreds of picturesque tropical islands with some of the worlds most beautiful sun-soaked, golden beaches. Because of its natural beauty, the Great Barrier Reef has become one of the worlds most sought after tourist destinations. A visitor to the Great Barrier Reef can enjoy many experiences including snorkeling, scuba diving, aircraft or helicopter tours, bare boats (self-sail), glass-bottomed boat viewing, semi-submersibles and educational trips, cruise ship tours, whale watching and swimming with dolphins.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Marine Angelfish are remarkable creatures and some of the most alluring of all fish. They have an elegant form, graceful movement, and often display beautiful vibrant colors. Their bodies are compressed laterally, a flat disc-like form that allows them to slip between rocky outcroppings and reef crevices. They come in all shapes and sizes, and although they can be very showy, their coloration actually helps them blend with the patterns and shadows of the reef. Saltwater angelfish vary considerably in their care requirements, and with wild caught specimens, acclimating them to the aquarium can be a challenge. Yet once established they are relatively hardy, making these exquisite specimens highly desirable. Angelfish do tend to become very territorial as they mature, so it is generally recommended to keep only a single specimen.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Some scientists predict that 90% of global reefs will experience severe bleaching annually by 2055. Most corals have a narrow temperature tolerance. When temperatures become too warm, corals will expel the symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae) that live inside them causing them to turn white and lose an important food source. Although corals can survive a bleaching event, they are more vulnerable to disease and will eventually die if the marine heatwave lasts too long. 200 million people in coastal communities could be displaced if coral growth does not keep up with sea level rise. Corals are predicted to end up in deeper water, which means they will receive less sunlight (vital for their food source) and grow more slowly. As shorelines erode, corals may also be more affected by polluted runoff and sedimentation.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Last month conservationists working with SeaLife Aquarium in Australia dropped 18 biodegradable “hotels” into Sydney Harbor and Port Stephens to help one of the region’s most endangered species: tiny White’s seahorses (Hippocampus whitei).The hotels — which look like cages but have bars spaced out enough for the 5-inch seahorses to swim through — are sorely needed. Recent research indicates that some White’s seahorse populations have fallen by as much as 95% due to commercial destruction of their marine habitats. The manmade domiciles — up to 100 of which will be deployed — will replace some of that lost habitat for both seahorses and their food. “A lot of marine growth such as sponges and coral will accumulate, and that provides a lot of food and shelter for the seahorses,” David Harasti, a marine scientist with the Port Stephens Fisheries Institute, told Australia’s 9News.<br>

One of Australia’s most remarkable natural gifts, the Great Barrier Reef is blessed with the breathtaking beauty of the world’s largest coral reef. The reef contains an abundance of marine life and comprises of over 3000 individual reef systems and coral cays and literally hundreds of picturesque tropical islands with some of the worlds most beautiful sun-soaked, golden beaches. Because of its natural beauty, the Great Barrier Reef has become one of the worlds most sought after tourist destinations. A visitor to the Great Barrier Reef can enjoy many experiences including snorkeling, scuba diving, aircraft or helicopter tours, bare boats (self-sail), glass-bottomed boat viewing, semi-submersibles and educational trips, cruise ship tours, whale watching and swimming with dolphins.&nbsp;<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Marine Angelfish are remarkable creatures and some of the most alluring of all fish. They have an elegant form, graceful movement, and often display beautiful vibrant colors. Their bodies are compressed laterally, a flat disc-like form that allows them to slip between rocky outcroppings and reef crevices. They come in all shapes and sizes, and although they can be very showy, their coloration actually helps them blend with the patterns and shadows of the reef. Saltwater angelfish vary considerably in their care requirements, and with wild caught specimens, acclimating them to the aquarium can be a challenge. Yet once established they are relatively hardy, making these exquisite specimens highly desirable. Angelfish do tend to become very territorial as they mature, so it is generally recommended to keep only a single specimen.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Some scientists predict that 90% of global reefs will experience severe bleaching annually by 2055. Most corals have a narrow temperature tolerance. When temperatures become too warm, corals will expel the symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae) that live inside them causing them to turn white and lose an important food source. Although corals can survive a bleaching event, they are more vulnerable to disease and will eventually die if the marine heatwave lasts too long. 200 million people in coastal communities could be displaced if coral growth does not keep up with sea level rise. Corals are predicted to end up in deeper water, which means they will receive less sunlight (vital for their food source) and grow more slowly. As shorelines erode, corals may also be more affected by polluted runoff and sedimentation.<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Last month conservationists working with SeaLife Aquarium in Australia dropped 18 biodegradable “hotels” into Sydney Harbor and Port Stephens to help one of the region’s most endangered species: tiny White’s seahorses (Hippocampus whitei).The hotels — which look like cages but have bars spaced out enough for the 5-inch seahorses to swim through — are sorely needed. Recent research indicates that some White’s seahorse populations have fallen by as much as 95% due to commercial destruction of their marine habitats. The manmade domiciles — up to 100 of which will be deployed — will replace some of that lost habitat for both seahorses and their food. “A lot of marine growth such as sponges and coral will accumulate, and that provides a lot of food and shelter for the seahorses,” David Harasti, a marine scientist with the Port Stephens Fisheries Institute, told Australia’s 9News.<br>

Because of its natural beauty, the Great Barrier Reef has become one of the worlds most sought after tourist destinations. A visitor to the Great Barrier Reef can enjoy many experiences including snorkeling, scuba diving, aircraft or helicopter tours, bare boats (self-sail), glass-bottomed boat viewing, semi-submersibles and educational trips, cruise ship tours, whale watching and swimming with dolphins.&nbsp;<br>

Marine Angelfish are remarkable creatures and some of the most alluring of all fish. They have an elegant form, graceful movement, and often display beautiful vibrant colors. Their bodies are compressed laterally, a flat disc-like form that allows them to slip between rocky outcroppings and reef crevices. They come in all shapes and sizes, and although they can be very showy, their coloration actually helps them blend with the patterns and shadows of the reef. Saltwater angelfish vary considerably in their care requirements, and with wild caught specimens, acclimating them to the aquarium can be a challenge. Yet once established they are relatively hardy, making these exquisite specimens highly desirable. Angelfish do tend to become very territorial as they mature, so it is generally recommended to keep only a single specimen.<br>

Some scientists predict that 90% of global reefs will experience severe bleaching annually by 2055. Most corals have a narrow temperature tolerance. When temperatures become too warm, corals will expel the symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae) that live inside them causing them to turn white and lose an important food source. Although corals can survive a bleaching event, they are more vulnerable to disease and will eventually die if the marine heatwave lasts too long. 200 million people in coastal communities could be displaced if coral growth does not keep up with sea level rise. Corals are predicted to end up in deeper water, which means they will receive less sunlight (vital for their food source) and grow more slowly. As shorelines erode, corals may also be more affected by polluted runoff and sedimentation.<br>

Last month conservationists working with SeaLife Aquarium in Australia dropped 18 biodegradable “hotels” into Sydney Harbor and Port Stephens to help one of the region’s most endangered species: tiny White’s seahorses (Hippocampus whitei).The hotels — which look like cages but have bars spaced out enough for the 5-inch seahorses to swim through — are sorely needed. Recent research indicates that some White’s seahorse populations have fallen by as much as 95% due to commercial destruction of their marine habitats. The manmade domiciles — up to 100 of which will be deployed — will replace some of that lost habitat for both seahorses and their food. “A lot of marine growth such as sponges and coral will accumulate, and that provides a lot of food and shelter for the seahorses,” David Harasti, a marine scientist with the Port Stephens Fisheries Institute, told Australia’s 9News.<br>
