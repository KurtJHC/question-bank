He found himself in the neighbourhood of the asteroids 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, and 330. He began, therefore, by visiting them, in order to add to his knowledge.</p>
        <p>The first of them was inhabited by a king. Clad in royal purple and ermine, he was seated upon a throne which was at the same time both simple and majestic.</p>
        <p>“Ah! Here is a subject,” exclaimed the king, when he saw the little prince coming.</p>
        <p>And the little prince asked himself:</p>
        <p>“How could he recognize me when he has never seen me before?”</p>
        <p>He did not know how the world is simplified for kings. To them, all men are subjects.</p>
        <p>“Approach, so that I may see you better,” said the king, who felt consumingly proud of being at last a king over somebody.</p>
        <p>The little prince looked everywhere to find a place to sit down; but the entire planet was crammed and obstructed by the king’s magnificent ermine robe. So he remained standing upright, and, since he was tired, he yawned.</p>
        <p>“It is contrary to etiquette to yawn in the presence of a king,” the monarch said to him. “I forbid you to do so.”</p>
        <p>“I can’t help it. I can’t stop myself,” replied the little prince, thoroughly embarrassed. “I have come on a long journey, and I have had no sleep . . .”</p>
        <p>“Ah, then,” the king said. “I order you to yawn. It is years since I have seen anyone yawning. Yawns, to me, are objects of curiosity. Come, now! Yawn again! It is an order.”</p>
        <p>“That frightens me . . . I cannot, any more . . .” murmured the little prince, now completely abashed.</p>
        <p>“Hum! Hum!” replied the king. “Then I--I order you sometimes to yawn and sometimes to--” He sputtered a little, and seemed vexed.</p>
        <p>For what the king fundamentally insisted upon was that his authority should be respected.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>He tolerated no disobedience. He was an absolute monarch. But, because he was a very good man, he made his orders reasonable.</p>
        <p>“If I ordered a general,” he would say, by way of example, “if I ordered a general to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not obey me, that would not be the fault of the general. It would be my fault.”</p>
        <p>“May I sit down?” came now a timid inquiry from the little prince.</p>
        <p>“I order you to do so,” the king answered him, and majestically gathered in a fold of his ermine mantle.</p>
        <p>But the little prince was wondering . . . The planet was tiny. Over what could this king really rule?</p>
        <p>“Sire,” he said to him, “I beg that you will excuse my asking you a question . . .”</p>
        <p>“I order you to ask me a question,” the king hastened to assure him.</p>
        <p>“Sire--over what do you rule?”</p>
        <p>“Over everything,” said the king, with magnificent simplicity.</p>
        <p>“Over everything?”</p>
        <p>The king made a gesture, which took in his planet, the other planets, and all the stars.</p>
        <p>“Over all that?” asked the little prince.</p>
        <p>“Over all that,” the king answered.</p>
        <p>For his rule was not only absolute: it was also universal.</p>
        <p>“And the stars obey you?”</p>
        <p>“Certainly they do,” the king said. “They obey instantly. I do not permit insubordination.”</p>
        <p>Such power was a thing for the little prince to marvel at. If he had been master of such complete authority, he would have been able to watch the sunset, not forty-four times in one day, but seventy-two, or even a hundred, or even two hundred times, without ever having to move his chair. And because he felt a bit sad as he remembered his little planet which he had forsaken, he plucked up his courage to ask the king a favor:</p>
        <p>“I should like to see a sunset . . . Do me that kindness . . . Order the sun to set . . .”&nbsp;</p>

        <p>“If I ordered a general,” he would say, by way of example, “if I ordered a general to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not obey me, that would not be the fault of the general. It would be my fault.”</p>
        <p>“May I sit down?” came now a timid inquiry from the little prince.</p>
        <p>“I order you to do so,” the king answered him, and majestically gathered in a fold of his ermine mantle.</p>
        <p>But the little prince was wondering . . . The planet was tiny. Over what could this king really rule?</p>
        <p>“Sire,” he said to him, “I beg that you will excuse my asking you a question . . .”</p>
        <p>“I order you to ask me a question,” the king hastened to assure him.</p>
        <p>“Sire--over what do you rule?”</p>
        <p>“Over everything,” said the king, with magnificent simplicity.</p>
        <p>“Over everything?”</p>
        <p>The king made a gesture, which took in his planet, the other planets, and all the stars.</p>
        <p>“Over all that?” asked the little prince.</p>
        <p>“Over all that,” the king answered.</p>
        <p>For his rule was not only absolute: it was also universal.</p>
        <p>“And the stars obey you?”</p>
        <p>“Certainly they do,” the king said. “They obey instantly. I do not permit insubordination.”</p>
        <p>Such power was a thing for the little prince to marvel at. If he had been master of such complete authority, he would have been able to watch the sunset, not forty-four times in one day, but seventy-two, or even a hundred, or even two hundred times, without ever having to move his chair. And because he felt a bit sad as he remembered his little planet which he had forsaken, he plucked up his courage to ask the king a favor:</p>
        <p>“I should like to see a sunset . . . Do me that kindness . . . Order the sun to set . . .”&nbsp;</p>

A life on the ocean wave,<br>
A home on the rolling deep,<br>
Where the scattered waters rave,<br>
And the winds their revels keep!<br>
Like an eagle caged,I pine<br>
On this dull, unchanging shore:<br>
Oh! give me the flashing brine,<br>
The spray and the tempest’s roar!</p>
        <p>Once more on the deck I stand<br>
Of my own swift-gliding craft:<br>
Set sail! farewell to the land!<br>
The gale follows fair abaft.<br>
We shoot through the sparkling foam<br>
Like an ocean-bird set free;-<br>
Like the ocean-bird, our home<br>
We’ll find far out on the sea.</p>
        <p>The land is no longer in view,<br>
The clouds have begun to frown;<br>
But with a stout vessel and crew,<br>
We’ll say, Let the storm come down!<br>
And the song of our hearts shall be,<br>
While the winds and the waters rave,<br>
A home on the rolling sea!<br>
A life on the ocean wave!<br>

A life on the ocean wave,<br>
A home on the rolling deep,<br>
Where the scattered waters rave,<br>
And the winds their revels keep!<br>
Like an eagle caged,I pine<br>
On this dull, unchanging shore:<br>
Oh! give me the flashing brine,<br>
The spray and the tempest’s roar!</p>
        <p>Once more on the deck I stand<br>
Of my own swift-gliding craft:<br>
Set sail! farewell to the land!<br>
The gale follows fair abaft.<br>
We shoot through the sparkling foam<br>
Like an ocean-bird set free;-<br>
Like the ocean-bird, our home<br>
We’ll find far out on the sea.</p>
        <p>The land is no longer in view,<br>
The clouds have begun to frown;<br>
But with a stout vessel and crew,<br>
We’ll say, Let the storm come down!<br>
And the song of our hearts shall be,<br>
While the winds and the waters rave,<br>
A home on the rolling sea!<br>
A life on the ocean wave!<br>

        <p><strong>Read the text below. Six sentences have been removed from this text so that there are six gaps.</strong><br><br><strong>CHINA</strong><br><br>
China is the world’s most populous country, home to over 1.4 billion people, and has a history spanning over 5,000 years. Located in East Asia, it is the fourth-largest country by land area, covering about 9.6 million square kilometres. China’s diverse geography includes towering mountains, vast plains, large deserts, and major rivers like the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers. The Himalayas, including Everest, form part of China’s western border, while fertile plains in the east support major cities. <strong>(A)</strong> ………… This geographical diversity has played a key role in shaping China’s development and culture.</p>
        <p>China’s long history is marked by the rise and fall of powerful dynasties. <strong>(B)</strong> …………. Some of the most influential dynasties include the Qin Dynasty, which unified China, the Tang Dynasty, known for its cultural advancements, and the Ming Dynasty, famous for its porcelain and naval exploration. The Great Wall of China, built over centuries, stands as a symbol of the country’s historical efforts to protect itself from invaders. Throughout history, China has influenced global culture through inventions like paper, gunpowder, and the compass.</p>
        <p>Chinese culture is rich and diverse, with traditions that have shaped its identity for thousands of years. Mandarin is the official language, though many other dialects, such as Cantonese and Shanghainese, are spoken in different regions. Chinese cuisine is world renowned, featuring dishes such as dumplings, noodles, and rice-based meals. Regional variations in food reflect China’s vast size, with wheat-based dishes being more common in the north and rice-based meals dominating the south. <strong>(C)</strong> ………… They bring families together to enjoy traditional foods, music, and dances. Chinese art forms like calligraphy, painting, and literature have influenced cultures beyond China’s borders.</p>
        <p>China has one of the fastest-growing economies in the world and is a global leader in manufacturing and trade. <strong>(D)</strong> ………… Major cities like Shanghai and Shenzhen are hubs for industry and technology, with companies like Huawei and Alibaba driving innovation. Agriculture remains an essential part of the economy, with China being a top producer of rice and wheat. The country is also investing heavily in new industries such as artificial intelligence, renewable energy, and space exploration, demonstrating its ambition to remain at the forefront of technological advancement.</p>
        <p>China is home to many unique species, including the giant panda, the golden monkey, and the Chinese dragon—a mythical creature representing power and good fortune.&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant panda, an iconic symbol of China, primarily eats bamboo and is endangered due to habitat loss. Conservation efforts have been put in place to protect these animals and their environments. The golden monkey, known for its striking golden fur, lives in the forests of China’s mountainous regions but faces threats from deforestation. China’s vast landscapes support a variety of wildlife. <strong>(E)</strong> ……………&nbsp;</p>
        <p>China is a one-party state ruled by the Communist Party of China (CCP) since 1949. Unlike democratic countries, where leaders are elected through voting, the CCP maintains control over the government, military, and media. The National People’s Congress (NPC) is responsible for passing laws, but key decisions are made by the CCP’s leadership. In 2018, President Xi Jinping removed term limits, allowing him to remain in power indefinitely. The CCP’s strict control over information and political affairs has been a topic of international discussion, with concerns about press freedom and human rights. <strong>(F)</strong>&nbsp;………….&nbsp;</p>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of perseverance. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Perseverance is not an inborn talent but rather a skill that can be developed over time. Studies have shown that people who practice persistence in small tasks build resilience for larger challenges. Children who are taught to approach setbacks with determination tend to grow into adults who can navigate difficulties more effectively. This ability is closely linked with a ‘growth mindset’—the belief that effort leads to improvement. The most successful individuals are those who see challenges as opportunities to grow rather than as barriers to their goals. By cultivating perseverance, people can overcome difficulties that might otherwise seem insurmountable.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of perseverance. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
The path to success is often paved with failure. Many of history’s most accomplished f igures, from inventors to athletes, faced repeated setbacks before achieving greatness. Thomas Edison, for instance, famously failed thousands of times before successfully inventing the light bulb. Such failures were not defeats but rather learning experiences that allowed for improvement. Perseverance means continuing to push forward, even when the odds seem stacked against you. While failure can be discouraging, those who persist despite obstacles often emerge stronger and more knowledgeable than before.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of perseverance. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Few people can persevere through challenges entirely on their own. Encouragements from mentors, family, and friends play a vital role in sustaining one’s determination. Whether it is an athlete training for a competition or a student striving for academic success, having a support system can make a significant difference. The presence of role models also helps individuals stay committed to their goals, as they can look to others who have persevered and succeeded. However, external support must be paired with personal resolve; ultimately, perseverance is a combination of both internal determination and external motivation. In today’s highly-driven society, it is common to see people giving up at the f irst setback they face and moving onto their next project instead of “wasting time” trying to push through.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of perseverance. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Perseverance is a key factor in various aspects of life, from careers to personal relationships. In professional settings, staying committed to long-term goals despite setbacks is often what differentiates those who succeed from those who do not. Though persevering is a challenging process and can lead to a certain amount of discouragement, or even irritation, it pays off in the long run. In relationships, perseverance means working through conflicts rather than giving up when challenges arise. However, persistence does not mean stubbornly refusing to change course—it involves knowing when to adjust strategies while maintaining a strong commitment to the goal. Whether in work or personal life, those who cultivate perseverance develop the ability to navigate hardships with patience and determination.<br>

The second planet was inhabited by a conceited man.</p>
        <p>“Ah! Ah! I am about to receive a visit from an admirer!” he exclaimed from afar, when he f irst saw the little prince coming. For, to conceited men, all other men are admirers.</p>
        <p>“Good morning,” said the little prince. “That is a strange hat you are wearing.”</p>
        <p>“It is a hat for salutes,” the conceited man replied. “It is to raise in salute when people acclaim me. Unfortunately, nobody at all ever passes this way.”</p>
        <p>“Yes?” said the little prince, who did not understand what the conceited man was talking about.</p>
        <p>“Clap your hands, one against the other,” the conceited man now directed him.</p>
        <p>The little prince clapped his hands. The conceited man raised his hat in a modest salute.</p>
        <p>“This is more entertaining than the visit to the king,” the little prince said to himself. And he began again to clap his hands, one against the other. The conceited man again raised his hat in salute. After five minutes of this exercise the little prince grew tired of the game’s monotony.</p>
        <p>“And what should one do to make the hat come down?” he asked.</p>
        <p>But the conceited man did not hear him. Conceited people never hear anything but praise.</p>
        <p>“Do you really admire me very much?” he demanded of the little prince.</p>
        <p>“What does that mean — ‘admire’?”</p>
        <p>“To admire means that you regard me as the handsomest, the best-dressed, the richest, and the most intelligent man on this planet.”</p>
        <p>“But you are the only man on your planet!”</p>
        <p>“Do me this kindness. Admire me just the same.”</p>
        <p>“I admire you,” said the little prince, shrugging his shoulders&nbsp;&nbsp;slightly, “but what is there in that to interest you so much?” And the little prince went away.</p>
        <p>“The grown-ups are certainly very odd,” he said to himself, as he continued on his journey.</p>
        <p>The next planet was inhabited by a tippler. This was a very short visit, but it plunged the little prince into deep dejection.</p>
        <p>“What are you doing there?” he said to the tippler, whom he found settled down in silence before a collection of empty bottles and also a collection of full bottles.</p>
        <p>“I am drinking,” replied the tippler, with a lugubrious air.</p>
        <p>“Why are you drinking?” demanded the little prince.</p>
        <p>“So that I may forget,” replied the tippler.</p>
        <p>“Forget what?” inquired the little prince, who already was sorry for him.</p>
        <p>“Forget that I am ashamed,” the tippler confessed, hanging his head.</p>
        <p>“Ashamed of what?” insisted the little prince, who wanted to help him.</p>
        <p>“Ashamed of drinking!” The tippler brought his speech to an end, and shut himself up in an impregnable silence.</p>
        <p>And the little prince went away, puzzled.</p>
        <p>“The grown-ups are certainly very, very odd,” he said to himself, as he continued on his journey.</p>

        <p>“Ah! Ah! I am about to receive a visit from an admirer!” he exclaimed from afar, when he f irst saw the little prince coming. For, to conceited men, all other men are admirers.</p>
        <p>“Good morning,” said the little prince. “That is a strange hat you are wearing.”</p>
        <p>“It is a hat for salutes,” the conceited man replied. “It is to raise in salute when people acclaim me. Unfortunately, nobody at all ever passes this way.”</p>
        <p>“Yes?” said the little prince, who did not understand what the conceited man was talking about.</p>
        <p>“Clap your hands, one against the other,” the conceited man now directed him.</p>
        <p>The little prince clapped his hands. The conceited man raised his hat in a modest salute.</p>
        <p>“This is more entertaining than the visit to the king,” the little prince said to himself. And he began again to clap his hands, one against the other. The conceited man again raised his hat in salute. After five minutes of this exercise the little prince grew tired of the game’s monotony.</p>
        <p>“And what should one do to make the hat come down?” he asked.</p>
        <p>But the conceited man did not hear him. Conceited people never hear anything but praise.</p>
        <p>“Do you really admire me very much?” he demanded of the little prince.</p>
        <p>“What does that mean — ‘admire’?”</p>
        <p>“To admire means that you regard me as the handsomest, the best-dressed, the richest, and the most intelligent man on this planet.”</p>
        <p>“But you are the only man on your planet!”</p>
        <p>“Do me this kindness. Admire me just the same.”</p>
        <p>“I admire you,” said the little prince, shrugging his shoulders&nbsp;&nbsp;slightly, “but what is there in that to interest you so much?” And the little prince went away.</p>
        <p>“The grown-ups are certainly very odd,” he said to himself, as he continued on his journey.</p>
        <p>The next planet was inhabited by a tippler. This was a very short visit, but it plunged the little prince into deep dejection.</p>
        <p>“What are you doing there?” he said to the tippler, whom he found settled down in silence before a collection of empty bottles and also a collection of full bottles.</p>
        <p>“I am drinking,” replied the tippler, with a lugubrious air.</p>
        <p>“Why are you drinking?” demanded the little prince.</p>
        <p>“So that I may forget,” replied the tippler.</p>
        <p>“Forget what?” inquired the little prince, who already was sorry for him.</p>
        <p>“Forget that I am ashamed,” the tippler confessed, hanging his head.</p>
        <p>“Ashamed of what?” insisted the little prince, who wanted to help him.</p>
        <p>“Ashamed of drinking!” The tippler brought his speech to an end, and shut himself up in an impregnable silence.</p>
        <p>And the little prince went away, puzzled.</p>
        <p>“The grown-ups are certainly very, very odd,” he said to himself, as he continued on his journey.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br>
The second planet was inhabited by a conceited man.</p>
        <p>“Ah! Ah! I am about to receive a visit from an admirer!” he exclaimed from afar, when he f irst saw the little prince coming. For, to conceited men, all other men are admirers.</p>
        <p>“Good morning,” said the little prince. “That is a strange hat you are wearing.”</p>
        <p>“It is a hat for salutes,” the conceited man replied. “It is to raise in salute when people acclaim me. Unfortunately, nobody at all ever passes this way.”</p>
        <p>“Yes?” said the little prince, who did not understand what the conceited man was talking about.</p>
        <p>“Clap your hands, one against the other,” the conceited man now directed him.</p>
        <p>The little prince clapped his hands. The conceited man raised his hat in a modest salute.</p>
        <p>“This is more entertaining than the visit to the king,” the little prince said to himself. And he began again to clap his hands, one against the other. The conceited man again raised his hat in salute. After five minutes of this exercise the little prince grew tired of the game’s monotony.</p>
        <p>“And what should one do to make the hat come down?” he asked.</p>
        <p>But the conceited man did not hear him. Conceited people never hear anything but praise.</p>
        <p>“Do you really admire me very much?” he demanded of the little prince.</p>
        <p>“What does that mean — ‘admire’?”</p>
        <p>“To admire means that you regard me as the handsomest, the best-dressed, the richest, and the most intelligent man on this planet.”</p>
        <p>“But you are the only man on your planet!”</p>
        <p>“Do me this kindness. Admire me just the same.”</p>
        <p>“I admire you,” said the little prince, shrugging his shoulders&nbsp;&nbsp;slightly, “but what is there in that to interest you so much?” And the little prince went away.</p>
        <p>“The grown-ups are certainly very odd,” he said to himself, as he continued on his journey.</p>
        <p>The next planet was inhabited by a tippler. This was a very short visit, but it plunged the little prince into deep dejection.</p>
        <p>“What are you doing there?” he said to the tippler, whom he found settled down in silence before a collection of empty bottles and also a collection of full bottles.</p>
        <p>“I am drinking,” replied the tippler, with a lugubrious air.</p>
        <p>“Why are you drinking?” demanded the little prince.</p>
        <p>“So that I may forget,” replied the tippler.</p>
        <p>“Forget what?” inquired the little prince, who already was sorry for him.</p>
        <p>“Forget that I am ashamed,” the tippler confessed, hanging his head.</p>
        <p>“Ashamed of what?” insisted the little prince, who wanted to help him.</p>
        <p>“Ashamed of drinking!” The tippler brought his speech to an end, and shut himself up in an impregnable silence.</p>
        <p>And the little prince went away, puzzled.</p>
        <p>“The grown-ups are certainly very, very odd,” he said to himself, as he continued on his journey.</p>

Full knee-deep lies the winter snow,<br>
And the winter winds are wearily sighing:<br>
Toll ye the church-bell sad and slow,<br>
And tread softly and speak low,<br>
For the old year lies a-dying.<br>
Old year, you must not die;<br>
You came to us so readily,<br>
You lived with us so steadily,<br>
Old year, you shall not die.</p>
        <p>He froth’d his bumpers to the brim;<br>
A jollier year we shall not see.<br>
But tho’ his eyes are waxing dim,<br>
And tho’ his foes speak ill of him,<br>
He was a friend to me.<br>
Old year, you shall not die;<br>
We did so laugh and cry with you,<br>
I’ve half a mind to die with you,<br>
Old year, if you must die.</p>
        <p>His face is growing sharp and thin.<br>
Alack! our friend is gone.<br>
Close up his eyes: tie up his chin:<br>
Step from the corpse, and let him in<br>
That stands there alone,<br>
And waits at the door.<br>
There’s a new foot on the floor, my friend,<br>
And a new face at the door, my friend,<br>
A new face at the door.</p>

And tho’ his foes speak ill of him,<br>
He was a friend to me.<br>
Old year, you shall not die;<br>
We did so laugh and cry with you,<br>
I’ve half a mind to die with you,<br>
Old year, if you must die.</p>
        <p>His face is growing sharp and thin.<br>
Alack! our friend is gone.<br>
Close up his eyes: tie up his chin:<br>
Step from the corpse, and let him in<br>
That stands there alone,<br>
And waits at the door.<br>
There’s a new foot on the floor, my friend,<br>
And a new face at the door, my friend,<br>
A new face at the door.</p>

You came to us so readily,<br>
You lived with us so steadily,<br>
Old year, you shall not die.</p>
        <p>He froth’d his bumpers to the brim;<br>
A jollier year we shall not see.<br>
But tho’ his eyes are waxing dim,<br>
And tho’ his foes speak ill of him,<br>
He was a friend to me.<br>
Old year, you shall not die;<br>
We did so laugh and cry with you,<br>
I’ve half a mind to die with you,<br>
Old year, if you must die.</p>
        <p>His face is growing sharp and thin.<br>
Alack! our friend is gone.<br>
Close up his eyes: tie up his chin:<br>
Step from the corpse, and let him in<br>
That stands there alone,<br>
And waits at the door.<br>
There’s a new foot on the floor, my friend,<br>
And a new face at the door, my friend,<br>
A new face at the door.</p>

A tsunami is a series of powerful ocean waves caused by underwater disturbances such as earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. These waves can travel long distances at high speeds and become destructive when they reach coastal areas. Thailand, a Southeast Asian country, has experienced several tsunamis, with the most devastating one occurring on December 26, 2004. <strong>(A)</strong> ………… Understanding the causes, effects, and responses to this disaster is essential in learning how to better prepare for future tsunamis.</p>
        <p>The 2004 tsunami was triggered by a massive undersea earthquake off the coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. The earthquake had a magnitude of 9.1–9.3 and occurred along the Sunda Trench, where the Indian and Burma tectonic plates meet. <strong>(B)</strong> ………… This displaced a huge volume of water and creating massive waves. These waves travelled at incredible speeds across the Indian Ocean, reaching Thailand’s western coastline along the Andaman Sea within hours. Some areas experienced waves as high as 30 metres, causing extensive damage to coastal communities.</p>
        <p>Thailand suffered severe devastation, particularly in the provinces of Phang Nga, Phuket, Krabi, and Trang, which are known for their beaches and tourism. Thousands of people lost their lives, including both locals and international tourists. Entire villages, resorts, and businesses were swept away by the massive waves. <strong>(C)</strong> ………… The popular tourist island of Phuket was severely affected, with beachfront hotels and restaurants being destroyed. The country faced a humanitarian crisis, with thousands of injured people in need of urgent medical care and many left homeless.</p>
        <p>In response to the disaster, the Thai government, international organisations, and volunteers quickly mobilised to provide aid. Search and rescue teams worked tirelessly to f ind survivors trapped under debris, while hospitals were overwhelmed with injured victims. Emergency shelters were set up to house displaced people, and relief organisations provided food, water, and medical supplies. International aid came from around the world, with countries sending financial assistance, supplies, and rescue workers. <strong>(D)</strong> ………….&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The tsunami highlighted the importance of having an effective early warning system to prevent such tragedies in the future. In the aftermath, Thailand and other countries around the Indian Ocean established the Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning System, which includes underwater sensors and communication networks to detect and warn about potential tsunamis. <strong>(E)</strong> …………. These measures have significantly improved disaster&nbsp;&nbsp;preparedness and response in the region.</p>
        <p>The 2004 tsunami was a tragic event that caused immense suffering in Thailand and other affected countries. <strong>(F)</strong> ………… Through global cooperation and better preparedness, Thailand and other nations are now better equipped to handle future natural disasters. The memory of the tsunami serves as a reminder of the power of nature and the importance of being vigilant and ready for emergencies.</p>

Underwater claustrophobia, also known as submechanophobia, is a specific phobia characterised by an intense fear or anxiety related to submerged man-made objects, such as sunken ships, underwater structures, or submerged machinery. Individuals with submechanophobia may experience distress or panic when encountering these objects while swimming or diving, often due to a fear of entanglement, injury, or the unknown. Understanding the triggers and symptoms of submechanophobia can help individuals develop coping strategies and seek appropriate support, such as therapy or relaxation techniques, to manage their fear and safely enjoy aquatic activities.<br>

No story about ocean careers is complete without some mention of Jacques Cousteau. Specifically, his invention, with partner Emile Gagnan, of a self-contained system that made it possible to breathe for long periods of time underwater. By inventing the “aqualung” in 1943, Cousteau changed forever how underwater exploration, and work would be carried out. His invention set divers free to explore to depths of 100 feet and beyond. Before Cousteau, the only options available for undersea exploration were the diving bell and the helmeted diving suit, which severely restricted an explorer’s movements. He opened up more of the Earth’s surface to humankind than any other explorer in history. Through his books, films, and undersea explorations, the French explorer, inventor, photographer and filmmaker brought the oceans and all their life into the world’s living rooms.<br>

Thousands have climbed Mount Everest, and a handful of people have walked on the moon. But reaching the lowest part of the ocean? Only three people have ever done that, and one was a U.S. Navy submariner. In the Pacific Ocean, somewhere between Guam and the Philippines, lies the Marianas Trench, also known as the Mariana Trench. At 35,814 feet below sea level, its bottom is called the Challenger Deep — the deepest point known on Earth. Only three people have ever made it to the Challenger Deep. The first two did it 59 years ago this week: Navy Lt. Don Walsh, a submariner, and explorer Jacques Piccard. Walsh’s engineering background allowed him to be a test pilot for the Trieste, a deep-diving research submersible purchased on behalf of the Navy. The rig was specially equipped with 5-inch-thick steel walls to withstand immense pressures — eight tons of pressure per square inch, to be specific, which is like 2,365 pounds sitting on a person’s f ingernail. On Jan. 23, 1960, Walsh and Piccard made history when they made the five hour, 6.78-mile odyssey to the world’s deepest-known point.<br>

<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of underwater. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Can you hold your breath for five whole minutes? For some freedivers, it’s easy! Some freedivers can dive down more than 120 meters with just one breath. So, are these people crazy? Are they superhumans? The most important question is this: How the heck do they stay underwater for so long without passing out, being crushed by the water pressure, or totally freaking out? Take a deep breath, and let’s find out! Freediving is a form of underwater diving that does not require any sort of scuba gear. So that means divers have to hold their breaths! Freediving used to be a necessity for humans, for fishing, harvesting natural resources, and even for military operations. But in modern times, it’s an epic sport that requires insane physical and mental toughness, and, of course, lungs of steel. To prove our point, let’s take a look at Alexey Molchanov. The Russian diver dove 130 meters with one breath, while wearing a monofin. That’s 426 feet, and a world record! This record breaking dive took him 39 stories underwater, and he had to hold his breath for almost f ive minutes. The best freedivers in the world (Alexey included) have perfected the arts of breath control and mindfulness, which allow them to stay relaxed in deep water. They learn to take advantage of the mammalian dive reflex, which kicks in as soon as we put our faces in the water. The body redirects blood to the vital organs, the heart rate slows down by up to 25%, and the spleen releases a bunch of new red blood cells to increase the oxygen capacity of the blood.&nbsp;<br>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br>
The fourth planet belonged to a businessman. This man was so much occupied that he did not even raise his head at the little prince’s arrival. “Good morning,” the little prince said to him. “Your cigarette has gone out.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Three and two make five. Five and seven make twelve. Twelve and three make fifteen. Good morning. Fifteen and seven make twenty-two. Twenty-two and six make twenty eight. I haven’t time to light it again. Twenty-six and five make thirty-one. Phew! Then that makes five-hundred and-one million, six-hundred-twenty-two-thousand, seven hundred thirty-one.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Five hundred million what?” asked the little prince.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Eh? Are you still there? Five-hundred-and-one million - I can’t stop . . . I have so much to do! I am concerned with matters of consequence. I don’t amuse myself with balderdash. Two and five make seven . . .”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Five-hundred-and-one million what?” repeated the little prince, who never in his life had let go of a question once he had asked it. The businessman raised his head.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“During the fifty-four years that I have inhabited this planet, I have been disturbed only three times. The first time was twenty-two years ago, when some giddy goose fell from goodness knows where. He made the most frightful noise that resounded all over the place, and I made four mistakes in my addition. The second time, eleven years ago, I was disturbed by an attack of rheumatism. I don’t get enough exercise. I have no time for loafing. The third time--well, this is it! I was saying, then, five-hundred-and-one millions--”</p>
        <p>“Millions of what?” The businessman suddenly realized that there was no hope of being left in peace until he answered this question. “Millions of those little objects,” he said, “which one sometimes sees in the sky.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Flies?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Oh, no. Little glittering objects.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Bees?”</p>
        <p>“Oh, no. Little golden objects that set lazy men to idle dreaming. As for me, I am concerned with matters of consequence. There is no time for idle dreaming in my life.” “Ah! You mean the stars?”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Yes, that’s it. The stars.” “And what do you do with five-hundred millions of stars?”</p>
        <p>“Five-hundred-and-one million, six-hundred-twenty-two thousand, seven-hundred-thirty one. I am concerned with matters of consequence: I am accurate.”</p>
        <p>“And what do you do with these stars?” “What do I do with them?”</p>
        <p>“Yes.”</p>
        <p>“Nothing. I own them.”</p>
        <p>“You own the stars?”</p>
        <p>“Yes.”</p>
        <p>“But I have already seen a king who--”</p>
        <p>“Kings do not own, they reign over. It is a very different matter.”</p>
        <p>“And what good does it do you to own the stars?”</p>
        <p>“It does me the good of making me rich.”</p>
        <p>“And what good does it do you to be rich?”</p>
        <p>“It makes it possible for me to buy more stars, if any are discovered.”</p>
        <p>“This man,” the little prince said to himself, “reasons a little like my poor tippler . . .”</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, he still had some more questions. “How is it possible for one to own the stars?”</p>
        <p>“To whom do they belong?” the businessman retorted, peevishly.</p>
        <p>“I don’t know. To nobody.”</p>
        <p>“Then they belong to me, because I was the first person to think of it.”</p>
        <p>“Is that all that is necessary?”</p>
        <p>“Certainly. When you find a diamond that belongs to nobody, it is yours. When you discover an island that belongs to nobody, it is yours. When you get an idea before anyone else, you take out a patent on it: it is yours. So with me: I own the stars, because nobody else before me ever thought of owning them.” “Yes, that is true,” said the little prince. “And&nbsp;&nbsp;what do you do with them?” “I administer them,” replied the businessman. “I count them and recount them. It is difficult. But I am a man who is naturally interested in matters of consequence.” The little prince was still not satisfied.</p>
        <p>“If I owned a silk scarf,” he said, “I could put it around my neck and take it away with me. If I owned a flower, I could pluck that flower and take it away with me. But you cannot pluck the stars from heaven . . .”</p>
        <p>“No. But I can put them in the bank.”</p>
        <p>“Whatever does that mean?”</p>
        <p>“That means that I write the number of my stars on a little paper. And then I put this paper in a drawer and lock it with a key.”</p>
        <p>“And that is all?”</p>
        <p>“That is enough,” said the businessman.</p>

        <p>“Three and two make five. Five and seven make twelve. Twelve and three make fifteen. Good morning. Fifteen and seven make twenty-two. Twenty-two and six make twenty eight. I haven’t time to light it again. Twenty-six and five make thirty-one. Phew! Then that makes five-hundred and-one million, six-hundred-twenty-two-thousand, seven hundred thirty-one.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Five hundred million what?” asked the little prince.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Eh? Are you still there? Five-hundred-and-one million - I can’t stop . . . I have so much to do! I am concerned with matters of consequence. I don’t amuse myself with balderdash. Two and five make seven . . .”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Five-hundred-and-one million what?” repeated the little prince, who never in his life had let go of a question once he had asked it. The businessman raised his head.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“During the fifty-four years that I have inhabited this planet, I have been disturbed only three times. The first time was twenty-two years ago, when some giddy goose fell from goodness knows where. He made the most frightful noise that resounded all over the place, and I made four mistakes in my addition. The second time, eleven years ago, I was disturbed by an attack of rheumatism. I don’t get enough exercise. I have no time for loafing. The third time--well, this is it! I was saying, then, five-hundred-and-one millions--”</p>
        <p>“Millions of what?” The businessman suddenly realized that there was no hope of being left in peace until he answered this question. “Millions of those little objects,” he said, “which one sometimes sees in the sky.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Flies?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Oh, no. Little glittering objects.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Bees?”</p>
        <p>“Oh, no. Little golden objects that set lazy men to idle dreaming. As for me, I am concerned with matters of consequence. There is no time for idle dreaming in my life.” “Ah! You mean the stars?”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Yes, that’s it. The stars.” “And what do you do with five-hundred millions of stars?”</p>
        <p>“Five-hundred-and-one million, six-hundred-twenty-two thousand, seven-hundred-thirty one. I am concerned with matters of consequence: I am accurate.”</p>
        <p>“And what do you do with these stars?” “What do I do with them?”</p>
        <p>“Yes.”</p>
        <p>“Nothing. I own them.”</p>
        <p>“You own the stars?”</p>
        <p>“Yes.”</p>
        <p>“But I have already seen a king who--”</p>
        <p>“Kings do not own, they reign over. It is a very different matter.”</p>
        <p>“And what good does it do you to own the stars?”</p>
        <p>“It does me the good of making me rich.”</p>
        <p>“And what good does it do you to be rich?”</p>
        <p>“It makes it possible for me to buy more stars, if any are discovered.”</p>
        <p>“This man,” the little prince said to himself, “reasons a little like my poor tippler . . .”</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, he still had some more questions. “How is it possible for one to own the stars?”</p>
        <p>“To whom do they belong?” the businessman retorted, peevishly.</p>
        <p>“I don’t know. To nobody.”</p>
        <p>“Then they belong to me, because I was the first person to think of it.”</p>
        <p>“Is that all that is necessary?”</p>
        <p>“Certainly. When you find a diamond that belongs to nobody, it is yours. When you discover an island that belongs to nobody, it is yours. When you get an idea before anyone else, you take out a patent on it: it is yours. So with me: I own the stars, because nobody else before me ever thought of owning them.” “Yes, that is true,” said the little prince. “And&nbsp;&nbsp;what do you do with them?” “I administer them,” replied the businessman. “I count them and recount them. It is difficult. But I am a man who is naturally interested in matters of consequence.” The little prince was still not satisfied.</p>
        <p>“If I owned a silk scarf,” he said, “I could put it around my neck and take it away with me. If I owned a flower, I could pluck that flower and take it away with me. But you cannot pluck the stars from heaven . . .”</p>
        <p>“No. But I can put them in the bank.”</p>
        <p>“Whatever does that mean?”</p>
        <p>“That means that I write the number of my stars on a little paper. And then I put this paper in a drawer and lock it with a key.”</p>
        <p>“And that is all?”</p>
        <p>“That is enough,” said the businessman.</p>

The first time was twenty-two years ago, when some giddy goose fell from goodness knows where. He made the most frightful noise that resounded all over the place, and I made four mistakes in my addition. The second time, eleven years ago, I was disturbed by an attack of rheumatism. I don’t get enough exercise. I have no time for loafing. The third time--well, this is it! I was saying, then, five-hundred-and-one millions--”</p>
        <p>“Millions of what?” The businessman suddenly realized that there was no hope of being left in peace until he answered this question. “Millions of those little objects,” he said, “which one sometimes sees in the sky.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Flies?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Oh, no. Little glittering objects.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Bees?”</p>
        <p>“Oh, no. Little golden objects that set lazy men to idle dreaming. As for me, I am concerned with matters of consequence. There is no time for idle dreaming in my life.” “Ah! You mean the stars?”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Yes, that’s it. The stars.” “And what do you do with five-hundred millions of stars?”</p>
        <p>“Five-hundred-and-one million, six-hundred-twenty-two thousand, seven-hundred-thirty one. I am concerned with matters of consequence: I am accurate.”</p>
        <p>“And what do you do with these stars?” “What do I do with them?”</p>
        <p>“Yes.”</p>
        <p>“Nothing. I own them.”</p>
        <p>“You own the stars?”</p>
        <p>“Yes.”</p>
        <p>“But I have already seen a king who--”</p>
        <p>“Kings do not own, they reign over. It is a very different matter.”</p>
        <p>“And what good does it do you to own the stars?”</p>
        <p>“It does me the good of making me rich.”</p>
        <p>“And what good does it do you to be rich?”</p>
        <p>“It makes it possible for me to buy more stars, if any are discovered.”</p>
        <p>“This man,” the little prince said to himself, “reasons a little like my poor tippler . . .”</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, he still had some more questions. “How is it possible for one to own the stars?”</p>
        <p>“To whom do they belong?” the businessman retorted, peevishly.</p>
        <p>“I don’t know. To nobody.”</p>
        <p>“Then they belong to me, because I was the first person to think of it.”</p>
        <p>“Is that all that is necessary?”</p>
        <p>“Certainly. When you find a diamond that belongs to nobody, it is yours. When you discover an island that belongs to nobody, it is yours. When you get an idea before anyone else, you take out a patent on it: it is yours. So with me: I own the stars, because nobody else before me ever thought of owning them.” “Yes, that is true,” said the little prince. “And&nbsp;&nbsp;what do you do with them?” “I administer them,” replied the businessman. “I count them and recount them. It is difficult. But I am a man who is naturally interested in matters of consequence.” The little prince was still not satisfied.</p>
        <p>“If I owned a silk scarf,” he said, “I could put it around my neck and take it away with me. If I owned a flower, I could pluck that flower and take it away with me. But you cannot pluck the stars from heaven . . .”</p>
        <p>“No. But I can put them in the bank.”</p>
        <p>“Whatever does that mean?”</p>
        <p>“That means that I write the number of my stars on a little paper. And then I put this paper in a drawer and lock it with a key.”</p>
        <p>“And that is all?”</p>
        <p>“That is enough,” said the businessman.</p>

The fourth planet belonged to a businessman. This man was so much occupied that he did not even raise his head at the little prince’s arrival. “Good morning,” the little prince said to him. “Your cigarette has gone out.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Three and two make five. Five and seven make twelve. Twelve and three make fifteen. Good morning. Fifteen and seven make twenty-two. Twenty-two and six make twenty eight. I haven’t time to light it again. Twenty-six and five make thirty-one. Phew! Then that makes five-hundred and-one million, six-hundred-twenty-two-thousand, seven hundred thirty-one.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Five hundred million what?” asked the little prince.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Eh? Are you still there? Five-hundred-and-one million - I can’t stop . . . I have so much to do! I am concerned with matters of consequence. I don’t amuse myself with balderdash. Two and five make seven . . .”&nbsp;</p>
