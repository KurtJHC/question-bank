<strong>How to Make Your Website Easy to Navigate</strong><br>
<br>
Not all websites are made equal. Some websites are simple, logical, and easy to use. Others are a messy hodgepodge of pages and links.<br>
<br>
Bad navigation is an especially common problem area. We’ve all struggled to find things on disorganized websites without any logical structure. It feels hopeless, like being lost in a maze with no map.<br>
<br>
Just because a website looks awesome doesn’t mean that it is easy to navigate. You can have a beautifully designed website, but if it is impossible to use, what’s the point? No one is going to sign up for a newsletter or buy any products. Search engines will be confused, too.<br>
<br>
Designing and developing good navigation is the most important part of building your website. If a website is like a house, navigation is the foundation. Just like the structural foundation of a house, you must start by building the structural foundation of your site navigation first.<br>
<br>
It can be hard to design user-friendly navigation, especially on huge websites. Just remember that simplicity is always the best approach. Also, before your website gets too big, think about how you want users to navigate around it — or things will quickly get disorganized.<br>
<br>
Here are a few tips on how to create good website navigation, turning a negative user experience into an awesome one.<br>
<br>
<strong>Tip #1: Make Sure The Navigation Is Clear And Legible</strong><br>
<br>
In most cases, stay away from narrow fonts and scripts.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The minimum text size on your site’s navigation should be 12 pixels. Anything smaller and your users will be squinting, and search engines might flag it as suspicious. It’s always a good idea to test your website for legibility on mobile devices. Be sure the navigation is easy to read.<br>
<br>
Navigation should also be divided into clear categories, with only the most important links on your main menu. If your website has a lot of pages, use second-level or third-level dropdown menus.<br>
<br>
Use accurate navigation titles. There’s nothing more frustrating than digging around on a website and getting lost because the titles on the navigation links were confusing, vague, or too similar to other titles.<br>
<br>
Use actual text instead of icons for menu items. It’s good for SEO (search engine optimisation) and easier for your users. Search engines can read text to figure out the most important parts of your website, which helps visitors find you, but search engines can’t read icons. Too many icons will also slow down your page speed, which is bad for SEO. Visitors might not be able to load the images quickly either. Text is always the best way to go.<br>
<br>
Be sure that there’s a clear contrast with the colours used for your navigation menu. You can use dark text on a light background, or light text on a dark background, but never dark-on-dark or lighton-light.<br>
<br>
You may also want to try different colours on your navigation links to see what users respond to. Here’s a good example why: In 2014, Google earned an extra $200 million per year by switching to a new shade of blue on advertising links that people clicked on more often.<br>
<br>
<strong>Tip #2: Understand Human Behaviour, Especially When It Comes To Interacting With Different Devices</strong><br>
<br>
People naturally look for patterns and gravitate toward what is comfortable for them. If they can’t find the menu easily, or figure out how to navigate between pages on your website, they won’t stay long.<br>
<br>
In this day and age, people are used to interacting with websites in a certain way. Try not to make things difficult for them. The good news is that basic navigation patterns haven’t changed much over the years.<br>
<br>
For example, desktop users expect to see a prominent, clearly-labelled menu on the top or the side of the page. Mobile device users expect the menu to be integrated in the app, or the responsive page design.<br>
<br>
As more people switch from desktops to mobile devices, more websites are switching to a navigation menu that is far less obvious.<br>
<br>
On mobile devices, there has been a wide adoption of the “hamburger menu,” a three-lined icon that users click on to expand the menu.<br>
<br>
Hiding your navigation menu behind a hamburger button can be hard to find, which is why some apps and websites opt instead for side bars, dropdown menus, or a tab bar at the bottom of the app screen.<br>
<br>
<strong>Tip #3: Integrate Search Functionality With Your Site</strong><br>
<br>
When all else fails, the search bar is the saving grace of navigation. Search functionality is also a great idea for websites where users will be looking for something specific instead of clicking through links.<br>
<br>
Taking steps to improve your website’s search functionality can help improve conversion rates. It can lead to happier shoppers who come back again and again. Even so, the search bar is often neglected.<br>
<br>
There are a few things you can do to make it stand out. Put text inside the box, such as “Search Here,” or an icon of a magnifying glass, to help your visitors figure out that it is a search bar instead of a newsletter sign-up form. You can also draw attention to your search bar by offsetting it in a different colour from your site’s colour scheme.<br>
<br>
The functionality of the search results page is also extremely important. Users expect their product searches to be filterable. It is no longer enough to have minimal options like size, colour, and style. Users also want to be able to search for new items, sale or clearance, and more — and filter out categories they don’t want to see.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Tip #4: Include A Sitemap On Your Website</strong><br>
<br>
A sitemap is like a directory of your website. It is a page with text links to the most important parts of your website. Sitemaps help your users navigate your website, but they are just as important for SEO. They give search engine crawlers an easy way to find pages on your site.<br>
<br>
There are two types of sitemaps: HTML and XML, and you may want both. An HTML sitemap helps a person navigate your website, with links to the most important parts of your website. An XML sitemap helps a search engine navigate your website, with links to all of the pages and information about how frequently the content is updated.</div>

Just because a website looks awesome doesn’t mean that it is easy to navigate. You can have a beautifully designed website, but if it is impossible to use, what’s the point? No one is going to sign up for a newsletter or buy any products. Search engines will be confused, too.<br>
<br>
Designing and developing good navigation is the most important part of building your website. If a website is like a house, navigation is the foundation. Just like the structural foundation of a house, you must start by building the structural foundation of your site navigation first.<br>
<br>
It can be hard to design user-friendly navigation, especially on huge websites. Just remember that simplicity is always the best approach. Also, before your website gets too big, think about how you want users to navigate around it — or things will quickly get disorganized.<br>
<br>
Here are a few tips on how to create good website navigation, turning a negative user experience into an awesome one.<br>
<br>
<strong>Tip #1: Make Sure The Navigation Is Clear And Legible</strong><br>
<br>
In most cases, stay away from narrow fonts and scripts.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The minimum text size on your site’s navigation should be 12 pixels. Anything smaller and your users will be squinting, and search engines might flag it as suspicious. It’s always a good idea to test your website for legibility on mobile devices. Be sure the navigation is easy to read.<br>
<br>
Navigation should also be divided into clear categories, with only the most important links on your main menu. If your website has a lot of pages, use second-level or third-level dropdown menus.<br>
<br>
Use accurate navigation titles. There’s nothing more frustrating than digging around on a website and getting lost because the titles on the navigation links were confusing, vague, or too similar to other titles.<br>
<br>
Use actual text instead of icons for menu items. It’s good for SEO (search engine optimisation) and easier for your users. Search engines can read text to figure out the most important parts of your website, which helps visitors find you, but search engines can’t read icons. Too many icons will also slow down your page speed, which is bad for SEO. Visitors might not be able to load the images quickly either. Text is always the best way to go.<br>
<br>
Be sure that there’s a clear contrast with the colours used for your navigation menu. You can use dark text on a light background, or light text on a dark background, but never dark-on-dark or lighton-light.<br>
<br>
You may also want to try different colours on your navigation links to see what users respond to. Here’s a good example why: In 2014, Google earned an extra $200 million per year by switching to a new shade of blue on advertising links that people clicked on more often.<br>
<br>
<strong>Tip #2: Understand Human Behaviour, Especially When It Comes To Interacting With Different Devices</strong><br>
<br>
People naturally look for patterns and gravitate toward what is comfortable for them. If they can’t find the menu easily, or figure out how to navigate between pages on your website, they won’t stay long.<br>
<br>
In this day and age, people are used to interacting with websites in a certain way. Try not to make things difficult for them. The good news is that basic navigation patterns haven’t changed much over the years.<br>
<br>
For example, desktop users expect to see a prominent, clearly-labelled menu on the top or the side of the page. Mobile device users expect the menu to be integrated in the app, or the responsive page design.<br>
<br>
As more people switch from desktops to mobile devices, more websites are switching to a navigation menu that is far less obvious.<br>
<br>
On mobile devices, there has been a wide adoption of the “hamburger menu,” a three-lined icon that users click on to expand the menu.<br>
<br>
Hiding your navigation menu behind a hamburger button can be hard to find, which is why some apps and websites opt instead for side bars, dropdown menus, or a tab bar at the bottom of the app screen.<br>
<br>
<strong>Tip #3: Integrate Search Functionality With Your Site</strong><br>
<br>
When all else fails, the search bar is the saving grace of navigation. Search functionality is also a great idea for websites where users will be looking for something specific instead of clicking through links.<br>
<br>
Taking steps to improve your website’s search functionality can help improve conversion rates. It can lead to happier shoppers who come back again and again. Even so, the search bar is often neglected.<br>
<br>
There are a few things you can do to make it stand out. Put text inside the box, such as “Search Here,” or an icon of a magnifying glass, to help your visitors figure out that it is a search bar instead of a newsletter sign-up form. You can also draw attention to your search bar by offsetting it in a different colour from your site’s colour scheme.<br>
<br>
The functionality of the search results page is also extremely important. Users expect their product searches to be filterable. It is no longer enough to have minimal options like size, colour, and style. Users also want to be able to search for new items, sale or clearance, and more — and filter out categories they don’t want to see.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Tip #4: Include A Sitemap On Your Website</strong><br>
<br>
A sitemap is like a directory of your website. It is a page with text links to the most important parts of your website. Sitemaps help your users navigate your website, but they are just as important for SEO. They give search engine crawlers an easy way to find pages on your site.<br>
<br>
There are two types of sitemaps: HTML and XML, and you may want both. An HTML sitemap helps a person navigate your website, with links to the most important parts of your website. An XML sitemap helps a search engine navigate your website, with links to all of the pages and information about how frequently the content is updated.</div>

<strong>How to Make Your Website Easy to Navigate</strong><br>
<br>
Not all websites are made equal. Some websites are simple, logical, and easy to use. Others are a messy hodgepodge of pages and links.<br>
<br>

<strong>Tip #1: Make Sure The Navigation Is Clear And Legible</strong><br>
<br>
In most cases, stay away from narrow fonts and scripts.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The minimum text size on your site’s navigation should be 12 pixels. Anything smaller and your users will be squinting, and search engines might flag it as suspicious. It’s always a good idea to test your website for legibility on mobile devices. Be sure the navigation is easy to read.<br>
<br>
Navigation should also be divided into clear categories, with only the most important links on your main menu. If your website has a lot of pages, use second-level or third-level dropdown menus.<br>
<br>
Use accurate navigation titles. There’s nothing more frustrating than digging around on a website and getting lost because the titles on the navigation links were confusing, vague, or too similar to other titles.<br>
<br>
Use actual text instead of icons for menu items. It’s good for SEO (search engine optimisation) and easier for your users. Search engines can read text to figure out the most important parts of your website, which helps visitors find you, but search engines can’t read icons. Too many icons will also slow down your page speed, which is bad for SEO. Visitors might not be able to load the images quickly either. Text is always the best way to go.<br>
<br>
Be sure that there’s a clear contrast with the colours used for your navigation menu. You can use dark text on a light background, or light text on a dark background, but never dark-on-dark or lighton-light.<br>
<br>
You may also want to try different colours on your navigation links to see what users respond to. Here’s a good example why: In 2014, Google earned an extra $200 million per year by switching to a new shade of blue on advertising links that people clicked on more often.<br>
<br>
<strong>Tip #2: Understand Human Behaviour, Especially When It Comes To Interacting With Different Devices</strong><br>
<br>
People naturally look for patterns and gravitate toward what is comfortable for them. If they can’t find the menu easily, or figure out how to navigate between pages on your website, they won’t stay long.<br>
<br>
In this day and age, people are used to interacting with websites in a certain way. Try not to make things difficult for them. The good news is that basic navigation patterns haven’t changed much over the years.<br>
<br>
For example, desktop users expect to see a prominent, clearly-labelled menu on the top or the side of the page. Mobile device users expect the menu to be integrated in the app, or the responsive page design.<br>
<br>
As more people switch from desktops to mobile devices, more websites are switching to a navigation menu that is far less obvious.<br>
<br>
On mobile devices, there has been a wide adoption of the “hamburger menu,” a three-lined icon that users click on to expand the menu.<br>
<br>
Hiding your navigation menu behind a hamburger button can be hard to find, which is why some apps and websites opt instead for side bars, dropdown menus, or a tab bar at the bottom of the app screen.<br>
<br>
<strong>Tip #3: Integrate Search Functionality With Your Site</strong><br>
<br>
When all else fails, the search bar is the saving grace of navigation. Search functionality is also a great idea for websites where users will be looking for something specific instead of clicking through links.<br>
<br>
Taking steps to improve your website’s search functionality can help improve conversion rates. It can lead to happier shoppers who come back again and again. Even so, the search bar is often neglected.<br>
<br>
There are a few things you can do to make it stand out. Put text inside the box, such as “Search Here,” or an icon of a magnifying glass, to help your visitors figure out that it is a search bar instead of a newsletter sign-up form. You can also draw attention to your search bar by offsetting it in a different colour from your site’s colour scheme.<br>
<br>
The functionality of the search results page is also extremely important. Users expect their product searches to be filterable. It is no longer enough to have minimal options like size, colour, and style. Users also want to be able to search for new items, sale or clearance, and more — and filter out categories they don’t want to see.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Tip #4: Include A Sitemap On Your Website</strong><br>
<br>
A sitemap is like a directory of your website. It is a page with text links to the most important parts of your website. Sitemaps help your users navigate your website, but they are just as important for SEO. They give search engine crawlers an easy way to find pages on your site.<br>
<br>
There are two types of sitemaps: HTML and XML, and you may want both. An HTML sitemap helps a person navigate your website, with links to the most important parts of your website. An XML sitemap helps a search engine navigate your website, with links to all of the pages and information about how frequently the content is updated.</div>

<strong>How to Make Your Website Easy to Navigate</strong><br>
<br>
Not all websites are made equal. Some websites are simple, logical, and easy to use. Others are a messy hodgepodge of pages and links.<br>
<br>
Bad navigation is an especially common problem area. We’ve all struggled to find things on disorganized websites without any logical structure. It feels hopeless, like being lost in a maze with no map.<br>
<br>
Just because a website looks awesome doesn’t mean that it is easy to navigate. You can have a beautifully designed website, but if it is impossible to use, what’s the point? No one is going to sign up for a newsletter or buy any products. Search engines will be confused, too.<br>
<br>
Designing and developing good navigation is the most important part of building your website. If a website is like a house, navigation is the foundation. Just like the structural foundation of a house, you must start by building the structural foundation of your site navigation first.<br>
<br>
It can be hard to design user-friendly navigation, especially on huge websites. Just remember that simplicity is always the best approach. Also, before your website gets too big, think about how you want users to navigate around it — or things will quickly get disorganized.<br>

Too many icons will also slow down your page speed, which is bad for SEO. Visitors might not be able to load the images quickly either. Text is always the best way to go.<br>
<br>
Be sure that there’s a clear contrast with the colours used for your navigation menu. You can use dark text on a light background, or light text on a dark background, but never dark-on-dark or lighton-light.<br>
<br>
You may also want to try different colours on your navigation links to see what users respond to. Here’s a good example why: In 2014, Google earned an extra $200 million per year by switching to a new shade of blue on advertising links that people clicked on more often.<br>
<br>
<strong>Tip #2: Understand Human Behaviour, Especially When It Comes To Interacting With Different Devices</strong><br>
<br>
People naturally look for patterns and gravitate toward what is comfortable for them. If they can’t find the menu easily, or figure out how to navigate between pages on your website, they won’t stay long.<br>
<br>
In this day and age, people are used to interacting with websites in a certain way. Try not to make things difficult for them. The good news is that basic navigation patterns haven’t changed much over the years.<br>
<br>
For example, desktop users expect to see a prominent, clearly-labelled menu on the top or the side of the page. Mobile device users expect the menu to be integrated in the app, or the responsive page design.<br>
<br>
As more people switch from desktops to mobile devices, more websites are switching to a navigation menu that is far less obvious.<br>
<br>
On mobile devices, there has been a wide adoption of the “hamburger menu,” a three-lined icon that users click on to expand the menu.<br>
<br>
Hiding your navigation menu behind a hamburger button can be hard to find, which is why some apps and websites opt instead for side bars, dropdown menus, or a tab bar at the bottom of the app screen.<br>
<br>
<strong>Tip #3: Integrate Search Functionality With Your Site</strong><br>
<br>
When all else fails, the search bar is the saving grace of navigation. Search functionality is also a great idea for websites where users will be looking for something specific instead of clicking through links.<br>
<br>
Taking steps to improve your website’s search functionality can help improve conversion rates. It can lead to happier shoppers who come back again and again. Even so, the search bar is often neglected.<br>
<br>
There are a few things you can do to make it stand out. Put text inside the box, such as “Search Here,” or an icon of a magnifying glass, to help your visitors figure out that it is a search bar instead of a newsletter sign-up form. You can also draw attention to your search bar by offsetting it in a different colour from your site’s colour scheme.<br>
<br>
The functionality of the search results page is also extremely important. Users expect their product searches to be filterable. It is no longer enough to have minimal options like size, colour, and style. Users also want to be able to search for new items, sale or clearance, and more — and filter out categories they don’t want to see.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Tip #4: Include A Sitemap On Your Website</strong><br>
<br>
A sitemap is like a directory of your website. It is a page with text links to the most important parts of your website. Sitemaps help your users navigate your website, but they are just as important for SEO. They give search engine crawlers an easy way to find pages on your site.<br>
<br>
There are two types of sitemaps: HTML and XML, and you may want both. An HTML sitemap helps a person navigate your website, with links to the most important parts of your website. An XML sitemap helps a search engine navigate your website, with links to all of the pages and information about how frequently the content is updated.</div>

<br>
<br>
Come with me back in time to another era when a strange “design” life form roamed suburban Australia imposing its will on the meek, the weak and the minimal.<br>
<br>
Throughout the whole of the 1970s and 1980s, and into the 1990s, it was the Clutter People who reigned supreme. No surface in the suburban home was safe from being tarted up with a chi-chi knick-knack or curio. Fussy Victoriana furniture was all the go, especially in cedar and mahogany for hallstands, sideboards and dining-room tables – all essential furniture in the aspirational period home at this time.<br>
<br>
It was as if the Clutter People wanted to recreate 19th-century Victorian living in the late 20th century. The game was played hard: the winners were those with the most intricate of interior colour schemes and with the fussiest of brass fittings and fixtures.<br>
<br>
And on weekends Edwardian and Victorian houses across the nation were being lovingly restored – and sometimes bastardised – with burnt orange laminex in the kitchen and with grandly decorated formal rooms that invariably included a frieze. And if you don’t know what a frieze is, you were never part of the Holy Clutter People Kingdom.<br>
<br>
Then something odd happened. At some point in the mid-1990s there was a powerful tectonic shift in the design landscape. All that the Clutter People had held dear was usurped as the Minimalists arrived with their painfully pallid ways. No style, no design, no colour, just white on white and clinically-clear benchtops. All this while the Clutter People’s eyes yearned, nay, lusted for engagement with a casual curio or a formal knick-knack.<br>
<br>
“Oh yes, yes, yes” said the advancing Minimalists to the new design belief system. And “Oh no, no, no” said the retreating Clutter People as they lost ground.<br>
<br>
And there you might think the story of the Clutter People ends; a lost tribe that once supported a vast empire of antique furniture shops and curio stores. But I think the Clutter People live on, not as beaten people in a remote corner of the continent but in the homes of their enemies, the Minimalists.<br>
<br>
Ask yourself, how do the Minimalist People do it? Where do they hide the detritus of life? I have a theory. Scratch the surface of the Minimalist façade and you will find hard evidence of Clutter People behaviour. Under the knife drawer in the Minimalist kitchen there’ll be a “junk drawer”, which is a place that collects the flotsam of everyday life.<br>
<br>
But it goes further, much further. Every Minimalist house today must by law contain a junk room – a room of shame. There are things in the junk room that delicate Minimalist eyes should never witness.<br>
<br>
Cedar chairs and mahogany sideboards too good to throw out are stored in the junk room. Furniture from the 1980s that cannot survive in today’s Minimalist house must spend years in the purgatory of the junk room before being arbitrarily “disposed of”.<br>
<br>
You realise what I am saying. The Clutter People didn’t die off. They mutated and reincarnated as modern-day Minimalists.<br>
<br>
Oh, the Clutter People’s demand for clutter is still there but it is now taken to a new level. It’s the discrete and the very private clutter – the junk drawers, the junk rooms and don’t get me started on the garage – that must exist in order to create the Minimalist look.<br>
<br>
The Clutter People’s philosophy lives on in the form of Dark Clutter that is hidden from view in today’s officially clutter-free homes.<br>
<br>

Fussy Victoriana furniture was all the go, especially in cedar and mahogany for hallstands, sideboards and dining-room tables – all essential furniture in the aspirational period home at this time.<br>
<br>
It was as if the Clutter People wanted to recreate 19th-century Victorian living in the late 20th century. The game was played hard: the winners were those with the most intricate of interior colour schemes and with the fussiest of brass fittings and fixtures.<br>
<br>
And on weekends Edwardian and Victorian houses across the nation were being lovingly restored – and sometimes bastardised – with burnt orange laminex in the kitchen and with grandly decorated formal rooms that invariably included a frieze. And if you don’t know what a frieze is, you were never part of the Holy Clutter People Kingdom.<br>
<br>
Then something odd happened. At some point in the mid-1990s there was a powerful tectonic shift in the design landscape. All that the Clutter People had held dear was usurped as the Minimalists arrived with their painfully pallid ways. No style, no design, no colour, just white on white and clinically-clear benchtops. All this while the Clutter People’s eyes yearned, nay, lusted for engagement with a casual curio or a formal knick-knack.<br>
<br>
“Oh yes, yes, yes” said the advancing Minimalists to the new design belief system. And “Oh no, no, no” said the retreating Clutter People as they lost ground.<br>
<br>
And there you might think the story of the Clutter People ends; a lost tribe that once supported a vast empire of antique furniture shops and curio stores. But I think the Clutter People live on, not as beaten people in a remote corner of the continent but in the homes of their enemies, the Minimalists.<br>
<br>
Ask yourself, how do the Minimalist People do it? Where do they hide the detritus of life? I have a theory. Scratch the surface of the Minimalist façade and you will find hard evidence of Clutter People behaviour. Under the knife drawer in the Minimalist kitchen there’ll be a “junk drawer”, which is a place that collects the flotsam of everyday life.<br>
<br>
But it goes further, much further. Every Minimalist house today must by law contain a junk room – a room of shame. There are things in the junk room that delicate Minimalist eyes should never witness.<br>
<br>
Cedar chairs and mahogany sideboards too good to throw out are stored in the junk room. Furniture from the 1980s that cannot survive in today’s Minimalist house must spend years in the purgatory of the junk room before being arbitrarily “disposed of”.<br>
<br>
You realise what I am saying. The Clutter People didn’t die off. They mutated and reincarnated as modern-day Minimalists.<br>
<br>
Oh, the Clutter People’s demand for clutter is still there but it is now taken to a new level. It’s the discrete and the very private clutter – the junk drawers, the junk rooms and don’t get me started on the garage – that must exist in order to create the Minimalist look.<br>
<br>
The Clutter People’s philosophy lives on in the form of Dark Clutter that is hidden from view in today’s officially clutter-free homes.<br>

<br>
Come with me back in time to another era when a strange “design” life form roamed suburban Australia imposing its will on the meek, the weak and the minimal.<br>
<br>
Throughout the whole of the 1970s and 1980s, and into the 1990s, it was the Clutter People who reigned supreme. No surface in the suburban home was safe from being tarted up with a chi-chi knick-knack or curio. Fussy Victoriana furniture was all the go, especially in cedar and mahogany for hallstands, sideboards and dining-room tables – all essential furniture in the aspirational period home at this time.<br>

<br>
And on weekends Edwardian and Victorian houses across the nation were being lovingly restored – and sometimes bastardised – with burnt orange laminex in the kitchen and with grandly decorated formal rooms that invariably included a frieze. And if you don’t know what a frieze is, you were never part of the Holy Clutter People Kingdom.<br>
<br>
Then something odd happened. At some point in the mid-1990s there was a powerful tectonic shift in the design landscape. All that the Clutter People had held dear was usurped as the Minimalists arrived with their painfully pallid ways. No style, no design, no colour, just white on white and clinically-clear benchtops. All this while the Clutter People’s eyes yearned, nay, lusted for engagement with a casual curio or a formal knick-knack.<br>
<br>
“Oh yes, yes, yes” said the advancing Minimalists to the new design belief system. And “Oh no, no, no” said the retreating Clutter People as they lost ground.<br>
<br>
And there you might think the story of the Clutter People ends; a lost tribe that once supported a vast empire of antique furniture shops and curio stores. But I think the Clutter People live on, not as beaten people in a remote corner of the continent but in the homes of their enemies, the Minimalists.<br>

                &nbsp;Most people in the 70s, 80s and 90s led cluttered and disorganised lives, with old furniture littering their homes and decorations that were over the top. Over time, younger people rebelled against homes like this and instead took a more minimalist approach to their homes. However, like their parents and grandparents, they still struggle to resist the temptation to hold on to just a little bit of clutter.

                &nbsp;Home décor in the 70s, 80s and 90s was mostly 19<sup>th</sup> century Victorian- and Edwardianinspired. In the mid 90s, home décor shifted towards a more neutral palette, favouring whites and minimising the amount of furniture and embellishment in a home. Many homes, although bare in the visible areas, contain storage rooms and areas where clutter still gathers but can be hidden from prying eyes.

                &nbsp;Home décor trends change over time and usually occur in thirty year waves. We are currently halfway through a minimalist wave, having just come off a cluttered wave. Usually these waves occur in generations so most homes tend to reflect the youthful time period of their occupants. This explains why many grandparents have old fashioned furniture and homes whilst young people have more modern, minimalist homes.
