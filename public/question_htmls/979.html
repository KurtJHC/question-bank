How about an elephant’s back scratcher? Scientists have learned that some animals use things they find in nature as tools. These tools help them with many jobs.</p>

        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> The woodpecker finch is a bird that eats insects that live deep in the cracks of tree bark. The bird uses a small stick or a cactus thorn as a tool to reach the insects. It holds the stick or thorn in its beak and pushes out bugs to eat for supper.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> The Egyptian vulture uses stones to help it eat ostrich eggs. The eggshells are too hard for the bird to open with its beak. When the vulture finds an egg, it looks for a stone. Then the bird uses its beak to throw the stone at the egg. The vulture will throw the stone again and again until the egg cracks open. It would be hard for the Egyptian vulture to eat ostrich eggs without the aid of stones.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4 </strong></em>Stones are essential tools for other animals, too. Sea otters like to eat clams, which live inside hard shells. However, it would be difficult for sea otters to eat clams without the help of stones. First a sea otter dives into the water for a clam. Then it dives again for a stone. As the otter floats on its back in the water, it puts the stone on its chest. Then it bangs the clam against the stone until the shell cracks open. Finally the otter digs out the meat inside with its paws and eats it.</p>

        <p><em><strong>5 </strong></em>Some insects use leaves to help them get food. Scientists have studied a kind of ant that uses leaves as a shopping bag. The ants put pieces of fruit on the leaves. They use the leaves to help them carry the pieces of fruit back to their nest. The leaves soak up the juice from the fruit. Then the ants eat the fruit and the leaves, too.</p>

        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em>&nbsp;Mealtime isn’t the only time that&nbsp;animals use tools. Many animals use things around them to help solve problems throughout the day.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> The heat in Africa can cause an elephant’s skin to itch. Elephants have learned that sticks and branches are good for scratching. If an elephant has an itch, it picks up a stick with its trunk. Then it stretches its trunk over its head to scratch itself.</p>

        <p><em><strong>5 </strong></em>Some insects use leaves to help them get food. Scientists have studied a kind of ant that uses leaves as a shopping bag. The ants put pieces of fruit on the leaves. They use the leaves to help them carry the pieces of fruit back to their nest. The leaves soak up the juice from the fruit. Then the ants eat the fruit and the leaves, too.</p>

        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> The woodpecker finch is a bird that eats insects that live deep in the cracks of tree bark. The bird uses a small stick or a cactus thorn as a tool to reach the insects. It holds the stick or thorn in its beak and pushes out bugs to eat for supper.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> The Egyptian vulture uses stones to help it eat ostrich eggs. The eggshells are too hard for the bird to open with its beak. When the vulture finds an egg, it looks for a stone. Then the bird uses its beak to throw the stone at the egg. The vulture will throw the stone again and again until the egg cracks open. It would be hard for the Egyptian vulture to eat ostrich eggs without the aid of stones.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4 </strong></em>Stones are essential tools for other animals, too. Sea otters like to eat clams, which live inside hard shells. However, it would be difficult for sea otters to eat clams without the help of stones. First a sea otter dives into the water for a clam. Then it dives again for a stone. As the otter floats on its back in the water, it puts the stone on its chest. Then it bangs the clam against the stone until the shell cracks open. Finally the otter digs out the meat inside with its paws and eats it.</p>

        <p><em><strong>5 </strong></em>Some insects use leaves to help them get food. Scientists have studied a kind of ant that uses leaves as a shopping bag. The ants put pieces of fruit on the leaves. They use the leaves to help them carry the pieces of fruit back to their nest. The leaves soak up the juice from the fruit. Then the ants eat the fruit and the leaves, too.</p>

          <strong>Fossil Find</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> The rain had finally slowed down. “It’s about time,” Clay Reyna thought. This place was not like sunny California at all. He had lived on this ranch for only a few weeks, but already he didn’t like it. He hadn’t made any friends at school. All it seemed to do here was rain.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> It was Saturday afternoon, and Clay was bored. When the rain finally stopped, he decided to go outside and walk around. It had rained so hard for so long. Clay could see that water had washed away a <span class="txt-underline"><strong>layer</strong></span> of dirt. Rocks that had been covered with dirt now poked out. The top part of the ground had been washed away.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> As Clay walked along, he saw a rock with an unusual shape. He carefully dug the rock out of the ground. He had to use both hands to pick it up. It was shaped like a cone. “This looks like a shell or a giant snail,” Clay thought, “except that it’s rock.” Puzzled, he decided to take it to school on Monday. His teacher Miss Shaw could probably tell him more about it.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> “Where did you find this?” Miss Shaw asked excitedly when Clay showed her the rock at school. When he told her where he had found it, Miss Shaw’s face lit up. “May I keep this for a day or two?” she asked. “I promise to give it back.” Clay agreed.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> That night at home, the phone rang. After a few minutes Clay’s mother came into his room.</p>
        <p><strong><em>6</em></strong> “That was Miss Shaw. She wanted to know whether we would let her bring your class to our ranch on Friday,” Clay’s mother said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> “Really?” Clay asked, a little excited. It would be neat to have a field trip at his house.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “Miss Shaw said she took your rock to the college in town. She found out that the rock is really a fossil of a shell. She wants your &nbsp;class to look for more fossils. I told her we would love to have your class here,” Clay’s mother said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> The next day at school, Miss Shaw announced to the class, “I’m going to change our science lessons for this week. We’re going on a fossil hunt. Clay’s parents are going to let us look around their ranch. We’re going to look for fossils like the one Clay found. I asked the principal, and she has <span class="txt-underline"><strong>approved</strong></span> our field trip for this Friday. But before we go, I want all of you to learn more about fossils.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, Clay and his classmates studied fossils. They learned that fossils are signs of life from long ago. Fossils can be a deep print of a leaf, branch, or an animal’s foot in a rock. Fossils can also be bones or shells that have turned into rock over the years. By studying fossils, people can learn about the plants and animals that once lived on Earth. They also can learn about the changes that have occurred in weather, water, and land. These changes have taken place over many years.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> Finally it was Friday morning. Clay’s class, Miss Shaw, and several parents rode a school bus to the Reynas’ ranch. Miss Shaw picked up a stone as soon as she got off the bus. “This might have been a clam once,” she said, holding up a fat heart-shaped rock.</p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> Several students gathered around her to look at the rock. Knowing what to look for, they found three more just like it. All the students started talking and walking around together. After about an hour of searching, Clay found a piece of flat, smooth stone with what looked like a leaf printed on it. One of the other students found a gray stone with the perfect fan shape of a seashell on it.</p>
        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> Miss Shaw finally announced it was time to go. Disappointed, the students got back onto the bus. A few students approached Clay when they arrived back at school.</p>
        <p><em><strong>14</strong></em> “Do you think it would be O.K. if we came back to your ranch tomorrow?” one of the girls from Clay’s class asked. “We could look for more fossils.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>15</strong></em> Clay thought that it would be great. He nodded his head thoughtfully. Maybe this place wasn’t so bad after all.</p>

          <strong>Fossil Find</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> The rain had finally slowed down. “It’s about time,” Clay Reyna thought. This place was not like sunny California at all. He had lived on this ranch for only a few weeks, but already he didn’t like it. He hadn’t made any friends at school. All it seemed to do here was rain.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> It was Saturday afternoon, and Clay was bored. When the rain finally stopped, he decided to go outside and walk around. It had rained so hard for so long. Clay could see that water had washed away a <span class="txt-underline"><strong>layer</strong></span> of dirt. Rocks that had been covered with dirt now poked out. The top part of the ground had been washed away.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> As Clay walked along, he saw a rock with an unusual shape. He carefully dug the rock out of the ground. He had to use both hands to pick it up. It was shaped like a cone. “This looks like a shell or a giant snail,” Clay thought, “except that it’s rock.” Puzzled, he decided to take it to school on Monday. His teacher Miss Shaw could probably tell him more about it.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> “Where did you find this?” Miss Shaw asked excitedly when Clay showed her the rock at school. When he told her where he had found it, Miss Shaw’s face lit up. “May I keep this for a day or two?” she asked. “I promise to give it back.” Clay agreed.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> That night at home, the phone rang. After a few minutes Clay’s mother came into his room.</p>
        <p><strong><em>6</em></strong> “That was Miss Shaw. She wanted to know whether we would let her bring your class to our ranch on Friday,” Clay’s mother said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> “Really?” Clay asked, a little excited. It would be neat to have a field trip at his house.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “Miss Shaw said she took your rock to the college in town. She found out that the rock is really a fossil of a shell. She wants your &nbsp;class to look for more fossils. I told her we would love to have your class here,” Clay’s mother said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> The next day at school, Miss Shaw announced to the class, “I’m going to change our science lessons for this week. We’re going on a fossil hunt. Clay’s parents are going to let us look around their ranch. We’re going to look for fossils like the one Clay found. I asked the principal, and she has <span class="txt-underline"><strong>approved</strong></span> our field trip for this Friday. But before we go, I want all of you to learn more about fossils.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, Clay and his classmates studied fossils. They learned that fossils are signs of life from long ago. Fossils can be a deep print of a leaf, branch, or an animal’s foot in a rock. Fossils can also be bones or shells that have turned into rock over the years. By studying fossils, people can learn about the plants and animals that once lived on Earth. They also can learn about the changes that have occurred in weather, water, and land. These changes have taken place over many years.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> Finally it was Friday morning. Clay’s class, Miss Shaw, and several parents rode a school bus to the Reynas’ ranch. Miss Shaw picked up a stone as soon as she got off the bus. “This might have been a clam once,” she said, holding up a fat heart-shaped rock.</p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> Several students gathered around her to look at the rock. Knowing what to look for, they found three more just like it. All the students started talking and walking around together. After about an hour of searching, Clay found a piece of flat, smooth stone with what looked like a leaf printed on it. One of the other students found a gray stone with the perfect fan shape of a seashell on it.</p>
        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> Miss Shaw finally announced it was time to go. Disappointed, the students got back onto the bus. A few students approached Clay when they arrived back at school.</p>
        <p><em><strong>14</strong></em> “Do you think it would be O.K. if we came back to your ranch tomorrow?” one of the girls from Clay’s class asked. “We could look for more fossils.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>15</strong></em> Clay thought that it would be great. He nodded his head thoughtfully. Maybe this place wasn’t so bad after all.</p>

          <strong>Fossil Find</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> The rain had finally slowed down. “It’s about time,” Clay Reyna thought. This place was not like sunny California at all. He had lived on this ranch for only a few weeks, but already he didn’t like it. He hadn’t made any friends at school. All it seemed to do here was rain.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> It was Saturday afternoon, and Clay was bored. When the rain finally stopped, he decided to go outside and walk around. It had rained so hard for so long. Clay could see that water had washed away a <span class="txt-underline"><strong>layer</strong></span> of dirt. Rocks that had been covered with dirt now poked out. The top part of the ground had been washed away.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> As Clay walked along, he saw a rock with an unusual shape. He carefully dug the rock out of the ground. He had to use both hands to pick it up. It was shaped like a cone. “This looks like a shell or a giant snail,” Clay thought, “except that it’s rock.” Puzzled, he decided to take it to school on Monday. His teacher Miss Shaw could probably tell him more about it.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> “Where did you find this?” Miss Shaw asked excitedly when Clay showed her the rock at school. When he told her where he had found it, Miss Shaw’s face lit up. “May I keep this for a day or two?” she asked. “I promise to give it back.” Clay agreed.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> That night at home, the phone rang. After a few minutes Clay’s mother came into his room.</p>
        <p><strong><em>6</em></strong> “That was Miss Shaw. She wanted to know whether we would let her bring your class to our ranch on Friday,” Clay’s mother said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> “Really?” Clay asked, a little excited. It would be neat to have a field trip at his house.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “Miss Shaw said she took your rock to the college in town. She found out that the rock is really a fossil of a shell. She wants your &nbsp;class to look for more fossils. I told her we would love to have your class here,” Clay’s mother said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> The next day at school, Miss Shaw announced to the class, “I’m going to change our science lessons for this week. We’re going on a fossil hunt. Clay’s parents are going to let us look around their ranch. We’re going to look for fossils like the one Clay found. I asked the principal, and she has <span class="txt-underline"><strong>approved</strong></span> our field trip for this Friday. But before we go, I want all of you to learn more about fossils.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, Clay and his classmates studied fossils. They learned that fossils are signs of life from long ago. Fossils can be a deep print of a leaf, branch, or an animal’s foot in a rock. Fossils can also be bones or shells that have turned into rock over the years. By studying fossils, people can learn about the plants and animals that once lived on Earth. They also can learn about the changes that have occurred in weather, water, and land. These changes have taken place over many years.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> Finally it was Friday morning. Clay’s class, Miss Shaw, and several parents rode a school bus to the Reynas’ ranch. Miss Shaw picked up a stone as soon as she got off the bus. “This might have been a clam once,” she said, holding up a fat heart-shaped rock.</p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> Several students gathered around her to look at the rock. Knowing what to look for, they found three more just like it. All the students started talking and walking around together. After about an hour of searching, Clay found a piece of flat, smooth stone with what looked like a leaf printed on it. One of the other students found a gray stone with the perfect fan shape of a seashell on it.</p>
        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> Miss Shaw finally announced it was time to go. Disappointed, the students got back onto the bus. A few students approached Clay when they arrived back at school.</p>
        <p><em><strong>14</strong></em> “Do you think it would be O.K. if we came back to your ranch tomorrow?” one of the girls from Clay’s class asked. “We could look for more fossils.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>15</strong></em> Clay thought that it would be great. He nodded his head thoughtfully. Maybe this place wasn’t so bad after all.</p>

          <strong>Fossil Find</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> The rain had finally slowed down. “It’s about time,” Clay Reyna thought. This place was not like sunny California at all. He had lived on this ranch for only a few weeks, but already he didn’t like it. He hadn’t made any friends at school. All it seemed to do here was rain.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> It was Saturday afternoon, and Clay was bored. When the rain finally stopped, he decided to go outside and walk around. It had rained so hard for so long. Clay could see that water had washed away a <span class="txt-underline"><strong>layer</strong></span> of dirt. Rocks that had been covered with dirt now poked out. The top part of the ground had been washed away.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> As Clay walked along, he saw a rock with an unusual shape. He carefully dug the rock out of the ground. He had to use both hands to pick it up. It was shaped like a cone. “This looks like a shell or a giant snail,” Clay thought, “except that it’s rock.” Puzzled, he decided to take it to school on Monday. His teacher Miss Shaw could probably tell him more about it.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> “Where did you find this?” Miss Shaw asked excitedly when Clay showed her the rock at school. When he told her where he had found it, Miss Shaw’s face lit up. “May I keep this for a day or two?” she asked. “I promise to give it back.” Clay agreed.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> That night at home, the phone rang. After a few minutes Clay’s mother came into his room.</p>
        <p><strong><em>6</em></strong> “That was Miss Shaw. She wanted to know whether we would let her bring your class to our ranch on Friday,” Clay’s mother said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> “Really?” Clay asked, a little excited. It would be neat to have a field trip at his house.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “Miss Shaw said she took your rock to the college in town. She found out that the rock is really a fossil of a shell. She wants your &nbsp;class to look for more fossils. I told her we would love to have your class here,” Clay’s mother said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> The next day at school, Miss Shaw announced to the class, “I’m going to change our science lessons for this week. We’re going on a fossil hunt. Clay’s parents are going to let us look around their ranch. We’re going to look for fossils like the one Clay found. I asked the principal, and she has <span class="txt-underline"><strong>approved</strong></span> our field trip for this Friday. But before we go, I want all of you to learn more about fossils.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, Clay and his classmates studied fossils. They learned that fossils are signs of life from long ago. Fossils can be a deep print of a leaf, branch, or an animal’s foot in a rock. Fossils can also be bones or shells that have turned into rock over the years. By studying fossils, people can learn about the plants and animals that once lived on Earth. They also can learn about the changes that have occurred in weather, water, and land. These changes have taken place over many years.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> Finally it was Friday morning. Clay’s class, Miss Shaw, and several parents rode a school bus to the Reynas’ ranch. Miss Shaw picked up a stone as soon as she got off the bus. “This might have been a clam once,” she said, holding up a fat heart-shaped rock.</p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> Several students gathered around her to look at the rock. Knowing what to look for, they found three more just like it. All the students started talking and walking around together. After about an hour of searching, Clay found a piece of flat, smooth stone with what looked like a leaf printed on it. One of the other students found a gray stone with the perfect fan shape of a seashell on it.</p>
        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> Miss Shaw finally announced it was time to go. Disappointed, the students got back onto the bus. A few students approached Clay when they arrived back at school.</p>
        <p><em><strong>14</strong></em> “Do you think it would be O.K. if we came back to your ranch tomorrow?” one of the girls from Clay’s class asked. “We could look for more fossils.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>15</strong></em> Clay thought that it would be great. He nodded his head thoughtfully. Maybe this place wasn’t so bad after all.</p>

        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> “Where did you find this?” Miss Shaw asked excitedly when Clay showed her the rock at school. When he told her where he had found it, Miss Shaw’s face lit up. “May I keep this for a day or two?” she asked. “I promise to give it back.” Clay agreed.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> That night at home, the phone rang. After a few minutes Clay’s mother came into his room.</p>
        <p><strong><em>6</em></strong> “That was Miss Shaw. She wanted to know whether we would let her bring your class to our ranch on Friday,” Clay’s mother said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> “Really?” Clay asked, a little excited. It would be neat to have a field trip at his house.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “Miss Shaw said she took your rock to the college in town. She found out that the rock is really a fossil of a shell. She wants your &nbsp;class to look for more fossils. I told her we would love to have your class here,” Clay’s mother said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> The next day at school, Miss Shaw announced to the class, “I’m going to change our science lessons for this week. We’re going on a fossil hunt. Clay’s parents are going to let us look around their ranch. We’re going to look for fossils like the one Clay found. I asked the principal, and she has <span class="txt-underline"><strong>approved</strong></span> our field trip for this Friday. But before we go, I want all of you to learn more about fossils.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, Clay and his classmates studied fossils. They learned that fossils are signs of life from long ago. Fossils can be a deep print of a leaf, branch, or an animal’s foot in a rock. Fossils can also be bones or shells that have turned into rock over the years. By studying fossils, people can learn about the plants and animals that once lived on Earth. They also can learn about the changes that have occurred in weather, water, and land. These changes have taken place over many years.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> Finally it was Friday morning. Clay’s class, Miss Shaw, and several parents rode a school bus to the Reynas’ ranch. Miss Shaw picked up a stone as soon as she got off the bus. “This might have been a clam once,” she said, holding up a fat heart-shaped rock.</p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> Several students gathered around her to look at the rock. Knowing what to look for, they found three more just like it. All the students started talking and walking around together. After about an hour of searching, Clay found a piece of flat, smooth stone with what looked like a leaf printed on it. One of the other students found a gray stone with the perfect fan shape of a seashell on it.</p>
        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> Miss Shaw finally announced it was time to go. Disappointed, the students got back onto the bus. A few students approached Clay when they arrived back at school.</p>
        <p><em><strong>14</strong></em> “Do you think it would be O.K. if we came back to your ranch tomorrow?” one of the girls from Clay’s class asked. “We could look for more fossils.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>15</strong></em> Clay thought that it would be great. He nodded his head thoughtfully. Maybe this place wasn’t so bad after all.</p>

          <strong>Fossil Find</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> The rain had finally slowed down. “It’s about time,” Clay Reyna thought. This place was not like sunny California at all. He had lived on this ranch for only a few weeks, but already he didn’t like it. He hadn’t made any friends at school. All it seemed to do here was rain.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> It was Saturday afternoon, and Clay was bored. When the rain finally stopped, he decided to go outside and walk around. It had rained so hard for so long. Clay could see that water had washed away a <span class="txt-underline"><strong>layer</strong></span> of dirt. Rocks that had been covered with dirt now poked out. The top part of the ground had been washed away.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> As Clay walked along, he saw a rock with an unusual shape. He carefully dug the rock out of the ground. He had to use both hands to pick it up. It was shaped like a cone. “This looks like a shell or a giant snail,” Clay thought, “except that it’s rock.” Puzzled, he decided to take it to school on Monday. His teacher Miss Shaw could probably tell him more about it.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> “Where did you find this?” Miss Shaw asked excitedly when Clay showed her the rock at school. When he told her where he had found it, Miss Shaw’s face lit up. “May I keep this for a day or two?” she asked. “I promise to give it back.” Clay agreed.</p>

By studying fossils, people can learn about the plants and animals that once lived on Earth. They also can learn about the changes that have occurred in weather, water, and land. These changes have taken place over many years.</p>

        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> Finally it was Friday morning. Clay’s class, Miss Shaw, and several parents rode a school bus to the Reynas’ ranch. Miss Shaw picked up a stone as soon as she got off the bus. “This might have been a clam once,” she said, holding up a fat heart-shaped rock.</p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> Several students gathered around her to look at the rock. Knowing what to look for, they found three more just like it. All the students started talking and walking around together. After about an hour of searching, Clay found a piece of flat, smooth stone with what looked like a leaf printed on it. One of the other students found a gray stone with the perfect fan shape of a seashell on it.</p>
        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> Miss Shaw finally announced it was time to go. Disappointed, the students got back onto the bus. A few students approached Clay when they arrived back at school.</p>
        <p><em><strong>14</strong></em> “Do you think it would be O.K. if we came back to your ranch tomorrow?” one of the girls from Clay’s class asked. “We could look for more fossils.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>15</strong></em> Clay thought that it would be great. He nodded his head thoughtfully. Maybe this place wasn’t so bad after all.</p>

          <strong>Fossil Find</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> The rain had finally slowed down. “It’s about time,” Clay Reyna thought. This place was not like sunny California at all. He had lived on this ranch for only a few weeks, but already he didn’t like it. He hadn’t made any friends at school. All it seemed to do here was rain.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> It was Saturday afternoon, and Clay was bored. When the rain finally stopped, he decided to go outside and walk around. It had rained so hard for so long. Clay could see that water had washed away a <span class="txt-underline"><strong>layer</strong></span> of dirt. Rocks that had been covered with dirt now poked out. The top part of the ground had been washed away.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> As Clay walked along, he saw a rock with an unusual shape. He carefully dug the rock out of the ground. He had to use both hands to pick it up. It was shaped like a cone. “This looks like a shell or a giant snail,” Clay thought, “except that it’s rock.” Puzzled, he decided to take it to school on Monday. His teacher Miss Shaw could probably tell him more about it.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> “Where did you find this?” Miss Shaw asked excitedly when Clay showed her the rock at school. When he told her where he had found it, Miss Shaw’s face lit up. “May I keep this for a day or two?” she asked. “I promise to give it back.” Clay agreed.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> That night at home, the phone rang. After a few minutes Clay’s mother came into his room.</p>
        <p><strong><em>6</em></strong> “That was Miss Shaw. She wanted to know whether we would let her bring your class to our ranch on Friday,” Clay’s mother said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> “Really?” Clay asked, a little excited. It would be neat to have a field trip at his house.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “Miss Shaw said she took your rock to the college in town. She found out that the rock is really a fossil of a shell. She wants your &nbsp;class to look for more fossils. I told her we would love to have your class here,” Clay’s mother said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> The next day at school, Miss Shaw announced to the class, “I’m going to change our science lessons for this week. We’re going on a fossil hunt. Clay’s parents are going to let us look around their ranch. We’re going to look for fossils like the one Clay found. I asked the principal, and she has <span class="txt-underline"><strong>approved</strong></span> our field trip for this Friday. But before we go, I want all of you to learn more about fossils.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, Clay and his classmates studied fossils. They learned that fossils are signs of life from long ago. Fossils can be a deep print of a leaf, branch, or an animal’s foot in a rock. Fossils can also be bones or shells that have turned into rock over the years.
