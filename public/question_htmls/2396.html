          <strong>Ice Hockey</strong>

          <strong>History</strong>
        </p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Exactly when and where hockey was invented is not known. As long ago as 500 B.C., the Greeks played a <span class="txt-underline">version</span> of it. Iroquois Indians living in the St. Lawrence River valley in eastern Canada during the 1700s liked to hit hard balls along the ground with sticks. When players got hit by shots, they’d yell “Ho-gee!” That meant, “It hurts!”</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Ice hockey as it is known today might have begun in England during the 1850s. Field hockey was popular during the warm-weather months. In winter, kids played the game on ice. In the United States, an ice game called <em>shinny</em> was popular. Players controlled a ball with a stick, avoided defenders, and scored by shooting the ball between two piles of stones placed four or five feet apart.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Ice hockey became very popular in Canada in the late 1800s. During the long, cold winters, thousands of kids played on frozen ponds. They used field hockey sticks to shoot <em>pucks</em> made from pieces of wood, tin cans, or even chunks of frozen horse manure! Boards were placed around the ice to keep the puck in play. The playing area became known as a <em>rink</em>, which is the Scottish word for course.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Early hockey games were wild and disorganized. Sometimes there were as many as 30 players on each team. Rules were changed or added as years went by. By the 1890s, organized leagues and teams were playing across Canada and in the northern United States. Ice hockey is now a major sport in North America, Europe, Scandinavia, and the countries that once made up the Soviet Union. . . .</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Organized Hockey</strong>
        </p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The first ice hockey league was formed in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, in 1885. Ten years later, there were leagues all over Canada. Montreal had more than 100 teams!</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In 1892, Canada’s governor general, Lord Stanley of Preston, decided that a trophy should be awarded to the best team each year. He paid $48.50 for a silver bowl that is now the “Stanley Cup.” When the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association club won the Amateur Hockey Association championship in 1893, it was the first team to win the Cup.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States, the first league was formed in 1896. It was based in New York City and had four teams. All the players were amateurs. It wasn’t until 1904 that a professional league was created: the International Pro Hockey League (IPHL). Based in Michigan, it attracted top American and Canadian players, who were paid $500 to $1,000 per game.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The IPHL went out of business in 1907, but other pro leagues popped up during the next 10 years. One of them, the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), did a lot to influence the way the game is played today. The PCHA was founded by Joseph Patrick and his sons, Frank and Lester. They were the first to put numbers on players’ sweaters, use blue lines on the ice, and keep records of goals and assists. They also created a championship playoff series.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Teams from the PCHA and the National Hockey Association (NHA) played for the Stanley Cup from 1910 until the PCHA went out of business in 1926. In 1917, the NHA became the National Hockey League (NHL).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>The NHL</strong>
        </p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The NHL began with four teams in Canada. They included the Montreal Canadiens and Toronto Arenas, who were later renamed the “Maple Leafs.” Montreal and Toronto are the NHL’s oldest teams. In 1924, the Boston Bruins became the NHL’s first team in the United States. Two years later, the New York Rangers, Chicago Blackhawks, and Detroit Red Wings joined the league.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;From 1942 to 1967, the NHL had only those six teams. Nearly all the players were from Canada and few people outside of the northern parts of the United States cared much about hockey. However, much has changed over the past 27 years. The NHL now has 26 teams, with some in such southern locations as Dallas, Miami, and Tampa Bay. American players such as defenseman Brian Leetch of the New York Rangers have become stars. So have top players from countries such as Sweden, Finland, and Russia.</p>

          <strong>History</strong>
        </p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Exactly when and where hockey was invented is not known. As long ago as 500 B.C., the Greeks played a <span class="txt-underline">version</span> of it. Iroquois Indians living in the St. Lawrence River valley in eastern Canada during the 1700s liked to hit hard balls along the ground with sticks. When players got hit by shots, they’d yell “Ho-gee!” That meant, “It hurts!”</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Ice hockey as it is known today might have begun in England during the 1850s. Field hockey was popular during the warm-weather months. In winter, kids played the game on ice. In the United States, an ice game called <em>shinny</em> was popular. Players controlled a ball with a stick, avoided defenders, and scored by shooting the ball between two piles of stones placed four or five feet apart.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Ice hockey became very popular in Canada in the late 1800s. During the long, cold winters, thousands of kids played on frozen ponds. They used field hockey sticks to shoot <em>pucks</em> made from pieces of wood, tin cans, or even chunks of frozen horse manure! Boards were placed around the ice to keep the puck in play. The playing area became known as a <em>rink</em>, which is the Scottish word for course.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Early hockey games were wild and disorganized. Sometimes there were as many as 30 players on each team. Rules were changed or added as years went by. By the 1890s, organized leagues and teams were playing across Canada and in the northern United States. Ice hockey is now a major sport in North America, Europe, Scandinavia, and the countries that once made up the Soviet Union. . . .</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Organized Hockey</strong>
        </p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The first ice hockey league was formed in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, in 1885. Ten years later, there were leagues all over Canada. Montreal had more than 100 teams!</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In 1892, Canada’s governor general, Lord Stanley of Preston, decided that a trophy should be awarded to the best team each year. He paid $48.50 for a silver bowl that is now the “Stanley Cup.” When the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association club won the Amateur Hockey Association championship in 1893, it was the first team to win the Cup.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States, the first league was formed in 1896. It was based in New York City and had four teams. All the players were amateurs. It wasn’t until 1904 that a professional league was created: the International Pro Hockey League (IPHL). Based in Michigan, it attracted top American and Canadian players, who were paid $500 to $1,000 per game.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The IPHL went out of business in 1907, but other pro leagues popped up during the next 10 years. One of them, the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), did a lot to influence the way the game is played today. The PCHA was founded by Joseph Patrick and his sons, Frank and Lester. They were the first to put numbers on players’ sweaters, use blue lines on the ice, and keep records of goals and assists. They also created a championship playoff series.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Teams from the PCHA and the National Hockey Association (NHA) played for the Stanley Cup from 1910 until the PCHA went out of business in 1926. In 1917, the NHA became the National Hockey League (NHL).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>The NHL</strong>
        </p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The NHL began with four teams in Canada. They included the Montreal Canadiens and Toronto Arenas, who were later renamed the “Maple Leafs.” Montreal and Toronto are the NHL’s oldest teams. In 1924, the Boston Bruins became the NHL’s first team in the United States. Two years later, the New York Rangers, Chicago Blackhawks, and Detroit Red Wings joined the league.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;From 1942 to 1967, the NHL had only those six teams. Nearly all the players were from Canada and few people outside of the northern parts of the United States cared much about hockey. However, much has changed over the past 27 years. The NHL now has 26 teams, with some in such southern locations as Dallas, Miami, and Tampa Bay. American players such as defenseman Brian Leetch of the New York Rangers have become stars. So have top players from countries such as Sweden, Finland, and Russia.</p>

        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; THE BUFFALO no longer wandered the prairie, and the grass was wilted and brown. The streams no longer ran full and deep. In the glare of the sun, the parched earth lay burning, for drought had come into the country of the Blackfoot, and with the drought came famine. Many miles wandered the hunters in search of game, only to return empty handed and with <span class="txt-underline">waning</span> strength. Bad days had come to the Blackfoot nation and powerful ceremonies were to be held in the hope of securing relief.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Along the shore of a well-loved lake, two medicine lodges had been built, and here the ceremonies were carried on. Chants were sung and accompanied with elaborate ritual. At last these earnest prayers were heard by Old Man. Through His spirit helpers, He sent word to the suffering nation that they must send seven of their oldest and wisest men to the top of the mountain where the Wind Spirit lived. (Chief Mountain.) It was the Wind Spirit who was causing the drought, and it was he who must be appeased.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;And so the seven were selected and sent forth to climb the steep mountain to its summit. But when they reached the top, the Wind Spirit was such an awe-inspiring person that their hearts failed them and they turned and fled in fear. Therefore the drought continued, the suffering increased, and the Blackfoot were in desperate straits.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Now Old Man sent word again—this time that fourteen of the young warriors must journey to the home of the Wind Spirit. The fourteen bravest were selected—those who had earned many of the hard-won eagle plumes and whose deeds were most often recounted about the evening camp fires. They made their way up the trail until they, too, stood upon the mountain crest.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Wind Spirit waited in the door of his lodge, dreadful to behold. But these were warriors, tried and true, and though they were fearful they were brave as well. They gave no sign of weakness but drew nearer until they could reach out and touch the robe of this Mighty One.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Their courage pleased the Wind Spirit greatly. He sent them home with these words to carry to their people. “Now am I sure that the Blackfoot are a nation of men and deserving of my favor.” He brought forth the life-giving rains and poured them down upon the parched land, drenching the earth with the cool, sweet water.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When the young men reached the lake shore, they found the grass growing thick and green, the streams replenished, and the buffalo returned. From that day forth there was happiness and prosperity where dwelt the bands of the Blackfoot nation.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; THE BUFFALO no longer wandered the prairie, and the grass was wilted and brown. The streams no longer ran full and deep. In the glare of the sun, the parched earth lay burning, for drought had come into the country of the Blackfoot, and with the drought came famine. Many miles wandered the hunters in search of game, only to return empty handed and with <span class="txt-underline">waning</span> strength. Bad days had come to the Blackfoot nation and powerful ceremonies were to be held in the hope of securing relief.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Along the shore of a well-loved lake, two medicine lodges had been built, and here the ceremonies were carried on. Chants were sung and accompanied with elaborate ritual. At last these earnest prayers were heard by Old Man. Through His spirit helpers, He sent word to the suffering nation that they must send seven of their oldest and wisest men to the top of the mountain where the Wind Spirit lived. (Chief Mountain.) It was the Wind Spirit who was causing the drought, and it was he who must be appeased.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;And so the seven were selected and sent forth to climb the steep mountain to its summit. But when they reached the top, the Wind Spirit was such an awe-inspiring person that their hearts failed them and they turned and fled in fear. Therefore the drought continued, the suffering increased, and the Blackfoot were in desperate straits.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Now Old Man sent word again—this time that fourteen of the young warriors must journey to the home of the Wind Spirit. The fourteen bravest were selected—those who had earned many of the hard-won eagle plumes and whose deeds were most often recounted about the evening camp fires. They made their way up the trail until they, too, stood upon the mountain crest.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Wind Spirit waited in the door of his lodge, dreadful to behold. But these were warriors, tried and true, and though they were fearful they were brave as well. They gave no sign of weakness but drew nearer until they could reach out and touch the robe of this Mighty One.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Their courage pleased the Wind Spirit greatly. He sent them home with these words to carry to their people. “Now am I sure that the Blackfoot are a nation of men and deserving of my favor.” He brought forth the life-giving rains and poured them down upon the parched land, drenching the earth with the cool, sweet water.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When the young men reached the lake shore, they found the grass growing thick and green, the streams replenished, and the buffalo returned. From that day forth there was happiness and prosperity where dwelt the bands of the Blackfoot nation.</p>
