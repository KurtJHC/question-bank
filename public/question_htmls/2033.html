        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Apollo 13: The moon-mission that dodged disaster&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Apollo 13 was NASA's third moon-landing mission, but the astronauts never made it to the lunar surface. An oxygen tank explosion almost 56 hours into the flight forced the crew to abandon all thoughts of reaching the moon. The spacecraft was damaged, but the crew were able to seek cramped shelter in the lunar module for the trip back to Earth, before returning to the command module for an uncomfortable splashdown. <strong>15 ………. </strong>It also illustrates NASA's innovative mind’s ability to work together to save lives on the fly. The Apollo 13 mission celebrates its 50th anniversary this year on April 11.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Apollo 13 astronauts were commander James Lovell, lunar module pilot Fred Haise and command module pilot John "Jack" Swigert. Apollo 13 launched on April 11, 1970. The Apollo spacecraft was made up of two independent spacecrafts joined by a tunnel: orbiter Odyssey and lander Aquarius. The crew lived in Odyssey on the journey to the moon. <strong>16 ………. </strong>Mission controller, Sy Liebergot then saw a low-pressure warning signal on a hydrogen tank in Odyssey. The signal could have shown a problem or could have indicated the hydrogen just needed to be resettled by heating and fanning the gas inside the tank. That procedure was called a "cryo stir," and was supposed to stop the supercold gas from settling into layers.</p>
        <p>Swigert flipped the switch for the routine procedure. A moment later, the entire spacecraft shook. Alarm lights lit up in Odyssey and in Mission Control as oxygen pressure fell and power disappeared. The crew notified Mission Control, with Swigert famously saying, "Houston, we've had a problem." (Note that the 1995 movie "Apollo 13" took some creative license with the phrase, changing it to "Houston, we have a problem," and having the words come out of Apollo 13 commander James Lovell's mouth.) Much later, a NASA accident investigation board determined wires were exposed in the oxygen tank because of a combination of manufacturing and testing errors before flight. <strong>17 ………. </strong>It ripped apart one oxygen tank and damaged another inside the spacecraft. Since oxygen fed Odyssey's fuel cells, power was reduced as well. The spacecraft's attitude control thrusters, sensing the venting oxygen, tried to stabilise the spacecraft through firing small jets. The system wasn't very successful given several of the jets were slammed shut by the explosion.</p>
        <p>Fortunately for Apollo 13, the damaged Odyssey had a healthy backup. It was Aquarius, which wasn't supposed to be turned on until the crew was close to landing on the moon. Haise and Lovell frantically worked to boot Aquarius up in less time than designed. <strong>18 ………. </strong>So, as Lovell and Haise got the lunar module up and running, Swigert remained in Odyssey to shut down its systems to conserve power for splashdown.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The crew had to balance the challenge of getting home with the challenge of preserving power on Aquarius. After they performed a crucial burn to point the spacecraft back towards Earth, the crew powered down every nonessential system in the spacecraft. Without a source of heat, cabin temperatures quickly dropped down close to freezing. Some food became inedible. The crew also rationed water to make sure Aquarius — operating for longer than it was designed — would have enough liquid to cool its hardware down. <strong>19 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>On Earth, flight director Gene Kranz pulled his shift of controllers off regular rotation to focus on managing consumables like water and power. Other mission control teams helped the crew with its daily activities. Spacecraft manufacturers worked around the clock to support NASA and the crew. It was a rough journey home. The entire spaceflight crew lost weight and Haise developed a kidney infection. But the small vessel protected and carried the crew long enough to reach Earth's atmosphere. In the hours before splashdown, the exhausted crew scrambled back over to the Odyssey and powered it up. <strong>20 ………. </strong>However, thanks to safeguards put in place after the Apollo 1 disaster, there were no issues. Lovell, Haise and Swigert splashed down safely in the Pacific Ocean near Samoa, on April 17.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>Apollo 13: The moon-mission that dodged disaster&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Apollo 13 was NASA's third moon-landing mission, but the astronauts never made it to the lunar surface. An oxygen tank explosion almost 56 hours into the flight forced the crew to abandon all thoughts of reaching the moon. The spacecraft was damaged, but the crew were able to seek cramped shelter in the lunar module for the trip back to Earth, before returning to the command module for an uncomfortable splashdown. <strong>15 ………. </strong>It also illustrates NASA's innovative mind’s ability to work together to save lives on the fly. The Apollo 13 mission celebrates its 50th anniversary this year on April 11.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Apollo 13 astronauts were commander James Lovell, lunar module pilot Fred Haise and command module pilot John "Jack" Swigert. Apollo 13 launched on April 11, 1970. The Apollo spacecraft was made up of two independent spacecrafts joined by a tunnel: orbiter Odyssey and lander Aquarius. The crew lived in Odyssey on the journey to the moon. <strong>16 ………. </strong>Mission controller, Sy Liebergot then saw a low-pressure warning signal on a hydrogen tank in Odyssey. The signal could have shown a problem or could have indicated the hydrogen just needed to be resettled by heating and fanning the gas inside the tank. That procedure was called a "cryo stir," and was supposed to stop the supercold gas from settling into layers.</p>
        <p>Swigert flipped the switch for the routine procedure. A moment later, the entire spacecraft shook. Alarm lights lit up in Odyssey and in Mission Control as oxygen pressure fell and power disappeared. The crew notified Mission Control, with Swigert famously saying, "Houston, we've had a problem." (Note that the 1995 movie "Apollo 13" took some creative license with the phrase, changing it to "Houston, we have a problem," and having the words come out of Apollo 13 commander James Lovell's mouth.) Much later, a NASA accident investigation board determined wires were exposed in the oxygen tank because of a combination of manufacturing and testing errors before flight. <strong>17 ………. </strong>It ripped apart one oxygen tank and damaged another inside the spacecraft. Since oxygen fed Odyssey's fuel cells, power was reduced as well. The spacecraft's attitude control thrusters, sensing the venting oxygen, tried to stabilise the spacecraft through firing small jets. The system wasn't very successful given several of the jets were slammed shut by the explosion.</p>
        <p>Fortunately for Apollo 13, the damaged Odyssey had a healthy backup. It was Aquarius, which wasn't supposed to be turned on until the crew was close to landing on the moon. Haise and Lovell frantically worked to boot Aquarius up in less time than designed. <strong>18 ………. </strong>So, as Lovell and Haise got the lunar module up and running, Swigert remained in Odyssey to shut down its systems to conserve power for splashdown.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The crew had to balance the challenge of getting home with the challenge of preserving power on Aquarius. After they performed a crucial burn to point the spacecraft back towards Earth, the crew powered down every nonessential system in the spacecraft. Without a source of heat, cabin temperatures quickly dropped down close to freezing. Some food became inedible. The crew also rationed water to make sure Aquarius — operating for longer than it was designed — would have enough liquid to cool its hardware down. <strong>19 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>On Earth, flight director Gene Kranz pulled his shift of controllers off regular rotation to focus on managing consumables like water and power. Other mission control teams helped the crew with its daily activities. Spacecraft manufacturers worked around the clock to support NASA and the crew. It was a rough journey home. The entire spaceflight crew lost weight and Haise developed a kidney infection. But the small vessel protected and carried the crew long enough to reach Earth's atmosphere. In the hours before splashdown, the exhausted crew scrambled back over to the Odyssey and powered it up. <strong>20 ………. </strong>However, thanks to safeguards put in place after the Apollo 1 disaster, there were no issues. Lovell, Haise and Swigert splashed down safely in the Pacific Ocean near Samoa, on April 17.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Apollo 13: The moon-mission that dodged disaster&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
Apollo 13 was NASA's third moon-landing mission, but the astronauts never made it to the lunar surface. An oxygen tank explosion almost 56 hours into the flight forced the crew to abandon all thoughts of reaching the moon. The spacecraft was damaged, but the crew were able to seek cramped shelter in the lunar module for the trip back to Earth, before returning to the command module for an uncomfortable splashdown. <strong>15 ………. </strong>It also illustrates NASA's innovative mind’s ability to work together to save lives on the fly. The Apollo 13 mission celebrates its 50th anniversary this year on April 11.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Apollo 13 astronauts were commander James Lovell, lunar module pilot Fred Haise and command module pilot John "Jack" Swigert. Apollo 13 launched on April 11, 1970. The Apollo spacecraft was made up of two independent spacecrafts joined by a tunnel: orbiter Odyssey and lander Aquarius. The crew lived in Odyssey on the journey to the moon. <strong>16 ………. </strong>Mission controller, Sy Liebergot then saw a low-pressure warning signal on a hydrogen tank in Odyssey. The signal could have shown a problem or could have indicated the hydrogen just needed to be resettled by heating and fanning the gas inside the tank. That procedure was called a "cryo stir," and was supposed to stop the supercold gas from settling into layers.</p>
        <p>Swigert flipped the switch for the routine procedure. A moment later, the entire spacecraft shook. Alarm lights lit up in Odyssey and in Mission Control as oxygen pressure fell and power disappeared. The crew notified Mission Control, with Swigert famously saying, "Houston, we've had a problem." (Note that the 1995 movie "Apollo 13" took some creative license with the phrase, changing it to "Houston, we have a problem," and having the words come out of Apollo 13 commander James Lovell's mouth.) Much later, a NASA accident investigation board determined wires were exposed in the oxygen tank because of a combination of manufacturing and testing errors before flight. <strong>17 ………. </strong>It ripped apart one oxygen tank and damaged another inside the spacecraft. Since oxygen fed Odyssey's fuel cells, power was reduced as well. The spacecraft's attitude control thrusters, sensing the venting oxygen, tried to stabilise the spacecraft through firing small jets. The system wasn't very successful given several of the jets were slammed shut by the explosion.</p>
        <p>Fortunately for Apollo 13, the damaged Odyssey had a healthy backup. It was Aquarius, which wasn't supposed to be turned on until the crew was close to landing on the moon. Haise and Lovell frantically worked to boot Aquarius up in less time than designed. <strong>18 ………. </strong>So, as Lovell and Haise got the lunar module up and running, Swigert remained in Odyssey to shut down its systems to conserve power for splashdown.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The crew had to balance the challenge of getting home with the challenge of preserving power on Aquarius. After they performed a crucial burn to point the spacecraft back towards Earth, the crew powered down every nonessential system in the spacecraft. Without a source of heat, cabin temperatures quickly dropped down close to freezing. Some food became inedible. The crew also rationed water to make sure Aquarius — operating for longer than it was designed — would have enough liquid to cool its hardware down. <strong>19 ……….&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>On Earth, flight director Gene Kranz pulled his shift of controllers off regular rotation to focus on managing consumables like water and power. Other mission control teams helped the crew with its daily activities. Spacecraft manufacturers worked around the clock to support NASA and the crew. It was a rough journey home. The entire spaceflight crew lost weight and Haise developed a kidney infection. But the small vessel protected and carried the crew long enough to reach Earth's atmosphere. In the hours before splashdown, the exhausted crew scrambled back over to the Odyssey and powered it up. <strong>20 ………. </strong>However, thanks to safeguards put in place after the Apollo 1 disaster, there were no issues. Lovell, Haise and Swigert splashed down safely in the Pacific Ocean near Samoa, on April 17.</p>

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
There’s no doubt about it - Australia is a big country. Hopping on a guided tour is certainly a stress-free way to see the highlights, but there are benefits to taking your itinerary into your own hands. Leave the crowds behind and seek out adventure by heading to some of the best ‘undiscovered’ parts of the country. These hidden gems will reward your efforts with awe inspiring landscapes, wildlife, star-filled skies and a chance to connect with nature in a way that few get to experience.<br>
<br>
The Grampians National Park is just three hours from Melbourne, yet feels worlds away. The area is famous for quality red wines, hiking trails and Aboriginal history. The craggy peaks and rocky gorges of South Australia’s Flinders Ranges require a five-hour road trip from Adelaide, but are well worth the journey. Explore the 100 kilometre crater that is Wilpena Pound, taste kangaroo and emu at an outback pub and glamp under the stars at Arkaba Station. Or you could head off road. There are just some places that a tour bus can’t go. The Great Beach Drive, a 200 kilometre wave-washed highway on the Sunshine Coast, is the perfect example of an incredible experience you can only have by hopping behind the wheel. You'll need a 4WD and a sense of adventure, but you’ll never forget the feeling of sand beneath your wheels as the waves crash just metres away.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Even after the sun goes down there’s plenty to see and do around Uluru in the NSW outback. The award-winning exhibition Field of Light is available to enjoy and experience. The outdoor installation, aptly named Tili Wiru Tjuta Nyakutjaku or ‘looking at lots of beautiful lights’ in local Pitjantjatjara, sees more than 50,000 solar-powered stems light up at sunset and glow throughout the night. In keeping with the desert’s vast scale, the brightly coloured light stems cover an area the size of four football fields. Explore it on your own or join a tour to see the sunset over the twinkling lights.<br>
<br>
A visit to the Red Centre wouldn’t be complete without experiencing this iconic Australian landmark. But there’s more than one way to see it. While many people choose to walk the 10 kilometres around the base of Uluru, there are countless other ways you can take it all in. Perhaps one of the most memorable is a scenic helicopter flight which will allow you to truly appreciate the full scale of Uluru and Kata Tjuta. If you’re more comfortable on the ground you can hop on a segway to cruise around the base, ride a camel at sunset or even take a motorcycle ride through the desert for a fun and exciting way to experience this sacred spot.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Have an Australian seafood adventure, from ocean to plate. Australia is home to some of the world’s most pristine waters – one major reason why Australian seafood has a global reputation for excellence. If you’re keen to sample some of Australia’s best seafood, start at Sydney Fish Market - an iconic local attraction in Sydney where visitors flock daily to see the bountiful supplies of fresh fish. Alternatively, head to nearby restaurants like multiaward-winning Saint Peter, which showcases Australia’s sustainable approach to sourcing and eating local delicacies like marron and Sydney rock oysters.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
On Tasmania’s beautiful eastern coast, at luxury lodge Saffire Freycinet or Freycinet Marine Farm, you can even pluck your own oysters and eat them directly from the sea. Or head to the Kimberley to experience the traditional hunt for mud crab with Indigenous custodian, Brian Lee.<br>

“Australians are very unfair in this way. They spend half of any conversation insisting that the country's dangers are vastly overrated and that there's nothing to worry about, and the other half telling you how six months ago their Uncle Bob was driving near Mudgee when a tiger snake slid out from under the dashboard and bit him on the groin, but that it's okay now because he's off the life support machine and they've discovered he can communicate with eye blinks.” … “As the saying goes, it takes all kinds to make the world go around, though perhaps some shouldn't go quite so far around it as others.” … “The people are immensely likable— cheerful, extrovert, quick-witted and unfailingly obliging. Their cities are safe and clean and nearly always built on water. They have a society that is prosperous, well ordered and instinctively egalitarian. The food is excellent. The sun nearly always shines. There is coffee on every corner. Life doesn't get much better than this.” - Bill Bryson, In a Sunburned Country<br>

You'll need a 4WD and a sense of adventure, but you’ll never forget the feeling of sand beneath your wheels as the waves crash just metres away.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Even after the sun goes down there’s plenty to see and do around Uluru in the NSW outback. The award-winning exhibition Field of Light is available to enjoy and experience. The outdoor installation, aptly named Tili Wiru Tjuta Nyakutjaku or ‘looking at lots of beautiful lights’ in local Pitjantjatjara, sees more than 50,000 solar-powered stems light up at sunset and glow throughout the night. In keeping with the desert’s vast scale, the brightly coloured light stems cover an area the size of four football fields. Explore it on your own or join a tour to see the sunset over the twinkling lights.<br>
<br>
A visit to the Red Centre wouldn’t be complete without experiencing this iconic Australian landmark. But there’s more than one way to see it. While many people choose to walk the 10 kilometres around the base of Uluru, there are countless other ways you can take it all in. Perhaps one of the most memorable is a scenic helicopter flight which will allow you to truly appreciate the full scale of Uluru and Kata Tjuta. If you’re more comfortable on the ground you can hop on a segway to cruise around the base, ride a camel at sunset or even take a motorcycle ride through the desert for a fun and exciting way to experience this sacred spot.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Have an Australian seafood adventure, from ocean to plate. Australia is home to some of the world’s most pristine waters – one major reason why Australian seafood has a global reputation for excellence. If you’re keen to sample some of Australia’s best seafood, start at Sydney Fish Market - an iconic local attraction in Sydney where visitors flock daily to see the bountiful supplies of fresh fish. Alternatively, head to nearby restaurants like multiaward-winning Saint Peter, which showcases Australia’s sustainable approach to sourcing and eating local delicacies like marron and Sydney rock oysters.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
On Tasmania’s beautiful eastern coast, at luxury lodge Saffire Freycinet or Freycinet Marine Farm, you can even pluck your own oysters and eat them directly from the sea. Or head to the Kimberley to experience the traditional hunt for mud crab with Indigenous custodian, Brian Lee.<br>

“Australians are very unfair in this way. They spend half of any conversation insisting that the country's dangers are vastly overrated and that there's nothing to worry about, and the other half telling you how six months ago their Uncle Bob was driving near Mudgee when a tiger snake slid out from under the dashboard and bit him on the groin, but that it's okay now because he's off the life support machine and they've discovered he can communicate with eye blinks.” … “As the saying goes, it takes all kinds to make the world go around, though perhaps some shouldn't go quite so far around it as others.” … “The people are immensely likable— cheerful, extrovert, quick-witted and unfailingly obliging. Their cities are safe and clean and nearly always built on water. They have a society that is prosperous, well ordered and instinctively egalitarian. The food is excellent. The sun nearly always shines. There is coffee on every corner. Life doesn't get much better than this.” - Bill Bryson, In a Sunburned Country<br>

There’s no doubt about it - Australia is a big country. Hopping on a guided tour is certainly a stress-free way to see the highlights, but there are benefits to taking your itinerary into your own hands. Leave the crowds behind and seek out adventure by heading to some of the best ‘undiscovered’ parts of the country. These hidden gems will reward your efforts with awe inspiring landscapes, wildlife, star-filled skies and a chance to connect with nature in a way that few get to experience.<br>
<br>
The Grampians National Park is just three hours from Melbourne, yet feels worlds away. The area is famous for quality red wines, hiking trails and Aboriginal history. The craggy peaks and rocky gorges of South Australia’s Flinders Ranges require a five-hour road trip from Adelaide, but are well worth the journey. Explore the 100 kilometre crater that is Wilpena Pound, taste kangaroo and emu at an outback pub and glamp under the stars at Arkaba Station. Or you could head off road.

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
There’s no doubt about it - Australia is a big country. Hopping on a guided tour is certainly a stress-free way to see the highlights, but there are benefits to taking your itinerary into your own hands. Leave the crowds behind and seek out adventure by heading to some of the best ‘undiscovered’ parts of the country. These hidden gems will reward your efforts with awe inspiring landscapes, wildlife, star-filled skies and a chance to connect with nature in a way that few get to experience.<br>
<br>
The Grampians National Park is just three hours from Melbourne, yet feels worlds away. The area is famous for quality red wines, hiking trails and Aboriginal history. The craggy peaks and rocky gorges of South Australia’s Flinders Ranges require a five-hour road trip from Adelaide, but are well worth the journey. Explore the 100 kilometre crater that is Wilpena Pound, taste kangaroo and emu at an outback pub and glamp under the stars at Arkaba Station. Or you could head off road. There are just some places that a tour bus can’t go. The Great Beach Drive, a 200 kilometre wave-washed highway on the Sunshine Coast, is the perfect example of an incredible experience you can only have by hopping behind the wheel. You'll need a 4WD and a sense of adventure, but you’ll never forget the feeling of sand beneath your wheels as the waves crash just metres away.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Even after the sun goes down there’s plenty to see and do around Uluru in the NSW outback. The award-winning exhibition Field of Light is available to enjoy and experience. The outdoor installation, aptly named Tili Wiru Tjuta Nyakutjaku or ‘looking at lots of beautiful lights’ in local Pitjantjatjara, sees more than 50,000 solar-powered stems light up at sunset and glow throughout the night. In keeping with the desert’s vast scale, the brightly coloured light stems cover an area the size of four football fields. Explore it on your own or join a tour to see the sunset over the twinkling lights.<br>
<br>
A visit to the Red Centre wouldn’t be complete without experiencing this iconic Australian landmark. But there’s more than one way to see it. While many people choose to walk the 10 kilometres around the base of Uluru, there are countless other ways you can take it all in. Perhaps one of the most memorable is a scenic helicopter flight which will allow you to truly appreciate the full scale of Uluru and Kata Tjuta. If you’re more comfortable on the ground you can hop on a segway to cruise around the base, ride a camel at sunset or even take a motorcycle ride through the desert for a fun and exciting way to experience this sacred spot.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Have an Australian seafood adventure, from ocean to plate. Australia is home to some of the world’s most pristine waters – one major reason why Australian seafood has a global reputation for excellence. If you’re keen to sample some of Australia’s best seafood, start at Sydney Fish Market - an iconic local attraction in Sydney where visitors flock daily to see the bountiful supplies of fresh fish. Alternatively, head to nearby restaurants like multiaward-winning Saint Peter, which showcases Australia’s sustainable approach to sourcing and eating local delicacies like marron and Sydney rock oysters.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
On Tasmania’s beautiful eastern coast, at luxury lodge Saffire Freycinet or Freycinet Marine Farm, you can even pluck your own oysters and eat them directly from the sea. Or head to the Kimberley to experience the traditional hunt for mud crab with Indigenous custodian, Brian Lee.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
“Australians are very unfair in this way. They spend half of any conversation insisting that the country's dangers are vastly overrated and that there's nothing to worry about, and the other half telling you how six months ago their Uncle Bob was driving near Mudgee when a tiger snake slid out from under the dashboard and bit him on the groin, but that it's okay now because he's off the life support machine and they've discovered he can communicate with eye blinks.” … “As the saying goes, it takes all kinds to make the world go around, though perhaps some shouldn't go quite so far around it as others.” … “The people are immensely likable— cheerful, extrovert, quick-witted and unfailingly obliging. Their cities are safe and clean and nearly always built on water. They have a society that is prosperous, well ordered and instinctively egalitarian. The food is excellent. The sun nearly always shines. There is coffee on every corner. Life doesn't get much better than this.” - Bill Bryson, In a Sunburned Country<br>
