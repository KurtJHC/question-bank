        <p>He jumped nervously as Strong Jonn’s hand touched his shoulder. He looked up. They were in a small clearing. Before them was the silken door. It was a huge gleaming white web, so thick that you could not see through it. Its surface was scattered with twigs and leaves caught in its sticky threads.

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Allun turned carefully to face his companions.</p>
        <p>“What now?” he mouthed.</p>
        <p>“The verse,” breathed Marlie.</p>
        <p>“The verse has no meaning,” hissed Bronden.</p>
        <p>“Cut through the web and be done with it, Allun. Or if you do not have the stomach for it, let me through and I will do it myself!”</p>
        <p>The spiders rustled and moved in the web.</p>
        <p>“No!” whispered Strong Jonn. “Not while the spiders hang about the silk in such numbers. As soon as we touch the web they will be upon us. We cannot risk that.”</p>
        <p>“They may be quite harmless,” said Val.</p>
        <p>“Or they may not,” answered Marlie. “As Jonn says, we cannot risk it. We have already lost one member of our party.”</p>
        <p>“What then?” Bronden was angry. Ellis’s flight from the forest had been a great shock to her. How could such a big, strong man have such a childish weakness? She was baffled by it. She took care not to look at Val. How shamed she must feel.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The light changed. From directly above them a ray of sun penetrated the gloom of the forest, bathing them in warmth. The spiders around them began to chitter and creep back.</p>
        <p>“They do not like the light,” Rowan breathed.</p>

        <p>He jumped nervously as Strong Jonn’s hand touched his shoulder. He looked up. They were in a small clearing. Before them was the silken door. It was a huge gleaming white web, so thick that you could not see through it. Its surface was scattered with twigs and leaves caught in its sticky threads. It stretched from one side of the path to the other, blocking it completely. And all around it crouched hundreds of spiders. Waiting.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Allun turned carefully to face his companions.</p>
        <p>“What now?” he mouthed.</p>
        <p>“The verse,” breathed Marlie.</p>
        <p>“The verse has no meaning,” hissed Bronden.</p>
        <p>“Cut through the web and be done with it, Allun. Or if you do not have the stomach for it, let me through and I will do it myself!”</p>
        <p>The spiders rustled and moved in the web.</p>
        <p>“No!” whispered Strong Jonn. “Not while the spiders hang about the silk in such numbers. As soon as we touch the web they will be upon us. We cannot risk that.”</p>
        <p>“They may be quite harmless,” said Val.</p>
        <p>“Or they may not,” answered Marlie. “As Jonn says, we cannot risk it. We have already lost one member of our party.”</p>
        <p>“What then?” Bronden was angry. Ellis’s flight from the forest had been a great shock to her. How could such a big, strong man have such a childish weakness? She was baffled by it. She took care not to look at Val. How shamed she must feel.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The light changed. From directly above them a ray of sun penetrated the gloom of the forest, bathing them in warmth. The spiders around them began to chitter and creep back.</p>

        <p>Colour-Changing Bugs</p>
        <p>Sept.&nbsp;5,&nbsp;2007</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A variety of animals can dramatically change the colours of their bodies to blend with the environment or to ward off predators, among other reasons. Such creatures, including chameleons and squid, usually switch shades by altering the size of special cells. These cells carry coloured chemicals called pigments.</p>
        <p>The Panamanian golden tortoise beetle also changes colours – from gold to red. Instead of using pigment cells, however, the bug uses an entirely different strategy to make the colour switch.</p>
        <p>The colour-changing beetle, called Charidotella egregia, grows to be about 8 millimetres (0.3 inches) long. It has a see-through shell. Usually, the shell reflects a metallic-gold colour. But when the insect is disturbed, the gold hue fades, revealing a dull red.</p>
        <p>Researchers from the University of Numar in Belgium used an electron microscope to take a close look at the beetle's shell. They found that the shell has three tiers, or layers, arranged one on top of the other. The bottom tier is thickest. The top tier is thinnest. Each tier is made up of a number of closely packed smaller layers.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Each of the three tiers reflects light of a different colour. Combined, these reflections produce a gold colour. Beneath all three tiers is a layer of red pigment.</p>
        <p>Within the layers that make up each tier, the scientists noticed tiny grooves. Sometimes, the beetle's body fluids fill these grooves. When that happens, the layers become smooth.

        <p>When the grooves are empty of fluid, on the other hand, the tiers act more like windows than mirrors. The shell loses its shine, and the red pigment shows through.</p>

        <p>Colour-Changing Bugs</p>
        <p>Sept.&nbsp;5,&nbsp;2007</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A variety of animals can dramatically change the colours of their bodies to blend with the environment or to ward off predators, among other reasons. Such creatures, including chameleons and squid, usually switch shades by altering the size of special cells. These cells carry coloured chemicals called pigments.</p>
        <p>The Panamanian golden tortoise beetle also changes colours – from gold to red. Instead of using pigment cells, however, the bug uses an entirely different strategy to make the colour switch.</p>
        <p>The colour-changing beetle, called Charidotella egregia, grows to be about 8 millimetres (0.3 inches) long. It has a see-through shell. Usually, the shell reflects a metallic-gold colour. But when the insect is disturbed, the gold hue fades, revealing a dull red.</p>
        <p>Researchers from the University of Numar in Belgium used an electron microscope to take a close look at the beetle's shell. They found that the shell has three tiers, or layers, arranged one on top of the other. The bottom tier is thickest. The top tier is thinnest. Each tier is made up of a number of closely packed smaller layers.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Each of the three tiers reflects light of a different colour. Combined, these reflections produce a gold colour. Beneath all three tiers is a layer of red pigment.</p>

        <p>Colour-Changing Bugs</p>
        <p>Sept.&nbsp;5,&nbsp;2007</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A variety of animals can dramatically change the colours of their bodies to blend with the environment or to ward off predators, among other reasons. Such creatures, including chameleons and squid, usually switch shades by altering the size of special cells. These cells carry coloured chemicals called pigments.</p>
        <p>The Panamanian golden tortoise beetle also changes colours – from gold to red. Instead of using pigment cells, however, the bug uses an entirely different strategy to make the colour switch.</p>

        <p><em>EDMUND</em> &nbsp;&nbsp;Dad!</p>
        <p>He breaks his mother’s hold and RACES BACK INTO THE HOUSE.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>MRS. PEVENSIE</em>&nbsp; Edmund!</p>
        <p>Susan and Lucy yank their mother toward the shelter.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Pevensie looks pleadingly toward Peter.</p>
        <p>Peter turns to the house, hesitant.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>INT. PEVENSIE HOUSE-NIGHT</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Edmund dashes into the sitting room and grabs…</p>
        <p>A FRAMED PHOTO of a man in an RAF UNIFORM.</p>
        <p>ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUNS pound outside.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Edmund looks out the window. A SPITFIRE swoop in.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, PLANE SHOOTS FROM ONE OF THE BOMBERS. It wobbles in the air…</p>
        <p>Edmund stares in awe as the burning plane plunges out of the sky…DIRECTLY AT HIM.</p>
        <p>He stands frozen…</p>
        <p>THE PLANE SMASHES INTO THE HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET.</p>
        <p><em>PETER (o.s) </em>&nbsp;Edmund!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>PETER yanks Edmund away. Their dad’s picture flies from his hand. IT SMASHES ON THE FLOOR.</p>
        <p>Edmund looks angrily from the picture to Peter. He snatches it up as his brother runs him outside.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>EXT. PEVENSIE HOUSE-NIGHT</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Peter and Edmund race across the yard and into the shelter.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>INT. AIR RAID SHELTER –NIGHT</strong>
        </p>
        <p>They tumble inside.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><em>PETER</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;You twirp! We could’ve both been killed!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Edmund looks at the crumpled photograph. He glares at Peter, tears in his eyes.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Pevensie pulls Edmund to her. The girls look on, shattered.</p>
        <p>Peter slams the shelter door shut.</p>
        <p>Outside, LONDON BURNS.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>EXT. TRAFALGAR SQUARE –DAY</strong>
        </p>
        <p>The next morning, bobbies wave traffic around a crater.</p>
        <p>Firemen hose a smouldering building.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>THE PEVENSIE FAMILY walks through crowded TRAFALGAR SQUARE.</p>
        <p>The children carry suitcases and GAS MASK BOXES.</p>
        <p>LUCY stops suddenly, staring up at a GIANT BRONZE LION.</p>

          <strong>Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>By Eleanor Coerr</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>1. Good Luck Signs</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Sadako was born to be a runner. Her mother always said that Sadako had learned to run before she could walk.</p>
        <p>One morning in August 1954 Sadako ran outside into the street as soon as she was dressed. The morning sun of Japan touched brown highlights in her dark hair. There was not a speck of cloud in the blue sky. It was a good sign. Sadako was always on the lookout for good luck signs.</p>
        <p>Back in the house her sister and two brothers were still sleeping on their bed quilts. She poked her big brother, Masahiro.</p>
        <p>“Get up, lazybones!” she said. “It’s Peace Day!”</p>
        <p>Masahiro groaned and yawned. He wanted to sleep as long as possible but, like most fourteen-year-old boys, he also loved to eat. When he sniffed the good smell of bean soup, Masahiro got up. Soon Mitsue and Eiji were awake, too.</p>
        <p>Sadako helped Eiji get dressed. He was six, but he sometimes lost a sock or shirt. Afterward, Sadako folded the bed quilts. Her sister, Mitsue, who was nine, helped put them away in the closet.</p>
        <p>Rushing like a whirlwind into the kitchen, Sadako cried, “Oh, Mother! I can hardly wait to go to the carnival. Can we please hurry with breakfast?”</p>
        <p>Her mother was busily slicing pickled radishes to serve with the rice and soup. She looked sternly at Sadako. “You are eleven years old and should know better,” she scolded. “You must not call it a carnival. Every year on August sixth we remember those who died when the atom bomb was dropped on our city. It is a memorial day.”</p>
        <p>Mr Sasaki came in from the back porch. “That’s right,” he said. “Sadako chan, you must show respect. Your own grandmother was killed that awful day.”</p>
        <p>“But I do respect Oba chan,” Sadako said. “ It’s just that I’m so happy today.”</p>
        <p>“As a matter of fact, it’s time for our prayers now,’ her father said.</p>
        <p>Mr Sasaki gave thanks for his barber shop. He gave thanks for his fine children. And he prayed that his family would be protected from the atom bomb disease called leukaemia.</p>
        <p>Many still died from the disease, even through the atom bomb had been dropped on Hiroshima nine years before. It has filled the air with radiation—a kind of poison—that stayed inside people for a long time.</p>

          <strong>Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>By Eleanor Coerr</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>1. Good Luck Signs</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Sadako was born to be a runner. Her mother always said that Sadako had learned to run before she could walk.</p>
        <p>One morning in August 1954 Sadako ran outside into the street as soon as she was dressed. The morning sun of Japan touched brown highlights in her dark hair. There was not a speck of cloud in the blue sky. It was a good sign. Sadako was always on the lookout for good luck signs.</p>
        <p>Back in the house her sister and two brothers were still sleeping on their bed quilts. She poked her big brother, Masahiro.</p>
        <p>“Get up, lazybones!” she said. “It’s Peace Day!”</p>
        <p>Masahiro groaned and yawned. He wanted to sleep as long as possible but, like most fourteen-year-old boys, he also loved to eat. When he sniffed the good smell of bean soup, Masahiro got up. Soon Mitsue and Eiji were awake, too.</p>
        <p>Sadako helped Eiji get dressed. He was six, but he sometimes lost a sock or shirt. Afterward, Sadako folded the bed quilts. Her sister, Mitsue, who was nine, helped put them away in the closet.</p>
        <p>Rushing like a whirlwind into the kitchen, Sadako cried, “Oh, Mother! I can hardly wait to go to the carnival. Can we please hurry with breakfast?”</p>
        <p>Her mother was busily slicing pickled radishes to serve with the rice and soup. She looked sternly at Sadako. “You are eleven years old and should know better,” she scolded. “You must not call it a carnival. Every year on August sixth we remember those who died when the atom bomb was dropped on our city. It is a memorial day.”</p>
        <p>Mr Sasaki came in from the back porch. “That’s right,” he said. “Sadako chan, you must show respect. Your own grandmother was killed that awful day.”</p>
        <p>“But I do respect Oba chan,” Sadako said. “ It’s just that I’m so happy today.”</p>
        <p>“As a matter of fact, it’s time for our prayers now,’ her father said.</p>
        <p>Mr Sasaki gave thanks for his barber shop. He gave thanks for his fine children. And he prayed that his family would be protected from the atom bomb disease called leukaemia.</p>
        <p>Many still died from the disease, even through the atom bomb had been dropped on Hiroshima nine years before. It has filled the air with radiation—a kind of poison—that stayed inside people for a long time.</p>

          <strong>1. Good Luck Signs</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Sadako was born to be a runner. Her mother always said that Sadako had learned to run before she could walk.</p>
        <p>One morning in August 1954 Sadako ran outside into the street as soon as she was dressed. The morning sun of Japan touched brown highlights in her dark hair. There was not a speck of cloud in the blue sky. It was a good sign. Sadako was always on the lookout for good luck signs.</p>
        <p>Back in the house her sister and two brothers were still sleeping on their bed quilts. She poked her big brother, Masahiro.</p>
        <p>“Get up, lazybones!” she said. “It’s Peace Day!”</p>
        <p>Masahiro groaned and yawned. He wanted to sleep as long as possible but, like most fourteen-year-old boys, he also loved to eat. When he sniffed the good smell of bean soup, Masahiro got up. Soon Mitsue and Eiji were awake, too.</p>
        <p>Sadako helped Eiji get dressed. He was six, but he sometimes lost a sock or shirt. Afterward, Sadako folded the bed quilts. Her sister, Mitsue, who was nine, helped put them away in the closet.</p>
        <p>Rushing like a whirlwind into the kitchen, Sadako cried, “Oh, Mother! I can hardly wait to go to the carnival. Can we please hurry with breakfast?”</p>
        <p>Her mother was busily slicing pickled radishes to serve with the rice and soup. She looked sternly at Sadako. “You are eleven years old and should know better,” she scolded. “You must not call it a carnival. Every year on August sixth we remember those who died when the atom bomb was dropped on our city. It is a memorial day.”</p>
        <p>Mr Sasaki came in from the back porch. “That’s right,” he said. “Sadako chan, you must show respect. Your own grandmother was killed that awful day.”</p>
        <p>“But I do respect Oba chan,” Sadako said. “ It’s just that I’m so happy today.”</p>
        <p>“As a matter of fact, it’s time for our prayers now,’ her father said.</p>
        <p>Mr Sasaki gave thanks for his barber shop. He gave thanks for his fine children. And he prayed that his family would be protected from the atom bomb disease called leukaemia.</p>
        <p>Many still died from the disease, even through the atom bomb had been dropped on Hiroshima nine years before. It has filled the air with radiation—a kind of poison—that stayed inside people for a long time.</p>

          <strong>Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>By Eleanor Coerr</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>1. Good Luck Signs</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Sadako was born to be a runner. Her mother always said that Sadako had learned to run before she could walk.</p>
        <p>One morning in August 1954 Sadako ran outside into the street as soon as she was dressed. The morning sun of Japan touched brown highlights in her dark hair. There was not a speck of cloud in the blue sky. It was a good sign. Sadako was always on the lookout for good luck signs.</p>
        <p>Back in the house her sister and two brothers were still sleeping on their bed quilts. She poked her big brother, Masahiro.</p>
        <p>“Get up, lazybones!” she said. “It’s Peace Day!”</p>
        <p>Masahiro groaned and yawned. He wanted to sleep as long as possible but, like most fourteen-year-old boys, he also loved to eat. When he sniffed the good smell of bean soup, Masahiro got up. Soon Mitsue and Eiji were awake, too.</p>
        <p>Sadako helped Eiji get dressed. He was six, but he sometimes lost a sock or shirt. Afterward, Sadako folded the bed quilts. Her sister, Mitsue, who was nine, helped put them away in the closet.</p>
        <p>Rushing like a whirlwind into the kitchen, Sadako cried, “Oh, Mother! I can hardly wait to go to the carnival. Can we please hurry with breakfast?”</p>
        <p>Her mother was busily slicing pickled radishes to serve with the rice and soup. She looked sternly at Sadako. “You are eleven years old and should know better,” she scolded. “You must not call it a carnival. Every year on August sixth we remember those who died when the atom bomb was dropped on our city. It is a memorial day.”</p>
        <p>Mr Sasaki came in from the back porch. “That’s right,” he said. “Sadako chan, you must show respect. Your own grandmother was killed that awful day.”</p>
        <p>“But I do respect Oba chan,” Sadako said. “ It’s just that I’m so happy today.”</p>
        <p>“As a matter of fact, it’s time for our prayers now,’ her father said.</p>
        <p>Mr Sasaki gave thanks for his barber shop. He gave thanks for his fine children. And he prayed that his family would be protected from the atom bomb disease called leukaemia.</p>
        <p>Many still died from the disease, even through the atom bomb had been dropped on Hiroshima nine years before. It has filled the air with radiation—a kind of poison—that stayed inside people for a long time.</p>

          <strong>Maple Story</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You can explore a totally new and unknown world you have never been to, put on beautiful clothes and gorgeous accessories and even attract other users in the process. You may begin the journey to explore the world of unknown alone, but you may come out on the other end with numerous new friends through hunting and chatting. If you're tired of hunting and competition, how about playing minigames with a friend for a change?</p>
        <p>You'll become a brave adventurer protecting the Maple World and if you're exhausted from all the intense battles and competition, you may one day build your own house at a quiet rural village, enjoying the life of a recluse who welcomes visitors.</p>
        <p>At Maple Island, you will learn from the NPC's simple hunting skills and basic control of the game to help you ease into the game. Then, you'll board the ship that heads to Victoria Island and that's where your journey REALLY begins.</p>
        <p>From Lith Harbor that welcomes you from a long journey from Maple Island, you'll run into such fascinating towns as Henesys - the village of bowmen with comfy mushroom-shaped houses gathered together; Ellinia - the village of magicians with mysterious spells embedded between tall trees; Perion - the village of warriors with the fighting spirit typical of the Indians living in highlands; and Kerning City – the village of thieves that reminds you of the back alleys of dark cities.</p>
        <p>You'll be playing the game at Victoria Island where all these diverse and unique towns and fields coexist.</p>
        <p>Here, you are going to be just a regular gamer hunting down monsters and protecting yourself in the process. You'll be given 4 paths to choose from, 4 that will define your life in Maple Story: Warrior, Bowman, Thief and Magician. Through levelling up and meeting some requirements, you'll be able to make job advancements and nurture your character in your own, unique way.</p>
