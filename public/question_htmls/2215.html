        <p><br><strong>Chocolate’s Sweet History:</strong><br>
From Elite Treat to Food for the Masses<br>
<br>
Mankind’s love affair with chocolate stretches back more than five millennia. Produced from tropical cacao trees native to the rainforests of Central and South America, chocolate was first considered “food of the gods”, and later, a delicacy for the elite. <strong>(A)</strong> ………. Archaeologists discovered early traces of cacao in pottery used by the ancient Mayo-Chinchipe culture 5,300 years ago in the upper Amazon. Chocolate played an important political, spiritual and economic role in ancient Mesoamerican civilisations, which ground roasted cacao beans into a paste to brew a frothy chocolate drink. Ancient Mesoamericans believed chocolate was an energy booster with mystical and medicinal qualities. The Mayans, who considered cacao a gift from the gods, used chocolate for sacred ceremonies and funeral offerings.</p>
        <p>As people of the Aztec empire spread, others began to prize cacao. Since they couldn’t grow it in the dry highlands of central Mexico, they traded with the Mayans for the beans. Chocolate arrived in Europe in the 1500s, brought by Spanish friars and conquistadors who had travelled to the Americas. Although the Spanish sweetened the bitter drink with cane sugar and cinnamon, one thing remained unchanged: <strong>(B)</strong> ………. It was an expensive import sipped by royal lips, and affordable only to Spanish elites. Chocolate’s popularity then spread to other European courts, where aristocrats consumed it as a magic elixir with health benefits. To quench their growing thirst for chocolate, European powers established colonial plantations in equatorial regions around the world to grow cacao and sugar. When diseases depleted the labour pool, African slaves were imported to work to maintain chocolate production.</p>
        <p><strong>(C) </strong>………. Attributed to Dutch chemist, Coenraad Johannes van Houten, the cocoa press squeezed the fatty butter from roasted cacao beans, leaving behind a dry cake that could be pulverised into a fine powder and be mixed with liquids and other ingredients, poured into moulds, and solidified into easily digestible chocolate. The cocoa press ushered in the modern era of chocolate by enabling it to be used as a confectionary with the resulting drop in production costs making chocolate much more affordable.</p>
        <p>In 1847, British company J. S. Fry &amp; Sons created the first edible chocolate bar from cocoa butter, cocoa powder and sugar. Rival chocolatier, Cadbury’s, followed suit soon after and in 1854 earned a royal warrant as purveyors of chocolate to Queen Victoria. It was in Switzerland that chocolate production took one of its greatest leaps forward. In the 1870s, Swiss chocolatier Daniel Peter utilised a powdered milk developed several years earlier by his neighbour, Henri Nestlé to produce the first milk chocolate bar. The pair eventually formed the Nestlé Company. Eventually, Swiss chocolatier, Rodolphe Lindt invented the conching machine in 1879. <strong>(D)</strong> ………. This allowed for the mass production of smooth, creamy milk chocolate.</p>
        <p>In the United States, Milton Hershey pioneered the assembly-line production of milk chocolate. Hershey bought farmland in rural Pennsylvania and built an entire factory town devoted to chocolate. <strong>(E)</strong> ………. Chocolate bars soared in popularity during the 1920’s. By the end of the decade, more than 40,000 different candy bars were being made in the U.S., according to Susan Benjamin, candy historian.</p>
        <p>From its roots more than 5,000 years ago, chocolate has become a big business. According to research by Statista, retail sales of chocolate worldwide in 2016 totalled nearly $100 billion. This included almost $25 billion in the United States alone. <strong>(F)</strong> ………. Africa is now the source of more than two-thirds of worldwide cocoa production.</p>

<br>
Michelangelo was a sculptor, painter and architect widely considered to be one of the greatest artists of the Renaissance — and arguably of all time. His work demonstrated a blend of psychological insight, physical realism and intensity never seen before.<br>
<br>
Michelangelo needed very little sleep and was usually so drawn up in his work that he would spend weeks in the same clothes and shoes. His servant reported that when Michelangelo did take off his shoes, the skin on his feet would peel off like a snake’s.<br>
<br>
Michelangelo was a highly focused artist, but his creativity wasn’t something he took for granted. He wrote, “Critique by creating.” Michelangelo felt that he could respond to others by doing a better job than they could.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of creativity. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Being creative means solving a problem in a new way. It means changing your perspective.<br>
<br>
Being creative means taking risks and ignoring doubt and facing fears. It means breaking with routine and doing something different for the sake of doing something different. It means mapping out a thousand different routes to reach one destination. It means challenging yourself every day by applying extensive thought processes in many scenarios.<br>
<br>
Being creative means searching for inspiration in even the most mundane places. It means you’re asking stupid questions. It means creating without critiquing.<br>
<br>
Being creative means you know how to find the similarities and differences between two completely random ideas. Being creative means you’re thinking.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of creativity. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
How did songwriters John Lennon and Paul McCartney make music magic together? On the surface, it seems simple — they covered for each other's deficits and created outlets for each other's strengths. Paul's melodic sunshine smoothed out John's bluesy growls, while John's soulful depth gave stability to Paul and kept him from floating away.<br>
<br>
But images of completion and balance miss an essential energy between Lennon and McCartney — the potential energy of creative partnerships that they, as much as any pair in history, exemplify and illustrate. We tend to think of them in terms of arithmetic: Two people added together yield magnificence. This is the idea of partnership as chocolate and peanut butter — tasty, obvious, easy. But Lennon and McCartney were more like an oyster and a grain of sand. Their power together didn't derive simply from individual ingredients but from a dynamic of constant mutual influence.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of creativity. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Creative writing, a form of artistic expression, draws on the imagination to convey meaning through the use of imagery, narrative, and drama. This is in contrast with analytic or pragmatic forms of writing.<br>
<br>
This genre includes poetry, fiction (novels, short stories), scripts, screenplays and creative non-fiction. You should be able to recognise an author’s written voice the way you recognise a person’s spoken voice.<br>
<br>
In creative writing, one goal is to develop your written voice. Character development is the art of imagining and portraying characters in enough detail that they seem real both to the author and the audience.<br>
<br>
Consider the narrator’s perspective on the characters and occurrences in the piece of writing. Whose voice is telling the story? Most fiction is written in first person, an eyewitness account, or in third person, where the narrator describes things that happened to other people.<br>

Buck did not read the newspapers, or he would have known that trouble was brewing, not alone for himself, but for every tide-water dog, strong of muscle and with warm, long hair, from Puget Sound to San Diego. Because men, groping in the Arctic darkness, had found a yellow metal, and because steamship and transportation companies were booming the find, thousands of men were rushing into the Northland. These men wanted dogs, and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs, with strong muscles by which to toil, and furry coats to protect them from the frost.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Buck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley. Judge Miller’s place, it was called. It stood back from the road, half hidden among the trees, through which glimpses could be caught of the wide cool veranda that ran around its four sides. The house was approached by gravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns and under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars. At the rear things were on even a more spacious scale than at the front. There were great stables, where a dozen grooms and boys held forth, rows of vineclad servants’ cottages, an endless and orderly array of outhouses, long grape arbors, green pastures, orchards, and berry patches. Then there was the pumping plant for the artesian well, and the big cement tank where Judge Miller’s boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot afternoon.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span class="txt-underline"><strong>And over this great demesne Buck ruled</strong></span>. Here he was born, and here he had lived the four years of his life. It was true, there were other dogs, There could not but be other dogs on so vast a place, but they did not count. They came and went, resided in the populous kennels, or lived obscurely in the recesses of the house after the fashion of Toots, the Japanese pug, or Ysabel, the Mexican hairless,—strange creatures that rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground. On the other hand, there were the fox terriers, a score of them at least, who yelped fearful promises at Toots and Ysabel looking out of the windows at them and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with brooms and mops.</p>
        <p>But Buck was neither house-dog nor kennel-dog. The whole realm was his. He plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the Judge’s sons; he escorted Mollie and Alice, the Judge’s daughters, on long twilight or early morning rambles; on wintry nights he lay at the Judge’s feet before the roaring library fire; he carried the Judge’s grandsons on his back, or rolled them in the grass, and guarded their footsteps through wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable yard, and even beyond, where the paddocks were, and the berry patches. Among the terriers he stalked imperiously, and Toots and Ysabel he utterly ignored, for he was king,—king over all creeping, crawling, flying things of Judge Miller’s place, humans included.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>His father, Elmo, a huge St. Bernard, had been the Judge’s inseparable companion, and Buck bid fair to follow in the way of his father. He was not so large,—he weighed only one hundred and forty pounds,—for his mother, Shep, had been a Scotch shepherd dog. Nevertheless, one hundred and forty pounds, to which was added the dignity that comes of good living and universal respect, enabled him to carry himself in right royal fashion. During the four years since his puppyhood he had lived the life of a sated aristocrat; he had a fine pride in himself, was even a trifle egotistical, as country gentlemen sometimes become because of their insular situation. But he had saved himself by not becoming a mere pampered house-dog. Hunting and kindred outdoor delights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles; and to him, as to the cold-tubbing races, the love of water had been a tonic and a health preserver.</p>

Buck did not read the newspapers, or he would have known that trouble was brewing, not alone for himself, but for every tide-water dog, strong of muscle and with warm, long hair, from Puget Sound to San Diego. Because men, groping in the Arctic darkness, had found a yellow metal, and because steamship and transportation companies were booming the find, thousands of men were rushing into the Northland. These men wanted dogs, and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs, with strong muscles by which to toil, and furry coats to protect them from the frost.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Buck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley. Judge Miller’s place, it was called. It stood back from the road, half hidden among the trees, through which glimpses could be caught of the wide cool veranda that ran around its four sides. The house was approached by gravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns and under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars. At the rear things were on even a more spacious scale than at the front. There were great stables, where a dozen grooms and boys held forth, rows of vineclad servants’ cottages, an endless and orderly array of outhouses, long grape arbors, green pastures, orchards, and berry patches. Then there was the pumping plant for the artesian well, and the big cement tank where Judge Miller’s boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot afternoon.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><em>Read the extract below then answer the questions.</em><br><br>
Buck did not read the newspapers, or he would have known that trouble was brewing, not alone for himself, but for every tide-water dog, strong of muscle and with warm, long hair, from Puget Sound to San Diego. Because men, groping in the Arctic darkness, had found a yellow metal, and because steamship and transportation companies were booming the find, thousands of men were rushing into the Northland. These men wanted dogs, and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs, with strong muscles by which to toil, and furry coats to protect them from the frost.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Buck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley. Judge Miller’s place, it was called. It stood back from the road, half hidden among the trees, through which glimpses could be caught of the wide cool veranda that ran around its four sides. The house was approached by gravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns and under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars. At the rear things were on even a more spacious scale than at the front. There were great stables, where a dozen grooms and boys held forth, rows of vineclad servants’ cottages, an endless and orderly array of outhouses, long grape arbors, green pastures, orchards, and berry patches. Then there was the pumping plant for the artesian well, and the big cement tank where Judge Miller’s boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot afternoon.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span class="txt-underline"><strong>And over this great demesne Buck ruled</strong></span>. Here he was born, and here he had lived the four years of his life. It was true, there were other dogs, There could not but be other dogs on so vast a place, but they did not count. They came and went, resided in the populous kennels, or lived obscurely in the recesses of the house after the fashion of Toots, the Japanese pug, or Ysabel, the Mexican hairless,—strange creatures that rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground. On the other hand, there were the fox terriers, a score of them at least, who yelped fearful promises at Toots and Ysabel looking out of the windows at them and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with brooms and mops.</p>
        <p>But Buck was neither house-dog nor kennel-dog. The whole realm was his. He plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the Judge’s sons; he escorted Mollie and Alice, the Judge’s daughters, on long twilight or early morning rambles; on wintry nights he lay at the Judge’s feet before the roaring library fire; he carried the Judge’s grandsons on his back, or rolled them in the grass, and guarded their footsteps through wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable yard, and even beyond, where the paddocks were, and the berry patches. Among the terriers he stalked imperiously, and Toots and Ysabel he utterly ignored, for he was king,—king over all creeping, crawling, flying things of Judge Miller’s place, humans included.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>His father, Elmo, a huge St. Bernard, had been the Judge’s inseparable companion, and Buck bid fair to follow in the way of his father. He was not so large,—he weighed only one hundred and forty pounds,—for his mother, Shep, had been a Scotch shepherd dog. Nevertheless, one hundred and forty pounds, to which was added the dignity that comes of good living and universal respect, enabled him to carry himself in right royal fashion. During the four years since his puppyhood he had lived the life of a sated aristocrat; he had a fine pride in himself, was even a trifle egotistical, as country gentlemen sometimes become because of their insular situation. But he had saved himself by not becoming a mere pampered house-dog. Hunting and kindred outdoor delights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles; and to him, as to the cold-tubbing races, the love of water had been a tonic and a health preserver.</p>

Buck did not read the newspapers, or he would have known that trouble was brewing, not alone for himself, but for every tide-water dog, strong of muscle and with warm, long hair, from Puget Sound to San Diego. Because men, groping in the Arctic darkness, had found a yellow metal, and because steamship and transportation companies were booming the find, thousands of men were rushing into the Northland. These men wanted dogs, and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs, with strong muscles by which to toil, and furry coats to protect them from the frost.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Buck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley. Judge Miller’s place, it was called. It stood back from the road, half hidden among the trees, through which glimpses could be caught of the wide cool veranda that ran around its four sides. The house was approached by gravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns and under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars. At the rear things were on even a more spacious scale than at the front. There were great stables, where a dozen grooms and boys held forth, rows of vineclad servants’ cottages, an endless and orderly array of outhouses, long grape arbors, green pastures, orchards, and berry patches. Then there was the pumping plant for the artesian well, and the big cement tank where Judge Miller’s boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot afternoon.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span class="txt-underline"><strong>And over this great demesne Buck ruled</strong></span>. Here he was born, and here he had lived the four years of his life. It was true, there were other dogs, There could not but be other dogs on so vast a place, but they did not count. They came and went, resided in the populous kennels, or lived obscurely in the recesses of the house after the fashion of Toots, the Japanese pug, or Ysabel, the Mexican hairless,—strange creatures that rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground. On the other hand, there were the fox terriers, a score of them at least, who yelped fearful promises at Toots and Ysabel looking out of the windows at them and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with brooms and mops.</p>
        <p>But Buck was neither house-dog nor kennel-dog. The whole realm was his. He plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the Judge’s sons; he escorted Mollie and Alice, the Judge’s daughters, on long twilight or early morning rambles; on wintry nights he lay at the Judge’s feet before the roaring library fire; he carried the Judge’s grandsons on his back, or rolled them in the grass, and guarded their footsteps through wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable yard, and even beyond, where the paddocks were, and the berry patches. Among the terriers he stalked imperiously, and Toots and Ysabel he utterly ignored, for he was king,—king over all creeping, crawling, flying things of Judge Miller’s place, humans included.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>His father, Elmo, a huge St. Bernard, had been the Judge’s inseparable companion, and Buck bid fair to follow in the way of his father. He was not so large,—he weighed only one hundred and forty pounds,—for his mother, Shep, had been a Scotch shepherd dog. Nevertheless, one hundred and forty pounds, to which was added the dignity that comes of good living and universal respect, enabled him to carry himself in right royal fashion. During the four years since his puppyhood he had lived the life of a sated aristocrat; he had a fine pride in himself, was even a trifle egotistical, as country gentlemen sometimes become because of their insular situation. But he had saved himself by not becoming a mere pampered house-dog. Hunting and kindred outdoor delights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles; and to him, as to the cold-tubbing races, the love of water had been a tonic and a health preserver.</p>

A snake came to my water-trough<br>
On a hot, hot day, and I in pyjamas for the heat,<br>
To drink there.</p>
        <p>In the deep, strange-scented shade of the great dark carob-tree<br>
I came down the steps with my pitcher<br>
And must wait, must stand and wait, for there he was at the<br>
trough before me.</p>
        <p>He reached down from a fissure in the earth-wall in the gloom<br>
And trailed his yellow-brown slackness soft-bellied down, over the<br>
edge of the stone trough</p>
        <p>And rested his throat upon the stone bottom,<br>
And where the water had dripped from the tap, in a small<br>
clearness,</p>
        <p>He sipped with his straight mouth,<br>
Softly drank through his straight gums, into his slack long body,<br>
Silently.</p>
        <p>Someone was before me at my water-trough,<br>
And I, like a second comer, waiting.<br>
He lifted his head from his drinking, as cattle do,<br>
And looked at me vaguely, as drinking cattle do,<br>
And flickered his two-forked tongue from his lips, and mused a<br>
moment,<br>
And stooped and drank a little more,<br>
Being earth-brown, earth-golden from the burning bowels of the<br>
earth<br>

        <p><em>Read the poem below then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Snake</strong><br><br>
A snake came to my water-trough<br>
On a hot, hot day, and I in pyjamas for the heat,<br>
To drink there.</p>
        <p>In the deep, strange-scented shade of the great dark carob-tree<br>
I came down the steps with my pitcher<br>
And must wait, must stand and wait, for there he was at the<br>
trough before me.</p>
        <p>He reached down from a fissure in the earth-wall in the gloom<br>
And trailed his yellow-brown slackness soft-bellied down, over the<br>
edge of the stone trough</p>
        <p>And rested his throat upon the stone bottom,<br>
And where the water had dripped from the tap, in a small<br>
clearness,</p>
        <p>He sipped with his straight mouth,<br>
Softly drank through his straight gums, into his slack long body,<br>
Silently.</p>
        <p>Someone was before me at my water-trough,<br>
And I, like a second comer, waiting.<br>
He lifted his head from his drinking, as cattle do,<br>
And looked at me vaguely, as drinking cattle do,<br>
And flickered his two-forked tongue from his lips, and mused a<br>
moment,<br>
And stooped and drank a little more,<br>
Being earth-brown, earth-golden from the burning bowels of the<br>
earth<br>

        <p><em>Read the poem below then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Snake</strong><br><br>
A snake came to my water-trough<br>
On a hot, hot day, and I in pyjamas for the heat,<br>
To drink there.</p>
        <p>In the deep, strange-scented shade of the great dark carob-tree<br>
I came down the steps with my pitcher<br>
And must wait, must stand and wait, for there he was at the<br>
trough before me.</p>
        <p>He reached down from a fissure in the earth-wall in the gloom<br>
And trailed his yellow-brown slackness soft-bellied down, over the<br>
edge of the stone trough</p>
        <p>And rested his throat upon the stone bottom,<br>
And where the water had dripped from the tap, in a small<br>
clearness,</p>
        <p>He sipped with his straight mouth,<br>
Softly drank through his straight gums, into his slack long body,<br>
Silently.</p>
        <p>Someone was before me at my water-trough,<br>
And I, like a second comer, waiting.<br>
He lifted his head from his drinking, as cattle do,<br>
And looked at me vaguely, as drinking cattle do,<br>
And flickered his two-forked tongue from his lips, and mused a<br>
moment,<br>
And stooped and drank a little more,<br>
Being earth-brown, earth-golden from the burning bowels of the<br>
earth<br>
...</p>

        <strong>Kangaroos</strong>
        <p>The Iconic Australian Marsupial<br>
<br>
Kangaroos are one of Australia’s most iconic animals, recognized worldwide for their distinctive appearance and unique mode of locomotion. Their unique way of moving by hopping is not only efficient but also an adaptation to the vast, open landscapes of Australia. Kangaroos are often seen as symbols of the Australian outback, representing the wild and untamed nature of the continent.</p>
        <p>Kangaroos are found across a variety of Australian landscapes, from the open plains and grasslands to forests and savannas. <strong>(A)</strong> ……………&nbsp; The most well-known species include the Red Kangaroo, the Eastern Grey Kangaroo, and the Western Grey Kangaroo. Each species has its own distinct range and preferred habitat, but all kangaroos are generally associated with open spaces where they can hop freely. These environments provide the necessary resources for their survival, such as food and water, and allow them to maintain their social structures. The adaptability of kangaroos to different environments is a testament to their evolutionary success in Australia.</p>
        <p>Kangaroos are characterized by their large size, with the Red Kangaroo being the largest, standing over 6 feet tall and weighing up to 200 pounds. Their powerful hind legs allow them to travel at speeds of up to 35 miles per hour and leap distances of over 25 feet in a single bound. <strong>(B)</strong>&nbsp; ……………&nbsp; In addition to their legs, kangaroos have large, muscular tails that help with balance and stability while hopping. Their forelimbs are much smaller but are used for feeding and grooming. The combination of these physical traits makes kangaroos highly specialized for their environment.</p>
        <p>Kangaroos are herbivores, primarily feeding on grasses and shrubs. Their digestive system is specially adapted to extract maximum nutrients from their fibrous diet. Kangaroos are social animals, often seen in groups called mobs. These groups provide safety in numbers and social interaction, which is important for their survival. Mobs are typically led by a dominant male, known as the alpha, who has breeding rights with the females in the group. <strong>(C)</strong>&nbsp; ……………&nbsp; The social structure of kangaroos plays a crucial role in their daily lives, influencing their behaviour and interactions.</p>
        <p>Kangaroos have a unique reproductive process. Female kangaroos give birth to tiny, underdeveloped young, known as joeys, after a short gestation period of about 30 to 36 days. The newborn joey then crawls into its mother’s pouch. <strong>(D)</strong>&nbsp; …………….&nbsp; The pouch provides a safe environment for the joey to nurse and grow until it is ready to venture out on its own. During this time, the mother provides all the necessary care and protection for her joey. The bond between a mother and her joey is strong, and the joey often returns to the pouch for safety even after it begins to explore the outside world.</p>
        <p>Kangaroos are generally abundant across Australia. <strong>(E)</strong>&nbsp; ……………&nbsp; However, they do face threats from habitat destruction, climate change, and human activities such as hunting and vehicle collisions. Conservation efforts are in place to ensure that kangaroo populations remain stable and that their habitats are protected for future generations. Organizations work to monitor kangaroo populations, manage their habitats, and promote sustainable practices.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Kangaroos hold a special place in Australian culture and are a symbol of the country’s unique wildlife. They appear in Aboriginal art and mythology, as well as public media and are featured prominently in the national emblem. The kangaroo’s image is also used by various Australian organizations and brands, highlighting its importance as a national icon. In Aboriginal culture, kangaroos are often seen as totems and are integral to various stories and traditions. <strong>(F)&nbsp;</strong> ………………..&nbsp; As a symbol of the country’s natural heritage, it is crucial to continue efforts to protect and preserve these remarkable animals and their habitats.&nbsp;</p>

One of the bravest and most successful efforts to save a life was performed by a 14-year-old girl named Christina M‘Kay near Palmer’s Island last week. On Tuesday, the 26th of March, five people were on their way in a sailing boat from Iluka to Rocky Mouth, when the boat was capsized by the carelessness of some of the occupants – probably due to a supply of gin said to be on board. One man, Mark Shelton, drowned at once, and the others, including Mrs Eugenie, were left struggling in the water. A boy named Carr saw this mishap and told Ms M‘Kay, and that brave young woman put off in her father’s boat to the scene of the accident. Miss M‘Kay was an accomplished oarswoman and soon reached the spot. With commendable coolness and at great personal risk, she managed to get the whole of the party into her boat, with the unfortunate exception of Shelton. One man, Arthur O’Connor, was quite unconscious, and the others struggled to hold on to the bottom of the capsized boat.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of bravery. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
Courage is a quality that resonates with us all, guiding us through life’s twists and turns with strength and perseverance. It’s not just about grand gestures and epic journeys; it’s about the everyday moments of bravery that shape our lives. Courage is about recognising that something more or different can be done, summoning the determination to act, and persisting despite obstacles. How do we develop courage? Just as we strengthen our muscles by working on our physical resilience, we can develop our emotional resilience and mental resilience. An adaptive resilience can help us to understand how to act in a given situation. It’s about stepping out of our comfort zones, taking risks, facing the tough times and embracing new challenges, even when they scare us a little. Developing courage isn’t about becoming fearless; it’s about learning to face our fears head-on, work with them, and push past them.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
<strong>Using the tabs above (Extracts A – D), read the four extracts on the theme of bravery. Then answer the questions opposite.</strong><br>
<br>
There’s little wonder why we have courageous heroes. We need them to get us through this challenging experience called life. Heroes help us survive, and they help us thrive. They help us through our worst times, and they prepare us for our best times. Heroes nurture us, save us, and help us become our best selves. Heroes truly do help us meet all the human needs that correspond to Abraham Maslow’s iconic hierarchy of needs. Perhaps the most extraordinary thing about heroes is that they don’t have to be physically present to help us survive and thrive. Research shows that just remembering our heroes can do the job for us. Nostalgia for past heroes, both living and dead, can produce the 12 benefits of heroism. Research on the impact of losing a parent at a young age has shown that people carry the departed parent with them forever, holding them in their minds, and imagining their emotional support and mentoring. We all benefit from the memory of our heroes, often in ways we’re unaware of.<br>

<br>
The ‘Unlikely Hero’ tells the action and adventure story of one of Yellowstone’s most famous animals, Wolf 8: a runt of the litter who surprised scientists by becoming a powerful leader. Newly reintroduced along with his pack to Yellowstone National Park, Wolf 8 struggles at first. Small and bullied by his siblings, he must learn to fend for himself in his new home – learning to hunt, compete for food, and even stand up to a grizzly bear 10 times his size. One day, little 8 meets an alpha female raising a litter of pups on her own. Her mate was killed by humans. Does little 8 have the courage to rise to the occasion and help the young family survive? Is he ready to be an alpha wolf?<br>

        <p><em>Read the extract below then answer the questions.</em><br><br>
Buck did not read the newspapers, or he would have known that trouble was brewing, not alone for himself, but for every tide-water dog, strong of muscle and with warm, long hair, from Puget Sound to San Diego. Because men, groping in the Arctic darkness, had found a yellow metal, and because steamship and transportation companies were booming the find, thousands of men were rushing into the Northland. These men wanted dogs, and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs, with strong muscles by which to toil, and furry coats to protect them from the frost.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Buck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley. Judge Miller’s place, it was called. It stood back from the road, half hidden among the trees, through which glimpses could be caught of the wide cool veranda that ran around its four sides. The house was approached by gravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns and under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars. At the rear things were on even a more spacious scale than at the front. There were great stables, where a dozen grooms and boys held forth, rows of vineclad servants’ cottages, an endless and orderly array of outhouses, long grape arbors, green pastures, orchards, and berry patches. Then there was the pumping plant for the artesian well, and the big cement tank where Judge Miller’s boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot afternoon.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span class="txt-underline"><strong>And over this great demesne Buck ruled</strong></span>. Here he was born, and here he had lived the four years of his life. It was true, there were other dogs, There could not but be other dogs on so vast a place, but they did not count. They came and went, resided in the populous kennels, or lived obscurely in the recesses of the house after the fashion of Toots, the Japanese pug, or Ysabel, the Mexican hairless,—strange creatures that rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground. On the other hand, there were the fox terriers, a score of them at least, who yelped fearful promises at Toots and Ysabel looking out of the windows at them and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with brooms and mops.</p>
        <p>But Buck was neither house-dog nor kennel-dog. The whole realm was his. He plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the Judge’s sons; he escorted Mollie and Alice, the Judge’s daughters, on long twilight or early morning rambles; on wintry nights he lay at the Judge’s feet before the roaring library fire; he carried the Judge’s grandsons on his back, or rolled them in the grass, and guarded their footsteps through wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable yard, and even beyond, where the paddocks were, and the berry patches. Among the terriers he stalked imperiously, and Toots and Ysabel he utterly ignored, for he was king,—king over all creeping, crawling, flying things of Judge Miller’s place, humans included.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>His father, Elmo, a huge St. Bernard, had been the Judge’s inseparable companion, and Buck bid fair to follow in the way of his father. He was not so large,—he weighed only one hundred and forty pounds,—for his mother, Shep, had been a Scotch shepherd dog. Nevertheless, one hundred and forty pounds, to which was added the dignity that comes of good living and universal respect, enabled him to carry himself in right royal fashion. During the four years since his puppyhood he had lived the life of a sated aristocrat; he had a fine pride in himself, was even a trifle egotistical, as country gentlemen sometimes become because of their insular situation. But he had saved himself by not becoming a mere pampered house-dog. Hunting and kindred outdoor delights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles; and to him, as to the cold-tubbing races, the love of water had been a tonic and a health preserver.</p>

Buck did not read the newspapers, or he would have known that trouble was brewing, not alone for himself, but for every tide-water dog, strong of muscle and with warm, long hair, from Puget Sound to San Diego. Because men, groping in the Arctic darkness, had found a yellow metal, and because steamship and transportation companies were booming the find, thousands of men were rushing into the Northland. These men wanted dogs, and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs, with strong muscles by which to toil, and furry coats to protect them from the frost.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Buck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley. Judge Miller’s place, it was called. It stood back from the road, half hidden among the trees, through which glimpses could be caught of the wide cool veranda that ran around its four sides. The house was approached by gravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns and under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars. At the rear things were on even a more spacious scale than at the front. There were great stables, where a dozen grooms and boys held forth, rows of vineclad servants’ cottages, an endless and orderly array of outhouses, long grape arbors, green pastures, orchards, and berry patches. Then there was the pumping plant for the artesian well, and the big cement tank where Judge Miller’s boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot afternoon.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span class="txt-underline"><strong>And over this great demesne Buck ruled</strong></span>. Here he was born, and here he had lived the four years of his life. It was true, there were other dogs, There could not but be other dogs on so vast a place, but they did not count. They came and went, resided in the populous kennels, or lived obscurely in the recesses of the house after the fashion of Toots, the Japanese pug, or Ysabel, the Mexican hairless,—strange creatures that rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground. On the other hand, there were the fox terriers, a score of them at least, who yelped fearful promises at Toots and Ysabel looking out of the windows at them and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with brooms and mops.</p>
        <p>But Buck was neither house-dog nor kennel-dog. The whole realm was his. He plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the Judge’s sons; he escorted Mollie and Alice, the Judge’s daughters, on long twilight or early morning rambles; on wintry nights he lay at the Judge’s feet before the roaring library fire; he carried the Judge’s grandsons on his back, or rolled them in the grass, and guarded their footsteps through wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable yard, and even beyond, where the paddocks were, and the berry patches. Among the terriers he stalked imperiously, and Toots and Ysabel he utterly ignored, for he was king,—king over all creeping, crawling, flying things of Judge Miller’s place, humans included.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>His father, Elmo, a huge St. Bernard, had been the Judge’s inseparable companion, and Buck bid fair to follow in the way of his father. He was not so large,—he weighed only one hundred and forty pounds,—for his mother, Shep, had been a Scotch shepherd dog. Nevertheless, one hundred and forty pounds, to which was added the dignity that comes of good living and universal respect, enabled him to carry himself in right royal fashion. During the four years since his puppyhood he had lived the life of a sated aristocrat; he had a fine pride in himself, was even a trifle egotistical, as country gentlemen sometimes become because of their insular situation. But he had saved himself by not becoming a mere pampered house-dog. Hunting and kindred outdoor delights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles; and to him, as to the cold-tubbing races, the love of water had been a tonic and a health preserver.</p>

Buck did not read the newspapers, or he would have known that trouble was brewing, not alone for himself, but for every tide-water dog, strong of muscle and with warm, long hair, from Puget Sound to San Diego. Because men, groping in the Arctic darkness, had found a yellow metal, and because steamship and transportation companies were booming the find, thousands of men were rushing into the Northland. These men wanted dogs, and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs, with strong muscles by which to toil, and furry coats to protect them from the frost.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Buck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley. Judge Miller’s place, it was called. It stood back from the road, half hidden among the trees, through which glimpses could be caught of the wide cool veranda that ran around its four sides. The house was approached by gravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns and under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars. At the rear things were on even a more spacious scale than at the front. There were great stables, where a dozen grooms and boys held forth, rows of vineclad servants’ cottages, an endless and orderly array of outhouses, long grape arbors, green pastures, orchards, and berry patches. Then there was the pumping plant for the artesian well, and the big cement tank where Judge Miller’s boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot afternoon.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span class="txt-underline"><strong>And over this great demesne Buck ruled</strong></span>. Here he was born, and here he had lived the four years of his life. It was true, there were other dogs, There could not but be other dogs on so vast a place, but they did not count. They came and went, resided in the populous kennels, or lived obscurely in the recesses of the house after the fashion of Toots, the Japanese pug, or Ysabel, the Mexican hairless,—strange creatures that rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground. On the other hand, there were the fox terriers, a score of them at least, who yelped fearful promises at Toots and Ysabel looking out of the windows at them and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with brooms and mops.</p>
        <p>But Buck was neither house-dog nor kennel-dog. The whole realm was his. He plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the Judge’s sons; he escorted Mollie and Alice, the Judge’s daughters, on long twilight or early morning rambles; on wintry nights he lay at the Judge’s feet before the roaring library fire; he carried the Judge’s grandsons on his back, or rolled them in the grass, and guarded their footsteps through wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable yard, and even beyond, where the paddocks were, and the berry patches. Among the terriers he stalked imperiously, and Toots and Ysabel he utterly ignored, for he was king,—king over all creeping, crawling, flying things of Judge Miller’s place, humans included.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>His father, Elmo, a huge St. Bernard, had been the Judge’s inseparable companion, and Buck bid fair to follow in the way of his father. He was not so large,—he weighed only one hundred and forty pounds,—for his mother, Shep, had been a Scotch shepherd dog. Nevertheless, one hundred and forty pounds, to which was added the dignity that comes of good living and universal respect, enabled him to carry himself in right royal fashion. During the four years since his puppyhood he had lived the life of a sated aristocrat; he had a fine pride in himself, was even a trifle egotistical, as country gentlemen sometimes become because of their insular situation. But he had saved himself by not becoming a mere pampered house-dog. Hunting and kindred outdoor delights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles; and to him, as to the cold-tubbing races, the love of water had been a tonic and a health preserver.</p>

        <p><em>Read the extract below then answer the questions.</em><br><br>
Buck did not read the newspapers, or he would have known that trouble was brewing, not alone for himself, but for every tide-water dog, strong of muscle and with warm, long hair, from Puget Sound to San Diego. Because men, groping in the Arctic darkness, had found a yellow metal, and because steamship and transportation companies were booming the find, thousands of men were rushing into the Northland. These men wanted dogs, and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs, with strong muscles by which to toil, and furry coats to protect them from the frost.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Buck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley. Judge Miller’s place, it was called. It stood back from the road, half hidden among the trees, through which glimpses could be caught of the wide cool veranda that ran around its four sides. The house was approached by gravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns and under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars. At the rear things were on even a more spacious scale than at the front. There were great stables, where a dozen grooms and boys held forth, rows of vineclad servants’ cottages, an endless and orderly array of outhouses, long grape arbors, green pastures, orchards, and berry patches. Then there was the pumping plant for the artesian well, and the big cement tank where Judge Miller’s boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot afternoon.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span class="txt-underline"><strong>And over this great demesne Buck ruled</strong></span>. Here he was born, and here he had lived the four years of his life. It was true, there were other dogs, There could not but be other dogs on so vast a place, but they did not count. They came and went, resided in the populous kennels, or lived obscurely in the recesses of the house after the fashion of Toots, the Japanese pug, or Ysabel, the Mexican hairless,—strange creatures that rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground. On the other hand, there were the fox terriers, a score of them at least, who yelped fearful promises at Toots and Ysabel looking out of the windows at them and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with brooms and mops.</p>
        <p>But Buck was neither house-dog nor kennel-dog. The whole realm was his. He plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the Judge’s sons; he escorted Mollie and Alice, the Judge’s daughters, on long twilight or early morning rambles; on wintry nights he lay at the Judge’s feet before the roaring library fire; he carried the Judge’s grandsons on his back, or rolled them in the grass, and guarded their footsteps through wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable yard, and even beyond, where the paddocks were, and the berry patches. Among the terriers he stalked imperiously, and Toots and Ysabel he utterly ignored, for he was king,—king over all creeping, crawling, flying things of Judge Miller’s place, humans included.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>His father, Elmo, a huge St. Bernard, had been the Judge’s inseparable companion, and Buck bid fair to follow in the way of his father. He was not so large,—he weighed only one hundred and forty pounds,—for his mother, Shep, had been a Scotch shepherd dog. Nevertheless, one hundred and forty pounds, to which was added the dignity that comes of good living and universal respect, enabled him to carry himself in right royal fashion. During the four years since his puppyhood he had lived the life of a sated aristocrat; he had a fine pride in himself, was even a trifle egotistical, as country gentlemen sometimes become because of their insular situation. But he had saved himself by not becoming a mere pampered house-dog. Hunting and kindred outdoor delights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles; and to him, as to the cold-tubbing races, the love of water had been a tonic and a health preserver.</p>

A snake came to my water-trough<br>
On a hot, hot day, and I in pyjamas for the heat,<br>
To drink there.</p>
        <p>In the deep, strange-scented shade of the great dark carob-tree<br>
I came down the steps with my pitcher<br>
And must wait, must stand and wait, for there he was at the<br>
trough before me.</p>
        <p>He reached down from a fissure in the earth-wall in the gloom<br>
And trailed his yellow-brown slackness soft-bellied down, over the<br>
edge of the stone trough</p>
        <p>And rested his throat upon the stone bottom,<br>
And where the water had dripped from the tap, in a small<br>
clearness,</p>
        <p>He sipped with his straight mouth,<br>
Softly drank through his straight gums, into his slack long body,<br>
Silently.</p>
        <p>Someone was before me at my water-trough,<br>
And I, like a second comer, waiting.<br>
He lifted his head from his drinking, as cattle do,<br>
And looked at me vaguely, as drinking cattle do,<br>
And flickered his two-forked tongue from his lips, and mused a<br>
moment,<br>
And stooped and drank a little more,<br>
Being earth-brown, earth-golden from the burning bowels of the<br>
earth<br>

        <p><em>Read the poem below then answer the questions.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Snake</strong><br><br>
A snake came to my water-trough<br>
On a hot, hot day, and I in pyjamas for the heat,<br>
To drink there.</p>
        <p>In the deep, strange-scented shade of the great dark carob-tree<br>
I came down the steps with my pitcher<br>
And must wait, must stand and wait, for there he was at the<br>
trough before me.</p>
        <p>He reached down from a fissure in the earth-wall in the gloom<br>
And trailed his yellow-brown slackness soft-bellied down, over the<br>
edge of the stone trough</p>
        <p>And rested his throat upon the stone bottom,<br>
And where the water had dripped from the tap, in a small<br>
clearness,</p>
        <p>He sipped with his straight mouth,<br>
Softly drank through his straight gums, into his slack long body,<br>
Silently.</p>
        <p>Someone was before me at my water-trough,<br>
And I, like a second comer, waiting.<br>
He lifted his head from his drinking, as cattle do,<br>
And looked at me vaguely, as drinking cattle do,<br>
And flickered his two-forked tongue from his lips, and mused a<br>
moment,<br>
And stooped and drank a little more,<br>
Being earth-brown, earth-golden from the burning bowels of the<br>
earth<br>
...</p>
