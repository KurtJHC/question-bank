When I was (firmly) standing on stage, I felt free. I was addicted to the applause, even though most of the time I felt like I didn’t deserve it. Maybe if they just clapped harder, I would feel validated. Maybe if they just wolf-whistled louder, I could shake off my imposter syndrome. Maybe if I got a standing ovation, I could prove the haters wrong. In an attempt to scratch my itch, I co-wrote a stage show called Remote Control with my sister-in-law Genevieve, about a woman who had become so addicted to her television that she entirely lost her grasp on reality. Yes, it was semiautobiographical, based on the many, many hours I’d spent sitting in front of the idiot box wishing my life were a sitcom. One night, we played the show to a full house of five hundred people, and I went to bed afterwards happier than a human can be. I think I smiled in my sleep.<br>

Stage presence is the ability of a performer to capture and command the attention of an audience, directing and controlling that attention by being impressive in one’s visual appearance, body language, charismatic speech, and general mannerisms.<br>
<br>
Out of all the things you’re actively doing on stage, that only controls about 50% of what other people think of you. The other 50% is unspoken and comes from your body language. That means you can’t stand there like a statue behind your instrument or the mic stand. You need to be moving to the music. Don’t fidget about. Don’t cross your arms. Don’t sit down. Anything that you see other people do when they’re uncomfortable, nervous, and self-conscious are all of the things you want to stay as far away from as possible.<br>
<br>
All of this shows dominance and confidence. And without those two characteristics, nobody is going to want to look at you, let alone for an hour or more straight. You must be the alpha in the room that everyone would be watching even if they weren’t in the spotlight.<br>

Being a part of Manchester Valley’s drama club has been by far the most rewarding part of high school aside from the education itself. It has taught me the value of cooperation and compromise, patience, and time, allowing me to improve these skills within my own life – time management and prioritizing being a huge one. Throughout my experiences in theater, I’ve faced plenty of differing opinions that required each team of people working on the show to come together to find what will work with other components. (In one show, lighting became a major issue with set design since certain lighting colors clashed with the paint colors on the set pieces). Being in the club and lengthy list of shows has also given me a group of supportive people who I could go to in times of need – a largely diverse group of people that I probably wouldn’t have met otherwise. Drama has also provided me with an outlet to express myself, acting as a stress reliever while I was able to perform. Perhaps one of the greatest attributes I gained from theater, was learning stage presence and feeling confident and comfortable in front of a crowd – if not acting like it. This has proved to be undeniably helpful during class presentations, which I’m not sure I would be able to make it through without my experiences from drama.<br>

<strong>CHALKFACE</strong><br>
<em>by Angela Betzien<br>
Directed by Jessica Arthur</em><br>
<br>
What happens in the staff room, stays in the staff room.<br>
<br>
Played by the fantastic Catherine McClements, Pat is a jaded, stalwart primary school teacher who isn’t afraid to voice her opinions: all kids are terrors, the school’s a zoo and her colleagues are nitwits. Enter Anna, played by Stephanie Somerville in her STC mainstage debut, who is bright-eyed, idealistic and just out of university. Anna’s going to change the world, one gold star at a time.<br>
<br>
As you might suspect, these two don’t quite see eye to eye.<br>
<br>
In a hilarious new black comedy from the brilliant mind of Angela Betzien (The Hanging, ABC’s Total Control), audiences will get a sneak peek into one of society’s biggest mysteries: the teachers’ staff room. A mashup of The Office and Teachers, Chalkface is the rowdy tale of two teachers who must put their differences aside to stand up for what’s right – even if it means throwing out the rule book altogether.<br>

When I was (firmly) standing on stage, I felt free. I was addicted to the applause, even though most of the time I felt like I didn’t deserve it. Maybe if they just clapped harder, I would feel validated. Maybe if they just wolf-whistled louder, I could shake off my imposter syndrome. Maybe if I got a standing ovation, I could prove the haters wrong. In an attempt to scratch my itch, I co-wrote a stage show called Remote Control with my sister-in-law Genevieve, about a woman who had become so addicted to her television that she entirely lost her grasp on reality. Yes, it was semiautobiographical, based on the many, many hours I’d spent sitting in front of the idiot box wishing my life were a sitcom. One night, we played the show to a full house of five hundred people, and I went to bed afterwards happier than a human can be. I think I smiled in my sleep.<br>

{^ <strong>Extract B</strong> ^}<br>
Stage presence is the ability of a performer to capture and command the attention of an audience, directing and controlling that attention by being impressive in one’s visual appearance, body language, charismatic speech, and general mannerisms.<br>
<br>
Out of all the things you’re actively doing on stage, that only controls about 50% of what other people think of you. The other 50% is unspoken and comes from your body language. That means you can’t stand there like a statue behind your instrument or the mic stand. You need to be moving to the music. Don’t fidget about. Don’t cross your arms. Don’t sit down. Anything that you see other people do when they’re uncomfortable, nervous, and self-conscious are all of the things you want to stay as far away from as possible.<br>
<br>
All of this shows dominance and confidence. And without those two characteristics, nobody is going to want to look at you, let alone for an hour or more straight. You must be the alpha in the room that everyone would be watching even if they weren’t in the spotlight.<br>

{^ <strong>Extract C</strong> ^}<br>
Being a part of Manchester Valley’s drama club has been by far the most rewarding part of high school aside from the education itself. It has taught me the value of cooperation and compromise, patience, and time, allowing me to improve these skills within my own life – time management and prioritizing being a huge one. Throughout my experiences in theater, I’ve faced plenty of differing opinions that required each team of people working on the show to come together to find what will work with other components. (In one show, lighting became a major issue with set design since certain lighting colors clashed with the paint colors on the set pieces). Being in the club and lengthy list of shows has also given me a group of supportive people who I could go to in times of need – a largely diverse group of people that I probably wouldn’t have met otherwise. Drama has also provided me with an outlet to express myself, acting as a stress reliever while I was able to perform. Perhaps one of the greatest attributes I gained from theater, was learning stage presence and feeling confident and comfortable in front of a crowd – if not acting like it. This has proved to be undeniably helpful during class presentations, which I’m not sure I would be able to make it through without my experiences from drama.<br>

<strong>CHALKFACE</strong><br>
<em>by Angela Betzien<br>
Directed by Jessica Arthur</em><br>
<br>
What happens in the staff room, stays in the staff room.<br>
<br>
Played by the fantastic Catherine McClements, Pat is a jaded, stalwart primary school teacher who isn’t afraid to voice her opinions: all kids are terrors, the school’s a zoo and her colleagues are nitwits. Enter Anna, played by Stephanie Somerville in her STC mainstage debut, who is bright-eyed, idealistic and just out of university. Anna’s going to change the world, one gold star at a time.<br>
<br>
As you might suspect, these two don’t quite see eye to eye.<br>
<br>
In a hilarious new black comedy from the brilliant mind of Angela Betzien (The Hanging, ABC’s Total Control), audiences will get a sneak peek into one of society’s biggest mysteries: the teachers’ staff room. A mashup of The Office and Teachers, Chalkface is the rowdy tale of two teachers who must put their differences aside to stand up for what’s right – even if it means throwing out the rule book altogether.<br>

Drama has also provided me with an outlet to express myself, acting as a stress reliever while I was able to perform. Perhaps one of the greatest attributes I gained from theater, was learning stage presence and feeling confident and comfortable in front of a crowd – if not acting like it. This has proved to be undeniably helpful during class presentations, which I’m not sure I would be able to make it through without my experiences from drama.<br>

<strong>CHALKFACE</strong><br>
<em>by Angela Betzien<br>
Directed by Jessica Arthur</em><br>
<br>
What happens in the staff room, stays in the staff room.<br>
<br>
Played by the fantastic Catherine McClements, Pat is a jaded, stalwart primary school teacher who isn’t afraid to voice her opinions: all kids are terrors, the school’s a zoo and her colleagues are nitwits. Enter Anna, played by Stephanie Somerville in her STC mainstage debut, who is bright-eyed, idealistic and just out of university. Anna’s going to change the world, one gold star at a time.<br>
<br>
As you might suspect, these two don’t quite see eye to eye.<br>
<br>
In a hilarious new black comedy from the brilliant mind of Angela Betzien (The Hanging, ABC’s Total Control), audiences will get a sneak peek into one of society’s biggest mysteries: the teachers’ staff room. A mashup of The Office and Teachers, Chalkface is the rowdy tale of two teachers who must put their differences aside to stand up for what’s right – even if it means throwing out the rule book altogether.<br>

When I was (firmly) standing on stage, I felt free. I was addicted to the applause, even though most of the time I felt like I didn’t deserve it. Maybe if they just clapped harder, I would feel validated. Maybe if they just wolf-whistled louder, I could shake off my imposter syndrome. Maybe if I got a standing ovation, I could prove the haters wrong. In an attempt to scratch my itch, I co-wrote a stage show called Remote Control with my sister-in-law Genevieve, about a woman who had become so addicted to her television that she entirely lost her grasp on reality. Yes, it was semiautobiographical, based on the many, many hours I’d spent sitting in front of the idiot box wishing my life were a sitcom. One night, we played the show to a full house of five hundred people, and I went to bed afterwards happier than a human can be. I think I smiled in my sleep.<br>

{^ <strong>Extract B</strong> ^}<br>
Stage presence is the ability of a performer to capture and command the attention of an audience, directing and controlling that attention by being impressive in one’s visual appearance, body language, charismatic speech, and general mannerisms.<br>
<br>
Out of all the things you’re actively doing on stage, that only controls about 50% of what other people think of you. The other 50% is unspoken and comes from your body language. That means you can’t stand there like a statue behind your instrument or the mic stand. You need to be moving to the music. Don’t fidget about. Don’t cross your arms. Don’t sit down. Anything that you see other people do when they’re uncomfortable, nervous, and self-conscious are all of the things you want to stay as far away from as possible.<br>
<br>
All of this shows dominance and confidence. And without those two characteristics, nobody is going to want to look at you, let alone for an hour or more straight. You must be the alpha in the room that everyone would be watching even if they weren’t in the spotlight.<br>
<br>
{^ <strong>Extract C</strong> ^}<br>
Being a part of Manchester Valley’s drama club has been by far the most rewarding part of high school aside from the education itself. It has taught me the value of cooperation and compromise, patience, and time, allowing me to improve these skills within my own life – time management and prioritizing being a huge one. Throughout my experiences in theater, I’ve faced plenty of differing opinions that required each team of people working on the show to come together to find what will work with other components. (In one show, lighting became a major issue with set design since certain lighting colors clashed with the paint colors on the set pieces).

<strong>NEST EGGS</strong><br>
<br>
Birds all the sunny day<br>
&nbsp; Flutter and quarrel<br>
Here in the arbour-like<br>
&nbsp; Tent of the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>laurel.</strong></span><br>
<br>
Here in the fork<br>
&nbsp; The brown nest is seated;<br>
Four little blue eggs<br>
&nbsp; The mother keeps heated.<br>
<br>
While we stand watching her<br>
&nbsp; Staring like gabies,<br>
Safe in each egg are the<br>
&nbsp; Bird’s little babies.<br>
<br>
Soon the frail eggs they shall<br>
&nbsp; Chip, and upspringing<br>
Make all the April woods<br>
&nbsp; Merry with singing.<br>
<br>
Younger than we are,<br>
&nbsp; O children, and frailer,<br>
Soon in the blue air they’ll be,<br>
&nbsp; Singer and sailor.<br>
<br>
We, so much older,<br>
&nbsp; Taller and stronger,<br>
We shall look down on the<br>
&nbsp; Birdies no longer.<br>
<br>
They shall go flying<br>
&nbsp; With musical speeches<br>
High overhead in the<br>
&nbsp; Tops of the beeches.<br>
<br>
