          <strong>Hastin’s Big Chance</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; As usual, it was a scorching summer day in southern India. Hastin wiped the sweat from his forehead and wished for a cool breeze. He reached into his bag and pulled out a mango. He tore into the fleshy orange fruit with his teeth and wiped the juice from his chin. Sandos, his elephant, wandered over to Hastin. The elephant tried to swipe the mango from Hastin’s hand with his trunk. Hastin laughed and tore off a piece for his playful friend.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hastin had a deep affection for his elephant. The two had been together since Hastin was eight years old and Sandos was two years old. In the five years they had been together, Sandos had grown to be one of the strongest elephants living in the Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary. Yet the elephant was always gentle with Hastin. Hastin had become very fond of his giant friend.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As Hastin and Sandos rested, they watched Hastin’s father clear a road with the mahouts, or elephant trainers, who worked on clearing the roads. The mahouts were working with their elephants to remove some trees that had been knocked into the road by wild elephants. The sanctuary where the mahouts and elephants worked and lived had many visitors. The roads needed to be clear so the visitors could drive safely through the park.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hastin watched as the elephants moved the trees with their tusks. As he watched, he thought about becoming a mahout one day. However, there were few positions available. It would be difficult to become a mahout and get a job at the sanctuary. Hastin would have to prove to the head mahout that he could control an elephant before he would be considered for a position.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As a mahout, Hastin would work with the elephants, doing many jobs for the sanctuary. Besides moving trees, the mahouts and the trained elephants also worked to control wild elephants. The wild elephants sometimes wandered out of the sanctuary. They would go into the surrounding fields where the farmers had planted their crops. The farmers often called on the mahouts to take the wild elephants back to the sanctuary.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After Hastin had rested awhile, he heard several yells from the mahouts. “Hastin! Come quickly! I need you!” his father shouted to him. His call sounded <span class="txt-underline">urgent</span>.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hastin jumped up. “Dray, Sandos!” The elephant acknowledged the command by holding out its front foot. Hastin climbed the foot like a ladder and grabbed the chain collar around Sandos’s neck to pull himself up. “Hut!” Hastin said. As the elephant began moving forward, Hastin tucked his feet under the chain collar to keep from falling.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hastin rode toward his father and immediately saw what the problem was. A jeep carrying food and supplies had hit a tree in the road. The jeep had rolled onto its side and was blocking the road. Nearby, other trained elephants, not quite strong enough to move the jeep, began to eat the spilled food as the confused driver walked to safety.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hastin’s father looked at him. “Your elephant is one of the strongest. Now is the time to prove that you can be a mahout.”</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hastin knew t h at his father was right. Hastin took a deep breath. “Hut!” he said to Sandos with confidence in his voice. Heled Sandos to the jeep. As Hastin gave the commands, the large elephant leaned its head against the side of the jeep and pushed. The jeep moved but not enough. Again Hastin gave the orders, and Sandos followed his commands. As the elephant pushed, the jeep slowly rolled back onto all four wheels.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The other mahouts congratulated Hastin on a great job. The head mahout walked over to Hastin. “You have proved to me that you and Sandos are ready. Your training is complete. Beginning tomorrow, you will work with the other mahouts and elephants.”</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hastin smiled, feeling great joy in his heart. He and Sandos would finally be able to work alongside his father and the other mahouts. Hastin lay his body over Sandos’s head. He felt the strength of the leathery creature beneath him. He was glad that Sandos had followed his commands. He was also thankful for the friendship he had with Sandos. As Hastin and Sandos made their way back, they moved as one, elephant and mahout.</p>

          <strong>Tía Lidia Weaves a Story</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Ñanduti <em>is a type of thin lace handmade by women in Paraguay. </em>Ñanduti <em>can be made into many things, such as a scarf, tablecloth, or blanket. </em>A mantilla<em> is often made of this fine lace. It is worn by some women like a veil over their head and shoulders.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; As Celina walked along the main road in the town of Itaugua, Paraguay, she smiled at all the wonderful sights and smells. Along the side of the road, men and women sold goods from their street shops. Some were selling beans and peanuts, while others sold hats, mats, and many other things. Celina paused at one of the many shops where women were selling <em>mantillas</em>. She admired the delicate lace <em>mantillas </em>that many women in Paraguay both sell and wear. Most of the lace <em>mantillas </em>were white, but some were more colorful. At last Celina hurried on to Tía Lidia’s house. Celina liked to visit her aunt every day.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Like the women Celina had seen at the street shops, Tía Lidia made lace. Celina had always been fascinated by the wooden frame that stood in the corner of the house. She loved to watch her aunt stand at the frame, working the delicate strands of linen or silk. Most of all, she loved the pretty lace pieces called&nbsp;<em>ñanduti&nbsp;</em>that Tía Lidia created. Tía Lidia made everything from small lace collars to long, flowing dresses.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, when Celina arrived at her aunt’s house, Tía Lidia was working on an elegant lace tablecloth. She had been working on the tablecloth for several weeks. First Tía Lidia had placed a sheet of linen on the wooden frame. Then she had drawn a pattern of circles and fancy designs on the material. Finally she had begun carefully removing some of the threads from the material and weaving other threads across the open spaces. It was a difficult process that would produce a thin, detailed lace.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As Tía Lidia worked, Celina walked around the room and admired some of the lovely pieces her aunt had made. She smiled when she saw one rectangular piece of lace that lay over a bench. Celina carefully lifted it and settled it over her head like a veil. She peered out from behind the finely woven patterns. She thought that this must be how the world looked to new brides.</p>
        <p>“This looks like a spider’s web,” she said.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“That’s because that’s what it is,” Tía Lidia said, winking. “In Guaraní, the old language of Paraguay, ñanduti means ‘web.’” Tía Lidia paused as she carefully wove a thread into the tablecloth. “Have I ever told you the story of the white spider?” she asked at last.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“No, Tía Lidia. Tell me!”</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The dark-haired woman stepped away from the frame and smoothed her colorful skirt. “Every young girl in Paraguay should know this story. But this story needs a nice cup of yerba mate.” As Tía Lidia prepared the hot drink, she told Celina about the lace Tía Lidia’s mother had woven. “My mother told me this story when I was learning to make ñanduti.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“A very long time ago,” Tía Lidia began, “when a young man named Juan was fetching water for his mother to make tea with, he saw a white spider struggling in the stream. Quickly he scooped out the spider and placed it gently on the leaves of a yerba tree.”</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Isn’t this yerba mate made from the leaves of a yerba tree?” Celina asked.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“That’s right,” Tía Lidia said with a&nbsp;smile. “Every day, when Juan went to fill up the water jugs, he saw the white spider waiting for him. He began to think of the spider as a friend to whom he could tell all his troubles. One day he told the spider about a lovely woman with whom he had fallen in love. However, in those days, it was the custom in Paraguay for a woman’s father to choose her husband. This woman’s father had said, ‘I want to&nbsp;make sure my daughter is well cared for. Whoever brings forth the most wonderful and original gift shall win her hand.’ Juan was&nbsp;very sad. He knew he could never afford such a gift. The next day, however, when he returned to the spring, he saw that his friend was almost finished spinning a fragile silk cloth. Juan could see that it was the most exquisite lace mantilla he had ever seen. Juan knew the mantilla would look lovely draped around the shoulders of the woman he adored.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“The patterns of the mantilla were of all the native flowers of the area. Leaves and vines and drops of dew then surrounded the flowers. Instantly Juan understood what the spider had done. He ran off to present his gift. When he reached the village and placed the mantilla upon the woman, her face immediately lit up. She was radiant. Everyone around her gasped. They all knew at once&nbsp;that this mantilla was the most wonderful gift a woman could receive. Juan and the woman were married right away.”</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“From then on,” finished Tía Lidia, “the women of Paraguay have tried to duplicate the delicate lace. We have woven the lace for years, but no one has been able to equal that made by the white spider. Still, our lace is famous for its splendor.”</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Celina smiled at the wonderful tale she had just heard. “Now that I know the story of the white spider, perhaps it is time I learned to make lace.”</p>

          <strong>Tía Lidia Weaves a Story</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Ñanduti <em>is a type of thin lace handmade by women in Paraguay. </em>Ñanduti <em>can be made into many things, such as a scarf, tablecloth, or blanket. </em>A mantilla<em> is often made of this fine lace. It is worn by some women like a veil over their head and shoulders.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; As Celina walked along the main road in the town of Itaugua, Paraguay, she smiled at all the wonderful sights and smells. Along the side of the road, men and women sold goods from their street shops. Some were selling beans and peanuts, while others sold hats, mats, and many other things. Celina paused at one of the many shops where women were selling <em>mantillas</em>. She admired the delicate lace <em>mantillas </em>that many women in Paraguay both sell and wear. Most of the lace <em>mantillas </em>were white, but some were more colorful. At last Celina hurried on to Tía Lidia’s house. Celina liked to visit her aunt every day.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Like the women Celina had seen at the street shops, Tía Lidia made lace. Celina had always been fascinated by the wooden frame that stood in the corner of the house. She loved to watch her aunt stand at the frame, working the delicate strands of linen or silk. Most of all, she loved the pretty lace pieces called&nbsp;<em>ñanduti&nbsp;</em>that Tía Lidia created. Tía Lidia made everything from small lace collars to long, flowing dresses.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, when Celina arrived at her aunt’s house, Tía Lidia was working on an elegant lace tablecloth. She had been working on the tablecloth for several weeks. First Tía Lidia had placed a sheet of linen on the wooden frame. Then she had drawn a pattern of circles and fancy designs on the material. Finally she had begun carefully removing some of the threads from the material and weaving other threads across the open spaces. It was a difficult process that would produce a thin, detailed lace.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As Tía Lidia worked, Celina walked around the room and admired some of the lovely pieces her aunt had made. She smiled when she saw one rectangular piece of lace that lay over a bench. Celina carefully lifted it and settled it over her head like a veil. She peered out from behind the finely woven patterns. She thought that this must be how the world looked to new brides.</p>

Along the side of the road, men and women sold goods from their street shops. Some were selling beans and peanuts, while others sold hats, mats, and many other things. Celina paused at one of the many shops where women were selling <em>mantillas</em>. She admired the delicate lace <em>mantillas </em>that many women in Paraguay both sell and wear. Most of the lace <em>mantillas </em>were white, but some were more colorful. At last Celina hurried on to Tía Lidia’s house. Celina liked to visit her aunt every day.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Like the women Celina had seen at the street shops, Tía Lidia made lace. Celina had always been fascinated by the wooden frame that stood in the corner of the house. She loved to watch her aunt stand at the frame, working the delicate strands of linen or silk. Most of all, she loved the pretty lace pieces called&nbsp;<em>ñanduti&nbsp;</em>that Tía Lidia created. Tía Lidia made everything from small lace collars to long, flowing dresses.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, when Celina arrived at her aunt’s house, Tía Lidia was working on an elegant lace tablecloth. She had been working on the tablecloth for several weeks. First Tía Lidia had placed a sheet of linen on the wooden frame. Then she had drawn a pattern of circles and fancy designs on the material. Finally she had begun carefully removing some of the threads from the material and weaving other threads across the open spaces. It was a difficult process that would produce a thin, detailed lace.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As Tía Lidia worked, Celina walked around the room and admired some of the lovely pieces her aunt had made. She smiled when she saw one rectangular piece of lace that lay over a bench. Celina carefully lifted it and settled it over her head like a veil. She peered out from behind the finely woven patterns. She thought that this must be how the world looked to new brides.</p>
        <p>“This looks like a spider’s web,” she said.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“That’s because that’s what it is,” Tía Lidia said, winking. “In Guaraní, the old language of Paraguay, ñanduti means ‘web.’” Tía Lidia paused as she carefully wove a thread into the tablecloth. “Have I ever told you the story of the white spider?” she asked at last.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“No, Tía Lidia. Tell me!”</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The dark-haired woman stepped away from the frame and smoothed her colorful skirt. “Every young girl in Paraguay should know this story. But this story needs a nice cup of yerba mate.” As Tía Lidia prepared the hot drink, she told Celina about the lace Tía Lidia’s mother had woven. “My mother told me this story when I was learning to make ñanduti.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“A very long time ago,” Tía Lidia began, “when a young man named Juan was fetching water for his mother to make tea with, he saw a white spider struggling in the stream. Quickly he scooped out the spider and placed it gently on the leaves of a yerba tree.”</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Isn’t this yerba mate made from the leaves of a yerba tree?” Celina asked.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“That’s right,” Tía Lidia said with a&nbsp;smile. “Every day, when Juan went to fill up the water jugs, he saw the white spider waiting for him. He began to think of the spider as a friend to whom he could tell all his troubles. One day he told the spider about a lovely woman with whom he had fallen in love. However, in those days, it was the custom in Paraguay for a woman’s father to choose her husband. This woman’s father had said, ‘I want to&nbsp;make sure my daughter is well cared for. Whoever brings forth the most wonderful and original gift shall win her hand.’ Juan was&nbsp;very sad. He knew he could never afford such a gift. The next day, however, when he returned to the spring, he saw that his friend was almost finished spinning a fragile silk cloth. Juan could see that it was the most exquisite lace mantilla he had ever seen. Juan knew the mantilla would look lovely draped around the shoulders of the woman he adored.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“The patterns of the mantilla were of all the native flowers of the area. Leaves and vines and drops of dew then surrounded the flowers. Instantly Juan understood what the spider had done. He ran off to present his gift. When he reached the village and placed the mantilla upon the woman, her face immediately lit up. She was radiant. Everyone around her gasped. They all knew at once&nbsp;that this mantilla was the most wonderful gift a woman could receive. Juan and the woman were married right away.”</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“From then on,” finished Tía Lidia, “the women of Paraguay have tried to duplicate the delicate lace. We have woven the lace for years, but no one has been able to equal that made by the white spider. Still, our lace is famous for its splendor.”</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Celina smiled at the wonderful tale she had just heard. “Now that I know the story of the white spider, perhaps it is time I learned to make lace.”</p>

          <strong>Tía Lidia Weaves a Story</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Ñanduti <em>is a type of thin lace handmade by women in Paraguay. </em>Ñanduti <em>can be made into many things, such as a scarf, tablecloth, or blanket. </em>A mantilla<em> is often made of this fine lace. It is worn by some women like a veil over their head and shoulders.</em></p>

          <strong>Tía Lidia Weaves a Story</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Ñanduti <em>is a type of thin lace handmade by women in Paraguay. </em>Ñanduti <em>can be made into many things, such as a scarf, tablecloth, or blanket. </em>A mantilla<em> is often made of this fine lace. It is worn by some women like a veil over their head and shoulders.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; As Celina walked along the main road in the town of Itaugua, Paraguay, she smiled at all the wonderful sights and smells. Along the side of the road, men and women sold goods from their street shops. Some were selling beans and peanuts, while others sold hats, mats, and many other things. Celina paused at one of the many shops where women were selling <em>mantillas</em>. She admired the delicate lace <em>mantillas </em>that many women in Paraguay both sell and wear. Most of the lace <em>mantillas </em>were white, but some were more colorful. At last Celina hurried on to Tía Lidia’s house. Celina liked to visit her aunt every day.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Like the women Celina had seen at the street shops, Tía Lidia made lace. Celina had always been fascinated by the wooden frame that stood in the corner of the house. She loved to watch her aunt stand at the frame, working the delicate strands of linen or silk. Most of all, she loved the pretty lace pieces called&nbsp;<em>ñanduti&nbsp;</em>that Tía Lidia created. Tía Lidia made everything from small lace collars to long, flowing dresses.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, when Celina arrived at her aunt’s house, Tía Lidia was working on an elegant lace tablecloth. She had been working on the tablecloth for several weeks. First Tía Lidia had placed a sheet of linen on the wooden frame. Then she had drawn a pattern of circles and fancy designs on the material. Finally she had begun carefully removing some of the threads from the material and weaving other threads across the open spaces. It was a difficult process that would produce a thin, detailed lace.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As Tía Lidia worked, Celina walked around the room and admired some of the lovely pieces her aunt had made. She smiled when she saw one rectangular piece of lace that lay over a bench. Celina carefully lifted it and settled it over her head like a veil. She peered out from behind the finely woven patterns. She thought that this must be how the world looked to new brides.</p>
        <p>“This looks like a spider’s web,” she said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“That’s because that’s what it is,” Tía Lidia said, winking. “In Guaraní, the old language of Paraguay, ñanduti means ‘web.’” Tía Lidia paused as she carefully wove a thread into the tablecloth. “Have I ever told you the story of the white spider?” she asked at last.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“No, Tía Lidia. Tell me!”</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The dark-haired woman stepped away from the frame and smoothed her colorful skirt. “Every young girl in Paraguay should know this story. But this story needs a nice cup of yerba mate.” As Tía Lidia prepared the hot drink, she told Celina about the lace Tía Lidia’s mother had woven. “My mother told me this story when I was learning to make ñanduti.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“A very long time ago,” Tía Lidia began, “when a young man named Juan was fetching water for his mother to make tea with, he saw a white spider struggling in the stream. Quickly he scooped out the spider and placed it gently on the leaves of a yerba tree.”</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Isn’t this yerba mate made from the leaves of a yerba tree?” Celina asked.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“That’s right,” Tía Lidia said with a&nbsp;smile. “Every day, when Juan went to fill up the water jugs, he saw the white spider waiting for him. He began to think of the spider as a friend to whom he could tell all his troubles. One day he told the spider about a lovely woman with whom he had fallen in love. However, in those days, it was the custom in Paraguay for a woman’s father to choose her husband. This woman’s father had said, ‘I want to&nbsp;make sure my daughter is well cared for. Whoever brings forth the most wonderful and original gift shall win her hand.’ Juan was&nbsp;very sad. He knew he could never afford such a gift. The next day, however, when he returned to the spring, he saw that his friend was almost finished spinning a fragile silk cloth. Juan could see that it was the most exquisite lace mantilla he had ever seen. Juan knew the mantilla would look lovely draped around the shoulders of the woman he adored.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“The patterns of the mantilla were of all the native flowers of the area. Leaves and vines and drops of dew then surrounded the flowers. Instantly Juan understood what the spider had done. He ran off to present his gift. When he reached the village and placed the mantilla upon the woman, her face immediately lit up. She was radiant. Everyone around her gasped. They all knew at once&nbsp;that this mantilla was the most wonderful gift a woman could receive. Juan and the woman were married right away.”</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“From then on,” finished Tía Lidia, “the women of Paraguay have tried to duplicate the delicate lace. We have woven the lace for years, but no one has been able to equal that made by the white spider. Still, our lace is famous for its splendor.”</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Celina smiled at the wonderful tale she had just heard. “Now that I know the story of the white spider, perhaps it is time I learned to make lace.”</p>

          <strong>Tía Lidia Weaves a Story</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Ñanduti <em>is a type of thin lace handmade by women in Paraguay. </em>Ñanduti <em>can be made into many things, such as a scarf, tablecloth, or blanket. </em>A mantilla<em> is often made of this fine lace. It is worn by some women like a veil over their head and shoulders.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; As Celina walked along the main road in the town of Itaugua, Paraguay, she smiled at all the wonderful sights and smells. Along the side of the road, men and women sold goods from their street shops. Some were selling beans and peanuts, while others sold hats, mats, and many other things. Celina paused at one of the many shops where women were selling <em>mantillas</em>. She admired the delicate lace <em>mantillas </em>that many women in Paraguay both sell and wear. Most of the lace <em>mantillas </em>were white, but some were more colorful. At last Celina hurried on to Tía Lidia’s house. Celina liked to visit her aunt every day.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Like the women Celina had seen at the street shops, Tía Lidia made lace. Celina had always been fascinated by the wooden frame that stood in the corner of the house. She loved to watch her aunt stand at the frame, working the delicate strands of linen or silk. Most of all, she loved the pretty lace pieces called&nbsp;<em>ñanduti&nbsp;</em>that Tía Lidia created. Tía Lidia made everything from small lace collars to long, flowing dresses.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, when Celina arrived at her aunt’s house, Tía Lidia was working on an elegant lace tablecloth. She had been working on the tablecloth for several weeks. First Tía Lidia had placed a sheet of linen on the wooden frame. Then she had drawn a pattern of circles and fancy designs on the material. Finally she had begun carefully removing some of the threads from the material and weaving other threads across the open spaces. It was a difficult process that would produce a thin, detailed lace.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As Tía Lidia worked, Celina walked around the room and admired some of the lovely pieces her aunt had made. She smiled when she saw one rectangular piece of lace that lay over a bench. Celina carefully lifted it and settled it over her head like a veil. She peered out from behind the finely woven patterns. She thought that this must be how the world looked to new brides.</p>
        <p>“This looks like a spider’s web,” she said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“That’s because that’s what it is,” Tía Lidia said, winking. “In Guaraní, the old language of Paraguay, ñanduti means ‘web.’” Tía Lidia paused as she carefully wove a thread into the tablecloth. “Have I ever told you the story of the white spider?” she asked at last.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“No, Tía Lidia. Tell me!”</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The dark-haired woman stepped away from the frame and smoothed her colorful skirt. “Every young girl in Paraguay should know this story. But this story needs a nice cup of yerba mate.” As Tía Lidia prepared the hot drink, she told Celina about the lace Tía Lidia’s mother had woven. “My mother told me this story when I was learning to make ñanduti.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“A very long time ago,” Tía Lidia began, “when a young man named Juan was fetching water for his mother to make tea with, he saw a white spider struggling in the stream. Quickly he scooped out the spider and placed it gently on the leaves of a yerba tree.”</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Isn’t this yerba mate made from the leaves of a yerba tree?” Celina asked.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“That’s right,” Tía Lidia said with a&nbsp;smile. “Every day, when Juan went to fill up the water jugs, he saw the white spider waiting for him. He began to think of the spider as a friend to whom he could tell all his troubles. One day he told the spider about a lovely woman with whom he had fallen in love. However, in those days, it was the custom in Paraguay for a woman’s father to choose her husband. This woman’s father had said, ‘I want to&nbsp;make sure my daughter is well cared for. Whoever brings forth the most wonderful and original gift shall win her hand.’ Juan was&nbsp;very sad. He knew he could never afford such a gift. The next day, however, when he returned to the spring, he saw that his friend was almost finished spinning a fragile silk cloth. Juan could see that it was the most exquisite lace mantilla he had ever seen. Juan knew the mantilla would look lovely draped around the shoulders of the woman he adored.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“The patterns of the mantilla were of all the native flowers of the area. Leaves and vines and drops of dew then surrounded the flowers. Instantly Juan understood what the spider had done. He ran off to present his gift. When he reached the village and placed the mantilla upon the woman, her face immediately lit up. She was radiant. Everyone around her gasped. They all knew at once&nbsp;that this mantilla was the most wonderful gift a woman could receive. Juan and the woman were married right away.”</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“From then on,” finished Tía Lidia, “the women of Paraguay have tried to duplicate the delicate lace. We have woven the lace for years, but no one has been able to equal that made by the white spider. Still, our lace is famous for its splendor.”</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Celina smiled at the wonderful tale she had just heard. “Now that I know the story of the white spider, perhaps it is time I learned to make lace.”</p>

          <strong>Tía Lidia Weaves a Story</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Ñanduti <em>is a type of thin lace handmade by women in Paraguay. </em>Ñanduti <em>can be made into many things, such as a scarf, tablecloth, or blanket. </em>A mantilla<em> is often made of this fine lace. It is worn by some women like a veil over their head and shoulders.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; As Celina walked along the main road in the town of Itaugua, Paraguay, she smiled at all the wonderful sights and smells. Along the side of the road, men and women sold goods from their street shops. Some were selling beans and peanuts, while others sold hats, mats, and many other things. Celina paused at one of the many shops where women were selling <em>mantillas</em>. She admired the delicate lace <em>mantillas </em>that many women in Paraguay both sell and wear. Most of the lace <em>mantillas </em>were white, but some were more colorful. At last Celina hurried on to Tía Lidia’s house. Celina liked to visit her aunt every day.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Like the women Celina had seen at the street shops, Tía Lidia made lace. Celina had always been fascinated by the wooden frame that stood in the corner of the house. She loved to watch her aunt stand at the frame, working the delicate strands of linen or silk. Most of all, she loved the pretty lace pieces called&nbsp;<em>ñanduti&nbsp;</em>that Tía Lidia created. Tía Lidia made everything from small lace collars to long, flowing dresses.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, when Celina arrived at her aunt’s house, Tía Lidia was working on an elegant lace tablecloth. She had been working on the tablecloth for several weeks. First Tía Lidia had placed a sheet of linen on the wooden frame. Then she had drawn a pattern of circles and fancy designs on the material. Finally she had begun carefully removing some of the threads from the material and weaving other threads across the open spaces. It was a difficult process that would produce a thin, detailed lace.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As Tía Lidia worked, Celina walked around the room and admired some of the lovely pieces her aunt had made. She smiled when she saw one rectangular piece of lace that lay over a bench. Celina carefully lifted it and settled it over her head like a veil. She peered out from behind the finely woven patterns. She thought that this must be how the world looked to new brides.</p>
        <p>“This looks like a spider’s web,” she said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“That’s because that’s what it is,” Tía Lidia said, winking. “In Guaraní, the old language of Paraguay, ñanduti means ‘web.’” Tía Lidia paused as she carefully wove a thread into the tablecloth. “Have I ever told you the story of the white spider?” she asked at last.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“No, Tía Lidia. Tell me!”</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The dark-haired woman stepped away from the frame and smoothed her colorful skirt. “Every young girl in Paraguay should know this story. But this story needs a nice cup of yerba mate.” As Tía Lidia prepared the hot drink, she told Celina about the lace Tía Lidia’s mother had woven. “My mother told me this story when I was learning to make ñanduti.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“A very long time ago,” Tía Lidia began, “when a young man named Juan was fetching water for his mother to make tea with, he saw a white spider struggling in the stream. Quickly he scooped out the spider and placed it gently on the leaves of a yerba tree.”</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Isn’t this yerba mate made from the leaves of a yerba tree?” Celina asked.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“That’s right,” Tía Lidia said with a&nbsp;smile. “Every day, when Juan went to fill up the water jugs, he saw the white spider waiting for him. He began to think of the spider as a friend to whom he could tell all his troubles. One day he told the spider about a lovely woman with whom he had fallen in love. However, in those days, it was the custom in Paraguay for a woman’s father to choose her husband. This woman’s father had said, ‘I want to&nbsp;make sure my daughter is well cared for. Whoever brings forth the most wonderful and original gift shall win her hand.’ Juan was&nbsp;very sad. He knew he could never afford such a gift. The next day, however, when he returned to the spring, he saw that his friend was almost finished spinning a fragile silk cloth. Juan could see that it was the most exquisite lace mantilla he had ever seen. Juan knew the mantilla would look lovely draped around the shoulders of the woman he adored.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“The patterns of the mantilla were of all the native flowers of the area. Leaves and vines and drops of dew then surrounded the flowers. Instantly Juan understood what the spider had done. He ran off to present his gift. When he reached the village and placed the mantilla upon the woman, her face immediately lit up. She was radiant. Everyone around her gasped. They all knew at once&nbsp;that this mantilla was the most wonderful gift a woman could receive. Juan and the woman were married right away.”</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“From then on,” finished Tía Lidia, “the women of Paraguay have tried to duplicate the delicate lace. We have woven the lace for years, but no one has been able to equal that made by the white spider. Still, our lace is famous for its splendor.”</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Celina smiled at the wonderful tale she had just heard. “Now that I know the story of the white spider, perhaps it is time I learned to make lace.”</p>

          <strong>Tía Lidia Weaves a Story</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Ñanduti <em>is a type of thin lace handmade by women in Paraguay. </em>Ñanduti <em>can be made into many things, such as a scarf, tablecloth, or blanket. </em>A mantilla<em> is often made of this fine lace. It is worn by some women like a veil over their head and shoulders.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; As Celina walked along the main road in the town of Itaugua, Paraguay, she smiled at all the wonderful sights and smells. Along the side of the road, men and women sold goods from their street shops. Some were selling beans and peanuts, while others sold hats, mats, and many other things. Celina paused at one of the many shops where women were selling <em>mantillas</em>. She admired the delicate lace <em>mantillas </em>that many women in Paraguay both sell and wear. Most of the lace <em>mantillas </em>were white, but some were more colorful. At last Celina hurried on to Tía Lidia’s house. Celina liked to visit her aunt every day.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Like the women Celina had seen at the street shops, Tía Lidia made lace. Celina had always been fascinated by the wooden frame that stood in the corner of the house. She loved to watch her aunt stand at the frame, working the delicate strands of linen or silk. Most of all, she loved the pretty lace pieces called&nbsp;<em>ñanduti&nbsp;</em>that Tía Lidia created. Tía Lidia made everything from small lace collars to long, flowing dresses.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, when Celina arrived at her aunt’s house, Tía Lidia was working on an elegant lace tablecloth. She had been working on the tablecloth for several weeks. First Tía Lidia had placed a sheet of linen on the wooden frame. Then she had drawn a pattern of circles and fancy designs on the material. Finally she had begun carefully removing some of the threads from the material and weaving other threads across the open spaces. It was a difficult process that would produce a thin, detailed lace.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As Tía Lidia worked, Celina walked around the room and admired some of the lovely pieces her aunt had made. She smiled when she saw one rectangular piece of lace that lay over a bench. Celina carefully lifted it and settled it over her head like a veil. She peered out from behind the finely woven patterns. She thought that this must be how the world looked to new brides.</p>
        <p>“This looks like a spider’s web,” she said.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                  <img width="100%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/db0yrhgnb/image/upload/v1767494013/nkcmfkrwlo5racnjk5hb.png" alt="T2_04_CT_EN_21">


        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“That’s because that’s what it is,” Tía Lidia said, winking. “In Guaraní, the old language of Paraguay, ñanduti means ‘web.’” Tía Lidia paused as she carefully wove a thread into the tablecloth. “Have I ever told you the story of the white spider?” she asked at last.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“No, Tía Lidia. Tell me!”</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The dark-haired woman stepped away from the frame and smoothed her colorful skirt. “Every young girl in Paraguay should know this story. But this story needs a nice cup of yerba mate.” As Tía Lidia prepared the hot drink, she told Celina about the lace Tía Lidia’s mother had woven. “My mother told me this story when I was learning to make ñanduti.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“A very long time ago,” Tía Lidia began, “when a young man named Juan was fetching water for his mother to make tea with, he saw a white spider struggling in the stream. Quickly he scooped out the spider and placed it gently on the leaves of a yerba tree.”</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Isn’t this yerba mate made from the leaves of a yerba tree?” Celina asked.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“That’s right,” Tía Lidia said with a&nbsp;smile. “Every day, when Juan went to fill up the water jugs, he saw the white spider waiting for him. He began to think of the spider as a friend to whom he could tell all his troubles. One day he told the spider about a lovely woman with whom he had fallen in love. However, in those days, it was the custom in Paraguay for a woman’s father to choose her husband. This woman’s father had said, ‘I want to&nbsp;make sure my daughter is well cared for. Whoever brings forth the most wonderful and original gift shall win her hand.’ Juan was&nbsp;very sad. He knew he could never afford such a gift. The next day, however, when he returned to the spring, he saw that his friend was almost finished spinning a fragile silk cloth. Juan could see that it was the most exquisite lace mantilla he had ever seen. Juan knew the mantilla would look lovely draped around the shoulders of the woman he adored.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“The patterns of the mantilla were of all the native flowers of the area. Leaves and vines and drops of dew then surrounded the flowers. Instantly Juan understood what the spider had done. He ran off to present his gift. When he reached the village and placed the mantilla upon the woman, her face immediately lit up. She was radiant. Everyone around her gasped. They all knew at once&nbsp;that this mantilla was the most wonderful gift a woman could receive. Juan and the woman were married right away.”</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“From then on,” finished Tía Lidia, “the women of Paraguay have tried to duplicate the delicate lace. We have woven the lace for years, but no one has been able to equal that made by the white spider. Still, our lace is famous for its splendor.”</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Celina smiled at the wonderful tale she had just heard. “Now that I know the story of the white spider, perhaps it is time I learned to make lace.”</p>

          <strong>Lucy and the Chickens</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Lucy’s family had lots of animals. They had cows, horses, and pigs. They also had a dog, a cat, and a bird. Lucy’s favorite animals were the chickens. She enjoyed collecting eggs from the henhouse. But she wasn’t allowed to gather the eggs by herself.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“The hook that keeps the henhouse door closed is too high,” Dad explained. “You’re not tall enough yet to reach the hook and then fasten it again. If you don’t shut the door tightly, the chickens could get out. They might become supper for a coyote or some other wild animal.” Lucy’s eyes widened. She promised never to open the henhouse door by herself.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning Dad went to town to get a part to fix the tractor. Mom was talking on the phone to Grandma. All by herself Lucy swept the front porch. She put water in the dog’s bowl. By noon the bright sun was shining overhead. Lucy felt thirsty after doing her chores outside.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lucy went inside the house. She heard her mother still talking to Grandma. Lucy got a cool drink of water. Then she went back outside and admired the flower garden. “I’d better water the flowers,” Lucy said to herself. “They’re probably thirsty.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After watering the flowers, Lucy glanced toward the henhouse. “I should give the chickens some water. They’re probably thirsty, too.”</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lucy filled a big bucket with water. She could barely lift it. She tried dragging the bucket, but the water sloshed out. So she went to get her wagon. Hauling the water in the wagon was easier than carrying it by hand.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At last Lucy stood at the henhouse door. The hook was high. Even when she stretched on her tiptoes, she couldn’t reach it. She looked around and saw a stick on the ground. Using the stick, she&nbsp;pushed and poked at the hook. Soon the hook was free. Slowly the door swung open. Twenty chickens stared at her.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lucy considered what her father had said. She remembered her father’s warning that a coyote might harm the chickens. However, she did not want the chickens to be thirsty, either.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Look what I brought you,” she said. She went to get the<br>
bucket of water. Carefully she lifted the heavy bucket and set it on the ground. When she turned back around, the chickens were rushing through the open door.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“No!” Lucy cried, waving her arms. “Get back in there! Shoo!”</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But it was too late. Lucy started chasing the chickens around the yard. They rant his way and that. They scurried here and there. They flew and flapped. They fluttered and hopped. The more Lucy chased them, the more they scattered. They went behind trees and haystacks. They went under the tractor and wagon. The chickens didn't seem to understand that Lucy was trying to save them.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;By the time Dad got home, Lucy had given up. She was sitting in front of the henhouse crying in despair. Dad noticed the open&nbsp;door. He saw the bucket full of water. It didn’t take him long to guess what was wrong.</p>
        <p>13 “Let’s get those chickens back in the henhouse,” he said firmly. He went to get some chicken feed in a bucket. “Here, chick, chick, chick,” he called. He spread the feed on the ground near the henhouse. Soon all the chickens came to eat the feed. One by one, Lucy and Dad caught the chickens. When all the chickens were back in the henhouse, Dad hooked the door. Now the chickens were safe from coyotes.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lucy and Dad walked back to the house. “Your intention was good, and I know that you meant well,” Dad said. “Giving the chickens some water was a fine thought. But it would have been better not to open the door by yourself.” He stopped and looked at Lucy. “It’s a lot easier to keep chickens in than to catch them once they get out. Do you know what I mean?”</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lucy nodded. She knew exactly what he meant. She also knew that this was a lesson she would never forget.</p>

          <strong>Lucy and the Chickens</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Lucy’s family had lots of animals. They had cows, horses, and pigs. They also had a dog, a cat, and a bird. Lucy’s favorite animals were the chickens. She enjoyed collecting eggs from the henhouse. But she wasn’t allowed to gather the eggs by herself.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“The hook that keeps the henhouse door closed is too high,” Dad explained. “You’re not tall enough yet to reach the hook and then fasten it again. If you don’t shut the door tightly, the chickens could get out. They might become supper for a coyote or some other wild animal.” Lucy’s eyes widened. She promised never to open the henhouse door by herself.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning Dad went to town to get a part to fix the tractor. Mom was talking on the phone to Grandma. All by herself Lucy swept the front porch. She put water in the dog’s bowl. By noon the bright sun was shining overhead. Lucy felt thirsty after doing her chores outside.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lucy went inside the house. She heard her mother still talking to Grandma. Lucy got a cool drink of water. Then she went back outside and admired the flower garden. “I’d better water the flowers,” Lucy said to herself. “They’re probably thirsty.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After watering the flowers, Lucy glanced toward the henhouse. “I should give the chickens some water. They’re probably thirsty, too.”</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lucy filled a big bucket with water. She could barely lift it. She tried dragging the bucket, but the water sloshed out. So she went to get her wagon. Hauling the water in the wagon was easier than carrying it by hand.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At last Lucy stood at the henhouse door. The hook was high. Even when she stretched on her tiptoes, she couldn’t reach it. She looked around and saw a stick on the ground. Using the stick, she&nbsp;pushed and poked at the hook. Soon the hook was free. Slowly the door swung open. Twenty chickens stared at her.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lucy considered what her father had said. She remembered her father’s warning that a coyote might harm the chickens. However, she did not want the chickens to be thirsty, either.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Look what I brought you,” she said. She went to get the<br>
bucket of water. Carefully she lifted the heavy bucket and set it on the ground. When she turned back around, the chickens were rushing through the open door.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“No!” Lucy cried, waving her arms. “Get back in there! Shoo!”</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But it was too late. Lucy started chasing the chickens around the yard. They rant his way and that. They scurried here and there. They flew and flapped. They fluttered and hopped. The more Lucy chased them, the more they scattered. They went behind trees and haystacks. They went under the tractor and wagon. The chickens didn't seem to understand that Lucy was trying to save them.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;By the time Dad got home, Lucy had given up. She was sitting in front of the henhouse crying in despair. Dad noticed the open&nbsp;door. He saw the bucket full of water. It didn’t take him long to guess what was wrong.</p>
        <p>13 “Let’s get those chickens back in the henhouse,” he said firmly. He went to get some chicken feed in a bucket. “Here, chick, chick, chick,” he called. He spread the feed on the ground near the henhouse. Soon all the chickens came to eat the feed. One by one, Lucy and Dad caught the chickens. When all the chickens were back in the henhouse, Dad hooked the door. Now the chickens were safe from coyotes.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lucy and Dad walked back to the house. “Your intention was good, and I know that you meant well,” Dad said. “Giving the chickens some water was a fine thought. But it would have been better not to open the door by yourself.” He stopped and looked at Lucy. “It’s a lot easier to keep chickens in than to catch them once they get out. Do you know what I mean?”</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lucy nodded. She knew exactly what he meant. She also knew that this was a lesson she would never forget.</p>

        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At last Lucy stood at the henhouse door. The hook was high. Even when she stretched on her tiptoes, she couldn’t reach it. She looked around and saw a stick on the ground. Using the stick, she&nbsp;pushed and poked at the hook. Soon the hook was free. Slowly the door swung open. Twenty chickens stared at her.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lucy considered what her father had said. She remembered her father’s warning that a coyote might harm the chickens. However, she did not want the chickens to be thirsty, either.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Look what I brought you,” she said. She went to get the<br>
bucket of water. Carefully she lifted the heavy bucket and set it on the ground. When she turned back around, the chickens were rushing through the open door.</p>

        </p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“No!” Lucy cried, waving her arms. “Get back in there! Shoo!”</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But it was too late. Lucy started chasing the chickens around the yard. They rant his way and that. They scurried here and there. They flew and flapped. They fluttered and hopped. The more Lucy chased them, the more they scattered. They went behind trees and haystacks. They went under the tractor and wagon. The chickens didn't seem to understand that Lucy was trying to save them.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;By the time Dad got home, Lucy had given up. She was sitting in front of the henhouse crying in despair. Dad noticed the open&nbsp;door. He saw the bucket full of water. It didn’t take him long to guess what was wrong.</p>
        <p>13 “Let’s get those chickens back in the henhouse,” he said firmly. He went to get some chicken feed in a bucket. “Here, chick, chick, chick,” he called. He spread the feed on the ground near the henhouse. Soon all the chickens came to eat the feed. One by one, Lucy and Dad caught the chickens. When all the chickens were back in the henhouse, Dad hooked the door. Now the chickens were safe from coyotes.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lucy and Dad walked back to the house. “Your intention was good, and I know that you meant well,” Dad said. “Giving the chickens some water was a fine thought. But it would have been better not to open the door by yourself.” He stopped and looked at Lucy. “It’s a lot easier to keep chickens in than to catch them once they get out. Do you know what I mean?”</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lucy nodded. She knew exactly what he meant. She also knew that this was a lesson she would never forget.</p>

          <strong>Lucy and the Chickens</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Lucy’s family had lots of animals. They had cows, horses, and pigs. They also had a dog, a cat, and a bird. Lucy’s favorite animals were the chickens. She enjoyed collecting eggs from the henhouse. But she wasn’t allowed to gather the eggs by herself.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“The hook that keeps the henhouse door closed is too high,” Dad explained. “You’re not tall enough yet to reach the hook and then fasten it again. If you don’t shut the door tightly, the chickens could get out. They might become supper for a coyote or some other wild animal.” Lucy’s eyes widened. She promised never to open the henhouse door by herself.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning Dad went to town to get a part to fix the tractor. Mom was talking on the phone to Grandma. All by herself Lucy swept the front porch. She put water in the dog’s bowl. By noon the bright sun was shining overhead. Lucy felt thirsty after doing her chores outside.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lucy went inside the house. She heard her mother still talking to Grandma. Lucy got a cool drink of water. Then she went back outside and admired the flower garden. “I’d better water the flowers,” Lucy said to herself. “They’re probably thirsty.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After watering the flowers, Lucy glanced toward the henhouse. “I should give the chickens some water. They’re probably thirsty, too.”</p>

        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;By the time Dad got home, Lucy had given up. She was sitting in front of the henhouse crying in despair. Dad noticed the open&nbsp;door. He saw the bucket full of water. It didn’t take him long to guess what was wrong.</p>
        <p>13 “Let’s get those chickens back in the henhouse,” he said firmly. He went to get some chicken feed in a bucket. “Here, chick, chick, chick,” he called. He spread the feed on the ground near the henhouse. Soon all the chickens came to eat the feed. One by one, Lucy and Dad caught the chickens. When all the chickens were back in the henhouse, Dad hooked the door. Now the chickens were safe from coyotes.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lucy and Dad walked back to the house. “Your intention was good, and I know that you meant well,” Dad said. “Giving the chickens some water was a fine thought. But it would have been better not to open the door by yourself.” He stopped and looked at Lucy. “It’s a lot easier to keep chickens in than to catch them once they get out. Do you know what I mean?”</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lucy nodded. She knew exactly what he meant. She also knew that this was a lesson she would never forget.</p>
