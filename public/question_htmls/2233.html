And then, suddenly, without warning, uttering a cry that was inarticulate and more like the cry of an animal, John Thornton sprang upon the man who wielded the club. Hal was hurled backward, as though struck by a falling tree. Mercedes screamed. Charles looked on wistfully, wiped his watery eyes, but did not get up because of his stiffness.</p>
        <p>John Thornton stood over Buck, struggling to control himself, oo convulsed with rage to speak.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“If you strike that dog again, I’ll kill you,” he at last managed to say in a choking voice.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“It’s my dog,” Hal replied, wiping the blood from his mouth as he came back. “Get out of my way, or I’ll fix you. I’m going to Dawson.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Thornton stood between him and Buck, and evinced no intention of getting out of the way. Hal drew his long hunting-knife. Mercedes screamed, cried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria. Thornton rapped Hal’s knuckles with the axe-handle, knocking the knife to the ground. He rapped his knuckles again as he tried to pick it up. Then he stooped, picked it up himself, and with two strokes cut Buck’s traces.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Hal had no fight left in him. Besides, <span class="txt-underline"><strong>his hands were full with his sister</strong></span>, or his arms, rather; while Buck was too near dead to be of further use in hauling the sled. A few minutes later they pulled out from the bank and down the river. Buck heard them go and raised his head to see, Pike was leading, Sol-leks was at the wheel, and between were Joe and Teek. They were limping and staggering. Mercedes was riding the loaded sled. Hal guided at the gee-pole, and Charles stumbled along in the rear.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As Buck watched them, Thornton knelt beside him and with rough, kindly hands searched for broken bones. By the time his search had disclosed nothing more than many bruises and a state of terrible starvation, the sled was a quarter of a mile away. Dog and man watched it crawling along over the ice. Suddenly, they saw its back end drop down, as into a rut, and the gee-pole, with Hal clinging to it, jerk into the air. Mercedes’s scream came to their ears. They saw Charles turn and make one step to run back, and then a whole section of ice give way and dogs and humans disappear. A yawning hole was all that was to be seen. The bottom had dropped out of the trail.</p>
        <p>John Thornton and Buck looked at each other.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“You poor devil,” said John Thornton, and Buck licked his hand.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When John Thornton froze his feet in the previous December his partners had made him comfortable and left him to get well, going on themselves up the river to get out a raft of saw-logs for Dawson. He was still limping slightly at the time he rescued Buck, but with the continued warm weather even the slight limp left him. And here, lying by the river bank through the long spring days, watching the running water, listening lazily to the songs of birds and the hum of nature, Buck slowly won back his strength.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A rest comes very good after one has travelled three thousand miles, and it must be confessed that Buck waxed lazy as his wounds healed, his muscles swelled out, and the flesh came back to cover his bones. For that matter, they were all loafing,—Buck, John Thornton, and Skeet and Nig,—waiting for the raft to come that was to carry them down to Dawson. Skeet was a little Irish setter who early made friends with Buck, who, in a dying condition, was unable to resent her first advances. She had the doctor trait which some dogs possess; and as a mother cat washes her kittens, so she washed and cleansed Buck’s wounds. Regularly, each morning after he had finished his breakfast, she performed her self-appointed task, till he came to look for her ministrations as much as he did for Thornton’s. Nig, equally friendly, though less demonstrative, was a huge black dog, half bloodhound and half deerhound, with eyes that laughed and a boundless good nature.</p>

And then, suddenly, without warning, uttering a cry that was inarticulate and more like the cry of an animal, John Thornton sprang upon the man who wielded the club. Hal was hurled backward, as though struck by a falling tree. Mercedes screamed. Charles looked on wistfully, wiped his watery eyes, but did not get up because of his stiffness.</p>
        <p>John Thornton stood over Buck, struggling to control himself, oo convulsed with rage to speak.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“If you strike that dog again, I’ll kill you,” he at last managed to say in a choking voice.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“It’s my dog,” Hal replied, wiping the blood from his mouth as he came back. “Get out of my way, or I’ll fix you. I’m going to Dawson.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Thornton stood between him and Buck, and evinced no intention of getting out of the way. Hal drew his long hunting-knife. Mercedes screamed, cried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria. Thornton rapped Hal’s knuckles with the axe-handle, knocking the knife to the ground. He rapped his knuckles again as he tried to pick it up. Then he stooped, picked it up himself, and with two strokes cut Buck’s traces.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Hal had no fight left in him. Besides, <span class="txt-underline"><strong>his hands were full with his sister</strong></span>, or his arms, rather; while Buck was too near dead to be of further use in hauling the sled. A few minutes later they pulled out from the bank and down the river. Buck heard them go and raised his head to see, Pike was leading, Sol-leks was at the wheel, and between were Joe and Teek. They were limping and staggering. Mercedes was riding the loaded sled. Hal guided at the gee-pole, and Charles stumbled along in the rear.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As Buck watched them, Thornton knelt beside him and with rough, kindly hands searched for broken bones. By the time his search had disclosed nothing more than many bruises and a state of terrible starvation, the sled was a quarter of a mile away. Dog and man watched it crawling along over the ice. Suddenly, they saw its back end drop down, as into a rut, and the gee-pole, with Hal clinging to it, jerk into the air. Mercedes’s scream came to their ears. They saw Charles turn and make one step to run back, and then a whole section of ice give way and dogs and humans disappear. A yawning hole was all that was to be seen. The bottom had dropped out of the trail.</p>
        <p>John Thornton and Buck looked at each other.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“You poor devil,” said John Thornton, and Buck licked his hand.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When John Thornton froze his feet in the previous December his partners had made him comfortable and left him to get well, going on themselves up the river to get out a raft of saw-logs for Dawson. He was still limping slightly at the time he rescued Buck, but with the continued warm weather even the slight limp left him. And here, lying by the river bank through the long spring days, watching the running water, listening lazily to the songs of birds and the hum of nature, Buck slowly won back his strength.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A rest comes very good after one has travelled three thousand miles, and it must be confessed that Buck waxed lazy as his wounds healed, his muscles swelled out, and the flesh came back to cover his bones. For that matter, they were all loafing,—Buck, John Thornton, and Skeet and Nig,—waiting for the raft to come that was to carry them down to Dawson. Skeet was a little Irish setter who early made friends with Buck, who, in a dying condition, was unable to resent her first advances. She had the doctor trait which some dogs possess; and as a mother cat washes her kittens, so she washed and cleansed Buck’s wounds. Regularly, each morning after he had finished his breakfast, she performed her self-appointed task, till he came to look for her ministrations as much as he did for Thornton’s. Nig, equally friendly, though less demonstrative, was a huge black dog, half bloodhound and half deerhound, with eyes that laughed and a boundless good nature.</p>

        <p><em>Read the extract below then answer the questions.</em><br><br>
And then, suddenly, without warning, uttering a cry that was inarticulate and more like the cry of an animal, John Thornton sprang upon the man who wielded the club. Hal was hurled backward, as though struck by a falling tree. Mercedes screamed. Charles looked on wistfully, wiped his watery eyes, but did not get up because of his stiffness.</p>
        <p>John Thornton stood over Buck, struggling to control himself, oo convulsed with rage to speak.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“If you strike that dog again, I’ll kill you,” he at last managed to say in a choking voice.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“It’s my dog,” Hal replied, wiping the blood from his mouth as he came back. “Get out of my way, or I’ll fix you. I’m going to Dawson.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Thornton stood between him and Buck, and evinced no intention of getting out of the way. Hal drew his long hunting-knife. Mercedes screamed, cried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria. Thornton rapped Hal’s knuckles with the axe-handle, knocking the knife to the ground. He rapped his knuckles again as he tried to pick it up. Then he stooped, picked it up himself, and with two strokes cut Buck’s traces.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Hal had no fight left in him. Besides, <span class="txt-underline"><strong>his hands were full with his sister</strong></span>, or his arms, rather; while Buck was too near dead to be of further use in hauling the sled. A few minutes later they pulled out from the bank and down the river. Buck heard them go and raised his head to see, Pike was leading, Sol-leks was at the wheel, and between were Joe and Teek. They were limping and staggering. Mercedes was riding the loaded sled. Hal guided at the gee-pole, and Charles stumbled along in the rear.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As Buck watched them, Thornton knelt beside him and with rough, kindly hands searched for broken bones. By the time his search had disclosed nothing more than many bruises and a state of terrible starvation, the sled was a quarter of a mile away. Dog and man watched it crawling along over the ice. Suddenly, they saw its back end drop down, as into a rut, and the gee-pole, with Hal clinging to it, jerk into the air. Mercedes’s scream came to their ears. They saw Charles turn and make one step to run back, and then a whole section of ice give way and dogs and humans disappear. A yawning hole was all that was to be seen. The bottom had dropped out of the trail.</p>
        <p>John Thornton and Buck looked at each other.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“You poor devil,” said John Thornton, and Buck licked his hand.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When John Thornton froze his feet in the previous December his partners had made him comfortable and left him to get well, going on themselves up the river to get out a raft of saw-logs for Dawson. He was still limping slightly at the time he rescued Buck, but with the continued warm weather even the slight limp left him. And here, lying by the river bank through the long spring days, watching the running water, listening lazily to the songs of birds and the hum of nature, Buck slowly won back his strength.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A rest comes very good after one has travelled three thousand miles, and it must be confessed that Buck waxed lazy as his wounds healed, his muscles swelled out, and the flesh came back to cover his bones. For that matter, they were all loafing,—Buck, John Thornton, and Skeet and Nig,—waiting for the raft to come that was to carry them down to Dawson. Skeet was a little Irish setter who early made friends with Buck, who, in a dying condition, was unable to resent her first advances. She had the doctor trait which some dogs possess; and as a mother cat washes her kittens, so she washed and cleansed Buck’s wounds. Regularly, each morning after he had finished his breakfast, she performed her self-appointed task, till he came to look for her ministrations as much as he did for Thornton’s. Nig, equally friendly, though less demonstrative, was a huge black dog, half bloodhound and half deerhound, with eyes that laughed and a boundless good nature.</p>

        <p><em>Read the poem below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>The Sandpiper</strong><br><br>
Across the lonely beach we flit,<br>
One little sandpiper and I,<br>
And fast I gather, but by bit,<br>
The scattered driftwood bleached and dry.<br>
The wild waves reach their hands for it,<br>
The wild wind raves, the tide runs high,<br>
As up and down the beach we flit,<br>
One little sandpiper and I.</p>
        <p>Above our heads the sullen clouds<br>
Scud, black and swift, across the sky:<br>
Like silent ghosts in misty shrouds<br>
Stand out the white light-houses high.<br>
Almost as far as eye can reach<br>
I see the close-reefed vessels fly,<br>
As fast we flit along the beach,<br>
One little sandpiper and I.</p>
        <p>I watch him as he skims along,<br>
Uttering his sweet and mournful cry;<br>
He starts not at my fitful song,<br>
Nor flash of fluttering drapery.<br>

Stanch friends are we, well tried and strong,<br>

Comrade, where wilt thou be to-night,<br>
When the loosed storm breaks furiously?<br>
My drift-wood fire will burn so bright!<br>
To what warm shelter canst thou fly?<br>
I do not fear for thee, though wroth<br>
The tempest rushes through the sky;<br>
For are we not God’s children both,<br>
Thou, little sandpiper, and I?</p>

As fast we flit along the beach,<br>
One little sandpiper and I.</p>
        <p>I watch him as he skims along,<br>
Uttering his sweet and mournful cry;<br>
He starts not at my fitful song,<br>
Nor flash of fluttering drapery.<br>
He has no thought of any wrong,<br>
He scans me with a fearless eye;<br>
Stanch friends are we, well tried and strong,<br>
The little sandpiper and I.<br>
Comrade, where wilt thou be to-night,<br>
When the loosed storm breaks furiously?<br>
My drift-wood fire will burn so bright!<br>
To what warm shelter canst thou fly?<br>
I do not fear for thee, though wroth<br>
The tempest rushes through the sky;<br>
For are we not God’s children both,<br>
Thou, little sandpiper, and I?</p>

Nuclear energy is derived from the nucleus of atoms through two primary processes: nuclear fusion, where atomic nuclei are fused together, and nuclear fission, where nuclei are split apart. In nuclear power plants, the latter process is employed to generate electricity, particularly using the radioactive element uranium. Uranium, formed when the Earth was created, is a naturally occurring but non-renewable resource found in various rocks. <strong>(A)</strong>&nbsp;……………&nbsp; By splitting uranium atoms, substantial amounts of energy are released, which is harnessed to produce electricity, underscoring the importance of nuclear energy in the global power landscape.</p>
        <p>Nuclear reactors are central to the functioning of nuclear power plants. These reactors manage nuclear chain reactions to produce heat through fission. <strong>(B)&nbsp;</strong>.……………&nbsp; With over 400 reactors worldwide, including 93 in the United States, nuclear energy remains a significant source of reliable and carbon-free electricity. The reactors utilize uranium fuel, which is processed into ceramic pellets and enclosed in metal tubes called fuel rods. These rods are grouped into fuel assemblies within the reactor core, where they interact to sustain the fission process, generating the heat needed for electricity production.</p>
        <p>The operational mechanisms of nuclear reactors involve intricate systems designed to manage the fission process safely and efficiently. Fuel rods within the reactor vessel are immersed in water, which serves as both a coolant and a moderator to control the reaction rate. <strong>(C)</strong> ……………&nbsp; The heat generated by fission converts water into steam, which drives turbines to produce electricity. This method ensures a steady supply of carbon-free energy, highlighting the efficiency and environmental benefits of nuclear power.</p>
        <p>In the United States, all commercial nuclear reactors are light-water reactors, which use normal water as a coolant and neutron moderator. There are two main types: pressurized-water reactors (PWRs) and boiling water reactors (BWRs). PWRs, making up over 65% of U.S. reactors, maintain water under high pressure to prevent boiling within the reactor core. The heated water is circulated through a heat exchanger to create steam from a secondary water source, which then drives turbines. BWRs, comprising about a third of U.S. reactors, produce steam directly within the reactor vessel, which is then used to generate electricity. <strong>(D)&nbsp;</strong>.……………&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The debate over nuclear energy continues in various parts of the world, including Australia. Sixteen-year-old William Shackel is actively campaigning to lift Australia’s ban on nuclear energy, arguing it is a cleaner and more efficient alternative to coal amidst the current energy and climate crisis. Shackel’s campaign, Nuclear For Australia, aims to promote nuclear energy as a viable solution for the country’s energy needs. <strong>(E)</strong> ……………&nbsp; Despite Australia’s ban on nuclear power since 1998, proponents like Shackel see a significant opportunity for change.</p>
        <p>Historical incidents like the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 have left a lasting impact on public perception of nuclear energy. The catastrophic explosion and meltdown at the Chernobyl Power Station in Ukraine resulted in severe radioactive fallout, affecting countless lives and leading to a long-standing exclusion zone around the site. A protective shelter now covers the reactor to prevent further radiation leakage. The incident remains a stark reminder of the risks associated with nuclear power. <strong>(F)</strong> ……………&nbsp; Despite these concerns, advancements in reactor technology and safety measures continue to shape the future of nuclear energy as a critical component of the global energy mix.</p>

A stream forms when water collects from an area and gradually flows downhill in a continuous motion. As streams connect, they gradually grow larger and at some point, become large enough to be called a river. Rivers are important habitats for many water-dependent animals and plants, such as fish, waterbirds, frogs, turtles, and platypuses. Rivers allow water to flow and connect with habitats such as wetlands, pools, lagoons, swamps, and floodplain pools. Rivers can be connected to groundwater, both receiving water from underground and helping to replenish groundwater aquifers. Rivers and streams are vital sources of water for both humans and the environment. Many plants and animals rely on healthy rivers for habitat, food, and breeding, making it crucial that we manage water resources in a way that supports them. Rivers and streams are also an important part of First Nations culture. First Nations people rely on river water to carry out cultural traditions such as fishing, hunting, ceremonies, and to maintain a connection to Country.<br>

River calculations have confirmed that Australia’s longest single river is the River Murray at 2,508 kilometres. However, if the longest tributaries of the Darling River, the Culgoa, Balonne and Condamine, are taken into account, its total length increases to 2,740 kilometres, making it Australia’s longest waterway. Almost 2,000 km is navigable, making it the third longest navigable river on the planet, with only the Amazon and Nile rivers ahead of it. The Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) spans more than 1 million square kilometres, making up a whopping 14 per cent of the total area of Australia. The MDB produces 54 per cent of Australia’s apples and 95 per cent of its oranges. The River Murray provides water to about 1.5 million households, as well as farms and other businesses along its length. It also has its own flag. While the actual origins of the flag are a bit murky, it’s been in use since the 1850s. These days, three different versions of the flag are used by businesses and paddle steamers at various points along the river.<br>

In the USA, steamboats played a major role in the 19th-century development of the Mississippi River and its tributaries, facilitating the large-scale transport of passengers and freight both up and down the river. Using steam power, riverboats were developed during that time, which could navigate in shallow waters as well as upriver against strong currents. After the development of railroads, passenger traffic gradually switched to this faster form of transportation, but steamboats continued to serve Mississippi River commerce into the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. A small number of steamboats are still used for tourist excursions in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.&nbsp;<br>

I read an interesting article not long ago about fish that swim upstream. The main reason salmon, for example, swim upstream is to ensure the survival of their offspring. Salmon are born in freshwater rivers, spend most of their adult lives in the ocean, and then return to the place they were born to lay their eggs. As young salmon hatch in their home stream, they learn the smell of it. As they migrate downstream and into the ocean, they may memorise certain scents along the way. But even after being away for many years, when the salmon return to their birthplace as adults, they will use those smells to ‘test the waters’ and find their home stream. Some studies have shown that salmon use the Earth’s magnetic field to guide their migration. Salmon swim upstream to ensure the survival of their offspring. Similarly, in leadership, there will be times, more often than not, when you will need to swim upstream for your survival and success. This will be difficult, but you have to swim upstream to grow. Only dead fish go with the flow. If you want to succeed, you have to fight the currents of negativity and conformity.&nbsp;<br>

NOAA renews program to bring Southern Resident orca population back from decline</p>
        <p>The Southern Residents were chosen to be part of the Species in the Spotlight program to rescue the population from near "certain" extinction. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) renewed an initiative aiming to stabilise the Southern Resident Killer Whale population living in the Puget Sound. NOAA started the Species in the Spotlight program to provide targeted, immediate efforts to halt the decline and stabilise populations of the Southern Resident orcas and several other species thought to be headed for extinction in the United States.</p>
        <p><strong>1&nbsp;</strong>………. The Southern Resident whales are considered to be a recovery priority by NOAA, which means their "extinction is almost certain in the immediate future because of rapid population decline or habitat destruction, and because of conflicts with construction, development, or economic activity," according to NOAA's plan.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One of the major threats facing Southern Resident orcas is insufficient prey. <strong>2</strong> ………. The whales are also exposed to high levels of contaminants and are impacted by ships and noise pollution that affects their behavior and makes it harder for them to find and capture prey, according to the organization. NOAA reported the trajectory of the Southern Residents' population is still declining, even with the addition of three new calves born since the summer census count in 2020.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The next phase of NOAA's program will include protecting orcas from harmful vessel impacts, targeting conservation efforts of the orcas' prey, improving knowledge about the current health of Southern Resident Killer Whales. <strong>3</strong> ……….</p>
        <p>More positive news is that Orca ‘celebrities’ Tl’uk and Chainsaw were among 56 total killer whales spotted in the Salish Sea over Easter weekend. Naturalists had a whale of a time over the Easter weekend spotting four different pods of Bigg's killer whales in the Salish Sea, including two orcas known for their standout appearance. <strong>4</strong> ………. In all, the Pacific Whale Watch Association reported seeing 56 orcas over the weekend.</p>
        <p>Among a group travelling up Haro Strait, which is the boundary waters between the U.S. and Canada, was a Bigg’s killer whale named “Chainsaw.” <strong>5</strong> ………. Bigg’s killer whale “Chainsaw” swims with his pod in the Salish Sea.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Another high-profile orca spotted over the weekend was a transient whale known for its distinctive grey and white coloration. Researchers nicknamed the orca “Tl’uk,” which translates to “moon” in the language of the Indigenous Coast Salish people, because of his lunar-like grayish-white color.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"It's a pretty fabulous day out there whenever we see whales, but to have multiple groups including two ‘celebrities’ (Tl’uk and Chainsaw) in the neighbourhood is an extra special treat," said Val Shore, a professional naturalist and photographer with Eagle Wing Whale &amp; Wildlife Tours of Victoria. <strong>6</strong> ……….</p>
        <p>The Bigg’s killer whale population was 349 in 2018 and has been growing around 4% each year through the 2010s, according to researchers. The Pacific Whale Watch Association said over 200 Bigg’s killer whales are spotted in the Salish Sea each year</p>

John Thornton asked little of man or nature. He was unafraid of the wild. With a handful of salt and a rifle he could plunge into the wilderness and fare wherever he pleased and as long as he pleased. Being in no haste, Indian fashion, he hunted his dinner in the course of the day’s travel; and if he failed to find it, like the Indian, he kept on travelling, secure in the knowledge that sooner or later he would come to it. So, on this great journey into the East, straight meat was the bill of fare, ammunition and tools principally made up the load on the sled, and the time-card was drawn upon the limitless future.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To Buck it was <span class="txt-underline"><strong>boundless delight</strong></span>, this hunting, fishing, and indefinite wandering through strange places. For weeks at a time they would hold on steadily, day after day; and for weeks upon end they would camp, here and there, the dogs loafing and the men burning holes through frozen muck and gravel and washing countless pans of dirt by the heat of the fire. Sometimes they went hungry, sometimes they feasted riotously, all according to the abundance of game and the fortune of hunting. Summer arrived, and dogs and men packed on their backs, rafted across blue mountain lakes, and descended or ascended unknown rivers in slender boats whipsawed from the standing forest.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The months came and went, and back and forth they twisted through the uncharted vastness, where no men were and yet where men had been if the Lost Cabin were true. They went across divides in summer blizzards, shivered under the midnight sun on naked mountains between the timber line and the eternal snows, dropped into summer valleys amid swarming gnats and flies, and in the shadows of glaciers picked strawberries and flowers as ripe and fair as any the Southland could boast. In the fall of the year they penetrated a weird lake country, sad and silent, where wildfowl had been, but where then there was no life nor sign of life—only the blowing of chill winds, the forming of ice in sheltered places, and the melancholy rippling of waves on lonely beaches.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And through another winter they wandered on the obliterated trails of men who had gone before. Once, they came upon a path blazed through the forest, an <span class="txt-underline"><strong>ancient path</strong></span>, and the Lost Cabin seemed very near. But the path began nowhere and ended nowhere, and it remained mystery, as the man who made it and the reason he made it remained mystery. Another time they chanced upon the time-graven wreckage of a hunting lodge, and amid the shreds of rotted blankets John Thornton found a longbarrelled flint-lock. He knew it for a Hudson Bay Company gun of the young days in the Northwest, when such a gun was worth its height in beaver skins packed flat, And that was all—no hint as to the man who in an early day had reared the lodge and left the gun among the blankets.</p>
        <p>Spring came on once more, and at the end of all their wandering they found, not the Lost Cabin, but a shallow placer in a broad valley where the gold showed like yellow butter across the bottom of the washing-pan. They sought no farther. Each day they worked earned them thousands of dollars in clean dust and nuggets, and they worked every day. The gold was sacked in moose-hide bags, fifty pounds to the bag, and piled like so much firewood outside the spruce-bough lodge. Like giants they toiled, days flashing on the heels of days like dreams as they heaped the treasure up.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was nothing for the dogs to do, save the hauling in of meat now and again that Thornton killed, and Buck spent long hours musing by the fire. The vision of the shortlegged hairy man came to him more frequently, now that there was little work to be done; and often, blinking by the fire, Buck wandered with him in that other world which he remembered.</p>

        <p>To Buck it was <span class="txt-underline"><strong>boundless delight</strong></span>, this hunting, fishing, and indefinite wandering through strange places. For weeks at a time they would hold on steadily, day after day; and for weeks upon end they would camp, here and there, the dogs loafing and the men burning holes through frozen muck and gravel and washing countless pans of dirt by the heat of the fire. Sometimes they went hungry, sometimes they feasted riotously, all according to the abundance of game and the fortune of hunting. Summer arrived, and dogs and men packed on their backs, rafted across blue mountain lakes, and descended or ascended unknown rivers in slender boats whipsawed from the standing forest.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The months came and went, and back and forth they twisted through the uncharted vastness, where no men were and yet where men had been if the Lost Cabin were true. They went across divides in summer blizzards, shivered under the midnight sun on naked mountains between the timber line and the eternal snows, dropped into summer valleys amid swarming gnats and flies, and in the shadows of glaciers picked strawberries and flowers as ripe and fair as any the Southland could boast. In the fall of the year they penetrated a weird lake country, sad and silent, where wildfowl had been, but where then there was no life nor sign of life—only the blowing of chill winds, the forming of ice in sheltered places, and the melancholy rippling of waves on lonely beaches.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And through another winter they wandered on the obliterated trails of men who had gone before. Once, they came upon a path blazed through the forest, an <span class="txt-underline"><strong>ancient path</strong></span>, and the Lost Cabin seemed very near. But the path began nowhere and ended nowhere, and it remained mystery, as the man who made it and the reason he made it remained mystery. Another time they chanced upon the time-graven wreckage of a hunting lodge, and amid the shreds of rotted blankets John Thornton found a longbarrelled flint-lock. He knew it for a Hudson Bay Company gun of the young days in the Northwest, when such a gun was worth its height in beaver skins packed flat, And that was all—no hint as to the man who in an early day had reared the lodge and left the gun among the blankets.</p>
        <p>Spring came on once more, and at the end of all their wandering they found, not the Lost Cabin, but a shallow placer in a broad valley where the gold showed like yellow butter across the bottom of the washing-pan. They sought no farther. Each day they worked earned them thousands of dollars in clean dust and nuggets, and they worked every day. The gold was sacked in moose-hide bags, fifty pounds to the bag, and piled like so much firewood outside the spruce-bough lodge. Like giants they toiled, days flashing on the heels of days like dreams as they heaped the treasure up.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was nothing for the dogs to do, save the hauling in of meat now and again that Thornton killed, and Buck spent long hours musing by the fire. The vision of the shortlegged hairy man came to him more frequently, now that there was little work to be done; and often, blinking by the fire, Buck wandered with him in that other world which he remembered.</p>

John Thornton asked little of man or nature. He was unafraid of the wild. With a handful of salt and a rifle he could plunge into the wilderness and fare wherever he pleased and as long as he pleased. Being in no haste, Indian fashion, he hunted his dinner in the course of the day’s travel; and if he failed to find it, like the Indian, he kept on travelling, secure in the knowledge that sooner or later he would come to it.

        <p><em>Read the extract below then answer the questions.</em><br><br>
John Thornton asked little of man or nature. He was unafraid of the wild. With a handful of salt and a rifle he could plunge into the wilderness and fare wherever he pleased and as long as he pleased. Being in no haste, Indian fashion, he hunted his dinner in the course of the day’s travel; and if he failed to find it, like the Indian, he kept on travelling, secure in the knowledge that sooner or later he would come to it. So, on this great journey into the East, straight meat was the bill of fare, ammunition and tools principally made up the load on the sled, and the time-card was drawn upon the limitless future.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To Buck it was <span class="txt-underline"><strong>boundless delight</strong></span>, this hunting, fishing, and indefinite wandering through strange places. For weeks at a time they would hold on steadily, day after day; and for weeks upon end they would camp, here and there, the dogs loafing and the men burning holes through frozen muck and gravel and washing countless pans of dirt by the heat of the fire. Sometimes they went hungry, sometimes they feasted riotously, all according to the abundance of game and the fortune of hunting. Summer arrived, and dogs and men packed on their backs, rafted across blue mountain lakes, and descended or ascended unknown rivers in slender boats whipsawed from the standing forest.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The months came and went, and back and forth they twisted through the uncharted vastness, where no men were and yet where men had been if the Lost Cabin were true. They went across divides in summer blizzards, shivered under the midnight sun on naked mountains between the timber line and the eternal snows, dropped into summer valleys amid swarming gnats and flies, and in the shadows of glaciers picked strawberries and flowers as ripe and fair as any the Southland could boast. In the fall of the year they penetrated a weird lake country, sad and silent, where wildfowl had been, but where then there was no life nor sign of life—only the blowing of chill winds, the forming of ice in sheltered places, and the melancholy rippling of waves on lonely beaches.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And through another winter they wandered on the obliterated trails of men who had gone before. Once, they came upon a path blazed through the forest, an <span class="txt-underline"><strong>ancient path</strong></span>, and the Lost Cabin seemed very near. But the path began nowhere and ended nowhere, and it remained mystery, as the man who made it and the reason he made it remained mystery. Another time they chanced upon the time-graven wreckage of a hunting lodge, and amid the shreds of rotted blankets John Thornton found a longbarrelled flint-lock. He knew it for a Hudson Bay Company gun of the young days in the Northwest, when such a gun was worth its height in beaver skins packed flat, And that was all—no hint as to the man who in an early day had reared the lodge and left the gun among the blankets.</p>
        <p>Spring came on once more, and at the end of all their wandering they found, not the Lost Cabin, but a shallow placer in a broad valley where the gold showed like yellow butter across the bottom of the washing-pan. They sought no farther. Each day they worked earned them thousands of dollars in clean dust and nuggets, and they worked every day. The gold was sacked in moose-hide bags, fifty pounds to the bag, and piled like so much firewood outside the spruce-bough lodge. Like giants they toiled, days flashing on the heels of days like dreams as they heaped the treasure up.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was nothing for the dogs to do, save the hauling in of meat now and again that Thornton killed, and Buck spent long hours musing by the fire. The vision of the shortlegged hairy man came to him more frequently, now that there was little work to be done; and often, blinking by the fire, Buck wandered with him in that other world which he remembered.</p>

        <p><em>Read the extract below then answer the questions.</em><br><br>
John Thornton asked little of man or nature. He was unafraid of the wild. With a handful of salt and a rifle he could plunge into the wilderness and fare wherever he pleased and as long as he pleased. Being in no haste, Indian fashion, he hunted his dinner in the course of the day’s travel; and if he failed to find it, like the Indian, he kept on travelling, secure in the knowledge that sooner or later he would come to it. So, on this great journey into the East, straight meat was the bill of fare, ammunition and tools principally made up the load on the sled, and the time-card was drawn upon the limitless future.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To Buck it was <span class="txt-underline"><strong>boundless delight</strong></span>, this hunting, fishing, and indefinite wandering through strange places. For weeks at a time they would hold on steadily, day after day; and for weeks upon end they would camp, here and there, the dogs loafing and the men burning holes through frozen muck and gravel and washing countless pans of dirt by the heat of the fire. Sometimes they went hungry, sometimes they feasted riotously, all according to the abundance of game and the fortune of hunting. Summer arrived, and dogs and men packed on their backs, rafted across blue mountain lakes, and descended or ascended unknown rivers in slender boats whipsawed from the standing forest.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The months came and went, and back and forth they twisted through the uncharted vastness, where no men were and yet where men had been if the Lost Cabin were true. They went across divides in summer blizzards, shivered under the midnight sun on naked mountains between the timber line and the eternal snows, dropped into summer valleys amid swarming gnats and flies, and in the shadows of glaciers picked strawberries and flowers as ripe and fair as any the Southland could boast. In the fall of the year they penetrated a weird lake country, sad and silent, where wildfowl had been, but where then there was no life nor sign of life—only the blowing of chill winds, the forming of ice in sheltered places, and the melancholy rippling of waves on lonely beaches.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And through another winter they wandered on the obliterated trails of men who had gone before. Once, they came upon a path blazed through the forest, an <span class="txt-underline"><strong>ancient path</strong></span>, and the Lost Cabin seemed very near. But the path began nowhere and ended nowhere, and it remained mystery, as the man who made it and the reason he made it remained mystery. Another time they chanced upon the time-graven wreckage of a hunting lodge, and amid the shreds of rotted blankets John Thornton found a longbarrelled flint-lock. He knew it for a Hudson Bay Company gun of the young days in the Northwest, when such a gun was worth its height in beaver skins packed flat, And that was all—no hint as to the man who in an early day had reared the lodge and left the gun among the blankets.</p>
        <p>Spring came on once more, and at the end of all their wandering they found, not the Lost Cabin, but a shallow placer in a broad valley where the gold showed like yellow butter across the bottom of the washing-pan. They sought no farther. Each day they worked earned them thousands of dollars in clean dust and nuggets, and they worked every day. The gold was sacked in moose-hide bags, fifty pounds to the bag, and piled like so much firewood outside the spruce-bough lodge. Like giants they toiled, days flashing on the heels of days like dreams as they heaped the treasure up.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There was nothing for the dogs to do, save the hauling in of meat now and again that Thornton killed, and Buck spent long hours musing by the fire. The vision of the shortlegged hairy man came to him more frequently, now that there was little work to be done; and often, blinking by the fire, Buck wandered with him in that other world which he remembered.</p>

        <p><em>Read the poem by Robert Louis Stevenson below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>Hiawatha’s Childhood </strong>(Extract)<br><br>
At the door on summer evenings,<br>
Sat the little Hiawatha,<br>
Heard the whispering of the pine-trees,<br>
Heard the lapping of the waters,<br>
Sounds of music, words of wonder;<br>
“Minne-wawa!” said the pine-trees,<br>
“Mudway-aushka!” said the water.<br>
Saw the fire-fly Wah-wah-taysee,<br>
Flitting through the dusk of evening,<br>
With the twinkle of its candle<br>
Lighting up the brakes and bushes,<br>
And he sang the song of children,<br>
Sang the song Nokomis taught him;<br>
“Wah-wah-taysee, little fire-fly,<br>
Little flitting, white-fire insect,<br>
Little, dancing, white-fire creature,<br>
Light me with your little candle,<br>
Ere upon my bed I lay me,<br>
Ere in sleep I close my eyelids!”<br>
Saw the moon rise from the water,<br>
Rippling, rounding from the water,<br>
Saw the flecks and shadows on it,<br>
Whispered, “What is that, Nokomis?”<br>
And good Nokomis answered:<br>
“Once a warrior, very angry,<br>
Seized his grandmother, and threw her<br>
Up into the sky at midnight;<br>
Right against the moon he threw her;<br>
‘Tis her body that you see there.”<br>
Saw the rainbow in the heaven,<br>
In the eastern sky the rainbow,<br>
Whispered, “What is that, Nokomis?”<br>
And the good Nokomis answered:<br>
“’Tis the heaven of flowers you see there;<br>
All the wild-flowers of the forest,<br>
All the lilies of the prairie,<br>
When on earth they fade and perish,<br>
Blossom in that heaven above us.”<br>
When he heard the owls at midnight,<br>
Hooting, laughing in the forest,<br>
“What is that?’ he cried in terror;<br>
“What is that,” he said, “Nokomis?”<br>
And the good Nokomis answered;<br>
“That is but the owl and owlet,<br>
Talking in their native language,<br>
Talking, scolding at each other.”<br>
Then the little Hiawatha<br>
Learned their names and all their secrets,<br>
How they built their nests in summer,<br>
Where they hid themselves in winter,<br>
Talked with them whene’er he met them,<br>
Called them “Hiawatha’s Chickens.”<br>
Of all beasts he learned the language,<br>
Learned their names and all their secrets,<br>
How the beavers built their lodges,<br>
Where the squirrels hid their acorns,<br>
How the reindeer ran so swiftly,<br>
Why the rabbit was so timid,<br>
Talked with them whene’er he met them,<br>
Called them “Hiawatha’s Brothers.”</p>

At the door on summer evenings,<br>
Sat the little Hiawatha,<br>
Heard the whispering of the pine-trees,<br>
Heard the lapping of the waters,<br>
Sounds of music, words of wonder;<br>
“Minne-wawa!” said the pine-trees,<br>
“Mudway-aushka!” said the water.<br>
Saw the fire-fly Wah-wah-taysee,<br>
Flitting through the dusk of evening,<br>
With the twinkle of its candle<br>
Lighting up the brakes and bushes,<br>
And he sang the song of children,<br>
Sang the song Nokomis taught him;<br>
“Wah-wah-taysee, little fire-fly,<br>
Little flitting, white-fire insect,<br>
Little, dancing, white-fire creature,<br>
Light me with your little candle,<br>
Ere upon my bed I lay me,<br>
Ere in sleep I close my eyelids!”<br>
Saw the moon rise from the water,<br>
Rippling, rounding from the water,<br>
Saw the flecks and shadows on it,<br>
Whispered, “What is that, Nokomis?”<br>
And good Nokomis answered:<br>
“Once a warrior, very angry,<br>
Seized his grandmother, and threw her<br>
Up into the sky at midnight;<br>
Right against the moon he threw her;<br>
‘Tis her body that you see there.”<br>
Saw the rainbow in the heaven,<br>
In the eastern sky the rainbow,<br>
Whispered, “What is that, Nokomis?”<br>
And the good Nokomis answered:<br>
“’Tis the heaven of flowers you see there;<br>
All the wild-flowers of the forest,<br>
All the lilies of the prairie,<br>
When on earth they fade and perish,<br>
Blossom in that heaven above us.”<br>
When he heard the owls at midnight,<br>
Hooting, laughing in the forest,<br>
“What is that?’ he cried in terror;<br>
“What is that,” he said, “Nokomis?”<br>
And the good Nokomis answered;<br>
“That is but the owl and owlet,<br>
Talking in their native language,<br>
Talking, scolding at each other.”<br>
Then the little Hiawatha<br>
Learned their names and all their secrets,<br>
How they built their nests in summer,<br>
Where they hid themselves in winter,<br>
Talked with them whene’er he met them,<br>
Called them “Hiawatha’s Chickens.”<br>
Of all beasts he learned the language,<br>
Learned their names and all their secrets,<br>
How the beavers built their lodges,<br>
Where the squirrels hid their acorns,<br>
How the reindeer ran so swiftly,<br>
Why the rabbit was so timid,<br>
Talked with them whene’er he met them,<br>
Called them “Hiawatha’s Brothers.”</p>

When he heard the owls at midnight,<br>
Hooting, laughing in the forest,<br>
“What is that?’ he cried in terror;<br>
“What is that,” he said, “Nokomis?”<br>
And the good Nokomis answered;<br>
“That is but the owl and owlet,<br>
Talking in their native language,<br>
Talking, scolding at each other.”<br>
Then the little Hiawatha<br>
Learned their names and all their secrets,<br>
How they built their nests in summer,<br>
Where they hid themselves in winter,<br>
Talked with them whene’er he met them,<br>
Called them “Hiawatha’s Chickens.”<br>
Of all beasts he learned the language,<br>
Learned their names and all their secrets,<br>
How the beavers built their lodges,<br>
Where the squirrels hid their acorns,<br>
How the reindeer ran so swiftly,<br>
Why the rabbit was so timid,<br>
Talked with them whene’er he met them,<br>
Called them “Hiawatha’s Brothers.”</p>

        <p><em>Read the poem by Robert Louis Stevenson below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>Hiawatha’s Childhood </strong>(Extract)<br><br>
At the door on summer evenings,<br>
Sat the little Hiawatha,<br>
Heard the whispering of the pine-trees,<br>
Heard the lapping of the waters,<br>
Sounds of music, words of wonder;<br>
“Minne-wawa!” said the pine-trees,<br>
“Mudway-aushka!” said the water.<br>
Saw the fire-fly Wah-wah-taysee,<br>
Flitting through the dusk of evening,<br>
With the twinkle of its candle<br>
Lighting up the brakes and bushes,<br>
And he sang the song of children,<br>
Sang the song Nokomis taught him;<br>
“Wah-wah-taysee, little fire-fly,<br>
Little flitting, white-fire insect,<br>
Little, dancing, white-fire creature,<br>
Light me with your little candle,<br>
Ere upon my bed I lay me,<br>
Ere in sleep I close my eyelids!”<br>
Saw the moon rise from the water,<br>
Rippling, rounding from the water,<br>
Saw the flecks and shadows on it,<br>
Whispered, “What is that, Nokomis?”<br>
And good Nokomis answered:<br>
“Once a warrior, very angry,<br>
Seized his grandmother, and threw her<br>
Up into the sky at midnight;<br>
Right against the moon he threw her;<br>
‘Tis her body that you see there.”<br>
Saw the rainbow in the heaven,<br>
In the eastern sky the rainbow,<br>
Whispered, “What is that, Nokomis?”<br>
And the good Nokomis answered:<br>
“’Tis the heaven of flowers you see there;<br>
All the wild-flowers of the forest,<br>
All the lilies of the prairie,<br>
When on earth they fade and perish,<br>
Blossom in that heaven above us.”<br>
When he heard the owls at midnight,<br>
Hooting, laughing in the forest,<br>
“What is that?’ he cried in terror;<br>
“What is that,” he said, “Nokomis?”<br>
And the good Nokomis answered;<br>
“That is but the owl and owlet,<br>
Talking in their native language,<br>
Talking, scolding at each other.”<br>
Then the little Hiawatha<br>
Learned their names and all their secrets,<br>
How they built their nests in summer,<br>
Where they hid themselves in winter,<br>
Talked with them whene’er he met them,<br>
Called them “Hiawatha’s Chickens.”<br>
Of all beasts he learned the language,<br>
Learned their names and all their secrets,<br>
How the beavers built their lodges,<br>
Where the squirrels hid their acorns,<br>
How the reindeer ran so swiftly,<br>
Why the rabbit was so timid,<br>
Talked with them whene’er he met them,<br>
Called them “Hiawatha’s Brothers.”</p>
