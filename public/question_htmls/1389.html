          <strong>Biggles in Mexico&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by W. E. Johns&nbsp;</em><br><br>
THE sun blazed. It flayed the thirsty desert with bars of heat that knew no mercy, turning the arid north-west corner of Mexico into a glowing desolation. The air writhed and quivered under the relentless lash.</p>
        <p>Over all hung an <span class="txt-underline"><strong>ominous calm.</strong></span> A sinister silence. A profound, smothering silence, as if all life had been blotted out. Nothing stirred except the heatwaves, which set some distant mountains dancing and the horizon shimmering like a restless sea.</p>
        <p>There was no colour anywhere. All had faded in the devouring white light hurled down from a sky of burnished steel. Under it everything stood still and stark. The shadows of the saguaros, the giant cactuses which stood like the pillars of a lost civilisation, were thin and pale. Some of these monstrous vegetables had lost their flesh, having had it pecked out by desperate birds of passage, so that only the skeleton remained.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With a blast of heat as from a furnace the fiery master overhead struck at everything without discrimination. The dull alkaline sand; the grey chaparral—the usual desert growths of mesquit, yucca, agave, cactus and sagebrush. It struck at the bleaching bones of creatures that had perished; at outcrops of sand-eroded rock; boulders and buttes; meaningless patterns of gullies, and dried-up river beds that looked as if the tongues of stricken monsters had scoured the earth in a frenzied search for moisture.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It struck at the road that wound a sinuous course across the waste—if two ruts wriggling through the sand could be called a road. It struck at a heap of blistered wood and rusty metal, half buried in a drift of wind-blown sand, that had once been a motor car. And it struck at a touring car which, grey with dust, crawled along the track towards the wreck.</p>
        <p>There were two men in the car. Their faces, too, were grey with dust. Through it sweat had furrowed little lines. Even their friends would have found it hard to recognise Biggles of the Air Police, or his companion, Police Pilot Ginger Hebblethwaite.</p>
        <p>For the most part they travelled in silence, their lips shut tight to conserve the natural saliva of their mouths. But coming to the abandoned automobile Biggles spoke. ‘This could be Tricky Adamson’s car. It’s a Ford and has a Californian number plate. It must be somewhere about here.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Unless his tale was a lie.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘As you say, unless he lied; but I think he told the truth. The landscape conforms to what he said of it, anyway.’</p>
        <p>‘And the heat,’ muttered Ginger.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Biggles stopped the car. They got out and walked to the wreck. As Biggles looked in the open window, with a squawk of fright a little owl flew out. Biggles made a brief inspection. ‘As one would expect, the car’s been stripped of anything worth taking. We shall find nothing here. Let’s press on.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They returned to their own car.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As Biggles started it and moved forward Ginger said: ‘If anything goes wrong, we’re likely to end up like that. We must have been out of our minds to tackle this run in a used car.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘You mean, I must have been,’ corrected Biggles. ‘The scheme was mine. I didn’t imagine anything like this. Maybe I should, but it’s always easy to foresee trouble after it’s happened. I allowed for a run of from two to three hours. Certainly not more than four. And, foolishly perhaps, I expected to find an occasional garage on the way. I know the map showed desert, but this track we’re on was marked as a road, as indeed it was till we got to the frontier.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘It’s been getting worse ever since. It looks as if it might peter out altogether. If it does we shall be in a mess. I should have gone lighter on those four bottles of mineral water we started with.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘We’re nearer to being in a mess than you realise,’ said Biggles, grimly. ‘I notice the radiator’s boiling. At the rate things are going we may need that water for drinking before we’ve finished.’&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Biggles in Mexico&nbsp;</strong>

        <p><em>by W. E. Johns&nbsp;</em><br><br>
THE sun blazed. It flayed the thirsty desert with bars of heat that knew no mercy, turning the arid north-west corner of Mexico into a glowing desolation. The air writhed and quivered under the relentless lash.</p>
        <p>Over all hung an <span class="txt-underline"><strong>ominous calm.</strong></span> A sinister silence. A profound, smothering silence, as if all life had been blotted out. Nothing stirred except the heatwaves, which set some distant mountains dancing and the horizon shimmering like a restless sea.</p>
        <p>There was no colour anywhere. All had faded in the devouring white light hurled down from a sky of burnished steel. Under it everything stood still and stark. The shadows of the saguaros, the giant cactuses which stood like the pillars of a lost civilisation, were thin and pale. Some of these monstrous vegetables had lost their flesh, having had it pecked out by desperate birds of passage, so that only the skeleton remained.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With a blast of heat as from a furnace the fiery master overhead struck at everything without discrimination. The dull alkaline sand; the grey chaparral—the usual desert growths of mesquit, yucca, agave, cactus and sagebrush. It struck at the bleaching bones of creatures that had perished; at outcrops of sand-eroded rock; boulders and buttes; meaningless patterns of gullies, and dried-up river beds that looked as if the tongues of stricken monsters had scoured the earth in a frenzied search for moisture.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It struck at the road that wound a sinuous course across the waste—if two ruts wriggling through the sand could be called a road. It struck at a heap of blistered wood and rusty metal, half buried in a drift of wind-blown sand, that had once been a motor car. And it struck at a touring car which, grey with dust, crawled along the track towards the wreck.</p>
        <p>There were two men in the car. Their faces, too, were grey with dust. Through it sweat had furrowed little lines. Even their friends would have found it hard to recognise Biggles of the Air Police, or his companion, Police Pilot Ginger Hebblethwaite.</p>
        <p>For the most part they travelled in silence, their lips shut tight to conserve the natural saliva of their mouths. But coming to the abandoned automobile Biggles spoke. ‘This could be Tricky Adamson’s car. It’s a Ford and has a Californian number plate. It must be somewhere about here.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘Unless his tale was a lie.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘As you say, unless he lied; but I think he told the truth. The landscape conforms to what he said of it, anyway.’</p>
        <p>‘And the heat,’ muttered Ginger.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Biggles stopped the car. They got out and walked to the wreck. As Biggles looked in the open window, with a squawk of fright a little owl flew out. Biggles made a brief inspection. ‘As one would expect, the car’s been stripped of anything worth taking. We shall find nothing here. Let’s press on.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They returned to their own car.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As Biggles started it and moved forward Ginger said: ‘If anything goes wrong, we’re likely to end up like that. We must have been out of our minds to tackle this run in a used car.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘You mean, I must have been,’ corrected Biggles. ‘The scheme was mine. I didn’t imagine anything like this. Maybe I should, but it’s always easy to foresee trouble after it’s happened. I allowed for a run of from two to three hours. Certainly not more than four. And, foolishly perhaps, I expected to find an occasional garage on the way. I know the map showed desert, but this track we’re on was marked as a road, as indeed it was till we got to the frontier.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘It’s been getting worse ever since. It looks as if it might peter out altogether. If it does we shall be in a mess. I should have gone lighter on those four bottles of mineral water we started with.’&nbsp;</p>
        <p>‘We’re nearer to being in a mess than you realise,’ said Biggles, grimly. ‘I notice the radiator’s boiling. At the rate things are going we may need that water for drinking before we’ve finished.’&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Biggles in Mexico&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by W. E. Johns&nbsp;</em><br><br>
THE sun blazed. It flayed the thirsty desert with bars of heat that knew no mercy, turning the arid north-west corner of Mexico into a glowing desolation. The air writhed and quivered under the relentless lash.</p>
        <p>Over all hung an <span class="txt-underline"><strong>ominous calm.</strong></span> A sinister silence. A profound, smothering silence, as if all life had been blotted out. Nothing stirred except the heatwaves, which set some distant mountains dancing and the horizon shimmering like a restless sea.</p>
        <p>There was no colour anywhere. All had faded in the devouring white light hurled down from a sky of burnished steel. Under it everything stood still and stark. The shadows of the saguaros, the giant cactuses which stood like the pillars of a lost civilisation, were thin and pale. Some of these monstrous vegetables had lost their flesh, having had it pecked out by desperate birds of passage, so that only the skeleton remained.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With a blast of heat as from a furnace the fiery master overhead struck at everything without discrimination. The dull alkaline sand; the grey chaparral—the usual desert growths of mesquit, yucca, agave, cactus and sagebrush. It struck at the bleaching bones of creatures that had perished; at outcrops of sand-eroded rock; boulders and buttes; meaningless patterns of gullies, and dried-up river beds that looked as if the tongues of stricken monsters had scoured the earth in a frenzied search for moisture.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It struck at the road that wound a sinuous course across the waste—if two ruts wriggling through the sand could be called a road. It struck at a heap of blistered wood and rusty metal, half buried in a drift of wind-blown sand, that had once been a motor car. And it struck at a touring car which, grey with dust, crawled along the track towards the wreck.</p>
        <p>There were two men in the car. Their faces, too, were grey with dust. Through it sweat had furrowed little lines. Even their friends would have found it hard to recognise Biggles of the Air Police, or his companion, Police Pilot Ginger Hebblethwaite.</p>

          <strong>Biggles in Mexico&nbsp;</strong>

        <p><em>by W. E. Johns&nbsp;</em><br><br>
THE sun blazed. It flayed the thirsty desert with bars of heat that knew no mercy, turning the arid north-west corner of Mexico into a glowing desolation. The air writhed and quivered under the relentless lash.</p>
        <p>Over all hung an <span class="txt-underline"><strong>ominous calm.</strong></span> A sinister silence. A profound, smothering silence, as if all life had been blotted out. Nothing stirred except the heatwaves, which set some distant mountains dancing and the horizon shimmering like a restless sea.</p>
        <p>There was no colour anywhere. All had faded in the devouring white light hurled down from a sky of burnished steel. Under it everything stood still and stark. The shadows of the saguaros, the giant cactuses which stood like the pillars of a lost civilisation, were thin and pale. Some of these monstrous vegetables had lost their flesh, having had it pecked out by desperate birds of passage, so that only the skeleton remained.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With a blast of heat as from a furnace the fiery master overhead struck at everything without discrimination. The dull alkaline sand; the grey chaparral—the usual desert growths of mesquit, yucca, agave, cactus and sagebrush. It struck at the bleaching bones of creatures that had perished; at outcrops of sand-eroded rock; boulders and buttes; meaningless patterns of gullies, and dried-up river beds that looked as if the tongues of stricken monsters had scoured the earth in a frenzied search for moisture.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It struck at the road that wound a sinuous course across the waste—if two ruts wriggling through the sand could be called a road. It struck at a heap of blistered wood and rusty metal, half buried in a drift of wind-blown sand, that had once been a motor car. And it struck at a touring car which, grey with dust, crawled along the track towards the wreck.</p>
        <p>There were two men in the car. Their faces, too, were grey with dust. Through it sweat had furrowed little lines. Even their friends would have found it hard to recognise Biggles of the Air Police, or his companion, Police Pilot Ginger Hebblethwaite.</p>
        <p>For the most part they travelled in silence, their lips shut tight to conserve the natural saliva of their mouths. But coming to the abandoned automobile Biggles spoke. ‘This could be Tricky Adamson’s car. It’s a Ford and has a Californian number plate. It must be somewhere about here.’&nbsp;</p>

        <p>‘As you say, unless he lied; but I think he told the truth. The landscape conforms to what he said of it, anyway.’</p>
        <p>‘And the heat,’ muttered Ginger.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Biggles stopped the car. They got out and walked to the wreck. As Biggles looked in the open window, with a squawk of fright a little owl flew out.

Breathing the early morning air<br>
And leaving it still sweeter there<br>
And, one by one, intent upon<br>
Their purposes, they followed on<br>
In ordered silence... and were gone.<br>
<br>
But all the little wood was still<br>
As if it waited so, until<br>
Some blackbirds on an outpost yew<br>
Watching the slow procession through<br>
Lifted his yellow beak at last<br>
To whistle that the line had passed...<br>
Then all the wood began to sing<br>
Its morning anthem to the spring.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Africa’s not-so-big Two&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
YOU already know about Africa’s big five – the lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo and rhino. They’re the heroes of safari, celebrated for decades by gun-toting game hunters looking for the worthiest of foes. These days, the fearsome five serve a more useful marketing purpose, encouraging tourists to “tick and click” their way through the game parks of southern Africa. I’ve been fortunate to visit many game parks and have dutifully done the five. They’re big and beautiful, noble and regal and, in the case of the leopard, a right royal tease. <strong>15 ……….</strong> They’re the animals with bad manners and poor personal hygiene, the critters that are less than lovely on the eye, display unpalatable behaviour and are, in some cases, loathed. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you my Bestial Best Two.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Warthogs are rare in the animal world in that even their babies are ugly. <strong>16 ………. </strong>But pretty? No. The facial end of the warthog looks like it’s made with a bunch of stuff that no other animal wanted. It has two sets of tusks, tiny eyes, stiff whiskers and “warts”, the fatty protuberances that poke from either side of a ridiculously long face.</p>
        <p>But warthogs are good value precisely because they look so alien. They’re the gatekeepers of your African safari, telling you that you’ve arrived in the Dark Continent to encounter animal species you’ve only ever dreamt about. Chances are you’ll see the “pig of the plains” early in your trip, since they’re welcome guests in safari lodges. Warthog groundskeepers can be seen on the job 24/7, shuffling around on their front wrists (their front feet are tucked away, a sight in itself) to keep the lawns looking lovely. Despite those tusks and a quite evil-looking razorback mane, they muddle along OK with human beings and will let you get close enough for truly brilliant photos. <strong>17 ……….</strong> Last year, on a trip to Botswana, I discovered another reason to revere warthogs: they are absolutely delicious. Their meat is velvety smooth and baby-pink, a super-sweet pork that melts in your mouth. The first person in Australia to sell warthog meat will make a million.</p>
        <p>The other creature I admire is the Dung Beetle. On the Zambian side of Victoria Falls is Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park, which is home to the country’s only white rhinos. I saw one of them quite close – it charged the long-chassis Land Cruiser, stuck its horn under the rear wing and lifted us about half a metre into the air. The damage to the vehicle was substantial, but nothing to the damage wrought upon the hapless driver by his lodge owner for having failed to see a rhino behind a small bush.<strong> 18 ………. </strong>Nothing – except that you get none of this sort of trouble with a dung beetle. It is an ever-so-admirable and industrious little thing that spends its life quietly pushing excrement uphill.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That said, a safari vehicle will pull up if the guide sees a dung beetle. Why? Because these insects are really impressive and visitors are always intrigued by their antics. Only&nbsp;3cm long, they’re capable of converting a mountain of elephant poop to perfect golf-ballsized spheres and rolling them away. <strong>19 ………. </strong>The male does the rolling (the female clings on to the side of the ball) though sometimes they both roll together. The ball is eventually buried, eggs are laid and the larvae camps inside to feed.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Egyptians worshipped them (they’re part of the scarab family), cattle farmers still worship them (dung beetles are introduced to farmland, so good are they at mucking out). And in 2013, it was confirmed that dung beetles are the only known insect to navigate using the Milky Way. <strong>20 ………. </strong>So, when you see a dung beetle pushing its ball slowly through the warm dust, show it some proper respect – and drop to your knees and say hello.</p>

It is an ever-so-admirable and industrious little thing that spends its life quietly pushing excrement uphill.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That said, a safari vehicle will pull up if the guide sees a dung beetle. Why? Because these insects are really impressive and visitors are always intrigued by their antics. Only&nbsp;3cm long, they’re capable of converting a mountain of elephant poop to perfect golf-ballsized spheres and rolling them away. <strong>19 ………. </strong>The male does the rolling (the female clings on to the side of the ball) though sometimes they both roll together. The ball is eventually buried, eggs are laid and the larvae camps inside to feed.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Egyptians worshipped them (they’re part of the scarab family), cattle farmers still worship them (dung beetles are introduced to farmland, so good are they at mucking out). And in 2013, it was confirmed that dung beetles are the only known insect to navigate using the Milky Way. <strong>20 ………. </strong>So, when you see a dung beetle pushing its ball slowly through the warm dust, show it some proper respect – and drop to your knees and say hello.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Africa’s not-so-big Two&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
YOU already know about Africa’s big five – the lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo and rhino. They’re the heroes of safari, celebrated for decades by gun-toting game hunters looking for the worthiest of foes. These days, the fearsome five serve a more useful marketing purpose, encouraging tourists to “tick and click” their way through the game parks of southern Africa. I’ve been fortunate to visit many game parks and have dutifully done the five. They’re big and beautiful, noble and regal and, in the case of the leopard, a right royal tease. <strong>15 ……….</strong> They’re the animals with bad manners and poor personal hygiene, the critters that are less than lovely on the eye, display unpalatable behaviour and are, in some cases, loathed. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you my Bestial Best Two.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Warthogs are rare in the animal world in that even their babies are ugly. <strong>16 ………. </strong>But pretty? No. The facial end of the warthog looks like it’s made with a bunch of stuff that no other animal wanted. It has two sets of tusks, tiny eyes, stiff whiskers and “warts”, the fatty protuberances that poke from either side of a ridiculously long face.</p>
        <p>But warthogs are good value precisely because they look so alien. They’re the gatekeepers of your African safari, telling you that you’ve arrived in the Dark Continent to encounter animal species you’ve only ever dreamt about. Chances are you’ll see the “pig of the plains” early in your trip, since they’re welcome guests in safari lodges. Warthog groundskeepers can be seen on the job 24/7, shuffling around on their front wrists (their front feet are tucked away, a sight in itself) to keep the lawns looking lovely. Despite those tusks and a quite evil-looking razorback mane, they muddle along OK with human beings and will let you get close enough for truly brilliant photos. <strong>17 ……….</strong> Last year, on a trip to Botswana, I discovered another reason to revere warthogs: they are absolutely delicious. Their meat is velvety smooth and baby-pink, a super-sweet pork that melts in your mouth. The first person in Australia to sell warthog meat will make a million.</p>
        <p>The other creature I admire is the Dung Beetle. On the Zambian side of Victoria Falls is Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park, which is home to the country’s only white rhinos. I saw one of them quite close – it charged the long-chassis Land Cruiser, stuck its horn under the rear wing and lifted us about half a metre into the air. The damage to the vehicle was substantial, but nothing to the damage wrought upon the hapless driver by his lodge owner for having failed to see a rhino behind a small bush.<strong> 18 ………. </strong>Nothing – except that you get none of this sort of trouble with a dung beetle. It is an ever-so-admirable and industrious little thing that spends its life quietly pushing excrement uphill.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That said, a safari vehicle will pull up if the guide sees a dung beetle. Why? Because these insects are really impressive and visitors are always intrigued by their antics. Only&nbsp;3cm long, they’re capable of converting a mountain of elephant poop to perfect golf-ballsized spheres and rolling them away. <strong>19 ………. </strong>The male does the rolling (the female clings on to the side of the ball) though sometimes they both roll together. The ball is eventually buried, eggs are laid and the larvae camps inside to feed.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Egyptians worshipped them (they’re part of the scarab family), cattle farmers still worship them (dung beetles are introduced to farmland, so good are they at mucking out). And in 2013, it was confirmed that dung beetles are the only known insect to navigate using the Milky Way. <strong>20 ………. </strong>So, when you see a dung beetle pushing its ball slowly through the warm dust, show it some proper respect – and drop to your knees and say hello.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Africa’s not-so-big Two&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
YOU already know about Africa’s big five – the lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo and rhino. They’re the heroes of safari, celebrated for decades by gun-toting game hunters looking for the worthiest of foes. These days, the fearsome five serve a more useful marketing purpose, encouraging tourists to “tick and click” their way through the game parks of southern Africa. I’ve been fortunate to visit many game parks and have dutifully done the five. They’re big and beautiful, noble and regal and, in the case of the leopard, a right royal tease. <strong>15 ……….</strong> They’re the animals with bad manners and poor personal hygiene, the critters that are less than lovely on the eye, display unpalatable behaviour and are, in some cases, loathed. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you my Bestial Best Two.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Warthogs are rare in the animal world in that even their babies are ugly. <strong>16 ………. </strong>But pretty? No. The facial end of the warthog looks like it’s made with a bunch of stuff that no other animal wanted. It has two sets of tusks, tiny eyes, stiff whiskers and “warts”, the fatty protuberances that poke from either side of a ridiculously long face.</p>
        <p>But warthogs are good value precisely because they look so alien. They’re the gatekeepers of your African safari, telling you that you’ve arrived in the Dark Continent to encounter animal species you’ve only ever dreamt about. Chances are you’ll see the “pig of the plains” early in your trip, since they’re welcome guests in safari lodges. Warthog groundskeepers can be seen on the job 24/7, shuffling around on their front wrists (their front feet are tucked away, a sight in itself) to keep the lawns looking lovely. Despite those tusks and a quite evil-looking razorback mane, they muddle along OK with human beings and will let you get close enough for truly brilliant photos. <strong>17 ……….</strong> Last year, on a trip to Botswana, I discovered another reason to revere warthogs: they are absolutely delicious. Their meat is velvety smooth and baby-pink, a super-sweet pork that melts in your mouth. The first person in Australia to sell warthog meat will make a million.</p>
        <p>The other creature I admire is the Dung Beetle. On the Zambian side of Victoria Falls is Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park, which is home to the country’s only white rhinos. I saw one of them quite close – it charged the long-chassis Land Cruiser, stuck its horn under the rear wing and lifted us about half a metre into the air. The damage to the vehicle was substantial, but nothing to the damage wrought upon the hapless driver by his lodge owner for having failed to see a rhino behind a small bush.<strong> 18 ………. </strong>Nothing – except that you get none of this sort of trouble with a dung beetle. It is an ever-so-admirable and industrious little thing that spends its life quietly pushing excrement uphill.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That said, a safari vehicle will pull up if the guide sees a dung beetle. Why? Because these insects are really impressive and visitors are always intrigued by their antics. Only&nbsp;3cm long, they’re capable of converting a mountain of elephant poop to perfect golf-ballsized spheres and rolling them away. <strong>19 ………. </strong>The male does the rolling (the female clings on to the side of the ball) though sometimes they both roll together. The ball is eventually buried, eggs are laid and the larvae camps inside to feed.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Egyptians worshipped them (they’re part of the scarab family), cattle farmers still worship them (dung beetles are introduced to farmland, so good are they at mucking out). And in 2013, it was confirmed that dung beetles are the only known insect to navigate using the Milky Way. <strong>20 ………. </strong>So, when you see a dung beetle pushing its ball slowly through the warm dust, show it some proper respect – and drop to your knees and say hello.</p>

        <p><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Africa’s not-so-big Two&nbsp;</strong><br><br>
YOU already know about Africa’s big five – the lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo and rhino. They’re the heroes of safari, celebrated for decades by gun-toting game hunters looking for the worthiest of foes. These days, the fearsome five serve a more useful marketing purpose, encouraging tourists to “tick and click” their way through the game parks of southern Africa. I’ve been fortunate to visit many game parks and have dutifully done the five. They’re big and beautiful, noble and regal and, in the case of the leopard, a right royal tease. <strong>15 ……….</strong> They’re the animals with bad manners and poor personal hygiene, the critters that are less than lovely on the eye, display unpalatable behaviour and are, in some cases, loathed. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you my Bestial Best Two.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Warthogs are rare in the animal world in that even their babies are ugly. <strong>16 ………. </strong>But pretty? No. The facial end of the warthog looks like it’s made with a bunch of stuff that no other animal wanted. It has two sets of tusks, tiny eyes, stiff whiskers and “warts”, the fatty protuberances that poke from either side of a ridiculously long face.</p>
        <p>But warthogs are good value precisely because they look so alien. They’re the gatekeepers of your African safari, telling you that you’ve arrived in the Dark Continent to encounter animal species you’ve only ever dreamt about. Chances are you’ll see the “pig of the plains” early in your trip, since they’re welcome guests in safari lodges. Warthog groundskeepers can be seen on the job 24/7, shuffling around on their front wrists (their front feet are tucked away, a sight in itself) to keep the lawns looking lovely. Despite those tusks and a quite evil-looking razorback mane, they muddle along OK with human beings and will let you get close enough for truly brilliant photos. <strong>17 ……….</strong> Last year, on a trip to Botswana, I discovered another reason to revere warthogs: they are absolutely delicious. Their meat is velvety smooth and baby-pink, a super-sweet pork that melts in your mouth. The first person in Australia to sell warthog meat will make a million.</p>
        <p>The other creature I admire is the Dung Beetle. On the Zambian side of Victoria Falls is Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park, which is home to the country’s only white rhinos. I saw one of them quite close – it charged the long-chassis Land Cruiser, stuck its horn under the rear wing and lifted us about half a metre into the air. The damage to the vehicle was substantial, but nothing to the damage wrought upon the hapless driver by his lodge owner for having failed to see a rhino behind a small bush.<strong> 18 ………. </strong>Nothing – except that you get none of this sort of trouble with a dung beetle. It is an ever-so-admirable and industrious little thing that spends its life quietly pushing excrement uphill.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That said, a safari vehicle will pull up if the guide sees a dung beetle. Why? Because these insects are really impressive and visitors are always intrigued by their antics. Only&nbsp;3cm long, they’re capable of converting a mountain of elephant poop to perfect golf-ballsized spheres and rolling them away. <strong>19 ………. </strong>The male does the rolling (the female clings on to the side of the ball) though sometimes they both roll together. The ball is eventually buried, eggs are laid and the larvae camps inside to feed.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Egyptians worshipped them (they’re part of the scarab family), cattle farmers still worship them (dung beetles are introduced to farmland, so good are they at mucking out). And in 2013, it was confirmed that dung beetles are the only known insect to navigate using the Milky Way. <strong>20 ………. </strong>So, when you see a dung beetle pushing its ball slowly through the warm dust, show it some proper respect – and drop to your knees and say hello.</p>

Almost every successful person, whether in sport, business, family or leisure, possesses mental toughness attributes. Although they may not view themselves entirely that way, they almost certainly have a more positive and disciplined mindset than most other people. This mindset enables them to focus on achieving the outcomes they want, rather than be distracted or diverted by external factors or their own internal mental obstacles.<br>
<br>
It has been scientifically proven that mentally tough people are more successful, more positive and better able to manage their stress than those who aren’t as mentally tough. The good news is that Mental Toughness, which comprises both resilience (defined as the ability to bounce back from setbacks and failures) and confidence (defined as the ability to spot and seize opportunities) can be measured and then developed through a series of simple mental exercises – like going to the gym but for your mind.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
What are the types of physical endurance training? Endurance is the ability to do physical activity that increases your heart rate by 50% for as long as you can without getting tired.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There are two types of endurance: Specific endurance is when you fight against fatigue in sport-specific conditions. For example, if you run 1 500m you would use a specific combination of endurance training to excel in your 1 500m race. You might not be able to push yourself to do a 10 000m race if you have specifically focused on 1 500m.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
General endurance is when you fight against fatigue when doing different kinds of exercises. For example, if you run 1 500m, you can also run a 10 000m race without becoming fatigued. But if you compete against 10 000m runners who have done specific training for that distance, they would be able to outperform you.<br>

But for everyone, surely, what we have gone through in this period [the start of World War 2] -- I am addressing myself to the school -- surely from this period of ten months, this is the lesson: Never give in. Never give in. Never, never, never, never -- in nothing, great or small, large or petty -- never give in, except to convictions of honour and good sense.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Never yield to force. Never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy. We stood all alone a year ago, and, to many countries, it seemed that our account was closed, we were finished … we now find ourselves in a position where I say that we can be sure that we have only to persevere to conquer.&nbsp;<br>

Bear Grylls said he had “tears in his eyes regularly” while filming his new Amazon TV series. The adventurer hosts World’s Toughest Race: Eco-Challenge Fiji, which sees 66 teams from 30 countries race non-stop for 11 days, 24 hours a day, across hundreds of miles of rugged Fijian terrain complete with mountains, jungles and oceans. They cover 671 kilometres of terrain in a test of physical and mental endurance, in a bid to cross the finish line.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Speaking from north Wales, Grylls said the series was “a reminder for me in an era when the world desperately needs inspiration”. He added: “It was a reminder of the power of friendships and what you can do together and when you help each other and when you’re honest and vulnerable with each other. But also, a reminder of the power of just the human spirit, that resilience, that fire inside of all of us that it can conquer everything when everything is against you and you think the human body is incapable of it, mind and body and spirit is what really counts, that will always count more than the outer muscles, that fire and spirit can conquer all.”<br>

        <p>{^<strong>&nbsp;Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Almost every successful person, whether in sport, business, family or leisure, possesses mental toughness attributes. Although they may not view themselves entirely that way, they almost certainly have a more positive and disciplined mindset than most other people. This mindset enables them to focus on achieving the outcomes they want, rather than be distracted or diverted by external factors or their own internal mental obstacles.<br>
<br>
It has been scientifically proven that mentally tough people are more successful, more positive and better able to manage their stress than those who aren’t as mentally tough. The good news is that Mental Toughness, which comprises both resilience (defined as the ability to bounce back from setbacks and failures) and confidence (defined as the ability to spot and seize opportunities) can be measured and then developed through a series of simple mental exercises – like going to the gym but for your mind.<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
What are the types of physical endurance training? Endurance is the ability to do physical activity that increases your heart rate by 50% for as long as you can without getting tired.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There are two types of endurance: Specific endurance is when you fight against fatigue in sport-specific conditions. For example, if you run 1 500m you would use a specific combination of endurance training to excel in your 1 500m race. You might not be able to push yourself to do a 10 000m race if you have specifically focused on 1 500m.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
General endurance is when you fight against fatigue when doing different kinds of exercises. For example, if you run 1 500m, you can also run a 10 000m race without becoming fatigued. But if you compete against 10 000m runners who have done specific training for that distance, they would be able to outperform you.<br>

It has been scientifically proven that mentally tough people are more successful, more positive and better able to manage their stress than those who aren’t as mentally tough. The good news is that Mental Toughness, which comprises both resilience (defined as the ability to bounce back from setbacks and failures) and confidence (defined as the ability to spot and seize opportunities) can be measured and then developed through a series of simple mental exercises – like going to the gym but for your mind.<br>

What are the types of physical endurance training? Endurance is the ability to do physical activity that increases your heart rate by 50% for as long as you can without getting tired.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There are two types of endurance: Specific endurance is when you fight against fatigue in sport-specific conditions. For example, if you run 1 500m you would use a specific combination of endurance training to excel in your 1 500m race. You might not be able to push yourself to do a 10 000m race if you have specifically focused on 1 500m.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
General endurance is when you fight against fatigue when doing different kinds of exercises. For example, if you run 1 500m, you can also run a 10 000m race without becoming fatigued. But if you compete against 10 000m runners who have done specific training for that distance, they would be able to outperform you.<br>

<br>
But for everyone, surely, what we have gone through in this period [the start of World War 2] -- I am addressing myself to the school -- surely from this period of ten months, this is the lesson: Never give in. Never give in. Never, never, never, never -- in nothing, great or small, large or petty -- never give in, except to convictions of honour and good sense.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Never yield to force. Never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy. We stood all alone a year ago, and, to many countries, it seemed that our account was closed, we were finished … we now find ourselves in a position where I say that we can be sure that we have only to persevere to conquer.&nbsp;<br>

Bear Grylls said he had “tears in his eyes regularly” while filming his new Amazon TV series. The adventurer hosts World’s Toughest Race: Eco-Challenge Fiji, which sees 66 teams from 30 countries race non-stop for 11 days, 24 hours a day, across hundreds of miles of rugged Fijian terrain complete with mountains, jungles and oceans. They cover 671 kilometres of terrain in a test of physical and mental endurance, in a bid to cross the finish line.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Speaking from north Wales, Grylls said the series was “a reminder for me in an era when the world desperately needs inspiration”. He added: “It was a reminder of the power of friendships and what you can do together and when you help each other and when you’re honest and vulnerable with each other. But also, a reminder of the power of just the human spirit, that resilience, that fire inside of all of us that it can conquer everything when everything is against you and you think the human body is incapable of it, mind and body and spirit is what really counts, that will always count more than the outer muscles, that fire and spirit can conquer all.”<br>
