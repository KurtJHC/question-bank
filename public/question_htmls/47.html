        <p>Dear Sister,</p>
        <p>The time has again come round for me to write home. And it must be done tonight or you will not get one this week. Because we have a little more spare time Wednesday night than any other, and precious little then, for in addition to our regular studies we have a poor chance to do for examinations; two of which we will have next week - Greek, Mathematics.</p>
        <p>We are very well. The anniversary of the Graham Society was on last night. It was such a pleasant and beautiful moonlight that there was a large crowd. The anniversary address was delivered by Mr. Paxton of Rockbridge. It was a very good address, well written and very well delivered.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The question, "If Turkey fails to protect her [should] Christian nations interfere" was then discussed by four other members of the Society, whose names it is not necessary to mention. All the front of the college was illuminated and made a very pretty appearance.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>From all I can hear, I think that the secessionists are rapidly gaining ground in Virginia, and would not be surprised if that convention should declare Virginia out of the Union. From present appearances it seems that we are almost sure to have civil war.

        <p>Dear Sister,</p>
        <p>The time has again come round for me to write home. And it must be done tonight or you will not get one this week. Because we have a little more spare time Wednesday night than any other, and precious little then, for in addition to our regular studies we have a poor chance to do for examinations; two of which we will have next week - Greek, Mathematics.</p>
        <p>We are very well. The anniversary of the Graham Society was on last night. It was such a pleasant and beautiful moonlight that there was a large crowd. The anniversary address was delivered by Mr. Paxton of Rockbridge. It was a very good address, well written and very well delivered.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The question, "If Turkey fails to protect her [should] Christian nations interfere" was then discussed by four other members of the Society, whose names it is not necessary to mention. All the front of the college was illuminated and made a very pretty appearance.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>From all I can hear, I think that the secessionists are rapidly gaining ground in Virginia, and would not be surprised if that convention should declare Virginia out of the Union. From present appearances it seems that we are almost sure to have civil war. There are such extensive military preparations going on in the north and from the threatening and insulting way in which the Republican papers and from the overbearing and contemptuous actions of Congress in refusing compromises giving the South the barest justice, it must be Lincoln's intention to compel the South to remain in the Union, if he can. And if he attempts that, the whole South will and ought to unite and oppose it.<br>

        <p>The question, "If Turkey fails to protect her [should] Christian nations interfere" was then discussed by four other members of the Society, whose names it is not necessary to mention. All the front of the college was illuminated and made a very pretty appearance.</p>

        <p>Washington College<br>
<em>Lexington Jan 23 1861</em><br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Dear Sister,</p>
        <p>The time has again come round for me to write home. And it must be done tonight or you will not get one this week. Because we have a little more spare time Wednesday night than any other, and precious little then, for in addition to our regular studies we have a poor chance to do for examinations; two of which we will have next week - Greek, Mathematics.</p>
        <p>We are very well. The anniversary of the Graham Society was on last night. It was such a pleasant and beautiful moonlight that there was a large crowd. The anniversary address was delivered by Mr. Paxton of Rockbridge. It was a very good address, well written and very well delivered.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The question, "If Turkey fails to protect her [should] Christian nations interfere" was then discussed by four other members of the Society, whose names it is not necessary to mention. All the front of the college was illuminated and made a very pretty appearance.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>From all I can hear, I think that the secessionists are rapidly gaining ground in Virginia, and would not be surprised if that convention should declare Virginia out of the Union. From present appearances it seems that we are almost sure to have civil war. There are such extensive military preparations going on in the north and from the threatening and insulting way in which the Republican papers and from the overbearing and contemptuous actions of Congress in refusing compromises giving the South the barest justice, it must be Lincoln's intention to compel the South to remain in the Union, if he can. And if he attempts that, the whole South will and ought to unite and oppose it.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Writing letters is the hardest work that I have to do at College and since there is nothing here that will interest you, and believing that I have done remarkably well in having written this much, I quit.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Love to all,<br>
your brother<br>
<br>
A. Brooks</p>

          <strong>Black Beauty</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Mr. Blomefield, the vicar, had a large family of boys and girls; sometimes they used to come and play with Miss Jessie and Flora. One of the girls was as old as Miss Jessie; two of the boys were older, and there were several little ones. When they came there was plenty of work for Merrylegs, for nothing pleased them so much as getting on him by turns and riding him all about the orchard and the home paddock, and this they would do by the hour together.</p>

        <p>He looked very much offended, and said:</p>
        <p>"Of course not; I would not do such a thing for the best oats that ever came into the stable; why, I am as careful of our young ladies as the master could be, and as for the little ones it is I who teach them to ride.

It is not them, it is the boys; boys," said he, shaking his mane, "are quite different; they must be broken in as we were broken in when we were colts, and just be taught what's what.&nbsp;</p>

        </p>
        <p>Mr. Blomefield, the vicar, had a large family of boys and girls; sometimes they used to come and play with Miss Jessie and Flora. One of the girls was as old as Miss Jessie; two of the boys were older, and there were several little ones. When they came there was plenty of work for Merrylegs, for nothing pleased them so much as getting on him by turns and riding him all about the orchard and the home paddock, and this they would do by the hour together.</p>
        <p>One afternoon he had been out with them a long time, and when James brought him in and put on his halter he said:</p>
        <p>"There, you rogue, mind how you behave yourself, or we shall get into trouble."</p>

          <strong>Black Beauty</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Mr. Blomefield, the vicar, had a large family of boys and girls; sometimes they used to come and play with Miss Jessie and Flora. One of the girls was as old as Miss Jessie; two of the boys were older, and there were several little ones. When they came there was plenty of work for Merrylegs, for nothing pleased them so much as getting on him by turns and riding him all about the orchard and the home paddock, and this they would do by the hour together.</p>
        <p>One afternoon he had been out with them a long time, and when James brought him in and put on his halter he said:</p>
        <p>"There, you rogue, mind how you behave yourself, or we shall get into trouble."</p>
        <p>"What have you been doing, Merrylegs?" I asked.</p>
        <p>"Oh!" said he, tossing his little head, "I have only been giving those young people a lesson; they did not know when they had had enough, nor when I had had enough, so I just pitched them off backward; that was the only thing they could understand."</p>
        <p>"What!" said I, "you threw the children off? I thought you did know better than that! Did you throw Miss Jessie or Miss Flora?"</p>
        <p>He looked very much offended, and said:</p>
        <p>"Of course not; I would not do such a thing for the best oats that ever came into the stable; why, I am as careful of our young ladies as the master could be, and as for the little ones it is I who teach them to ride. When they seem frightened or a little unsteady on my back I go as smooth and as quiet as old pussy when she is after a bird; and when they are all right I go on again faster, you see, just to use them to it; so don't you trouble yourself preaching to me; I am the best friend and the best riding-master those children have. It is not them, it is the boys; boys," said he, shaking his mane, "are quite different; they must be broken in as we were broken in when we were colts, and just be taught what's what.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Black Beauty</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Mr. Blomefield, the vicar, had a large family of boys and girls; sometimes they used to come and play with Miss Jessie and Flora. One of the girls was as old as Miss Jessie; two of the boys were older, and there were several little ones. When they came there was plenty of work for Merrylegs, for nothing pleased them so much as getting on him by turns and riding him all about the orchard and the home paddock, and this they would do by the hour together.</p>
        <p>One afternoon he had been out with them a long time, and when James brought him in and put on his halter he said:</p>
        <p>"There, you rogue, mind how you behave yourself, or we shall get into trouble."</p>
        <p>"What have you been doing, Merrylegs?" I asked.</p>
        <p>"Oh!" said he, tossing his little head, "I have only been giving those young people a lesson; they did not know when they had had enough, nor when I had had enough, so I just pitched them off backward; that was the only thing they could understand."</p>
        <p>"What!" said I, "you threw the children off? I thought you did know better than that! Did you throw Miss Jessie or Miss Flora?"</p>
        <p>He looked very much offended, and said:</p>
        <p>"Of course not; I would not do such a thing for the best oats that ever came into the stable; why, I am as careful of our young ladies as the master could be, and as for the little ones it is I who teach them to ride. When they seem frightened or a little unsteady on my back I go as smooth and as quiet as old pussy when she is after a bird; and when they are all right I go on again faster, you see, just to use them to it; so don't you trouble yourself preaching to me; I am the best friend and the best riding-master those children have. It is not them, it is the boys; boys," said he, shaking his mane, "are quite different; they must be broken in as we were broken in when we were colts, and just be taught what's what.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Country Profile: Laos</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Laos, one of the world's few remaining communist states, is one of east Asia's poorest countries. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 it has struggled to find its position within a changing political and economic landscape.</p>
        <p>Communist forces overthrew the monarchy in 1975, heralding years of isolation. Laos began opening up to the world in the 1990s, but despite tentative reforms, it remains poor and dependent on international donations.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>OVERVIEW</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>Thailand is the largest foreign investor in Laos. Whilst this support is badly needed, the dangers of exposing Laos's fragile economy to world trends are clear.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Politics: Ruling communists maintain a monopoly of political power</p>
        <p>Economy: One of the world's poorest nations, Laos has little industry and relies on foreign aid; hopes are pinned on a hydroelectric project</p>
        <p>International: Communist regime is backed by China and Vietnam</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>Timeline</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>The Asian currency crisis of 1997 caused the national currency, the kip, to lose more than nine-tenths of its value against the US dollar.</p>
        <p>Laos is a <strong>landlocked</strong>, mountainous country, widely covered by largely unspoilt tropical forest. Less than 5% of the land is suitable for subsistence agriculture, which nevertheless provides around 80% of employment.</p>
        <p>The main crop is rice, which is grown on the fertile floodplain of the Mekong River. Vegetables, fruit, spices and cotton are also grown. Part of the region's heroin-producing "Golden Triangle", Laos has all but stamped out opium production.</p>
        <p>Outside the capital, many people live without electricity or access to basic facilities. But Laos is banking on the anticipated returns from a billion-dollar dam scheme, intended to generate electricity for export to Thailand, to boost its economy and infrastructure.</p>
        <p>Several small bomb blasts in recent years in and around the capital, Vientiane, have suggested that opposition to the ruling party may be growing. <strong>But any public dissent is dealt with harshly by the authorities</strong>.</p>
        <p>The country's human rights record has come under scrutiny. Laos denies accusations of abuses by the military against the ethnic minority Hmong. Hmong groups have been fighting a low-level rebellion against the communist regime since 1975.</p>

        <p>Laos, one of the world's few remaining communist states, is one of east Asia's poorest countries. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 it has struggled to find its position within a changing political and economic landscape.</p>
        <p>Communist forces overthrew the monarchy in 1975, heralding years of isolation. Laos began opening up to the world in the 1990s, but despite tentative reforms, it remains poor and dependent on international donations.</p>

        <p>The Asian currency crisis of 1997 caused the national currency, the kip, to lose more than nine-tenths of its value against the US dollar.</p>
        <p>Laos is a <strong>landlocked</strong>, mountainous country, widely covered by largely unspoilt tropical forest. Less than 5% of the land is suitable for subsistence agriculture, which nevertheless provides around 80% of employment.</p>
        <p>The main crop is rice, which is grown on the fertile floodplain of the Mekong River. Vegetables, fruit, spices and cotton are also grown. Part of the region's heroin-producing "Golden Triangle", Laos has all but stamped out opium production.</p>
        <p>Outside the capital, many people live without electricity or access to basic facilities. But Laos is banking on the anticipated returns from a billion-dollar dam scheme, intended to generate electricity for export to Thailand, to boost its economy and infrastructure.</p>
        <p>Several small bomb blasts in recent years in and around the capital, Vientiane, have suggested that opposition to the ruling party may be growing. <strong>But any public dissent is dealt with harshly by the authorities</strong>.</p>
        <p>The country's human rights record has come under scrutiny. Laos denies accusations of abuses by the military against the ethnic minority Hmong. Hmong groups have been fighting a low-level rebellion against the communist regime since 1975.</p>

        <p>Outside the capital, many people live without electricity or access to basic facilities. But Laos is banking on the anticipated returns from a billion-dollar dam scheme, intended to generate electricity for export to Thailand, to boost its economy and infrastructure.</p>
        <p>Several small bomb blasts in recent years in and around the capital, Vientiane, have suggested that opposition to the ruling party may be growing. <strong>But any public dissent is dealt with harshly by the authorities</strong>.</p>
        <p>The country's human rights record has come under scrutiny. Laos denies accusations of abuses by the military against the ethnic minority Hmong. Hmong groups have been fighting a low-level rebellion against the communist regime since 1975.</p>

          <strong>The&nbsp;Redback Leftovers</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>By Debra Oswald</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>No sane person could describe the Redback Bay Under 13 Leftovers as a ‘team’ really. Imagine the worst soccer team you ever saw and then triple it. Let me review the lineup of players to give you some idea.</p>
        <p>Shane Borman (the fridge with a head) was a pretty good player - except for one problem. He kept growling and thumping everyone else on the field. Even players on his own team.</p>
        <p>Someone’d bump Shane accidentally and he’d aim his fist. ‘Want me to thump ya? Do ya? I will. I’ll thump ya,’ he’d roar. And you had no trouble believing him.</p>
        <p>Robbie Oldroyd copped quite a few of Shane’s threats. Something about him particularly riles Shane up. Robbie would just dance off, cackling.</p>
        <p>Robbie went to my school, so I already knew he wasn’t on the same planet as other people. For a start, he was always singing to himself. In the middle of a soccer game he’d lose interest, wander off and swing back and forth on the goalposts or beat out a rhythm on the crossbar like it was a set of drums. Robbie made me laugh and he was never nasty - but I can see why he drove a lot of people crazy.</p>
        <p>Mozzie was so small and scrawny, you’d pick him for maybe six years old. It was hard to believe he was nearly thirteen. You had to watch where you were going so you didn’t tread on tiny Mozzie.</p>
        <p>That little guy was certainly fast, with decent ball skills. When I first saw him streak ahead of the pack, dribbling the ball, I thought - yes, one good player. But two seconds later, Mozzie got tackled and pulverised by one of the bigger players. He lay on the ground, too scared to get up, so small you could hardly see him above the stalks of grass.</p>
        <p>There was a beefy girl called Sarah. Seriously tall, huge shoulders, legs like tree trunks. She was pretty slow and lumbering on the field. Sarah ended up in the Leftovers because she’d quit the girls’ team. I think she was sick of getting teased about being big and all that.</p>
        <p>Anthony Zammit had been a hopeless player when he was five years old. But now he was thirteen, he was even worse.</p>
        <p>Anthony’s speciality was the ‘air-kick’ where he’d swipe at the ball but only connect with the air and end up landing on his bum. But the thing about Anthony was that he didn’t care. He kept on hauling himself to his feet, still grinning. He was having a fantastic time, no matter how lousy he played. Anthony Zammit loved soccer more than any kid I ever met.</p>
        <p>And Spencer - well, I hate to say it but Spencer was hopeless. Spencer kept trying these tricky manoeuvres but he’d always trip on his own feet and collapse face first in the dirt. Then Shane would run right over the top of him, grinding his big boot into Spencer’s back.</p>
        <p>We had one player, Oliver, who didn’t even bother running after the ball. He just trudged grimly across the field, muttering to himself. Oliver had never played soccer in his life. He was only there because he’s done a deal with his mum to give one sport a go for a season.</p>
        <p>At least Oliver turned up. Holly hardly ever showed. She always came running in late to training, panting and lopsided - with one soccer boot on, the other boot flapping in her hand. One side of her hair in a plait, the rest blowing loose. Too flustered and panicky to concentrate on soccer.</p>
        <p>Holly had wanted to be in the girls’ team but she was too disorganised to register in time. That’s how she’d ended up a Leftover.</p>
        <p>Okay, so we did have a few good players. Apart from Stefan, we had Maria. She had speed, brilliant ball skills and fierce determination. Maria’s old club never gave girls a decent chance to make the First Grade. She got so mad she switched clubs. Now Maria was out to prove something. Trouble was, she got stuck in the Leftovers.</p>

          <strong>The&nbsp;Redback Leftovers</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>By Debra Oswald</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>No sane person could describe the Redback Bay Under 13 Leftovers as a ‘team’ really. Imagine the worst soccer team you ever saw and then triple it. Let me review the lineup of players to give you some idea.</p>
        <p>Shane Borman (the fridge with a head) was a pretty good player - except for one problem. He kept growling and thumping everyone else on the field. Even players on his own team.</p>
        <p>Someone’d bump Shane accidentally and he’d aim his fist. ‘Want me to thump ya? Do ya? I will. I’ll thump ya,’ he’d roar. And you had no trouble believing him.</p>
        <p>Robbie Oldroyd copped quite a few of Shane’s threats. Something about him particularly riles Shane up. Robbie would just dance off, cackling.</p>
        <p>Robbie went to my school, so I already knew he wasn’t on the same planet as other people. For a start, he was always singing to himself. In the middle of a soccer game he’d lose interest, wander off and swing back and forth on the goalposts or beat out a rhythm on the crossbar like it was a set of drums. Robbie made me laugh and he was never nasty - but I can see why he drove a lot of people crazy.</p>
        <p>Mozzie was so small and scrawny, you’d pick him for maybe six years old. It was hard to believe he was nearly thirteen. You had to watch where you were going so you didn’t tread on tiny Mozzie.</p>
        <p>That little guy was certainly fast, with decent ball skills. When I first saw him streak ahead of the pack, dribbling the ball, I thought - yes, one good player. But two seconds later, Mozzie got tackled and pulverised by one of the bigger players. He lay on the ground, too scared to get up, so small you could hardly see him above the stalks of grass.</p>
        <p>There was a beefy girl called Sarah. Seriously tall, huge shoulders, legs like tree trunks. She was pretty slow and lumbering on the field. Sarah ended up in the Leftovers because she’d quit the girls’ team. I think she was sick of getting teased about being big and all that.</p>
        <p>Anthony Zammit had been a hopeless player when he was five years old. But now he was thirteen, he was even worse.</p>
        <p>Anthony’s speciality was the ‘air-kick’ where he’d swipe at the ball but only connect with the air and end up landing on his bum. But the thing about Anthony was that he didn’t care. He kept on hauling himself to his feet, still grinning. He was having a fantastic time, no matter how lousy he played. Anthony Zammit loved soccer more than any kid I ever met.</p>
        <p>And Spencer - well, I hate to say it but Spencer was hopeless. Spencer kept trying these tricky manoeuvres but he’d always trip on his own feet and collapse face first in the dirt. Then Shane would run right over the top of him, grinding his big boot into Spencer’s back.</p>
        <p>We had one player, Oliver, who didn’t even bother running after the ball. He just trudged grimly across the field, muttering to himself. Oliver had never played soccer in his life. He was only there because he’s done a deal with his mum to give one sport a go for a season.</p>
        <p>At least Oliver turned up. Holly hardly ever showed. She always came running in late to training, panting and lopsided - with one soccer boot on, the other boot flapping in her hand. One side of her hair in a plait, the rest blowing loose. Too flustered and panicky to concentrate on soccer.</p>
        <p>Holly had wanted to be in the girls’ team but she was too disorganised to register in time. That’s how she’d ended up a Leftover.</p>
        <p>Okay, so we did have a few good players. Apart from Stefan, we had Maria. She had speed, brilliant ball skills and fierce determination. Maria’s old club never gave girls a decent chance to make the First Grade. She got so mad she switched clubs. Now Maria was out to prove something. Trouble was, she got stuck in the Leftovers.</p>

          <strong>The&nbsp;Redback Leftovers</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>By Debra Oswald</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>No sane person could describe the Redback Bay Under 13 Leftovers as a ‘team’ really. Imagine the worst soccer team you ever saw and then triple it. Let me review the lineup of players to give you some idea.</p>
        <p>Shane Borman (the fridge with a head) was a pretty good player - except for one problem. He kept growling and thumping everyone else on the field. Even players on his own team.</p>
        <p>Someone’d bump Shane accidentally and he’d aim his fist. ‘Want me to thump ya? Do ya? I will. I’ll thump ya,’ he’d roar. And you had no trouble believing him.</p>
        <p>Robbie Oldroyd copped quite a few of Shane’s threats. Something about him particularly riles Shane up. Robbie would just dance off, cackling.</p>
        <p>Robbie went to my school, so I already knew he wasn’t on the same planet as other people. For a start, he was always singing to himself. In the middle of a soccer game he’d lose interest, wander off and swing back and forth on the goalposts or beat out a rhythm on the crossbar like it was a set of drums. Robbie made me laugh and he was never nasty - but I can see why he drove a lot of people crazy.</p>
        <p>Mozzie was so small and scrawny, you’d pick him for maybe six years old. It was hard to believe he was nearly thirteen. You had to watch where you were going so you didn’t tread on tiny Mozzie.</p>
        <p>That little guy was certainly fast, with decent ball skills. When I first saw him streak ahead of the pack, dribbling the ball, I thought - yes, one good player. But two seconds later, Mozzie got tackled and pulverised by one of the bigger players. He lay on the ground, too scared to get up, so small you could hardly see him above the stalks of grass.</p>
        <p>There was a beefy girl called Sarah. Seriously tall, huge shoulders, legs like tree trunks. She was pretty slow and lumbering on the field. Sarah ended up in the Leftovers because she’d quit the girls’ team. I think she was sick of getting teased about being big and all that.</p>
        <p>Anthony Zammit had been a hopeless player when he was five years old. But now he was thirteen, he was even worse.</p>
        <p>Anthony’s speciality was the ‘air-kick’ where he’d swipe at the ball but only connect with the air and end up landing on his bum. But the thing about Anthony was that he didn’t care. He kept on hauling himself to his feet, still grinning. He was having a fantastic time, no matter how lousy he played. Anthony Zammit loved soccer more than any kid I ever met.</p>
        <p>And Spencer - well, I hate to say it but Spencer was hopeless. Spencer kept trying these tricky manoeuvres but he’d always trip on his own feet and collapse face first in the dirt. Then Shane would run right over the top of him, grinding his big boot into Spencer’s back.</p>
        <p>We had one player, Oliver, who didn’t even bother running after the ball. He just trudged grimly across the field, muttering to himself. Oliver had never played soccer in his life. He was only there because he’s done a deal with his mum to give one sport a go for a season.</p>
        <p>At least Oliver turned up. Holly hardly ever showed. She always came running in late to training, panting and lopsided - with one soccer boot on, the other boot flapping in her hand. One side of her hair in a plait, the rest blowing loose. Too flustered and panicky to concentrate on soccer.</p>
        <p>Holly had wanted to be in the girls’ team but she was too disorganised to register in time. That’s how she’d ended up a Leftover.</p>
        <p>Okay, so we did have a few good players. Apart from Stefan, we had Maria. She had speed, brilliant ball skills and fierce determination. Maria’s old club never gave girls a decent chance to make the First Grade. She got so mad she switched clubs. Now Maria was out to prove something. Trouble was, she got stuck in the Leftovers.</p>
