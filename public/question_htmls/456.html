          <strong>Striking Out the Guys</strong>

          <em>Segregation, or separation of people by race, was once a part of life in the United States. Professional baseball, public schools, buildings, and buses and trains were often segregated. The following is the story of Mamie Johnson, a young African American woman who fought for the chance to play baseball.</em>
        </p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Leave!” the large man with the cigar yelled. “Colored girls like you aren’t allowed to play in this league!”</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Seventeen-year-old Mamie Johnson couldn’t believe what the man was saying to her. For her entire life, all that she had thought about was baseball. Mamie had played in her grandmother’s yard when she was a young girl. When she was 10, she was selected to play on the all-white, all-male Police Athletic League team in Long Branch, New Jersey, after she demonstrated her pitching skills to the coach. When she moved to Washington, D.C., to live with her mother, she played in a city league that had excellent players. And today this man from the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League was telling her that she didn’t belong, without even letting her try out for the team!</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mamie reached down and picked up the ball she had been practicing with. She squeezed it as hard as she could, trying to hold back the tears. As she held the ball, she knew she had to throw it at least once. She knew the man would never change his mind, but she had to show him what he would be missing. She raised the ball up to her chest, kicked up her leg, pulled her arm back, and threw the ball as hard as she could toward home plate.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the ball landed beyond home plate, everyone’s eyes turned toward Mamie. She heard the whispers as she picked up her things. With her head held high, Mamie walked off the field and headed for the bus stop. She had been fighting battles like this all her life. People would tell her that girls weren’t supposed to play baseball. Then they would tell her that she shouldn’t play baseball with boys. Other people didn’t think she should play with white people.&nbsp;Some even taunted her about her small size. She was only five feet three inches tall and weighed less than 100 pounds. But Mamie surprised them, and she always proved them wrong.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although Mamie wasn’t given a chance to try out for the girl’s professional baseball league, she didn’t stop playing the game she loved. She spent just about every Sunday afternoon during spring and summer playing at Bannecker Field in Washington, D.C. The people who watched her play weren’t so critical. The baseball field was in the middle of an African American neighborhood. A university and a school were nearby, and there was a bakery so close by that freshly baked bread could be smelled from the field. When Mamie stepped up on the pitcher’s mound, she could see the U.S. Capitol.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One Sunday afternoon in 1953, Mamie’s friend Rita pointed at the stands and whispered, “That man in the suit has been at our games for the last three weeks. I wonder who he is.” Rita loved baseball as much as Mamie did. Rita had gone to the tryouts for the girl’s professional baseball league with Mamie two years ago, hoping to get a position on the team. Mamie wondered whether the man was a scout looking for new players for a professional team.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Let’s show him how well the girls can play with these guys,” Mamie said, smiling at Rita.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mamie ran onto the field and took her spot on the pitcher’s mound. She was feeling good, and her right arm felt strong. Even though Mamie was tiny, she didn’t feel small today. As the game began and she threw more and more pitches, she started to feel like a giant. Mamie struck out one batter after another and thought she was having her best game ever.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By the time the game was almost over, Mamie’s team was winning, but by only one run. Mamie looked at the last batter. She knew that he was just as determined to win the game as she was. Mamie could also feel the man in the suit watching her from the stands. She had to show them both what she could do. This batter was the best hitter on the team. He would try to hit a home run, and there were two runners on&nbsp;the bases. Mamie knew she had to strike him out. She took a deep breath and gripped the ball in her hand. Then she threw the first pitch right over the plate for a strike.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the batter got set again, Mamie thought about her next pitch. Staring at the tall batter, Mamie threw a ball that was level with his knees. He swung hard but missed, for a second strike.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“One more strike, and he’s out!” Mamie heard Rita yelling from behind her. “You can do it!”</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mamie tried to relax as she felt the eyes of the man in the suit watching her every move. She stepped back onto the pitcher’s mound and again waited for the batter to get ready. She didn’t have to wait for long, though. He stepped up to the plate and pointed at Mamie with the bat, trying to make her flinch. But that was the worst thing he could have done. Mamie remained calm. With all her might, she threw the ball and sent the batter a message—strike three!</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before Mamie knew it, she was surrounded by <span class="txt-underline">jubilant</span> teammates who jumped up and down and congratulated her. Then the man in the suit shook her hand and introduced himself. “I’m Bish Tyson,” he said. “Can you come try out for my team next week? I work for the Indianapolis Clowns, one of the best professional baseball teams in the Negro Leagues. I’d like to recruit you for the team.”</p>
        <p>
          <em>In 1953 Mamie “Peanut” Johnson (who was given her nickname because of her size) became the first woman to pitch in a professional baseball league for African American men. Known for her pitching style and precision, Mamie Johnson proved her ability to play alongside men.</em>

          <em>Segregation, or separation of people by race, was once a part of life in the United States. Professional baseball, public schools, buildings, and buses and trains were often segregated. The following is the story of Mamie Johnson, a young African American woman who fought for the chance to play baseball.</em>
        </p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Leave!” the large man with the cigar yelled. “Colored girls like you aren’t allowed to play in this league!”</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Seventeen-year-old Mamie Johnson couldn’t believe what the man was saying to her. For her entire life, all that she had thought about was baseball. Mamie had played in her grandmother’s yard when she was a young girl. When she was 10, she was selected to play on the all-white, all-male Police Athletic League team in Long Branch, New Jersey, after she demonstrated her pitching skills to the coach. When she moved to Washington, D.C., to live with her mother, she played in a city league that had excellent players. And today this man from the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League was telling her that she didn’t belong, without even letting her try out for the team!</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mamie reached down and picked up the ball she had been practicing with. She squeezed it as hard as she could, trying to hold back the tears. As she held the ball, she knew she had to throw it at least once. She knew the man would never change his mind, but she had to show him what he would be missing. She raised the ball up to her chest, kicked up her leg, pulled her arm back, and threw the ball as hard as she could toward home plate.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the ball landed beyond home plate, everyone’s eyes turned toward Mamie. She heard the whispers as she picked up her things. With her head held high, Mamie walked off the field and headed for the bus stop. She had been fighting battles like this all her life. People would tell her that girls weren’t supposed to play baseball. Then they would tell her that she shouldn’t play baseball with boys. Other people didn’t think she should play with white people.&nbsp;Some even taunted her about her small size. She was only five feet three inches tall and weighed less than 100 pounds. But Mamie surprised them, and she always proved them wrong.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although Mamie wasn’t given a chance to try out for the girl’s professional baseball league, she didn’t stop playing the game she loved. She spent just about every Sunday afternoon during spring and summer playing at Bannecker Field in Washington, D.C. The people who watched her play weren’t so critical. The baseball field was in the middle of an African American neighborhood. A university and a school were nearby, and there was a bakery so close by that freshly baked bread could be smelled from the field. When Mamie stepped up on the pitcher’s mound, she could see the U.S. Capitol.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One Sunday afternoon in 1953, Mamie’s friend Rita pointed at the stands and whispered, “That man in the suit has been at our games for the last three weeks. I wonder who he is.” Rita loved baseball as much as Mamie did. Rita had gone to the tryouts for the girl’s professional baseball league with Mamie two years ago, hoping to get a position on the team. Mamie wondered whether the man was a scout looking for new players for a professional team.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Let’s show him how well the girls can play with these guys,” Mamie said, smiling at Rita.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mamie ran onto the field and took her spot on the pitcher’s mound. She was feeling good, and her right arm felt strong. Even though Mamie was tiny, she didn’t feel small today. As the game began and she threw more and more pitches, she started to feel like a giant. Mamie struck out one batter after another and thought she was having her best game ever.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By the time the game was almost over, Mamie’s team was winning, but by only one run. Mamie looked at the last batter. She knew that he was just as determined to win the game as she was. Mamie could also feel the man in the suit watching her from the stands. She had to show them both what she could do. This batter was the best hitter on the team. He would try to hit a home run, and there were two runners on&nbsp;the bases. Mamie knew she had to strike him out. She took a deep breath and gripped the ball in her hand. Then she threw the first pitch right over the plate for a strike.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the batter got set again, Mamie thought about her next pitch. Staring at the tall batter, Mamie threw a ball that was level with his knees. He swung hard but missed, for a second strike.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“One more strike, and he’s out!” Mamie heard Rita yelling from behind her. “You can do it!”</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mamie tried to relax as she felt the eyes of the man in the suit watching her every move. She stepped back onto the pitcher’s mound and again waited for the batter to get ready. She didn’t have to wait for long, though. He stepped up to the plate and pointed at Mamie with the bat, trying to make her flinch. But that was the worst thing he could have done. Mamie remained calm. With all her might, she threw the ball and sent the batter a message—strike three!</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before Mamie knew it, she was surrounded by <span class="txt-underline">jubilant</span> teammates who jumped up and down and congratulated her. Then the man in the suit shook her hand and introduced himself. “I’m Bish Tyson,” he said. “Can you come try out for my team next week? I work for the Indianapolis Clowns, one of the best professional baseball teams in the Negro Leagues. I’d like to recruit you for the team.”</p>
        <p>

          <em>Segregation, or separation of people by race, was once a part of life in the United States. Professional baseball, public schools, buildings, and buses and trains were often segregated. The following is the story of Mamie Johnson, a young African American woman who fought for the chance to play baseball.</em>
        </p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Leave!” the large man with the cigar yelled. “Colored girls like you aren’t allowed to play in this league!”</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Seventeen-year-old Mamie Johnson couldn’t believe what the man was saying to her. For her entire life, all that she had thought about was baseball. Mamie had played in her grandmother’s yard when she was a young girl. When she was 10, she was selected to play on the all-white, all-male Police Athletic League team in Long Branch, New Jersey, after she demonstrated her pitching skills to the coach. When she moved to Washington, D.C., to live with her mother, she played in a city league that had excellent players. And today this man from the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League was telling her that she didn’t belong, without even letting her try out for the team!</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mamie reached down and picked up the ball she had been practicing with. She squeezed it as hard as she could, trying to hold back the tears. As she held the ball, she knew she had to throw it at least once. She knew the man would never change his mind, but she had to show him what he would be missing. She raised the ball up to her chest, kicked up her leg, pulled her arm back, and threw the ball as hard as she could toward home plate.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the ball landed beyond home plate, everyone’s eyes turned toward Mamie. She heard the whispers as she picked up her things. With her head held high, Mamie walked off the field and headed for the bus stop. She had been fighting battles like this all her life. People would tell her that girls weren’t supposed to play baseball. Then they would tell her that she shouldn’t play baseball with boys. Other people didn’t think she should play with white people.&nbsp;Some even taunted her about her small size. She was only five feet three inches tall and weighed less than 100 pounds. But Mamie surprised them, and she always proved them wrong.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although Mamie wasn’t given a chance to try out for the girl’s professional baseball league, she didn’t stop playing the game she loved. She spent just about every Sunday afternoon during spring and summer playing at Bannecker Field in Washington, D.C. The people who watched her play weren’t so critical. The baseball field was in the middle of an African American neighborhood. A university and a school were nearby, and there was a bakery so close by that freshly baked bread could be smelled from the field. When Mamie stepped up on the pitcher’s mound, she could see the U.S. Capitol.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One Sunday afternoon in 1953, Mamie’s friend Rita pointed at the stands and whispered, “That man in the suit has been at our games for the last three weeks. I wonder who he is.” Rita loved baseball as much as Mamie did. Rita had gone to the tryouts for the girl’s professional baseball league with Mamie two years ago, hoping to get a position on the team. Mamie wondered whether the man was a scout looking for new players for a professional team.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Let’s show him how well the girls can play with these guys,” Mamie said, smiling at Rita.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mamie ran onto the field and took her spot on the pitcher’s mound. She was feeling good, and her right arm felt strong. Even though Mamie was tiny, she didn’t feel small today. As the game began and she threw more and more pitches, she started to feel like a giant. Mamie struck out one batter after another and thought she was having her best game ever.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By the time the game was almost over, Mamie’s team was winning, but by only one run. Mamie looked at the last batter. She knew that he was just as determined to win the game as she was. Mamie could also feel the man in the suit watching her from the stands. She had to show them both what she could do. This batter was the best hitter on the team. He would try to hit a home run, and there were two runners on&nbsp;the bases. Mamie knew she had to strike him out. She took a deep breath and gripped the ball in her hand. Then she threw the first pitch right over the plate for a strike.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the batter got set again, Mamie thought about her next pitch. Staring at the tall batter, Mamie threw a ball that was level with his knees. He swung hard but missed, for a second strike.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“One more strike, and he’s out!” Mamie heard Rita yelling from behind her. “You can do it!”</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mamie tried to relax as she felt the eyes of the man in the suit watching her every move. She stepped back onto the pitcher’s mound and again waited for the batter to get ready. She didn’t have to wait for long, though. He stepped up to the plate and pointed at Mamie with the bat, trying to make her flinch. But that was the worst thing he could have done. Mamie remained calm. With all her might, she threw the ball and sent the batter a message—strike three!</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before Mamie knew it, she was surrounded by <span class="txt-underline">jubilant</span> teammates who jumped up and down and congratulated her. Then the man in the suit shook her hand and introduced himself. “I’m Bish Tyson,” he said. “Can you come try out for my team next week? I work for the Indianapolis Clowns, one of the best professional baseball teams in the Negro Leagues. I’d like to recruit you for the team.”</p>
        <p>
          <em>In 1953 Mamie “Peanut” Johnson (who was given her nickname because of her size) became the first woman to pitch in a professional baseball league for African American men. Known for her pitching style and precision, Mamie Johnson proved her ability to play alongside men.</em>

          <strong>Striking Out the Guys</strong>
        </p>

          <em>Segregation, or separation of people by race, was once a part of life in the United States. Professional baseball, public schools, buildings, and buses and trains were often segregated. The following is the story of Mamie Johnson, a young African American woman who fought for the chance to play baseball.</em>
        </p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Leave!” the large man with the cigar yelled. “Colored girls like you aren’t allowed to play in this league!”</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Seventeen-year-old Mamie Johnson couldn’t believe what the man was saying to her. For her entire life, all that she had thought about was baseball. Mamie had played in her grandmother’s yard when she was a young girl. When she was 10, she was selected to play on the all-white, all-male Police Athletic League team in Long Branch, New Jersey, after she demonstrated her pitching skills to the coach. When she moved to Washington, D.C., to live with her mother, she played in a city league that had excellent players. And today this man from the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League was telling her that she didn’t belong, without even letting her try out for the team!</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mamie reached down and picked up the ball she had been practicing with. She squeezed it as hard as she could, trying to hold back the tears. As she held the ball, she knew she had to throw it at least once. She knew the man would never change his mind, but she had to show him what he would be missing. She raised the ball up to her chest, kicked up her leg, pulled her arm back, and threw the ball as hard as she could toward home plate.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the ball landed beyond home plate, everyone’s eyes turned toward Mamie. She heard the whispers as she picked up her things. With her head held high, Mamie walked off the field and headed for the bus stop. She had been fighting battles like this all her life. People would tell her that girls weren’t supposed to play baseball. Then they would tell her that she shouldn’t play baseball with boys. Other people didn’t think she should play with white people.&nbsp;Some even taunted her about her small size. She was only five feet three inches tall and weighed less than 100 pounds. But Mamie surprised them, and she always proved them wrong.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although Mamie wasn’t given a chance to try out for the girl’s professional baseball league, she didn’t stop playing the game she loved. She spent just about every Sunday afternoon during spring and summer playing at Bannecker Field in Washington, D.C. The people who watched her play weren’t so critical. The baseball field was in the middle of an African American neighborhood. A university and a school were nearby, and there was a bakery so close by that freshly baked bread could be smelled from the field. When Mamie stepped up on the pitcher’s mound, she could see the U.S. Capitol.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One Sunday afternoon in 1953, Mamie’s friend Rita pointed at the stands and whispered, “That man in the suit has been at our games for the last three weeks. I wonder who he is.” Rita loved baseball as much as Mamie did. Rita had gone to the tryouts for the girl’s professional baseball league with Mamie two years ago, hoping to get a position on the team. Mamie wondered whether the man was a scout looking for new players for a professional team.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Let’s show him how well the girls can play with these guys,” Mamie said, smiling at Rita.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mamie ran onto the field and took her spot on the pitcher’s mound. She was feeling good, and her right arm felt strong. Even though Mamie was tiny, she didn’t feel small today. As the game began and she threw more and more pitches, she started to feel like a giant. Mamie struck out one batter after another and thought she was having her best game ever.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By the time the game was almost over, Mamie’s team was winning, but by only one run. Mamie looked at the last batter. She knew that he was just as determined to win the game as she was. Mamie could also feel the man in the suit watching her from the stands. She had to show them both what she could do. This batter was the best hitter on the team. He would try to hit a home run, and there were two runners on&nbsp;the bases. Mamie knew she had to strike him out. She took a deep breath and gripped the ball in her hand. Then she threw the first pitch right over the plate for a strike.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the batter got set again, Mamie thought about her next pitch. Staring at the tall batter, Mamie threw a ball that was level with his knees. He swung hard but missed, for a second strike.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“One more strike, and he’s out!” Mamie heard Rita yelling from behind her. “You can do it!”</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mamie tried to relax as she felt the eyes of the man in the suit watching her every move. She stepped back onto the pitcher’s mound and again waited for the batter to get ready. She didn’t have to wait for long, though. He stepped up to the plate and pointed at Mamie with the bat, trying to make her flinch. But that was the worst thing he could have done. Mamie remained calm. With all her might, she threw the ball and sent the batter a message—strike three!</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before Mamie knew it, she was surrounded by <span class="txt-underline">jubilant</span> teammates who jumped up and down and congratulated her. Then the man in the suit shook her hand and introduced himself. “I’m Bish Tyson,” he said. “Can you come try out for my team next week? I work for the Indianapolis Clowns, one of the best professional baseball teams in the Negro Leagues. I’d like to recruit you for the team.”</p>
        <p>
          <em>In 1953 Mamie “Peanut” Johnson (who was given her nickname because of her size) became the first woman to pitch in a professional baseball league for African American men. Known for her pitching style and precision, Mamie Johnson proved her ability to play alongside men.</em>

          <strong>Striking Out the Guys</strong>
        </p>

          <em>Segregation, or separation of people by race, was once a part of life in the United States. Professional baseball, public schools, buildings, and buses and trains were often segregated. The following is the story of Mamie Johnson, a young African American woman who fought for the chance to play baseball.</em>
        </p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Leave!” the large man with the cigar yelled. “Colored girls like you aren’t allowed to play in this league!”</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Seventeen-year-old Mamie Johnson couldn’t believe what the man was saying to her. For her entire life, all that she had thought about was baseball. Mamie had played in her grandmother’s yard when she was a young girl. When she was 10, she was selected to play on the all-white, all-male Police Athletic League team in Long Branch, New Jersey, after she demonstrated her pitching skills to the coach. When she moved to Washington, D.C., to live with her mother, she played in a city league that had excellent players. And today this man from the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League was telling her that she didn’t belong, without even letting her try out for the team!</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mamie reached down and picked up the ball she had been practicing with. She squeezed it as hard as she could, trying to hold back the tears. As she held the ball, she knew she had to throw it at least once. She knew the man would never change his mind, but she had to show him what he would be missing. She raised the ball up to her chest, kicked up her leg, pulled her arm back, and threw the ball as hard as she could toward home plate.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the ball landed beyond home plate, everyone’s eyes turned toward Mamie. She heard the whispers as she picked up her things. With her head held high, Mamie walked off the field and headed for the bus stop. She had been fighting battles like this all her life. People would tell her that girls weren’t supposed to play baseball. Then they would tell her that she shouldn’t play baseball with boys. Other people didn’t think she should play with white people.&nbsp;Some even taunted her about her small size. She was only five feet three inches tall and weighed less than 100 pounds. But Mamie surprised them, and she always proved them wrong.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Although Mamie wasn’t given a chance to try out for the girl’s professional baseball league, she didn’t stop playing the game she loved. She spent just about every Sunday afternoon during spring and summer playing at Bannecker Field in Washington, D.C. The people who watched her play weren’t so critical. The baseball field was in the middle of an African American neighborhood. A university and a school were nearby, and there was a bakery so close by that freshly baked bread could be smelled from the field. When Mamie stepped up on the pitcher’s mound, she could see the U.S. Capitol.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One Sunday afternoon in 1953, Mamie’s friend Rita pointed at the stands and whispered, “That man in the suit has been at our games for the last three weeks. I wonder who he is.” Rita loved baseball as much as Mamie did. Rita had gone to the tryouts for the girl’s professional baseball league with Mamie two years ago, hoping to get a position on the team. Mamie wondered whether the man was a scout looking for new players for a professional team.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Let’s show him how well the girls can play with these guys,” Mamie said, smiling at Rita.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mamie ran onto the field and took her spot on the pitcher’s mound. She was feeling good, and her right arm felt strong. Even though Mamie was tiny, she didn’t feel small today. As the game began and she threw more and more pitches, she started to feel like a giant. Mamie struck out one batter after another and thought she was having her best game ever.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By the time the game was almost over, Mamie’s team was winning, but by only one run. Mamie looked at the last batter. She knew that he was just as determined to win the game as she was. Mamie could also feel the man in the suit watching her from the stands. She had to show them both what she could do. This batter was the best hitter on the team. He would try to hit a home run, and there were two runners on&nbsp;the bases. Mamie knew she had to strike him out. She took a deep breath and gripped the ball in her hand. Then she threw the first pitch right over the plate for a strike.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the batter got set again, Mamie thought about her next pitch. Staring at the tall batter, Mamie threw a ball that was level with his knees. He swung hard but missed, for a second strike.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“One more strike, and he’s out!” Mamie heard Rita yelling from behind her. “You can do it!”</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mamie tried to relax as she felt the eyes of the man in the suit watching her every move. She stepped back onto the pitcher’s mound and again waited for the batter to get ready. She didn’t have to wait for long, though. He stepped up to the plate and pointed at Mamie with the bat, trying to make her flinch. But that was the worst thing he could have done. Mamie remained calm. With all her might, she threw the ball and sent the batter a message—strike three!</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before Mamie knew it, she was surrounded by <span class="txt-underline">jubilant</span> teammates who jumped up and down and congratulated her. Then the man in the suit shook her hand and introduced himself. “I’m Bish Tyson,” he said. “Can you come try out for my team next week? I work for the Indianapolis Clowns, one of the best professional baseball teams in the Negro Leagues. I’d like to recruit you for the team.”</p>
        <p>
          <em>In 1953 Mamie “Peanut” Johnson (who was given her nickname because of her size) became the first woman to pitch in a professional baseball league for African American men. Known for her pitching style and precision, Mamie Johnson proved her ability to play alongside men.</em>

        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before Mamie knew it, she was surrounded by <span class="txt-underline">jubilant</span> teammates who jumped up and down and congratulated her. Then the man in the suit shook her hand and introduced himself. “I’m Bish Tyson,” he said. “Can you come try out for my team next week? I work for the Indianapolis Clowns, one of the best professional baseball teams in the Negro Leagues. I’d like to recruit you for the team.”</p>
        <p>
          <em>In 1953 Mamie “Peanut” Johnson (who was given her nickname because of her size) became the first woman to pitch in a professional baseball league for African American men. Known for her pitching style and precision, Mamie Johnson proved her ability to play alongside men.</em>

          <strong>My Trip to Big Bend</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Andres Benavides</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I went on an incredible trip to Big Bend National Park last week. Mom and Dad and I planned the whole thing with my cousin Mike, who works as a guide there. We had an unbelievable trip, including rafting, rock climbing, and backpacking. Mike wanted to show me what Big Bend National Park is all about.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On the first day we put on our helmets and life jackets, climbed into our raft, and plunged into the muddy Rio Grande. Mike taught me a few tips on paddling. While I practiced, he explained that our trip would take us through Boquillas Canyon. The trip was 33 miles long, much longer than the rafting trips I had taken before. But I was so excited that I didn’t mind. Besides, the calm waters kept us from getting too tired.</p>

        </p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As Mike and I drifted through Boquillas Canyon, he told me a little about the area. Big Bend became a national park in 1944. It encompasses more than 800,000 acres. There are rugged mountains, a vast desert, deep canyons, and more than 100 miles of winding river. As we floated along in our raft, I looked up at towering cliffs as tall as skyscrapers. The huge rock walls made me feel very small. The only sound I could hear was the flowing river. Then suddenly I heard a low grunting. I looked up and saw a group of big hairy pigs passing by. I asked Mike whether there were farms in Big Bend. He laughed and told me that these creatures were actually javelinas, which look kind of like wild pigs.</p>

        </p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At the end of the day, we camped on the riverbank. At first I missed my soft bed back at home, but the stars overhead were so beautiful that I quickly forgot about being uncomfortable and fell asleep. The next morning my muscles ached from all the paddling the day before. Mike wasn’t sore at all. He was ready to go.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We spent three tiring but peaceful days floating through the canyon. After our tour of the canyon, we traded our raft and paddles for ropes and harnesses and started hiking through the desert to the Chisos Mountains. Although most of Big Bend is desert, there are forested mountains that reach a mile into the sky. Mike likes to call them the upside-down mountains. Most mountains have trees at the bottom and bare rocks at the top. The Chisos, however, have low, scrubby desert plants at the bottom and big trees at the top.</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
                  <img width="77%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/db0yrhgnb/image/upload/v1767495188/qbwgfurt7uv9peds2ob9.png" alt="T3_Y5_CT_EN_23_3">


        </p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Admiring the mountain cliffs from a distance is one thing, but climbing them is another. I have to admit that I was a little uneasy. Fortunately Mike knew that I had never been rock climbing, so he took me to a fairly easy climbing area called Basin Rock. As we started up the cliffs, the big cracks in the rocks helped me keep my footing. The more we climbed, the easier it became. When we had climbed for a few hours, we stopped on a large flat slab and admired the view. After all that work, I didn’t want to go right back down the mountain.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once we made camp and ate dinner at the base of the mountain, I was so exhausted that I fell right to sleep. The next morning the yapping of nearby coyotes woke me. I went to wash up and discovered fresh coyote tracks just 30 feet from my sleeping bag! After eating a quick breakfast, we put on our backpacks and began our hike in the desert. The land seemed to <span class="txt-underline">transform</span> from big trees to pink and white wildflowers and cacti blooming with yellow flowers. One plant looked like a bunch of dagger blades sticking out of the ground. Mike said it was called lechuguilla. We had to walk carefully because so many of these plants were on the narrow dirt&nbsp;path. One wrong move and the sharp plants could have jabbed our skin right through our pants.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Several miles farther, the path became wider and steeper. Soon the trail was shaded by shrubby oak trees and junipers, which gave welcome relief from the desert heat. We had reached an area where the desert became forest. Now, instead of graceful roadrunners crossing our path, we had creepy tarantulas crawling by. I wasn’t too happy about this change. As we stopped to eat under the feathery dark-green branches of some pine trees, I realized how much I had seen and done in just a few days. I could hardly believe how fast the days had gone by. Thinking about leaving Big Bend made me realize that it is a place like no other on Earth.</p>

        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once we made camp and ate dinner at the base of the mountain, I was so exhausted that I fell right to sleep. The next morning the yapping of nearby coyotes woke me. I went to wash up and discovered fresh coyote tracks just 30 feet from my sleeping bag! After eating a quick breakfast, we put on our backpacks and began our hike in the desert. The land seemed to <span class="txt-underline">transform</span> from big trees to pink and white wildflowers and cacti blooming with yellow flowers. One plant looked like a bunch of dagger blades sticking out of the ground. Mike said it was called lechuguilla. We had to walk carefully because so many of these plants were on the narrow dirt&nbsp;path. One wrong move and the sharp plants could have jabbed our skin right through our pants.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Several miles farther, the path became wider and steeper. Soon the trail was shaded by shrubby oak trees and junipers, which gave welcome relief from the desert heat. We had reached an area where the desert became forest. Now, instead of graceful roadrunners crossing our path, we had creepy tarantulas crawling by. I wasn’t too happy about this change. As we stopped to eat under the feathery dark-green branches of some pine trees, I realized how much I had seen and done in just a few days. I could hardly believe how fast the days had gone by. Thinking about leaving Big Bend made me realize that it is a place like no other on Earth.</p>

          <strong>My Trip to Big Bend</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Andres Benavides</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I went on an incredible trip to Big Bend National Park last week. Mom and Dad and I planned the whole thing with my cousin Mike, who works as a guide there. We had an unbelievable trip, including rafting, rock climbing, and backpacking. Mike wanted to show me what Big Bend National Park is all about.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On the first day we put on our helmets and life jackets, climbed into our raft, and plunged into the muddy Rio Grande. Mike taught me a few tips on paddling. While I practiced, he explained that our trip would take us through Boquillas Canyon. The trip was 33 miles long, much longer than the rafting trips I had taken before. But I was so excited that I didn’t mind. Besides, the calm waters kept us from getting too tired.</p>

        </p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As Mike and I drifted through Boquillas Canyon, he told me a little about the area. Big Bend became a national park in 1944. It encompasses more than 800,000 acres. There are rugged mountains, a vast desert, deep canyons, and more than 100 miles of winding river. As we floated along in our raft, I looked up at towering cliffs as tall as skyscrapers. The huge rock walls made me feel very small. The only sound I could hear was the flowing river. Then suddenly I heard a low grunting. I looked up and saw a group of big hairy pigs passing by. I asked Mike whether there were farms in Big Bend. He laughed and told me that these creatures were actually javelinas, which look kind of like wild pigs.</p>

        </p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At the end of the day, we camped on the riverbank. At first I missed my soft bed back at home, but the stars overhead were so beautiful that I quickly forgot about being uncomfortable and fell asleep. The next morning my muscles ached from all the paddling the day before. Mike wasn’t sore at all. He was ready to go.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We spent three tiring but peaceful days floating through the canyon. After our tour of the canyon, we traded our raft and paddles for ropes and harnesses and started hiking through the desert to the Chisos Mountains. Although most of Big Bend is desert, there are forested mountains that reach a mile into the sky. Mike likes to call them the upside-down mountains. Most mountains have trees at the bottom and bare rocks at the top. The Chisos, however, have low, scrubby desert plants at the bottom and big trees at the top.</p>

        </p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Admiring the mountain cliffs from a distance is one thing, but climbing them is another. I have to admit that I was a little uneasy. Fortunately Mike knew that I had never been rock climbing, so he took me to a fairly easy climbing area called Basin Rock. As we started up the cliffs, the big cracks in the rocks helped me keep my footing. The more we climbed, the easier it became. When we had climbed for a few hours, we stopped on a large flat slab and admired the view. After all that work, I didn’t want to go right back down the mountain.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once we made camp and ate dinner at the base of the mountain, I was so exhausted that I fell right to sleep. The next morning the yapping of nearby coyotes woke me.

        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Several miles farther, the path became wider and steeper. Soon the trail was shaded by shrubby oak trees and junipers, which gave welcome relief from the desert heat.

        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Admiring the mountain cliffs from a distance is one thing, but climbing them is another. I have to admit that I was a little uneasy. Fortunately Mike knew that I had never been rock climbing, so he took me to a fairly easy climbing area called Basin Rock. As we started up the cliffs, the big cracks in the rocks helped me keep my footing. The more we climbed, the easier it became. When we had climbed for a few hours, we stopped on a large flat slab and admired the view. After all that work, I didn’t want to go right back down the mountain.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once we made camp and ate dinner at the base of the mountain, I was so exhausted that I fell right to sleep. The next morning the yapping of nearby coyotes woke me. I went to wash up and discovered fresh coyote tracks just 30 feet from my sleeping bag! After eating a quick breakfast, we put on our backpacks and began our hike in the desert. The land seemed to <span class="txt-underline">transform</span> from big trees to pink and white wildflowers and cacti blooming with yellow flowers. One plant looked like a bunch of dagger blades sticking out of the ground. Mike said it was called lechuguilla. We had to walk carefully because so many of these plants were on the narrow dirt&nbsp;path. One wrong move and the sharp plants could have jabbed our skin right through our pants.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Several miles farther, the path became wider and steeper. Soon the trail was shaded by shrubby oak trees and junipers, which gave welcome relief from the desert heat. We had reached an area where the desert became forest. Now, instead of graceful roadrunners crossing our path, we had creepy tarantulas crawling by. I wasn’t too happy about this change. As we stopped to eat under the feathery dark-green branches of some pine trees, I realized how much I had seen and done in just a few days. I could hardly believe how fast the days had gone by. Thinking about leaving Big Bend made me realize that it is a place like no other on Earth.</p>

          <strong>My Trip to Big Bend</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Andres Benavides</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I went on an incredible trip to Big Bend National Park last week. Mom and Dad and I planned the whole thing with my cousin Mike, who works as a guide there. We had an unbelievable trip, including rafting, rock climbing, and backpacking. Mike wanted to show me what Big Bend National Park is all about.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On the first day we put on our helmets and life jackets, climbed into our raft, and plunged into the muddy Rio Grande. Mike taught me a few tips on paddling. While I practiced, he explained that our trip would take us through Boquillas Canyon. The trip was 33 miles long, much longer than the rafting trips I had taken before. But I was so excited that I didn’t mind. Besides, the calm waters kept us from getting too tired.</p>

        </p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As Mike and I drifted through Boquillas Canyon, he told me a little about the area. Big Bend became a national park in 1944. It encompasses more than 800,000 acres. There are rugged mountains, a vast desert, deep canyons, and more than 100 miles of winding river. As we floated along in our raft, I looked up at towering cliffs as tall as skyscrapers. The huge rock walls made me feel very small. The only sound I could hear was the flowing river. Then suddenly I heard a low grunting. I looked up and saw a group of big hairy pigs passing by. I asked Mike whether there were farms in Big Bend. He laughed and told me that these creatures were actually javelinas, which look kind of like wild pigs.</p>

        </p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At the end of the day, we camped on the riverbank. At first I missed my soft bed back at home, but the stars overhead were so beautiful that I quickly forgot about being uncomfortable and fell asleep. The next morning my muscles ached from all the paddling the day before. Mike wasn’t sore at all. He was ready to go.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We spent three tiring but peaceful days floating through the canyon. After our tour of the canyon, we traded our raft and paddles for ropes and harnesses and started hiking through the desert to the Chisos Mountains. Although most of Big Bend is desert, there are forested mountains that reach a mile into the sky. Mike likes to call them the upside-down mountains. Most mountains have trees at the bottom and bare rocks at the top. The Chisos, however, have low, scrubby desert plants at the bottom and big trees at the top.</p>

Although most of Big Bend is desert, there are forested mountains that reach a mile into the sky. Mike likes to call them the upside-down mountains. Most mountains have trees at the bottom and bare rocks at the top. The Chisos, however, have low, scrubby desert plants at the bottom and big trees at the top.</p>

        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Admiring the mountain cliffs from a distance is one thing, but climbing them is another. I have to admit that I was a little uneasy. Fortunately Mike knew that I had never been rock climbing, so he took me to a fairly easy climbing area called Basin Rock. As we started up the cliffs, the big cracks in the rocks helped me keep my footing. The more we climbed, the easier it became. When we had climbed for a few hours, we stopped on a large flat slab and admired the view. After all that work, I didn’t want to go right back down the mountain.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once we made camp and ate dinner at the base of the mountain, I was so exhausted that I fell right to sleep. The next morning the yapping of nearby coyotes woke me. I went to wash up and discovered fresh coyote tracks just 30 feet from my sleeping bag! After eating a quick breakfast, we put on our backpacks and began our hike in the desert. The land seemed to <span class="txt-underline">transform</span> from big trees to pink and white wildflowers and cacti blooming with yellow flowers. One plant looked like a bunch of dagger blades sticking out of the ground. Mike said it was called lechuguilla. We had to walk carefully because so many of these plants were on the narrow dirt&nbsp;path. One wrong move and the sharp plants could have jabbed our skin right through our pants.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Several miles farther, the path became wider and steeper. Soon the trail was shaded by shrubby oak trees and junipers, which gave welcome relief from the desert heat. We had reached an area where the desert became forest. Now, instead of graceful roadrunners crossing our path, we had creepy tarantulas crawling by. I wasn’t too happy about this change. As we stopped to eat under the feathery dark-green branches of some pine trees, I realized how much I had seen and done in just a few days. I could hardly believe how fast the days had gone by. Thinking about leaving Big Bend made me realize that it is a place like no other on Earth.</p>

          <strong>My Trip to Big Bend</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Andres Benavides</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I went on an incredible trip to Big Bend National Park last week. Mom and Dad and I planned the whole thing with my cousin Mike, who works as a guide there. We had an unbelievable trip, including rafting, rock climbing, and backpacking. Mike wanted to show me what Big Bend National Park is all about.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On the first day we put on our helmets and life jackets, climbed into our raft, and plunged into the muddy Rio Grande. Mike taught me a few tips on paddling. While I practiced, he explained that our trip would take us through Boquillas Canyon. The trip was 33 miles long, much longer than the rafting trips I had taken before. But I was so excited that I didn’t mind. Besides, the calm waters kept us from getting too tired.</p>

        </p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As Mike and I drifted through Boquillas Canyon, he told me a little about the area. Big Bend became a national park in 1944. It encompasses more than 800,000 acres. There are rugged mountains, a vast desert, deep canyons, and more than 100 miles of winding river. As we floated along in our raft, I looked up at towering cliffs as tall as skyscrapers. The huge rock walls made me feel very small. The only sound I could hear was the flowing river. Then suddenly I heard a low grunting. I looked up and saw a group of big hairy pigs passing by. I asked Mike whether there were farms in Big Bend. He laughed and told me that these creatures were actually javelinas, which look kind of like wild pigs.</p>

        </p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At the end of the day, we camped on the riverbank. At first I missed my soft bed back at home, but the stars overhead were so beautiful that I quickly forgot about being uncomfortable and fell asleep. The next morning my muscles ached from all the paddling the day before. Mike wasn’t sore at all. He was ready to go.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We spent three tiring but peaceful days floating through the canyon.

At first I missed my soft bed back at home, but the stars overhead were so beautiful that I quickly forgot about being uncomfortable and fell asleep. The next morning my muscles ached from all the paddling the day before. Mike wasn’t sore at all. He was ready to go.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We spent three tiring but peaceful days floating through the canyon. After our tour of the canyon, we traded our raft and paddles for ropes and harnesses and started hiking through the desert to the Chisos Mountains. Although most of Big Bend is desert, there are forested mountains that reach a mile into the sky. Mike likes to call them the upside-down mountains. Most mountains have trees at the bottom and bare rocks at the top. The Chisos, however, have low, scrubby desert plants at the bottom and big trees at the top.</p>

        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Admiring the mountain cliffs from a distance is one thing, but climbing them is another. I have to admit that I was a little uneasy. Fortunately Mike knew that I had never been rock climbing, so he took me to a fairly easy climbing area called Basin Rock. As we started up the cliffs, the big cracks in the rocks helped me keep my footing. The more we climbed, the easier it became. When we had climbed for a few hours, we stopped on a large flat slab and admired the view. After all that work, I didn’t want to go right back down the mountain.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once we made camp and ate dinner at the base of the mountain, I was so exhausted that I fell right to sleep. The next morning the yapping of nearby coyotes woke me. I went to wash up and discovered fresh coyote tracks just 30 feet from my sleeping bag! After eating a quick breakfast, we put on our backpacks and began our hike in the desert. The land seemed to <span class="txt-underline">transform</span> from big trees to pink and white wildflowers and cacti blooming with yellow flowers. One plant looked like a bunch of dagger blades sticking out of the ground. Mike said it was called lechuguilla. We had to walk carefully because so many of these plants were on the narrow dirt&nbsp;path. One wrong move and the sharp plants could have jabbed our skin right through our pants.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Several miles farther, the path became wider and steeper. Soon the trail was shaded by shrubby oak trees and junipers, which gave welcome relief from the desert heat. We had reached an area where the desert became forest. Now, instead of graceful roadrunners crossing our path, we had creepy tarantulas crawling by. I wasn’t too happy about this change. As we stopped to eat under the feathery dark-green branches of some pine trees, I realized how much I had seen and done in just a few days. I could hardly believe how fast the days had gone by. Thinking about leaving Big Bend made me realize that it is a place like no other on Earth.</p>

          <strong>My Trip to Big Bend</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Andres Benavides</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I went on an incredible trip to Big Bend National Park last week. Mom and Dad and I planned the whole thing with my cousin Mike, who works as a guide there. We had an unbelievable trip, including rafting, rock climbing, and backpacking. Mike wanted to show me what Big Bend National Park is all about.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On the first day we put on our helmets and life jackets, climbed into our raft, and plunged into the muddy Rio Grande. Mike taught me a few tips on paddling. While I practiced, he explained that our trip would take us through Boquillas Canyon. The trip was 33 miles long, much longer than the rafting trips I had taken before. But I was so excited that I didn’t mind. Besides, the calm waters kept us from getting too tired.</p>

        </p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As Mike and I drifted through Boquillas Canyon, he told me a little about the area. Big Bend became a national park in 1944. It encompasses more than 800,000 acres. There are rugged mountains, a vast desert, deep canyons, and more than 100 miles of winding river. As we floated along in our raft, I looked up at towering cliffs as tall as skyscrapers. The huge rock walls made me feel very small. The only sound I could hear was the flowing river. Then suddenly I heard a low grunting. I looked up and saw a group of big hairy pigs passing by. I asked Mike whether there were farms in Big Bend. He laughed and told me that these creatures were actually javelinas, which look kind of like wild pigs.</p>

I asked Mike whether there were farms in Big Bend. He laughed and told me that these creatures were actually javelinas, which look kind of like wild pigs.</p>

        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At the end of the day, we camped on the riverbank. At first I missed my soft bed back at home, but the stars overhead were so beautiful that I quickly forgot about being uncomfortable and fell asleep. The next morning my muscles ached from all the paddling the day before. Mike wasn’t sore at all. He was ready to go.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We spent three tiring but peaceful days floating through the canyon. After our tour of the canyon, we traded our raft and paddles for ropes and harnesses and started hiking through the desert to the Chisos Mountains. Although most of Big Bend is desert, there are forested mountains that reach a mile into the sky. Mike likes to call them the upside-down mountains. Most mountains have trees at the bottom and bare rocks at the top. The Chisos, however, have low, scrubby desert plants at the bottom and big trees at the top.</p>

        </p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Admiring the mountain cliffs from a distance is one thing, but climbing them is another. I have to admit that I was a little uneasy. Fortunately Mike knew that I had never been rock climbing, so he took me to a fairly easy climbing area called Basin Rock. As we started up the cliffs, the big cracks in the rocks helped me keep my footing. The more we climbed, the easier it became. When we had climbed for a few hours, we stopped on a large flat slab and admired the view. After all that work, I didn’t want to go right back down the mountain.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once we made camp and ate dinner at the base of the mountain, I was so exhausted that I fell right to sleep. The next morning the yapping of nearby coyotes woke me. I went to wash up and discovered fresh coyote tracks just 30 feet from my sleeping bag! After eating a quick breakfast, we put on our backpacks and began our hike in the desert. The land seemed to <span class="txt-underline">transform</span> from big trees to pink and white wildflowers and cacti blooming with yellow flowers. One plant looked like a bunch of dagger blades sticking out of the ground. Mike said it was called lechuguilla. We had to walk carefully because so many of these plants were on the narrow dirt&nbsp;path. One wrong move and the sharp plants could have jabbed our skin right through our pants.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Several miles farther, the path became wider and steeper. Soon the trail was shaded by shrubby oak trees and junipers, which gave welcome relief from the desert heat. We had reached an area where the desert became forest. Now, instead of graceful roadrunners crossing our path, we had creepy tarantulas crawling by. I wasn’t too happy about this change. As we stopped to eat under the feathery dark-green branches of some pine trees, I realized how much I had seen and done in just a few days. I could hardly believe how fast the days had gone by. Thinking about leaving Big Bend made me realize that it is a place like no other on Earth.</p>

          <strong>Anything for the Bike</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mrs. Radcliff wasn't really as mean as everyone said. At least that’s what Jordan kept telling himself on the way to ring the doorbell at the scariest-looking house in the neighborhood. He had picked Mrs. Radcliff’s house because he figured no one else would come here to ask for work. Looking at the house, Jordan decided that Mrs. Radcliff could use his help. The place was a mess.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As he got closer to Mrs. Radcliff’s house, Jordan started thinking about the other jobs his grandmother said he could do around the neighborhood: mow lawns, rake leaves, plant flowers. He thought about turning around and walking in the opposite direction, but he knew that the bicycle he wanted cost a lot of money. He told himself that he should at least talk to Mrs. Radcliff.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The gate into Mrs. Radcliff ’s yard opened with a scary squeak. “That’s all right,” Jordan said to himself as he felt his heart beating faster. “I can fix that.”</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The path leading to the house was overgrown with weeds and bushes. “That’s O.K.,” Jordan thought. “I can trim the bushes and pull those weeds.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Jordan climbed the stairs up to the front porch, the second step creaked. He stopped and thought about leaving. Instead, he whispered, “That’s O.K., too. Maybe I can fix the boards. I’ll do anything for the bike. Anything for the bike.”</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Taking a deep breath, Jordan knocked on the old door. When he heard rustling inside, he took a step back. “If I’m really quick,” Jordan thought, “I can be gone before the door opens.” But the&nbsp;doorknob rattled, and Jordan’s feet seemed to be frozen on the porch. The door opened just a little, and somebody said, “Yes?”</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jordan was afraid of what he would see. The kids in the neighborhood told stories about Mrs. Radcliff. It was said that no one came to see her and that she never went out. As the yard inside the fence had grown wilder over the last year, so had the stories. Soon the kids had begun talking about dogs and cats disappearing and strange lights being on at all hours of the night.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The door opened all the way. Jordan swallowed when he saw that shadows covered the woman’s face. “Yes?” she said again.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jordan had trouble moving his mouth. Finally he licked his lips and cleared his throat. “My name is Jordan Wells,” he said in a shaky voice. “I live with my grandma down the street. I was wondering whether you had any work I could do around here.”</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You’re Lillian Wells’s grandson,” Mrs. Radcliff said in a quiet voice. Then she turned her head toward her yard. “Well, yes, I guess I could use some help. Please come in.”</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jordan didn’t know whether he really wanted to go inside. “Anything for the bike,” he reminded himself. Mrs. Radcliff stepped back and held open the door. Jordan watched her closely as he stepped inside the dark house. “Sorry it’s so dark,” she said, looking upward. “I guess that bulb is burned out.”</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jordan wondered whether she was just trying to make her house scarier than it already was.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Come into the kitchen,” Mrs. Radcliff said as she walked in the dark. Jordan stood still, letting his eyes adjust to the darkness. When he could see, he noticed that all the furniture was covered with sheets. At least he thought it was furniture.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Coming?” Mrs. Radcliff said.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Yes, ma’am,” Jordan said nervously, not sure what he had gotten himself into. “Anything for the bike,” he mumbled to himself.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then Jordan heard a <span class="txt-underline">shrill</span> noise that sounded like a scream. The loud noise scared him so badly that he couldn’t take another step. He felt as if he were a tree with its roots stuck deep in the ground. “You’re just in time!” Mrs. Radcliff said.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mrs. Radcliff swung open the kitchen door. The room was bright and cheerful inside. A teakettle on the stove was whistling. Mrs. Radcliff smiled, and Jordan was reminded of his grandmother.</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You know, I used to go to school with your grandmother when we were little,” she said. “That was a long time ago. It’s been a little difficult for me to do everything around here since my children moved away.”</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jordan looked at the woman and smiled. “What kind of work can I help you with?” he asked.</p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Well,” she said, getting out another cup, “I always have a cup of hot chocolate this time of day. How about starting with that?”</p>

        <p class="txt-ctr"><strong>Training Luke</strong><br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Luke almost always keeps his brown eyes on his owner Kathy. When she raises her right thumb, Luke knows he’s been good. When Kathy holds her right hand in front of Luke, he sits. Kathy uses hand signals to train Luke because he is deaf.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Training a deaf dog can take more time than teaching a hearing dog. An owner must use signs to communicate commands. Some owners use American Sign Language, and others make up their own signs. Like hearing dogs, deaf dogs should first learn to sit, lie down, stay, come, and stop. Other commands can then be added one at a time. Luke is just one year old, and he knows 20 commands!</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To get Luke’s attention in the house, Kathy stomps her foot. The dog can feel the vibrations through the floor. Outdoors, during daylight hours, Kathy waves at Luke until he notices her. If Luke is in the backyard at night, Kathy calls him by turning the porch light off and on. Luke also wears a bell on his collar so that Kathy can monitor where he is.</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
                  <img width="50%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyilvwllw/image/upload/v1767482891/rolyhbczosoih8zd8puj.png" alt="T3_Y3_CT_EN_15">


        </p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Deaf dogs can be startled easily. Since Luke can’t hear someone walking up behind him, the surprise would often scare him when he was a puppy. To solve this&nbsp;problem, Kathy used treats. She would walk up behind Luke without his seeing her. After gently touching the dog, Kathy would quickly feed him a treat.

        <p class="txt-ctr"><strong>Training Luke</strong><br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Luke almost always keeps his brown eyes on his owner Kathy. When she raises her right thumb, Luke knows he’s been good. When Kathy holds her right hand in front of Luke, he sits. Kathy uses hand signals to train Luke because he is deaf.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Training a deaf dog can take more time than teaching a hearing dog. An owner must use signs to communicate commands. Some owners use American Sign Language, and others make up their own signs. Like hearing dogs, deaf dogs should first learn to sit, lie down, stay, come, and stop. Other commands can then be added one at a time. Luke is just one year old, and he knows 20 commands!</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To get Luke’s attention in the house, Kathy stomps her foot. The dog can feel the vibrations through the floor. Outdoors, during daylight hours, Kathy waves at Luke until he notices her. If Luke is in the backyard at night, Kathy calls him by turning the porch light off and on. Luke also wears a bell on his collar so that Kathy can monitor where he is.</p>

        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Deaf dogs can be startled easily. Since Luke can’t hear someone walking up behind him, the surprise would often scare him when he was a puppy. To solve this&nbsp;problem, Kathy used treats. She would walk up behind Luke without his seeing her. After gently touching the dog, Kathy would quickly feed him a treat. That way, Luke learned that being touched <span class="txt-underline">unexpectedly</span> is okay.</p>

        <p class="txt-ctr"><strong>Training Luke</strong><br>
&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Luke almost always keeps his brown eyes on his owner Kathy. When she raises her right thumb, Luke knows he’s been good. When Kathy holds her right hand in front of Luke, he sits. Kathy uses hand signals to train Luke because he is deaf.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Training a deaf dog can take more time than teaching a hearing dog. An owner must use signs to communicate commands. Some owners use American Sign Language, and others make up their own signs. Like hearing dogs, deaf dogs should first learn to sit, lie down, stay, come, and stop. Other commands can then be added one at a time. Luke is just one year old, and he knows 20 commands!</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To get Luke’s attention in the house, Kathy stomps her foot. The dog can feel the vibrations through the floor. Outdoors, during daylight hours, Kathy waves at Luke until he notices her. If Luke is in the backyard at night, Kathy calls him by turning the porch light off and on. Luke also wears a bell on his collar so that Kathy can monitor where he is.</p>

        </p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Deaf dogs can be startled easily. Since Luke can’t hear someone walking up behind him, the surprise would often scare him when he was a puppy. To solve this&nbsp;problem, Kathy used treats. She would walk up behind Luke without his seeing her. After gently touching the dog, Kathy would quickly feed him a treat. That way, Luke learned that being touched <span class="txt-underline">unexpectedly</span> is okay.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It’s also important to know how to wake up a deaf dog. To wake Luke, Kathy holds her hand in front of his nose. She lets her smell wake him up so that he won’t be startled. If Luke is sleeping when people visit, Kathy asks them not to wake him.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Like most deaf dogs, Luke gets <span class="txt-underline">anxious</span> if he doesn’t know where his owner is. He’ll pad from room to room, searching for Kathy. Before leaving a room, Kathy makes sure to get Luke’s attention. Sometimes Luke follows her, but other times he just sighs and goes back to sleep.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kathy and Luke spend about 15 minutes every day working on old and new commands. With his tail wagging and nose wiggling, Luke looks as if he’s playing instead of working.</p>

          <strong>Gators Roam Downtown Plaza Again</strong>
          <br>
          <em>by Wesley Schanen</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; EL PASO, Texas—After an absence of more than 20 years, alligators are again the center of attention downtown. But don’t worry—these gators are harmless. They are part of artist Luis Jiménez’s latest sculpture, titled <em>Plaza de los<br>
Lagartos</em>, which means “Plaza of the Alligators.”</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of residents gathered in San Jacinto Plaza to dedicate the large fiberglass statue and fountain. It is located near the area where live alligators once roamed the plaza’s pond. The statue brought back fond memories for many who attended the dedication. Some older El Pasoans related stories of childhood visits to the real gator pond in the 1950s and 1960s. Younger residents, however, found it hard to believe that gators actually lived in the park, hundreds of miles from the nearest swamp.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;According to legend, the whole thing started as a joke. Around 1883 an El Paso miner named Adolph Munsenberger received a package about the size of a shoe&nbsp;box from a friend in Louisiana. Inside he found six baby alligators along with a note from his friend. The note suggested that Munsenberger use the alligators to haul mining carts. By all accounts Munsenberger took the joke well. He put the little reptiles into a water barrel and began raising them as pets. However, he knew that this small home could be only temporary. Munsenberger went to the<br>
mayor and offered the gators as a gift to the city. The mayor accepted even though there wasn’t really a place to keep the animals. He finally decided to put the gators in the recently completed pond in San Jacinto Plaza.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;El Paso residents soon began to think of the gators as community pets. They gave each gator a name—Humpy, Sally, Ally, Don Porfirio, Mimmie, and Abercrombie. The gators quickly became local celebrities. El Paso newspapers reported their activities as though they were respected citizens. News accounts detailed the latest gator facts, and gossip columns included gator rumors. One local<br>
newspaper even ran a weekly column called “Alligators’ Tails.” The column&nbsp;related the “true” history of how alligators came to El Paso, as told by one of the alligators. People throughout the city shared tall tales and anecdotes about their unusual new neighbors. As these tales spread, each gator seemed to take on a unique personality. For example,<br>
witnesses claimed that Ally liked music. They said that he would wag his tail whenever a mariachi band performed in<br>
the park.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Alligators occupied the pond in San Jacinto Plaza for some 80 years. Over the years the original alligators died and were replaced with new ones. The alligators remained a popular local attraction and could be seen sunning themselves during the warmer months. Although El Paso is<br>
usually warm and sunny, its winters were cold for the gators. When temperatures dropped, usually in late October, the gators would retreat to the center of the pond. They would remain there in a type of hibernation until warmer days returned. Around March the gators would crawl back out of the water. Many El Pasoans came to view the alligators’ reappearance as a sure sign of spring.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the gators were by nature dangerous animals. On a few occasions park workers were attacked. Although most El Pasoans were fond of the alligators, people often involved the gators in risky pranks and practical jokes. On at least one occasion, a gator was placed in a hotel room to welcome an unsuspecting tourist. Once, students from a local college kidnapped one of the large reptiles and put it in the school swimming pool. Some of these exploits were even more harmful. There were incidents in which the alligators were mistreated and abused. In the 1960s two alligators were stoned to&nbsp;death, and another lost an eye. Park officials became worried about the gators’ safety and wisely decided to move them to<br>
the city zoo. Though the gators made a brief return to the pond in the 1970s, protected by a plastic enclosure, the zoo<br>
eventually became their permanent home.</p>

        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After they left San Jacinto Plaza, the gators gradually faded into El Paso’s past. Then in 1987 city officials asked Jiménez to create a work of art for downtown El Paso. An El Paso native, Jiménez remembered seeing the gators as a boy. He knew that they held special memories for many El Pasoans and chose to make them the subject of the statue. The statue took Jiménez eight years to complete. It depicts<br>
four alligators seeming to lunge out from the fountain, two with their mouths <span class="txt-underline">agape</span>, their sharp teeth bared as if ready to attack. Mist from the fountain keeps the gators looking moist and lifelike. Those in attendance at the dedication were happy that the park’s most famous citizens had finally returned—at least in spirit—to San Jacinto Plaza.</p>

        <p class="txt-ctr">________________________________________________</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr"><em>ScienceDaily (Mar. 26, 2007)—</em>An Emory University paleontologist, collaborating with colleagues from Montana State University and Japan, has uncovered the world’s first fossil evidence of burrowing behavior in dinosaurs. The study appears in the current Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences issue online.</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">________________________________________________</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The 95-million-year-old skeletal remains of the&nbsp;<span class="txt-underline">diminutive</span> dinosaur—along with the bones of two juveniles—were found tucked into a fossilized chamber at the end of a sediment<sup>1</sup>-filled burrow in southwestern Montana.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“The discovery represents the first scientific evidence that some dinosaurs not only dug burrows but also cared extensively for their young inside their dens,” says Anthony Martin, senior lecturer in Emory’s Department of Environmental Studies, of the newly named species of dinosaur, <em>Oryctodromeus cubicularis</em>, meaning “digging runner of the lair.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The discovery is reported by Martin and his colleagues, David Varricchio, of Montana State University, Bozeman; and Yoshihiro Katsura of Gifu Prefectural Museum in Japan. The study was funded by the Jurassic Foundation and the Department of Earth Sciences at Montana State University.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“The presence of an adult and two juveniles within a denning chamber represents some of the best evidence for dinosaur parental care,” Varricchio says. “The burrow likely protected the adult and young <em>Oryctodromeus cubicularis</em> from predators and harsh environmental conditions. Burrowing behavior may have allowed other dinosaurs to survive in extreme environments such as polar regions and deserts, and questions some end-Cretaceous extinction hypotheses.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The study notes that the dimensions of the burrowing tunnel and its end chamber were only slightly larger than the skeletal remains of the adult <em>Oryctodromeus cubicularis</em>, making it difficult for relatively large predators to enter the tunnel. Through computational analysis, the researchers estimated that the herbivorous<sup>2</sup> dinosaur weighed between 22 kg and 32 kg (48–70 pounds), was 2.1 m long (about seven feet), including a 1.25 m tail (4 feet), and had a trunk breadth of 26 cm to 30 cm (10–12 inches). The juveniles were about 55 to 65 percent the size of the adult.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Because the burrow was filled with sediment, the researchers hypothesize that the dinosaurs had drowned after water breached a nearby riverbank and flooded their den. The sediment, says Martin, helped preserve all three skeletons as well as the burrow structure.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp; The dinosaur’s functional morphology<sup>3</sup> gleaned from its skeleton also confirms that <em>Oryctodromeus cubicularis</em> was both a seasoned digger and an accomplished runner. <em>Oryctodromeus cubicularis</em> possessed several physical traits suited for digging: a modified snout that could be used as a shovel; large bony attachments in the shoulder to accommodate powerful muscles; and a robustly built hip that allowed for bracing during digging. In contrast to many modern digging animals, the dinosaur had long hind limbs and was well adapted for running on two legs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In addition to the three dinosaurs found, the team also uncovered fossil evidence of other burrowing animals, most likely invertebrates, which lived alongside <em>Oryctodromeus cubicularis</em>. The finding reinforces the idea that the dinosaur was a burrower.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“As we dug, we found five or six small burrows coming off the main one, filled with the same sediment, which convinced me that this was a dinosaur burrow,” says Martin. “Burrowing vertebrates often live in the same environment with burrowing bees, wasps or beetles.” Martin says he and his colleagues will return to Montana to see if they can find more burrows as previously uncovered fossil evidence indicates that other species of herbivorous dinosaurs often lived in nesting colonies.</p>

1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LONDON—The world’s largest Ferris wheel, the London Eye, has finally made its first revolution with people aboard. The event, intended for New Year’s Day, was delayed a month. But today the 700 people who took the first ride on the Ferris wheel agreed it was well worth the wait. And they couldn’t wait for another turn.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The London Eye rises more than 440 feet above the city. The wheel sits on the south bank of the Thames River, standing high above the House of Parliament and the famous Big Ben clock. Made of more than 1,300 tons of steel, glass, and cable, the wheel cost about $50 million to build. The main part of the wheel was built in the Netherlands, while other pieces were made in other European countries. The assembly of the parts was done on large temporary platforms stretched across the Thames River. Large cranes lifted the gigantic wheel to its upright position. With the amount of effort it took, it’s no wonder the London Eye was not completed on time.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;London architects David Marks and Julia Barfield wanted to celebrate the New Year in a remarkable way. They chose a wheel design that would represent the turning of one millennium, or one thousand years, into a new millennium. Their vision was to create a structure that people could play a part in and enjoy.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Ferris wheel moves continuously at about two miles per hour. People can easily get on the ride by stepping from a boarding platform into the slow-moving passenger cars called pods. There are 32 pods on the London Eye. The pods have glass walls and are heated in winter and cooled in summer. Each pod can carry 25 passengers. In clear weather riders can see about 25 miles in every direction, viewing sights such as Windsor Castle. The ride takes about half an hour to complete. At the end of the trip, thrilled passengers clap and cheer loudly. Nearly everyone wants s to repeat the experience again and again.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The plan of the builders is for the London Eye to remain running until 2005, when it is supposed to be taken down. From the <span class="txt-underline">reaction</span> of its first riders, however, this may not happen. Many riders have voiced the opinion that the wheel should keep turning after 2005. It is clear that the crowds of people enjoying the London Eye want it to stay where it is for many years.</p>

1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LONDON—The world’s largest Ferris wheel, the London Eye, has finally made its first revolution with people aboard. The event, intended for New Year’s Day, was delayed a month. But today the 700 people who took the first ride on the Ferris wheel agreed it was well worth the wait. And they couldn’t wait for another turn.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The London Eye rises more than 440 feet above the city. The wheel sits on the south bank of the Thames River, standing high above the House of Parliament and the famous Big Ben clock. Made of more than 1,300 tons of steel, glass, and cable, the wheel cost about $50 million to build. The main part of the wheel was built in the Netherlands, while other pieces were made in other European countries. The assembly of the parts was done on large temporary platforms stretched across the Thames River. Large cranes lifted the gigantic wheel to its upright position. With the amount of effort it took, it’s no wonder the London Eye was not completed on time.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;London architects David Marks and Julia Barfield wanted to celebrate the New Year in a remarkable way. They chose a wheel design that would represent the turning of one millennium, or one thousand years, into a new millennium. Their vision was to create a structure that people could play a part in and enjoy.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Ferris wheel moves continuously at about two miles per hour. People can easily get on the ride by stepping from a boarding platform into the slow-moving passenger cars called pods. There are 32 pods on the London Eye. The pods have glass walls and are heated in winter and cooled in summer. Each pod can carry 25 passengers. In clear weather riders can see about 25 miles in every direction, viewing sights such as Windsor Castle. The ride takes about half an hour to complete. At the end of the trip, thrilled passengers clap and cheer loudly. Nearly everyone wants s to repeat the experience again and again.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The plan of the builders is for the London Eye to remain running until 2005, when it is supposed to be taken down. From the <span class="txt-underline">reaction</span> of its first riders, however, this may not happen. Many riders have voiced the opinion that the wheel should keep turning after 2005. It is clear that the crowds of people enjoying the London Eye want it to stay where it is for many years.</p>
