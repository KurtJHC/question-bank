        <p><em>[Extract from the novel ‘Lord of the Flies’ by William Golding]&nbsp;</em><br><br>
Chapter One - <strong>The Sound of the Shell</strong><br>
<br>
The boy with fair hair lowered himself down the last few feet of rock and began to pick his way toward the lagoon. Though he had taken off his school sweater and trailed it now from one hand, his grey shirt stuck to him and his hair was plastered to his forehead. All round him the long scar smashed into the jungle was a bath of heat. He was clambering heavily among the creepers and broken trunks when a bird, a vision of red and yellow, flashed upwards with a witch-like cry; and this cry was echoed by another.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Hi!" it said. "Wait a minute!"</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The undergrowth at the side of the scar was shaken and a multitude of raindrops fell pattering.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Wait a minute," the voice said. "I got caught up."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fair boy stopped and jerked his stockings with an automatic gesture that made the jungle seem for a moment like the Home Counties.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The voice spoke again.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
"I can't hardly move with all these creeper things."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The owner of the voice came backing out of the undergrowth so that twigs scratched on a greasy wind-breaker. The naked crooks of his knees were plump, caught and scratched by thorns. He bent down, removed the thorns carefully, and turned around. He was shorter than the fair boy and very fat. He came forward, searching out safe lodgments for his feet, and then looked up through thick spectacles.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Where's the man with the megaphone?"</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fair boy shook his head.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"This is an island. At least I think it's an island. That's a reef out in the sea. Perhaps there aren't any grownups anywhere."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fat boy looked startled.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"There was that pilot. But he wasn't in the passenger cabin, he was up in front."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fair boy was peering at the reef through screwed-up eyes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"All them other kids," the fat boy went on. "Some of them must have got out. They must have, mustn't they?"</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fair boy began to pick his way as casually as possible toward the water. He tried to be offhand and not too obviously uninterested, but the fat boy hurried after him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Aren't there any grownups at all?"</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I don't think so."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fair boy said this solemnly; but then the delight of a realized ambition overcame him. In the middle of the scar he stood on his head and grinned at the reversed fat boy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No grownups!"</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fat boy thought for a moment.</p>

        <p><em>[Extract from the novel ‘Lord of the Flies’ by William Golding]&nbsp;</em><br><br>
Chapter One - <strong>The Sound of the Shell</strong><br>
<br>
The boy with fair hair lowered himself down the last few feet of rock and began to pick his way toward the lagoon. Though he had taken off his school sweater and trailed it now from one hand, his grey shirt stuck to him and his hair was plastered to his forehead. All round him the long scar smashed into the jungle was a bath of heat. He was clambering heavily among the creepers and broken trunks when a bird, a vision of red and yellow, flashed upwards with a witch-like cry; and this cry was echoed by another.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Hi!" it said. "Wait a minute!"</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The undergrowth at the side of the scar was shaken and a multitude of raindrops fell pattering.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Wait a minute," the voice said. "I got caught up."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fair boy stopped and jerked his stockings with an automatic gesture that made the jungle seem for a moment like the Home Counties.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The voice spoke again.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
"I can't hardly move with all these creeper things."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The owner of the voice came backing out of the undergrowth so that twigs scratched on a greasy wind-breaker. The naked crooks of his knees were plump, caught and scratched by thorns. He bent down, removed the thorns carefully, and turned around. He was shorter than the fair boy and very fat. He came forward, searching out safe lodgments for his feet, and then looked up through thick spectacles.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Where's the man with the megaphone?"</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fair boy shook his head.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"This is an island. At least I think it's an island. That's a reef out in the sea. Perhaps there aren't any grownups anywhere."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fat boy looked startled.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"There was that pilot. But he wasn't in the passenger cabin, he was up in front."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fair boy was peering at the reef through screwed-up eyes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"All them other kids," the fat boy went on. "Some of them must have got out. They must have, mustn't they?"</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fair boy began to pick his way as casually as possible toward the water. He tried to be offhand and not too obviously uninterested, but the fat boy hurried after him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Aren't there any grownups at all?"</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I don't think so."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fair boy said this solemnly; but then the delight of a realized ambition overcame him. In the middle of the scar he stood on his head and grinned at the reversed fat boy.</p>

Chapter One - <strong>The Sound of the Shell</strong><br>
<br>
The boy with fair hair lowered himself down the last few feet of rock and began to pick his way toward the lagoon. Though he had taken off his school sweater and trailed it now from one hand, his grey shirt stuck to him and his hair was plastered to his forehead. All round him the long scar smashed into the jungle was a bath of heat. He was clambering heavily among the creepers and broken trunks when a bird, a vision of red and yellow, flashed upwards with a witch-like cry; and this cry was echoed by another.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Hi!" it said. "Wait a minute!"</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The undergrowth at the side of the scar was shaken and a multitude of raindrops fell pattering.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Wait a minute," the voice said. "I got caught up."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fair boy stopped and jerked his stockings with an automatic gesture that made the jungle seem for a moment like the Home Counties.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The voice spoke again.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
"I can't hardly move with all these creeper things."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The owner of the voice came backing out of the undergrowth so that twigs scratched on a greasy wind-breaker. The naked crooks of his knees were plump, caught and scratched by thorns. He bent down, removed the thorns carefully, and turned around. He was shorter than the fair boy and very fat. He came forward, searching out safe lodgments for his feet, and then looked up through thick spectacles.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Where's the man with the megaphone?"</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fair boy shook his head.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"This is an island. At least I think it's an island. That's a reef out in the sea. Perhaps there aren't any grownups anywhere."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fat boy looked startled.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"There was that pilot. But he wasn't in the passenger cabin, he was up in front."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fair boy was peering at the reef through screwed-up eyes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"All them other kids," the fat boy went on. "Some of them must have got out. They must have, mustn't they?"</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fair boy began to pick his way as casually as possible toward the water. He tried to be offhand and not too obviously uninterested, but the fat boy hurried after him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Aren't there any grownups at all?"</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I don't think so."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fair boy said this solemnly; but then the delight of a realized ambition overcame him. In the middle of the scar he stood on his head and grinned at the reversed fat boy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No grownups!"</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fat boy thought for a moment.</p>

Chapter One - <strong>The Sound of the Shell</strong><br>
<br>
The boy with fair hair lowered himself down the last few feet of rock and began to pick his way toward the lagoon. Though he had taken off his school sweater and trailed it now from one hand, his grey shirt stuck to him and his hair was plastered to his forehead. All round him the long scar smashed into the jungle was a bath of heat. He was clambering heavily among the creepers and broken trunks when a bird, a vision of red and yellow, flashed upwards with a witch-like cry; and this cry was echoed by another.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Hi!" it said. "Wait a minute!"</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The undergrowth at the side of the scar was shaken and a multitude of raindrops fell pattering.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Wait a minute," the voice said. "I got caught up."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fair boy stopped and jerked his stockings with an automatic gesture that made the jungle seem for a moment like the Home Counties.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The voice spoke again.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
"I can't hardly move with all these creeper things."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The owner of the voice came backing out of the undergrowth so that twigs scratched on a greasy wind-breaker. The naked crooks of his knees were plump, caught and scratched by thorns. He bent down, removed the thorns carefully, and turned around. He was shorter than the fair boy and very fat. He came forward, searching out safe lodgments for his feet, and then looked up through thick spectacles.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Where's the man with the megaphone?"</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fair boy shook his head.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"This is an island. At least I think it's an island. That's a reef out in the sea. Perhaps there aren't any grownups anywhere."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fat boy looked startled.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"There was that pilot. But he wasn't in the passenger cabin, he was up in front."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fair boy was peering at the reef through screwed-up eyes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"All them other kids," the fat boy went on. "Some of them must have got out. They must have, mustn't they?"</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fair boy began to pick his way as casually as possible toward the water. He tried to be offhand and not too obviously uninterested, but the fat boy hurried after him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Aren't there any grownups at all?"</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I don't think so."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fair boy said this solemnly; but then the delight of a realized ambition overcame him. In the middle of the scar he stood on his head and grinned at the reversed fat boy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No grownups!"</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fat boy thought for a moment.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"There was that pilot. But he wasn't in the passenger cabin, he was up in front."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fair boy was peering at the reef through screwed-up eyes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"All them other kids," the fat boy went on. "Some of them must have got out. They must have, mustn't they?"</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fair boy began to pick his way as casually as possible toward the water. He tried to be offhand and not too obviously uninterested, but the fat boy hurried after him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Aren't there any grownups at all?"</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I don't think so."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fair boy said this solemnly; but then the delight of a realized ambition overcame him. In the middle of the scar he stood on his head and grinned at the reversed fat boy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No grownups!"</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fat boy thought for a moment.</p>

Chapter One - <strong>The Sound of the Shell</strong><br>
<br>
The boy with fair hair lowered himself down the last few feet of rock and began to pick his way toward the lagoon. Though he had taken off his school sweater and trailed it now from one hand, his grey shirt stuck to him and his hair was plastered to his forehead. All round him the long scar smashed into the jungle was a bath of heat. He was clambering heavily among the creepers and broken trunks when a bird, a vision of red and yellow, flashed upwards with a witch-like cry; and this cry was echoed by another.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Hi!" it said. "Wait a minute!"</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The undergrowth at the side of the scar was shaken and a multitude of raindrops fell pattering.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Wait a minute," the voice said. "I got caught up."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fair boy stopped and jerked his stockings with an automatic gesture that made the jungle seem for a moment like the Home Counties.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The voice spoke again.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
"I can't hardly move with all these creeper things."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The owner of the voice came backing out of the undergrowth so that twigs scratched on a greasy wind-breaker. The naked crooks of his knees were plump, caught and scratched by thorns. He bent down, removed the thorns carefully, and turned around. He was shorter than the fair boy and very fat. He came forward, searching out safe lodgments for his feet, and then looked up through thick spectacles.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Where's the man with the megaphone?"</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fair boy shook his head.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"This is an island. At least I think it's an island. That's a reef out in the sea. Perhaps there aren't any grownups anywhere."</p>

        <p><em>[Extract from the novel ‘Lord of the Flies’ by William Golding]&nbsp;</em><br><br>
Chapter One - <strong>The Sound of the Shell</strong><br>
<br>
The boy with fair hair lowered himself down the last few feet of rock and began to pick his way toward the lagoon. Though he had taken off his school sweater and trailed it now from one hand, his grey shirt stuck to him and his hair was plastered to his forehead. All round him the long scar smashed into the jungle was a bath of heat. He was clambering heavily among the creepers and broken trunks when a bird, a vision of red and yellow, flashed upwards with a witch-like cry; and this cry was echoed by another.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Hi!" it said. "Wait a minute!"</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The undergrowth at the side of the scar was shaken and a multitude of raindrops fell pattering.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Wait a minute," the voice said. "I got caught up."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fair boy stopped and jerked his stockings with an automatic gesture that made the jungle seem for a moment like the Home Counties.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The voice spoke again.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
"I can't hardly move with all these creeper things."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The owner of the voice came backing out of the undergrowth so that twigs scratched on a greasy wind-breaker. The naked crooks of his knees were plump, caught and scratched by thorns. He bent down, removed the thorns carefully, and turned around. He was shorter than the fair boy and very fat. He came forward, searching out safe lodgments for his feet, and then looked up through thick spectacles.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Where's the man with the megaphone?"</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fair boy shook his head.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"This is an island. At least I think it's an island. That's a reef out in the sea. Perhaps there aren't any grownups anywhere."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fat boy looked startled.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"There was that pilot. But he wasn't in the passenger cabin, he was up in front."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fair boy was peering at the reef through screwed-up eyes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"All them other kids," the fat boy went on. "Some of them must have got out. They must have, mustn't they?"</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fair boy began to pick his way as casually as possible toward the water. He tried to be offhand and not too obviously uninterested, but the fat boy hurried after him.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Aren't there any grownups at all?"</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I don't think so."</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fair boy said this solemnly; but then the delight of a realized ambition overcame him. In the middle of the scar he stood on his head and grinned at the reversed fat boy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No grownups!"</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fat boy thought for a moment.</p>

          <strong>Hotrod Heart</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>By John Fogerty</em><br><br>
Ooh, let's go ridin'<br>
Cruisin' down the open road<br>
We can put the top down<br>
Listen to the radio<br>
Big ol' Buick<br>
And a big ol' sky<br>
Wheels on fire<br>
And I'll tell you why<br>
I got a hot rod heart<br>
Ooh, let's go prowlin'<br>
Sneakin' like we used to do<br>
Way back in the country<br>
Cut across the cornfields too<br>
Big ol' Harley<br>
And a big ol' moon<br>
Big ol' 'gator<br>
Puttin' on the zoom<br>
I got a hot rod heart<br>
Got a one-way ticket to the open road<br>
Come on<br>
Got a red line engine<br>
And I'm rarin' to go<br>
Put the pedal to the metal<br>
If you want to ride<br>
If you want to ride<br>
Let's go</p>
        <p>Ooh, let's go ridin'<br>
Rollin' down the open road …</p>

          <strong>Hotrod Heart</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>By John Fogerty</em><br><br>
Ooh, let's go ridin'<br>
Cruisin' down the open road<br>
We can put the top down<br>
Listen to the radio<br>
Big ol' Buick<br>
And a big ol' sky<br>
Wheels on fire<br>
And I'll tell you why<br>
I got a hot rod heart<br>
Ooh, let's go prowlin'<br>
Sneakin' like we used to do<br>
Way back in the country<br>
Cut across the cornfields too<br>
Big ol' Harley<br>
And a big ol' moon<br>
Big ol' 'gator<br>
Puttin' on the zoom<br>
I got a hot rod heart<br>
Got a one-way ticket to the open road<br>
Come on<br>
Got a red line engine<br>
And I'm rarin' to go<br>
Put the pedal to the metal<br>
If you want to ride<br>
If you want to ride<br>
Let's go</p>
        <p>Ooh, let's go ridin'<br>
Rollin' down the open road …</p>

        <p><em>By John Fogerty</em><br><br>
Ooh, let's go ridin'<br>
Cruisin' down the open road<br>
We can put the top down<br>
Listen to the radio<br>
Big ol' Buick<br>
And a big ol' sky<br>
Wheels on fire<br>
And I'll tell you why<br>
I got a hot rod heart<br>
Ooh, let's go prowlin'<br>
Sneakin' like we used to do<br>
Way back in the country<br>
Cut across the cornfields too<br>
Big ol' Harley<br>
And a big ol' moon<br>
Big ol' 'gator<br>
Puttin' on the zoom<br>
I got a hot rod heart<br>
Got a one-way ticket to the open road<br>
Come on<br>
Got a red line engine<br>
And I'm rarin' to go<br>
Put the pedal to the metal<br>
If you want to ride<br>
If you want to ride<br>
Let's go</p>
        <p>Ooh, let's go ridin'<br>
Rollin' down the open road …</p>

Got a one-way ticket to the open road<br>

Got a red line engine<br>

          <strong>Hotrod Heart</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>By John Fogerty</em><br><br>
Ooh, let's go ridin'<br>
Cruisin' down the open road<br>
We can put the top down<br>
Listen to the radio<br>
Big ol' Buick<br>
And a big ol' sky<br>
Wheels on fire<br>
And I'll tell you why<br>
I got a hot rod heart<br>
Ooh, let's go prowlin'<br>
Sneakin' like we used to do<br>
Way back in the country<br>
Cut across the cornfields too<br>
Big ol' Harley<br>
And a big ol' moon<br>
Big ol' 'gator<br>
Puttin' on the zoom<br>
I got a hot rod heart<br>
Got a one-way ticket to the open road<br>
Come on<br>
Got a red line engine<br>
And I'm rarin' to go<br>
Put the pedal to the metal<br>
If you want to ride<br>
If you want to ride<br>
Let's go</p>
        <p>Ooh, let's go ridin'<br>
Rollin' down the open road …</p>

          <strong>The Highwayman</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>BY&nbsp;ALFRED NOYES</em>
        </p>
        <p><strong>PART&nbsp;ONE</strong><br><br>
The wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
The moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
The road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
And the highwayman came riding—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riding—riding—<br>
The highwayman came riding, up to the old inn-door.</p>
        <p>He’d a French cocked-hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his chin,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
A coat of the claret velvet, and breeches of brown doe-skin.<br>
They fitted with never a wrinkle. His boots were up to the thigh.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
And he rode with a jewelled twinkle,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His pistol butts a-twinkle,<br>
His rapier hilt a-twinkle, under the jewelled sky.</p>
        <p>Over the cobbles he clattered and clashed in the dark inn-yard.<br>
He tapped with his whip on the shutters, but all was locked and barred.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
He whistled a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
But the landlord’s black-eyed daughter,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bess, the landlord’s daughter,<br>
Plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair.</p>
        <p>And dark in the dark old inn-yard a stable-wicket creaked<br>
Where Tim the ostler listened. His face was white and peaked.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
His eyes were hollows of madness, his hair like mouldy hay,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
But he loved the landlord’s daughter,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The landlord’s red-lipped daughter.<br>
Dumb as a dog he listened, and he heard the robber say—</p>
        <p>“One kiss, my bonny sweetheart, I’m after a prize to-night,<br>
But I shall be back with the yellow gold before the morning light;<br>
Yet, if they press me sharply, and harry me through the day,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Then look for me by moonlight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watch for me by moonlight,<br>
I’ll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way.”</p>
        <p>He rose upright in the stirrups. He scarce could reach her hand,<br>
But she loosened her hair in the casement. His face burnt like a brand<br>
As the black cascade of perfume came tumbling over his breast;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
And he kissed its waves in the moonlight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(O, sweet black waves in the moonlight!)<br>
Then he tugged at his rein in the moonlight, and galloped away to the west.</p>

          <strong>The Highwayman</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>BY&nbsp;ALFRED NOYES</em>
        </p>
        <p><strong>PART&nbsp;ONE</strong><br><br>
The wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
The moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
The road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
And the highwayman came riding—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riding—riding—<br>
The highwayman came riding, up to the old inn-door.</p>
        <p>He’d a French cocked-hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his chin,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
A coat of the claret velvet, and breeches of brown doe-skin.<br>
They fitted with never a wrinkle. His boots were up to the thigh.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
And he rode with a jewelled twinkle,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His pistol butts a-twinkle,<br>
His rapier hilt a-twinkle, under the jewelled sky.</p>
        <p>Over the cobbles he clattered and clashed in the dark inn-yard.<br>
He tapped with his whip on the shutters, but all was locked and barred.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
He whistled a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
But the landlord’s black-eyed daughter,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bess, the landlord’s daughter,<br>
Plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair.</p>
        <p>And dark in the dark old inn-yard a stable-wicket creaked<br>
Where Tim the ostler listened. His face was white and peaked.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
His eyes were hollows of madness, his hair like mouldy hay,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
But he loved the landlord’s daughter,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The landlord’s red-lipped daughter.<br>
Dumb as a dog he listened, and he heard the robber say—</p>
        <p>“One kiss, my bonny sweetheart, I’m after a prize to-night,<br>
But I shall be back with the yellow gold before the morning light;<br>
Yet, if they press me sharply, and harry me through the day,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Then look for me by moonlight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watch for me by moonlight,<br>
I’ll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way.”</p>
        <p>He rose upright in the stirrups. He scarce could reach her hand,<br>
But she loosened her hair in the casement. His face burnt like a brand<br>
As the black cascade of perfume came tumbling over his breast;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
And he kissed its waves in the moonlight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(O, sweet black waves in the moonlight!)<br>
Then he tugged at his rein in the moonlight, and galloped away to the west.</p>

          <strong>The Highwayman</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>BY&nbsp;ALFRED NOYES</em>
        </p>
        <p><strong>PART&nbsp;ONE</strong><br><br>
The wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
The moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
The road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
And the highwayman came riding—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riding—riding—<br>
The highwayman came riding, up to the old inn-door.</p>
        <p>He’d a French cocked-hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his chin,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
A coat of the claret velvet, and breeches of brown doe-skin.<br>
They fitted with never a wrinkle. His boots were up to the thigh.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
And he rode with a jewelled twinkle,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His pistol butts a-twinkle,<br>
His rapier hilt a-twinkle, under the jewelled sky.</p>
        <p>Over the cobbles he clattered and clashed in the dark inn-yard.<br>
He tapped with his whip on the shutters, but all was locked and barred.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
He whistled a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
But the landlord’s black-eyed daughter,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bess, the landlord’s daughter,<br>
Plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair.</p>
        <p>And dark in the dark old inn-yard a stable-wicket creaked<br>
Where Tim the ostler listened. His face was white and peaked.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
His eyes were hollows of madness, his hair like mouldy hay,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
But he loved the landlord’s daughter,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The landlord’s red-lipped daughter.<br>
Dumb as a dog he listened, and he heard the robber say—</p>
        <p>“One kiss, my bonny sweetheart, I’m after a prize to-night,<br>
But I shall be back with the yellow gold before the morning light;<br>
Yet, if they press me sharply, and harry me through the day,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Then look for me by moonlight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watch for me by moonlight,<br>
I’ll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way.”</p>
        <p>He rose upright in the stirrups. He scarce could reach her hand,<br>
But she loosened her hair in the casement. His face burnt like a brand<br>
As the black cascade of perfume came tumbling over his breast;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
And he kissed its waves in the moonlight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(O, sweet black waves in the moonlight!)<br>
Then he tugged at his rein in the moonlight, and galloped away to the west.</p>

And the highwayman came riding—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riding—riding—<br>
The highwayman came riding, up to the old inn-door.</p>
        <p>He’d a French cocked-hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his chin,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
A coat of the claret velvet, and breeches of brown doe-skin.<br>
They fitted with never a wrinkle. His boots were up to the thigh.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
And he rode with a jewelled twinkle,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His pistol butts a-twinkle,<br>
His rapier hilt a-twinkle, under the jewelled sky.</p>
        <p>Over the cobbles he clattered and clashed in the dark inn-yard.<br>
He tapped with his whip on the shutters, but all was locked and barred.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
He whistled a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
But the landlord’s black-eyed daughter,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bess, the landlord’s daughter,<br>
Plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair.</p>
        <p>And dark in the dark old inn-yard a stable-wicket creaked<br>
Where Tim the ostler listened. His face was white and peaked.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
His eyes were hollows of madness, his hair like mouldy hay,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
But he loved the landlord’s daughter,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The landlord’s red-lipped daughter.<br>
Dumb as a dog he listened, and he heard the robber say—</p>
        <p>“One kiss, my bonny sweetheart, I’m after a prize to-night,<br>
But I shall be back with the yellow gold before the morning light;<br>
Yet, if they press me sharply, and harry me through the day,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Then look for me by moonlight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watch for me by moonlight,<br>
I’ll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way.”</p>
        <p>He rose upright in the stirrups. He scarce could reach her hand,<br>
But she loosened her hair in the casement. His face burnt like a brand<br>
As the black cascade of perfume came tumbling over his breast;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
And he kissed its waves in the moonlight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(O, sweet black waves in the moonlight!)<br>
Then he tugged at his rein in the moonlight, and galloped away to the west.</p>
