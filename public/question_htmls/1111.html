            </p>
            <p>Children living in poverty often lack access to quality education. Sometimes it’s because there are not enough quality schools, their parents cannot afford school fees, or because impoverished families need their children to work. Without a quality education, children grow up being unable to provide for their own children — thus the generational cycle of poverty.</p>
            <p>Living in poverty also means not being able to afford a doctor or medical treatment. It means no electricity, limited shelter, and often little to no food on the table. For young children, improper nutrition can mean stunting and wasting that permanently impact their development. In impoverished countries where many people lack access to clean water and sanitation, poverty means the spread of preventable diseases and the unnecessary death of children.</p>

            <p>Absolute poverty is when a person cannot afford the minimum nutrition, clothing, or shelter needs in their country.</p>
            <p>Relative poverty is a household income below a certain percentage, typically 50% or 60%, of the median income of that country. This measurement takes into consideration the subjective cost of participating in everyday life. For example, plumbing is a necessity in some places; without plumbing, a person could be considered impoverished. But, in other places plumbing is a luxury. Relative poverty is useful for considering income inequality within a country.</p>

            <p>Multidimensional poverty acknowledges that poverty isn’t always about income. Sometimes a person’s income might be above the poverty line, but their family has no electricity, no access to a proper toilet, no clean drinking water, and no one in the family has completed six years of school.</p>
            <p>Within the categories of health, education, and living standards, there are 10 key indicators of multidimensional poverty that include nutrition, child mortality, years of schooling, school attendance, cooking fuel, sanitation, drinking water, electricity, housing, and assets. If a person is experiencing deprivation in three or more of these standards, then he or she is multidimensionally poor.</p>

            <p>A poverty line, also called a poverty threshold, is the line below which it is difficult, if not impossible, to afford basic needs. The poverty line is determined in each country by adding up the cost of meeting minimum needs, such as food and shelter. Household incomes that are too low to afford minimum needs, such as food and shelter, are below the poverty line.</p>
            <p>The income necessary to afford meeting minimum needs typically sets the poverty line for a country. Poverty lines can then be compared between countries. The international poverty line is the standard poverty line for measuring poverty globally. However, relatively new measures such as the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index include measurements of health, education, and living standards, all as signs of poverty.</p>

            <p>Multidimensional poverty acknowledges that poverty isn’t always about income. Sometimes a person’s income might be above the poverty line, but their family has no electricity, no access to a proper toilet, no clean drinking water, and no one in the family has completed six years of school.</p>
            <p>Within the categories of health, education, and living standards, there are 10 key indicators of multidimensional poverty that include nutrition, child mortality, years of schooling, school attendance, cooking fuel, sanitation, drinking water, electricity, housing, and assets. If a person is experiencing deprivation in three or more of these standards, then he or she is multidimensionally poor.</p>

            <p>A poverty line, also called a poverty threshold, is the line below which it is difficult, if not impossible, to afford basic needs. The poverty line is determined in each country by adding up the cost of meeting minimum needs, such as food and shelter. Household incomes that are too low to afford minimum needs, such as food and shelter, are below the poverty line.</p>
            <p>The income necessary to afford meeting minimum needs typically sets the poverty line for a country. Poverty lines can then be compared between countries. The international poverty line is the standard poverty line for measuring poverty globally. However, relatively new measures such as the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index include measurements of health, education, and living standards, all as signs of poverty.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Children living in poverty often lack access to quality education. Sometimes it’s because there are not enough quality schools, their parents cannot afford school fees, or because impoverished families need their children to work. Without a quality education, children grow up being unable to provide for their own children — thus the generational cycle of poverty.</p>
            <p>Living in poverty also means not being able to afford a doctor or medical treatment. It means no electricity, limited shelter, and often little to no food on the table. For young children, improper nutrition can mean stunting and wasting that permanently impact their development. In impoverished countries where many people lack access to clean water and sanitation, poverty means the spread of preventable diseases and the unnecessary death of children.</p>

            <p>Absolute poverty is when a person cannot afford the minimum nutrition, clothing, or shelter needs in their country.</p>
            <p>Relative poverty is a household income below a certain percentage, typically 50% or 60%, of the median income of that country. This measurement takes into consideration the subjective cost of participating in everyday life. For example, plumbing is a necessity in some places; without plumbing, a person could be considered impoverished. But, in other places plumbing is a luxury. Relative poverty is useful for considering income inequality within a country.</p>

              <strong>Extract A </strong>
            </p>
            <p>Children living in poverty often lack access to quality education. Sometimes it’s because there are not enough quality schools, their parents cannot afford school fees, or because impoverished families need their children to work. Without a quality education, children grow up being unable to provide for their own children — thus the generational cycle of poverty.</p>
            <p>Living in poverty also means not being able to afford a doctor or medical treatment. It means no electricity, limited shelter, and often little to no food on the table. For young children, improper nutrition can mean stunting and wasting that permanently impact their development. In impoverished countries where many people lack access to clean water and sanitation, poverty means the spread of preventable diseases and the unnecessary death of children.</p>

            <p>Absolute poverty is when a person cannot afford the minimum nutrition, clothing, or shelter needs in their country.</p>
            <p>Relative poverty is a household income below a certain percentage, typically 50% or 60%, of the median income of that country. This measurement takes into consideration the subjective cost of participating in everyday life. For example, plumbing is a necessity in some places; without plumbing, a person could be considered impoverished. But, in other places plumbing is a luxury. Relative poverty is useful for considering income inequality within a country.</p>

            <p>Multidimensional poverty acknowledges that poverty isn’t always about income. Sometimes a person’s income might be above the poverty line, but their family has no electricity, no access to a proper toilet, no clean drinking water, and no one in the family has completed six years of school.</p>
            <p>Within the categories of health, education, and living standards, there are 10 key indicators of multidimensional poverty that include nutrition, child mortality, years of schooling, school attendance, cooking fuel, sanitation, drinking water, electricity, housing, and assets. If a person is experiencing deprivation in three or more of these standards, then he or she is multidimensionally poor.</p>

            <p>A poverty line, also called a poverty threshold, is the line below which it is difficult, if not impossible, to afford basic needs. The poverty line is determined in each country by adding up the cost of meeting minimum needs, such as food and shelter. Household incomes that are too low to afford minimum needs, such as food and shelter, are below the poverty line.</p>
            <p>The income necessary to afford meeting minimum needs typically sets the poverty line for a country. Poverty lines can then be compared between countries. The international poverty line is the standard poverty line for measuring poverty globally. However, relatively new measures such as the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index include measurements of health, education, and living standards, all as signs of poverty.</p>

          <strong>The Science of Soft Serve&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>

        <p>In England, they often call it Mr. Whippy. <strong>1 ………..</strong> But anywhere it’s eaten, people can tell you it tastes good.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Soft serve is a classic sweet treat that has been enjoyed since the 1940s. As anyone who has ever stopped by a Mr. Whippy can attest to, although it is definitely ice cream, it’s a bit different from what you might buy in a grocery store. There are several competing claims about who first invented soft serve–Tom Carvel, the Dairy Queen family and even Margaret Thatcher are all names that come up. <strong>2 ………..</strong></p>

          </span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In its purest form soft serve is basically just regular ice cream at a different point in its process, according to the University of Guelph. After the ice cream ingredients are mixed together, the university writes, a machine “both freezes a portion of the water and whips air into the frozen mixture.” Ice cream is between 30 and 60 per cent air– <strong>3 ……….. </strong>At this point in the process, if the mixture is drawn into a cone, it’s soft serve. <strong>4 ……….. </strong>In a sense, soft serve is really just melted ice cream.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <strong>The difference is (partially) in the air&nbsp;</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All ice cream is technically foam–at least that’s what chemists would tell you. “In ice cream–liquid particles of fat–called fat globules–are spread throughout a mixture of water, sugar and ice, along with air bubbles,” writes Brian Rohrig for ChemMatters. <strong>5 ……….. </strong>. In soft serve, writes Vanessa Farquharson for the National Post, “all that air leaves less room for dairy fat.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A side effect of all this air is that soft serve is much warmer than regular ice cream, Rohrig writes. <strong>6 ………..</strong> while soft serve is about 21 degrees Fahrenheit. But they’re both delicious.</p>

          <strong>The Science of Soft Serve&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In England, they often call it Mr. Whippy. <strong>1 ………..</strong> But anywhere it’s eaten, people can tell you it tastes good.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Soft serve is a classic sweet treat that has been enjoyed since the 1940s. As anyone who has ever stopped by a Mr. Whippy can attest to, although it is definitely ice cream, it’s a bit different from what you might buy in a grocery store. There are several competing claims about who first invented soft serve–Tom Carvel, the Dairy Queen family and even Margaret Thatcher are all names that come up. <strong>2 ………..</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>It shares a lot with regular ice cream&nbsp;</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In its purest form soft serve is basically just regular ice cream at a different point in its process, according to the University of Guelph. After the ice cream ingredients are mixed together, the university writes, a machine “both freezes a portion of the water and whips air into the frozen mixture.” Ice cream is between 30 and 60 per cent air– <strong>3 ……….. </strong>At this point in the process, if the mixture is drawn into a cone, it’s soft serve. <strong>4 ……….. </strong>In a sense, soft serve is really just melted ice cream.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>The difference is (partially) in the air&nbsp;</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All ice cream is technically foam–at least that’s what chemists would tell you. “In ice cream–liquid particles of fat–called fat globules–are spread throughout a mixture of water, sugar and ice, along with air bubbles,” writes Brian Rohrig for ChemMatters. <strong>5 ……….. </strong>. In soft serve, writes Vanessa Farquharson for the National Post, “all that air leaves less room for dairy fat.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A side effect of all this air is that soft serve is much warmer than regular ice cream, Rohrig writes. <strong>6 ………..</strong> while soft serve is about 21 degrees Fahrenheit. But they’re both delicious.</p>

          <strong>The Science of Soft Serve&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In England, they often call it Mr. Whippy. <strong>1 ………..</strong> But anywhere it’s eaten, people can tell you it tastes good.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Soft serve is a classic sweet treat that has been enjoyed since the 1940s. As anyone who has ever stopped by a Mr. Whippy can attest to, although it is definitely ice cream, it’s a bit different from what you might buy in a grocery store. There are several competing claims about who first invented soft serve–Tom Carvel, the Dairy Queen family and even Margaret Thatcher are all names that come up. <strong>2 ………..</strong></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In its purest form soft serve is basically just regular ice cream at a different point in its process, according to the University of Guelph. After the ice cream ingredients are mixed together, the university writes, a machine “both freezes a portion of the water and whips air into the frozen mixture.” Ice cream is between 30 and 60 per cent air– <strong>3 ……….. </strong>At this point in the process, if the mixture is drawn into a cone, it’s soft serve. <strong>4 ……….. </strong>In a sense, soft serve is really just melted ice cream.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All ice cream is technically foam–at least that’s what chemists would tell you. “In ice cream–liquid particles of fat–called fat globules–are spread throughout a mixture of water, sugar and ice, along with air bubbles,” writes Brian Rohrig for ChemMatters. <strong>5 ……….. </strong>. In soft serve, writes Vanessa Farquharson for the National Post, “all that air leaves less room for dairy fat.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A side effect of all this air is that soft serve is much warmer than regular ice cream, Rohrig writes. <strong>6 ………..</strong> while soft serve is about 21 degrees Fahrenheit. But they’re both delicious.</p>

          <strong>The Science of Soft Serve&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In England, they often call it Mr. Whippy. <strong>1 ………..</strong> But anywhere it’s eaten, people can tell you it tastes good.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Soft serve is a classic sweet treat that has been enjoyed since the 1940s. As anyone who has ever stopped by a Mr. Whippy can attest to, although it is definitely ice cream, it’s a bit different from what you might buy in a grocery store. There are several competing claims about who first invented soft serve–Tom Carvel, the Dairy Queen family and even Margaret Thatcher are all names that come up. <strong>2 ………..</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>It shares a lot with regular ice cream&nbsp;</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In its purest form soft serve is basically just regular ice cream at a different point in its process, according to the University of Guelph. After the ice cream ingredients are mixed together, the university writes, a machine “both freezes a portion of the water and whips air into the frozen mixture.” Ice cream is between 30 and 60 per cent air– <strong>3 ……….. </strong>At this point in the process, if the mixture is drawn into a cone, it’s soft serve. <strong>4 ……….. </strong>In a sense, soft serve is really just melted ice cream.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>The difference is (partially) in the air&nbsp;</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All ice cream is technically foam–at least that’s what chemists would tell you. “In ice cream–liquid particles of fat–called fat globules–are spread throughout a mixture of water, sugar and ice, along with air bubbles,” writes Brian Rohrig for ChemMatters. <strong>5 ……….. </strong>. In soft serve, writes Vanessa Farquharson for the National Post, “all that air leaves less room for dairy fat.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A side effect of all this air is that soft serve is much warmer than regular ice cream, Rohrig writes. <strong>6 ………..</strong> while soft serve is about 21 degrees Fahrenheit. But they’re both delicious.</p>

          <strong>Chernobyl Anniversary&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reporter: Amelia Moseley&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>INTRO: Let’s go back 35 years to when the world was learning about a devastating disaster in Ukraine. What unfolded was one of the worst accidents in the history of nuclear power. Let’s find out more about Chernobyl and how it’s still having an impact today.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>These used to be bustling Ukrainian towns, full of the sound of cars, workers and families. Now, they’re ghost towns. Quiet, run down and deserted. <strong>1 ................ </strong>In the early hours of Saturday 26th of April 1986, engineers at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in northern Ukraine were doing a routine test.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They were checking the systems designed to keep the power plant safe during a blackout. But a bunch of mistakes, along with a flaw in the reactor’s design meant it all went horribly wrong. <strong>2 ................ </strong>The explosion and a big fire sent dangerous radioactive air and material streaming out over surrounding areas, but in the days after, the rest of the world would be kept in the dark.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You see Ukraine was part of the USSR also known as the Soviet Union. In size, it was the biggest country on earth made up of a group of states controlled from Russia and stretching across large parts of Europe and Asia. The Soviet Union was also communist which meant its government kept tight control over the Soviet people, their freedoms and their access to news and information. And it was worried an accident like this would make it look bad. But monitoring stations in Sweden noticed there were unusually high levels of radiation in the wind. <strong>3 ................</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Soviet Union evacuated hundreds of surrounding towns including nearby Pryp’yat&nbsp;which was home to 30 thousand people. It sent in what it called liquidators, who were firefighters, plant workers and locals that helped to contain the area and cover up the exposed reactor core. <strong>4 ................</strong> In fact, Chernobyl released more radiation into the air than the two atomic bombs dropped on Japan during World War Two. And it’s thought thousands of people have gotten sick and even died in the years after because of radiation poisoning.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>5 ................ </strong>There were investigations into what went wrong, and many Soviet people started questioning the government more, forcing it to be less secretive. In 1991, the Soviet Union came to an end, but 35 years on, the exclusion zone it created around Chernobyl remains frozen in time. Radiation sticks around for hundreds of years, which is why these towns are still mostly abandoned besides the odd tour group visiting for short periods of time and plenty of animals enjoying the lack of people.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The nuclear plant actually kept running until 2010 when the last reactor was shut down. <strong>6 ................</strong> But as the 35th anniversary of Chernobyl was commemorated in both Russia and Ukraine, there’s no forgetting the impact this disaster has had and will continue to have for many, many years to come.</p>

          <strong>Chernobyl Anniversary&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reporter: Amelia Moseley&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>INTRO: Let’s go back 35 years to when the world was learning about a devastating disaster in Ukraine. What unfolded was one of the worst accidents in the history of nuclear power. Let’s find out more about Chernobyl and how it’s still having an impact today.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>These used to be bustling Ukrainian towns, full of the sound of cars, workers and families. Now, they’re ghost towns. Quiet, run down and deserted. <strong>1 ................ </strong>In the early hours of Saturday 26th of April 1986, engineers at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in northern Ukraine were doing a routine test.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They were checking the systems designed to keep the power plant safe during a blackout. But a bunch of mistakes, along with a flaw in the reactor’s design meant it all went horribly wrong. <strong>2 ................ </strong>The explosion and a big fire sent dangerous radioactive air and material streaming out over surrounding areas, but in the days after, the rest of the world would be kept in the dark.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You see Ukraine was part of the USSR also known as the Soviet Union. In size, it was the biggest country on earth made up of a group of states controlled from Russia and stretching across large parts of Europe and Asia. The Soviet Union was also communist which meant its government kept tight control over the Soviet people, their freedoms and their access to news and information. And it was worried an accident like this would make it look bad. But monitoring stations in Sweden noticed there were unusually high levels of radiation in the wind. <strong>3 ................</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Soviet Union evacuated hundreds of surrounding towns including nearby Pryp’yat&nbsp;which was home to 30 thousand people. It sent in what it called liquidators, who were firefighters, plant workers and locals that helped to contain the area and cover up the exposed reactor core. <strong>4 ................</strong> In fact, Chernobyl released more radiation into the air than the two atomic bombs dropped on Japan during World War Two. And it’s thought thousands of people have gotten sick and even died in the years after because of radiation poisoning.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>5 ................ </strong>There were investigations into what went wrong, and many Soviet people started questioning the government more, forcing it to be less secretive. In 1991, the Soviet Union came to an end, but 35 years on, the exclusion zone it created around Chernobyl remains frozen in time. Radiation sticks around for hundreds of years, which is why these towns are still mostly abandoned besides the odd tour group visiting for short periods of time and plenty of animals enjoying the lack of people.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The nuclear plant actually kept running until 2010 when the last reactor was shut down. <strong>6 ................</strong> But as the 35th anniversary of Chernobyl was commemorated in both Russia and Ukraine, there’s no forgetting the impact this disaster has had and will continue to have for many, many years to come.</p>

          <strong>Chernobyl Anniversary&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reporter: Amelia Moseley&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>INTRO: Let’s go back 35 years to when the world was learning about a devastating disaster in Ukraine. What unfolded was one of the worst accidents in the history of nuclear power. Let’s find out more about Chernobyl and how it’s still having an impact today.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>These used to be bustling Ukrainian towns, full of the sound of cars, workers and families. Now, they’re ghost towns. Quiet, run down and deserted. <strong>1 ................ </strong>In the early hours of Saturday 26th of April 1986, engineers at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in northern Ukraine were doing a routine test.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They were checking the systems designed to keep the power plant safe during a blackout. But a bunch of mistakes, along with a flaw in the reactor’s design meant it all went horribly wrong. <strong>2 ................ </strong>The explosion and a big fire sent dangerous radioactive air and material streaming out over surrounding areas, but in the days after, the rest of the world would be kept in the dark.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You see Ukraine was part of the USSR also known as the Soviet Union. In size, it was the biggest country on earth made up of a group of states controlled from Russia and stretching across large parts of Europe and Asia. The Soviet Union was also communist which meant its government kept tight control over the Soviet people, their freedoms and their access to news and information. And it was worried an accident like this would make it look bad. But monitoring stations in Sweden noticed there were unusually high levels of radiation in the wind. <strong>3 ................</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Soviet Union evacuated hundreds of surrounding towns including nearby Pryp’yat&nbsp;which was home to 30 thousand people. It sent in what it called liquidators, who were firefighters, plant workers and locals that helped to contain the area and cover up the exposed reactor core. <strong>4 ................</strong> In fact, Chernobyl released more radiation into the air than the two atomic bombs dropped on Japan during World War Two. And it’s thought thousands of people have gotten sick and even died in the years after because of radiation poisoning.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>5 ................ </strong>There were investigations into what went wrong, and many Soviet people started questioning the government more, forcing it to be less secretive. In 1991, the Soviet Union came to an end, but 35 years on, the exclusion zone it created around Chernobyl remains frozen in time. Radiation sticks around for hundreds of years, which is why these towns are still mostly abandoned besides the odd tour group visiting for short periods of time and plenty of animals enjoying the lack of people.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The nuclear plant actually kept running until 2010 when the last reactor was shut down. <strong>6 ................</strong> But as the 35th anniversary of Chernobyl was commemorated in both Russia and Ukraine, there’s no forgetting the impact this disaster has had and will continue to have for many, many years to come.</p>

          <strong>Chernobyl Anniversary&nbsp;</strong>

          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reporter: Amelia Moseley&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>INTRO: Let’s go back 35 years to when the world was learning about a devastating disaster in Ukraine. What unfolded was one of the worst accidents in the history of nuclear power. Let’s find out more about Chernobyl and how it’s still having an impact today.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>These used to be bustling Ukrainian towns, full of the sound of cars, workers and families. Now, they’re ghost towns. Quiet, run down and deserted. <strong>1 ................ </strong>In the early hours of Saturday 26th of April 1986, engineers at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in northern Ukraine were doing a routine test.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They were checking the systems designed to keep the power plant safe during a blackout. But a bunch of mistakes, along with a flaw in the reactor’s design meant it all went horribly wrong. <strong>2 ................ </strong>The explosion and a big fire sent dangerous radioactive air and material streaming out over surrounding areas, but in the days after, the rest of the world would be kept in the dark.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You see Ukraine was part of the USSR also known as the Soviet Union. In size, it was the biggest country on earth made up of a group of states controlled from Russia and stretching across large parts of Europe and Asia. The Soviet Union was also communist which meant its government kept tight control over the Soviet people, their freedoms and their access to news and information. And it was worried an accident like this would make it look bad. But monitoring stations in Sweden noticed there were unusually high levels of radiation in the wind. <strong>3 ................</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Soviet Union evacuated hundreds of surrounding towns including nearby Pryp’yat&nbsp;which was home to 30 thousand people. It sent in what it called liquidators, who were firefighters, plant workers and locals that helped to contain the area and cover up the exposed reactor core. <strong>4 ................</strong> In fact, Chernobyl released more radiation into the air than the two atomic bombs dropped on Japan during World War Two. And it’s thought thousands of people have gotten sick and even died in the years after because of radiation poisoning.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>5 ................ </strong>There were investigations into what went wrong, and many Soviet people started questioning the government more, forcing it to be less secretive. In 1991, the Soviet Union came to an end, but 35 years on, the exclusion zone it created around Chernobyl remains frozen in time. Radiation sticks around for hundreds of years, which is why these towns are still mostly abandoned besides the odd tour group visiting for short periods of time and plenty of animals enjoying the lack of people.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The nuclear plant actually kept running until 2010 when the last reactor was shut down. <strong>6 ................</strong> But as the 35th anniversary of Chernobyl was commemorated in both Russia and Ukraine, there’s no forgetting the impact this disaster has had and will continue to have for many, many years to come.</p>

          <strong>Chernobyl Anniversary&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reporter: Amelia Moseley&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>INTRO: Let’s go back 35 years to when the world was learning about a devastating disaster in Ukraine. What unfolded was one of the worst accidents in the history of nuclear power. Let’s find out more about Chernobyl and how it’s still having an impact today.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>These used to be bustling Ukrainian towns, full of the sound of cars, workers and families. Now, they’re ghost towns. Quiet, run down and deserted. <strong>1 ................ </strong>In the early hours of Saturday 26th of April 1986, engineers at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in northern Ukraine were doing a routine test.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They were checking the systems designed to keep the power plant safe during a blackout. But a bunch of mistakes, along with a flaw in the reactor’s design meant it all went horribly wrong. <strong>2 ................ </strong>The explosion and a big fire sent dangerous radioactive air and material streaming out over surrounding areas, but in the days after, the rest of the world would be kept in the dark.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You see Ukraine was part of the USSR also known as the Soviet Union. In size, it was the biggest country on earth made up of a group of states controlled from Russia and stretching across large parts of Europe and Asia. The Soviet Union was also communist which meant its government kept tight control over the Soviet people, their freedoms and their access to news and information. And it was worried an accident like this would make it look bad. But monitoring stations in Sweden noticed there were unusually high levels of radiation in the wind. <strong>3 ................</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Soviet Union evacuated hundreds of surrounding towns including nearby Pryp’yat&nbsp;which was home to 30 thousand people. It sent in what it called liquidators, who were firefighters, plant workers and locals that helped to contain the area and cover up the exposed reactor core. <strong>4 ................</strong> In fact, Chernobyl released more radiation into the air than the two atomic bombs dropped on Japan during World War Two. And it’s thought thousands of people have gotten sick and even died in the years after because of radiation poisoning.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>5 ................ </strong>There were investigations into what went wrong, and many Soviet people started questioning the government more, forcing it to be less secretive. In 1991, the Soviet Union came to an end, but 35 years on, the exclusion zone it created around Chernobyl remains frozen in time. Radiation sticks around for hundreds of years, which is why these towns are still mostly abandoned besides the odd tour group visiting for short periods of time and plenty of animals enjoying the lack of people.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The nuclear plant actually kept running until 2010 when the last reactor was shut down. <strong>6 ................</strong> But as the 35th anniversary of Chernobyl was commemorated in both Russia and Ukraine, there’s no forgetting the impact this disaster has had and will continue to have for many, many years to come.</p>
