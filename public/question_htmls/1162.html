          <strong>The Jungle Book&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Rudyard Kipling&nbsp;</em><br><br>
There was a chorus of deep growls, and a young wolf in his fourth year flung back Shere Khan’s question to Akela: “What have the Free People to do with <span class="txt-underline"><strong>a man’s cub</strong></span>?” Now, the Law of the Jungle lays down that if there is any dispute as to the right of a cub to be accepted by the Pack, he must be spoken for by at least two members of the Pack who are not his father and mother.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Who speaks for this cub?” said Akela. “Among the Free People who speaks?” There was no answer and <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Mother Wolf got ready for what she knew would be her last fight</strong></span>, if things came to fighting.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then the only other creature who is allowed at the Pack Council—Baloo, the sleepy brown bear who teaches the wolf cubs the Law of the Jungle: old Baloo, who can come and go where he pleases because he eats only nuts and roots and honey—rose upon his hind quarters and grunted.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“The man’s cub—the man’s cub?” he said. “I speak for the man’s cub. There is no harm in a man’s cub. I have no gift of words, but I speak the truth. Let him run with the Pack, and be entered with the others. I myself will teach him.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“We need yet another,” said Akela. “Baloo has spoken, and he is our teacher for the young cubs. Who speaks besides Baloo?”</p>
        <p>A black shadow dropped down into the circle. It was Bagheera the Black Panther, inky black all over, but with the panther markings showing up in certain lights like the pattern of watered silk. Everybody knew Bagheera, and nobody cared to cross his path; for he was as cunning as Tabaqui, as bold as the wild buffalo, and as reckless as the wounded elephant. But he had a voice as soft as wild honey dripping from a tree, and a skin softer than down.</p>
        <p>“O Akela, and ye the Free People,” he purred, “I have no right in your assembly, but the Law of the Jungle says that if there is a doubt which is not a killing matter in regard to a new cub, the life of that cub may be bought at a price. And the Law does not say who may or may not pay that price. Am I right?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Good! Good!” said the young wolves, who are always hungry. “Listen to Bagheera. The cub can be bought for a price. It is the Law.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Knowing that I have no right to speak here, I ask your leave.”</p>
        <p>“Speak then,” cried twenty voices.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“To kill a naked cub is shame. Besides, he may make better sport for you when he is grown. Baloo has spoken in his behalf. Now to Baloo’s word I will add one bull, and a fat one, newly&nbsp;killed, not half a mile from here, if ye will accept the man’s cub according to the Law. Is it difficult?”</p>
        <p>There was a clamor of scores of voices, saying: “What matter? He will die in the winter rains. He will scorch in the sun. What harm can a naked frog do us? Let him run with the Pack. Where is the bull, Bagheera? Let him be accepted.” And then came Akela’s deep bay, crying: “Look well—look well, O Wolves!”</p>
        <p>Mowgli was still deeply interested in the pebbles, and he did not notice when the wolves came and looked at him one by one. At last, they all went down the hill for the dead bull, and only Akela, Bagheera, Baloo, and Mowgli’s own wolves were left. Shere Khan roared still in the night, for he was very angry that Mowgli had not been handed over to him.</p>
        <p>“Ay, roar well,” said Bagheera, under his whiskers, “for the time will come when this naked thing will make thee roar to another tune, or I know nothing of man.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“It was well done,” said Akela. “Men and their cubs are very wise. He may be a help in time.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Truly, a help in time of need; for none can hope to lead the Pack forever,” said Bagheera.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Akela said nothing. He was thinking of the time that comes to every leader of every pack when his strength goes from him and he gets feebler and feebler, till at last he is killed by the wolves and a new leader comes up—to be killed in his turn.</p>
        <p>“Take him away,” he said to Father Wolf, “and train him as befits one of the Free People.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And that is how Mowgli was entered into the Seeonee Wolf Pack for the price of a bull and on Baloo’s good word.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now you must be content to skip ten or eleven whole years, and only guess at all the wonderful life that Mowgli led among the wolves, because if it were written out it would fill ever so many books. He grew up with the cubs, though they, of course, were grown wolves almost before he was a child. And Father Wolf taught him his business, and the meaning of things in the jungle, till every rustle in the grass, every breath of the warm night air, every note of the owls above his head, every scratch of a bat’s claws as it roosted for a while in a tree, and every splash of every little fish jumping in a pool meant just as much to him as the work of his office means to a business man. When he was not learning he sat out in the sun and slept, and ate and went to sleep again. When he felt dirty or hot, he swam in the forest pools; and when he wanted honey (Baloo told him that honey and nuts were just as pleasant to eat as raw meat) he climbed up for it, and that Bagheera showed him how to do.</p>

          <strong>The Jungle Book&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Rudyard Kipling&nbsp;</em><br><br>
There was a chorus of deep growls, and a young wolf in his fourth year flung back Shere Khan’s question to Akela: “What have the Free People to do with <span class="txt-underline"><strong>a man’s cub</strong></span>?” Now, the Law of the Jungle lays down that if there is any dispute as to the right of a cub to be accepted by the Pack, he must be spoken for by at least two members of the Pack who are not his father and mother.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Who speaks for this cub?” said Akela. “Among the Free People who speaks?” There was no answer and <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Mother Wolf got ready for what she knew would be her last fight</strong></span>, if things came to fighting.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then the only other creature who is allowed at the Pack Council—Baloo, the sleepy brown bear who teaches the wolf cubs the Law of the Jungle: old Baloo, who can come and go where he pleases because he eats only nuts and roots and honey—rose upon his hind quarters and grunted.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“The man’s cub—the man’s cub?” he said. “I speak for the man’s cub. There is no harm in a man’s cub. I have no gift of words, but I speak the truth. Let him run with the Pack, and be entered with the others. I myself will teach him.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“We need yet another,” said Akela. “Baloo has spoken, and he is our teacher for the young cubs. Who speaks besides Baloo?”</p>
        <p>A black shadow dropped down into the circle. It was Bagheera the Black Panther, inky black all over, but with the panther markings showing up in certain lights like the pattern of watered silk. Everybody knew Bagheera, and nobody cared to cross his path; for he was as cunning as Tabaqui, as bold as the wild buffalo, and as reckless as the wounded elephant. But he had a voice as soft as wild honey dripping from a tree, and a skin softer than down.</p>
        <p>“O Akela, and ye the Free People,” he purred, “I have no right in your assembly, but the Law of the Jungle says that if there is a doubt which is not a killing matter in regard to a new cub, the life of that cub may be bought at a price. And the Law does not say who may or may not pay that price. Am I right?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Good! Good!” said the young wolves, who are always hungry. “Listen to Bagheera. The cub can be bought for a price. It is the Law.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Knowing that I have no right to speak here, I ask your leave.”</p>
        <p>“Speak then,” cried twenty voices.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“To kill a naked cub is shame. Besides, he may make better sport for you when he is grown. Baloo has spoken in his behalf. Now to Baloo’s word I will add one bull, and a fat one, newly&nbsp;killed, not half a mile from here, if ye will accept the man’s cub according to the Law. Is it difficult?”</p>
        <p>There was a clamor of scores of voices, saying: “What matter? He will die in the winter rains. He will scorch in the sun. What harm can a naked frog do us? Let him run with the Pack. Where is the bull, Bagheera? Let him be accepted.” And then came Akela’s deep bay, crying: “Look well—look well, O Wolves!”</p>
        <p>Mowgli was still deeply interested in the pebbles, and he did not notice when the wolves came and looked at him one by one. At last, they all went down the hill for the dead bull, and only Akela, Bagheera, Baloo, and Mowgli’s own wolves were left. Shere Khan roared still in the night, for he was very angry that Mowgli had not been handed over to him.</p>
        <p>“Ay, roar well,” said Bagheera, under his whiskers, “for the time will come when this naked thing will make thee roar to another tune, or I know nothing of man.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“It was well done,” said Akela. “Men and their cubs are very wise. He may be a help in time.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Truly, a help in time of need; for none can hope to lead the Pack forever,” said Bagheera.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Akela said nothing. He was thinking of the time that comes to every leader of every pack when his strength goes from him and he gets feebler and feebler, till at last he is killed by the wolves and a new leader comes up—to be killed in his turn.</p>
        <p>“Take him away,” he said to Father Wolf, “and train him as befits one of the Free People.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And that is how Mowgli was entered into the Seeonee Wolf Pack for the price of a bull and on Baloo’s good word.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now you must be content to skip ten or eleven whole years, and only guess at all the wonderful life that Mowgli led among the wolves, because if it were written out it would fill ever so many books. He grew up with the cubs, though they, of course, were grown wolves almost before he was a child. And Father Wolf taught him his business, and the meaning of things in the jungle, till every rustle in the grass, every breath of the warm night air, every note of the owls above his head, every scratch of a bat’s claws as it roosted for a while in a tree, and every splash of every little fish jumping in a pool meant just as much to him as the work of his office means to a business man. When he was not learning he sat out in the sun and slept, and ate and went to sleep again. When he felt dirty or hot, he swam in the forest pools; and when he wanted honey (Baloo told him that honey and nuts were just as pleasant to eat as raw meat) he climbed up for it, and that Bagheera showed him how to do.</p>

          <strong>The Jungle Book&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em>by Rudyard Kipling&nbsp;</em><br><br>
There was a chorus of deep growls, and a young wolf in his fourth year flung back Shere Khan’s question to Akela: “What have the Free People to do with <span class="txt-underline"><strong>a man’s cub</strong></span>?” Now, the Law of the Jungle lays down that if there is any dispute as to the right of a cub to be accepted by the Pack, he must be spoken for by at least two members of the Pack who are not his father and mother.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Who speaks for this cub?” said Akela. “Among the Free People who speaks?” There was no answer and <span class="txt-underline"><strong>Mother Wolf got ready for what she knew would be her last fight</strong></span>, if things came to fighting.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then the only other creature who is allowed at the Pack Council—Baloo, the sleepy brown bear who teaches the wolf cubs the Law of the Jungle: old Baloo, who can come and go where he pleases because he eats only nuts and roots and honey—rose upon his hind quarters and grunted.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“The man’s cub—the man’s cub?” he said. “I speak for the man’s cub. There is no harm in a man’s cub. I have no gift of words, but I speak the truth. Let him run with the Pack, and be entered with the others. I myself will teach him.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“We need yet another,” said Akela. “Baloo has spoken, and he is our teacher for the young cubs. Who speaks besides Baloo?”</p>
        <p>A black shadow dropped down into the circle. It was Bagheera the Black Panther, inky black all over, but with the panther markings showing up in certain lights like the pattern of watered silk. Everybody knew Bagheera, and nobody cared to cross his path; for he was as cunning as Tabaqui, as bold as the wild buffalo, and as reckless as the wounded elephant. But he had a voice as soft as wild honey dripping from a tree, and a skin softer than down.</p>
        <p>“O Akela, and ye the Free People,” he purred, “I have no right in your assembly, but the Law of the Jungle says that if there is a doubt which is not a killing matter in regard to a new cub, the life of that cub may be bought at a price. And the Law does not say who may or may not pay that price. Am I right?”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Good! Good!” said the young wolves, who are always hungry. “Listen to Bagheera. The cub can be bought for a price. It is the Law.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Knowing that I have no right to speak here, I ask your leave.”</p>
        <p>“Speak then,” cried twenty voices.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“To kill a naked cub is shame. Besides, he may make better sport for you when he is grown. Baloo has spoken in his behalf. Now to Baloo’s word I will add one bull, and a fat one, newly&nbsp;killed, not half a mile from here, if ye will accept the man’s cub according to the Law. Is it difficult?”</p>
        <p>There was a clamor of scores of voices, saying: “What matter? He will die in the winter rains. He will scorch in the sun. What harm can a naked frog do us? Let him run with the Pack. Where is the bull, Bagheera? Let him be accepted.” And then came Akela’s deep bay, crying: “Look well—look well, O Wolves!”</p>
        <p>Mowgli was still deeply interested in the pebbles, and he did not notice when the wolves came and looked at him one by one. At last, they all went down the hill for the dead bull, and only Akela, Bagheera, Baloo, and Mowgli’s own wolves were left. Shere Khan roared still in the night, for he was very angry that Mowgli had not been handed over to him.</p>
        <p>“Ay, roar well,” said Bagheera, under his whiskers, “for the time will come when this naked thing will make thee roar to another tune, or I know nothing of man.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“It was well done,” said Akela. “Men and their cubs are very wise. He may be a help in time.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Truly, a help in time of need; for none can hope to lead the Pack forever,” said Bagheera.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Akela said nothing. He was thinking of the time that comes to every leader of every pack when his strength goes from him and he gets feebler and feebler, till at last he is killed by the wolves and a new leader comes up—to be killed in his turn.</p>
        <p>“Take him away,” he said to Father Wolf, “and train him as befits one of the Free People.”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And that is how Mowgli was entered into the Seeonee Wolf Pack for the price of a bull and on Baloo’s good word.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Now you must be content to skip ten or eleven whole years, and only guess at all the wonderful life that Mowgli led among the wolves, because if it were written out it would fill ever so many books. He grew up with the cubs, though they, of course, were grown wolves almost before he was a child. And Father Wolf taught him his business, and the meaning of things in the jungle, till every rustle in the grass, every breath of the warm night air, every note of the owls above his head, every scratch of a bat’s claws as it roosted for a while in a tree, and every splash of every little fish jumping in a pool meant just as much to him as the work of his office means to a business man. When he was not learning he sat out in the sun and slept, and ate and went to sleep again. When he felt dirty or hot, he swam in the forest pools; and when he wanted honey (Baloo told him that honey and nuts were just as pleasant to eat as raw meat) he climbed up for it, and that Bagheera showed him how to do.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The image of Uncle Sam is based on a combination of two earlier American characters: Yankee Doodle and Brother Jonathan. Yankee Doodle was a derogatory term the British used for colonial Americans during the Revolutionary War. <strong>12 ……….</strong> Though the origins of the name Uncle Sam are subject to some dispute, most historians believe that the name came from a New York merchant named Sam Wilson, known by his friends as “Uncle Sam”. <strong>13 ……….</strong> The barrels were stamped with the initials U.S., for United States, but many associated the initials with “Uncle Sam” Wilson. <strong>14 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>Illustrations of Uncle Sam, <strong>15 ……….,</strong> began appearing shortly after the War of 1812. British cartoonists from <em>Punch</em> magazine were the first to fully develop the image of Uncle Sam as a tall, bearded, thin figure. American cartoonist Thomas Nast cemented the image of Uncle Sam in his own drawings during the 1870s.</p>
        <p>By the early 1900s, Uncle Sam had become known worldwide as a symbol for the United States. <strong>16 ………. </strong>The U.S. government printed millions of these posters during World War I and used the image again during World War II. <strong>17 ………. </strong>Most depictions today closely resemble Flagg’s famous illustration.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The image of Uncle Sam is based on a combination of two earlier American characters: Yankee Doodle and Brother Jonathan. Yankee Doodle was a derogatory term the British used for colonial Americans during the Revolutionary War. <strong>12 ……….</strong> Though the origins of the name Uncle Sam are subject to some dispute, most historians believe that the name came from a New York merchant named Sam Wilson, known by his friends as “Uncle Sam”. <strong>13 ……….</strong> The barrels were stamped with the initials U.S., for United States, but many associated the initials with “Uncle Sam” Wilson. <strong>14 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>Illustrations of Uncle Sam, <strong>15 ……….,</strong> began appearing shortly after the War of 1812. British cartoonists from <em>Punch</em> magazine were the first to fully develop the image of Uncle Sam as a tall, bearded, thin figure. American cartoonist Thomas Nast cemented the image of Uncle Sam in his own drawings during the 1870s.</p>
        <p>By the early 1900s, Uncle Sam had become known worldwide as a symbol for the United States. <strong>16 ………. </strong>The U.S. government printed millions of these posters during World War I and used the image again during World War II. <strong>17 ………. </strong>Most depictions today closely resemble Flagg’s famous illustration.</p>

        <p>The image of Uncle Sam is based on a combination of two earlier American characters: Yankee Doodle and Brother Jonathan. Yankee Doodle was a derogatory term the British used for colonial Americans during the Revolutionary War. <strong>12 ……….</strong> Though the origins of the name Uncle Sam are subject to some dispute, most historians believe that the name came from a New York merchant named Sam Wilson, known by his friends as “Uncle Sam”. <strong>13 ……….</strong> The barrels were stamped with the initials U.S., for United States, but many associated the initials with “Uncle Sam” Wilson. <strong>14 ……….</strong></p>
        <p>Illustrations of Uncle Sam, <strong>15 ……….,</strong> began appearing shortly after the War of 1812. British cartoonists from <em>Punch</em> magazine were the first to fully develop the image of Uncle Sam as a tall, bearded, thin figure. American cartoonist Thomas Nast cemented the image of Uncle Sam in his own drawings during the 1870s.</p>
        <p>By the early 1900s, Uncle Sam had become known worldwide as a symbol for the United States. <strong>16 ………. </strong>The U.S. government printed millions of these posters during World War I and used the image again during World War II. <strong>17 ………. </strong>Most depictions today closely resemble Flagg’s famous illustration.</p>

      <div class="col-6">{^<strong> Extract A </strong>^}<br>
A problem with expectations was made famous by the Charles Dickens 1861 novel, "Great Expectations". The main character, Pip, inherits money from a secret benefactor. He views this fortune as a stepping stone to marrying the girl of his dreams.<br>
<br>
When he ultimately learned that the money was not necessarily part of that larger plan, he realised that he had taken for granted so many important relationships and gifts in his life. His expectations had robbed him of fully appreciating his reality.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong> ^}<br>
Research backs up the idea that we may not fully appreciate what we have when we are expecting more or comparing what we have to what we could have. One study found that participants who were exposed to a subliminal reminder of wealth spent less time savouring a chocolate bar and exhibited less enjoyment of the experience than other subjects who weren't reminded of wealth.<br>
<br>
This is an interesting study that can remind us all to try to savour our chocolate (and lives) more, and perhaps to try not to remind ourselves of what we don't have. This study can also remind us, however, of how easy it is to let our thoughts colour our enjoyment of what we actually have.<br>
<br>
How many times have we focused so much on something we wanted that we didn't truly savour what we had? How often might our expectations for great things make us feel like what we have isn't really that great (when there are many people who have less)?<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C&nbsp;</strong>^}<br>
Our expectations can get the better of us when we expect more than what is realistic in a given situation. We might expect our partners to live up to what we see in romance films, our jobs to be idealised versions we had as children, or even our lives to match up to what we see on Instagram.<br>
<br>
Our expectations can create significant stress when they don't match up to reality. Also consider how social media can greatly contribute to this: we compare our own worst moments (those not deemed to be shareable online) to others' best moments, which very often are filtered to seem perfect. We may not even realise this mismatched comparison.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D&nbsp;</strong>^}<br>
If you'd like to get out of the expectations vs. reality trap, it all comes down to awareness. Becoming aware of what you are expecting is a great start. Becoming aware of what you "should" be expecting is also a wise idea.<br>
<br>
When you find that what is happening is not what you expected, actively look for the positives in what you have. You may find that once you get over the disappointment, you have something you didn't initially realise you wanted. This helps you to be more appreciative of what you have.</div>

              <strong>Extract A&nbsp;</strong>
            </p>
            <p>A problem with expectations was made famous by the Charles Dickens 1861 novel, "Great Expectations". The main character, Pip, inherits money from a secret benefactor. He views this fortune as a stepping stone to marrying the girl of his dreams.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>When he ultimately learned that the money was not necessarily part of that larger plan, he realised that he had taken for granted so many important relationships and gifts in his life. His expectations had robbed him of fully appreciating his reality.</p>

              <strong>Extract B</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Research backs up the idea that we may not fully appreciate what we have when we are expecting more or comparing what we have to what we could have. One study found that participants who were exposed to a subliminal reminder of wealth spent less time savouring a chocolate bar and exhibited less enjoyment of the experience than other subjects who weren't reminded of wealth.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>This is an interesting study that can remind us all to try to savour our chocolate (and lives) more, and perhaps to try not to remind ourselves of what we don't have. This study can also remind us, however, of how easy it is to let our thoughts colour our enjoyment of what we actually have.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>How many times have we focused so much on something we wanted that we didn't truly savour what we had? How often might our expectations for great things make us feel like what we have isn't really that great (when there are many people who have less)?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>A problem with expectations was made famous by the Charles Dickens 1861 novel, "Great Expectations". The main character, Pip, inherits money from a secret benefactor. He views this fortune as a stepping stone to marrying the girl of his dreams.</p>

            <p>Research backs up the idea that we may not fully appreciate what we have when we are expecting more or comparing what we have to what we could have. One study found that participants who were exposed to a subliminal reminder of wealth spent less time savouring a chocolate bar and exhibited less enjoyment of the experience than other subjects who weren't reminded of wealth.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>This is an interesting study that can remind us all to try to savour our chocolate (and lives) more, and perhaps to try not to remind ourselves of what we don't have. This study can also remind us, however, of how easy it is to let our thoughts colour our enjoyment of what we actually have.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>How many times have we focused so much on something we wanted that we didn't truly savour what we had? How often might our expectations for great things make us feel like what we have isn't really that great (when there are many people who have less)?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Our expectations can get the better of us when we expect more than what is realistic in a given situation. We might expect our partners to live up to what we see in romance films, our jobs to be idealised versions we had as children, or even our lives to match up to what we see on Instagram.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Our expectations can create significant stress when they don't match up to reality. Also consider how social media can greatly contribute to this: we compare our own worst moments (those not deemed to be shareable online) to others' best moments, which very often are filtered to seem perfect. We may not even realise this mismatched comparison.</p>

One study found that participants who were exposed to a subliminal reminder of wealth spent less time savouring a chocolate bar and exhibited less enjoyment of the experience than other subjects who weren't reminded of wealth.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>This is an interesting study that can remind us all to try to savour our chocolate (and lives) more, and perhaps to try not to remind ourselves of what we don't have. This study can also remind us, however, of how easy it is to let our thoughts colour our enjoyment of what we actually have.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>How many times have we focused so much on something we wanted that we didn't truly savour what we had? How often might our expectations for great things make us feel like what we have isn't really that great (when there are many people who have less)?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Our expectations can get the better of us when we expect more than what is realistic in a given situation. We might expect our partners to live up to what we see in romance films, our jobs to be idealised versions we had as children, or even our lives to match up to what we see on Instagram.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Our expectations can create significant stress when they don't match up to reality. Also consider how social media can greatly contribute to this: we compare our own worst moments (those not deemed to be shareable online) to others' best moments, which very often are filtered to seem perfect. We may not even realise this mismatched comparison.</p>

            <p>If you'd like to get out of the expectations vs. reality trap, it all comes down to awareness. Becoming aware of what you are expecting is a great start. Becoming aware of what you "should" be expecting is also a wise idea.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>When you find that what is happening is not what you expected, actively look for the positives in what you have. You may find that once you get over the disappointment, you have something you didn't initially realise you wanted. This helps you to be more appreciative of what you have.</p>
