          <strong>A Lasting Impression</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em>&nbsp;Seventeen-year-old Vinnie Ream’s steps echoed down the long marble halls as she approached President Abraham Lincoln’s office. It was the middle of the day—time for the president’s half hour of relaxation. This half hour he spent in quiet, thinking or reading.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em>&nbsp;Vinnie opened the door of the office and quietly walked to the corner where her supplies were stored. She tied her apron around her waist and gathered her tub of clay and her tools. Then she removed the towel that covered the beginnings of a clay head and shoulders. Vinnie had draped the wet towel over the clay sculpture to keep it from drying out overnight.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3&nbsp;</strong></em>President Lincoln was already <span class="txt-underline"><strong>reclining</strong></span> in his favorite chair. Most days he leaned back in his chair, his long legs stretched out in front of him. Some days he read. Other times he closed his eyes, rested his chin on his chest, and sat as still as a sleeping giant. He usually said nothing.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4 </strong></em>Each day for weeks Vinnie had studied Lincoln’s expressions during his half-hour break. She was a sculptor known for more than her ability to shape the eyes, nose, and mouth of each of her subjects. The sculptures also captured their expressions and moods. Her sculptures of people seemed to say “I am worried” or “I am proud.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> As she worked, Vinnie thought of the contrast between Lincoln and herself. The president stood six feet four inches tall, while Vinnie was barely five feet tall. He was the leader of a nation; she was just a student of sculpture. She often replayed the events in her mind of how her dream of sculpting Lincoln had come true.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> Vinnie had been working at an art studio in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. There she was learning the art of sculpting from master sculptor Clark Mills. Congressman James Rollins, a family friend, had introduced Vinnie to Mills. Recognizing that she had natural talent, Mills asked Vinnie to become his student helper. From time to time, Congressman Rollins stopped by to check on her progress. “How is my favorite sculptor doing today?” he asked one day.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> “I’ve learned a great deal,” Vinnie replied, “but each day I dream of one day sculpting a likeness of the president.” Vinnie looked up from her work and sighed, “I know, I know, I’m just a dreamer.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “And a wonderful dream it is!” Rollins agreed.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> Later that day Rollins asked Lincoln whether he would allow Vinnie to sculpt his likeness. At first Lincoln declined. He was still recovering from the death of his young son Willie. He told Rollins that he was in no mood to be stared at by anyone.</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> After talking for a while longer, though, Rollins finally won Lincoln over. Lincoln agreed to allow Vinnie to work quietly in his office for a half hour each day. Soon, her clay and tools were moved to a corner of the president’s office. The idea of making a sculpture of the president thrilled Vinnie.</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> However, once she began working, Vinnie quickly became discouraged. She couldn’t get Lincoln’s expression right. He often stared out the window while she worked. She could see his <span class="txt-underline"><strong>melancholy</strong></span> expression grow even darker. “What makes him so unhappy?” Vinnie wondered.</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="74%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyilvwllw/image/upload/v1767486088/nl9pn3g2kyrwl0ewxf7q.png" alt="ASS_Y4_EN_01">


        </p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> Then one day, for the first time, Lincoln watched Vinnie as she worked. Finally he spoke. “You remind me of my son Willie. He liked reading books, and he was artistic.” Lincoln then stood up and walked to the window. On his face the same look appeared that Vinnie had seen so many times before. This time she knew what it meant. When Lincoln stared out the window, he saw the empty lawn where his son Willie had played. Vinnie bent quickly over her work, and Lincoln’s image began to appear in the clay.</p>
        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> Each day when she uncovered her sculpture, Vinnie’s satisfaction grew. She could see that she had perfected Lincoln’s features—the large nose, the bushy eyebrows, the sunken cheeks. Everything was right. The eyes were sad but determined. The expression was perfect. It was Abraham Lincoln—the gentleman, the father, the president.</p>
        <p><em><strong>14</strong></em> Finally, on April 13, 1865, nearly five months after she had started, Vinnie announced, “I believe I’m done.” It was a happy day, but a sad one, too. She knew her daily visits to Lincoln’s office would end.</p>
        <p><em><strong>15</strong></em> The next night, Abraham Lincoln was assassinated while attending a play at Ford’s Theater. Vinnie Ream was later chosen from among many fine sculptors to do a life-size statue of Lincoln. She used the sculpture of his head for the statue, which now stands in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C.</p>

          <strong>Emperors of the Antarctic</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Lynda Norwood</em>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1 </strong></em>A large male emperor penguin waddles slowly across the ice to the water. He dives deep into the chilly salt water and then springs back onto the ice. Nearby a female penguin sleeps as her baby rests on the tops of her feet. A group of smaller, younger penguins gather together in a circle to keep warm. The penguins are enjoying another beautiful day of sunshine and freezing temperatures in the Penguin Encounter, a special home built just for them in sunny California.</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="70%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dmgrgrhfu/image/upload/v1767442961/dswasn5jgz2diq7lmrrh.png" alt="ASS_Y4_EN_13_3">


        </p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em>&nbsp;The Penguin Encounter is located at Sea World in San Diego, California. It is the home of several hundred penguins. The Penguin Encounter was built to help study the emperor penguin, the largest of all penguins. The emperor penguin’s natural home is in the Antarctic, near the South Pole. Because of changes in the environment, scientists are concerned about the future of the emperor’s home. Increases in Earth’s temperatures, called global warming, could cause large amounts of &nbsp;ice to break up and float into the ocean. Scientists fear that this <span class="txt-underline"><strong>drastic</strong></span> change in the environment could destroy many of the emperor’s nesting areas. This would cause the number of emperor penguins to greatly decrease. A new home for them seemed to be the perfect answer.</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="71%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dmgrgrhfu/image/upload/v1767442960/qoocoqrdhdjcitu6tnmh.png" alt="ASS_Y4_EN_13_2">


        </p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong>&nbsp;</em>Scientists wanted to make the Penguin Encounter a comfortable home for the black-andwhite feathered birds. A team of scientists was sent to the Antarctic to learn more about the emperor penguin. Scientist Frank Todd led the team. Todd is an expert on birds, especially penguins. He has spent more than 25 years studying them.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> Getting close enough to the emperor penguins in the Antarctic wasn’t difficult for the group of scientists. The penguins were quite curious. Sometimes they would waddle close to Todd and his team. The scientists deduced that this behavior could be the result of poor eyesight. Penguins are nearsighted, which allows them to see better in the water than on land. Another possible reason for their behavior was that they had little to fear on the ice. Their enemies, such as leopard seals and killer whales, hunt mainly in the water.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> Todd and his team spent many months studying the diet and social habits of the emperor penguins. It was easy to get close to the penguins, but it wasn’t easy to study them in the Antarctic. The temperature rarely rises above zero degrees—perfect weather for penguins but not for scientists. Once Todd and his team had finally gathered enough information, they made plans for a new home in California for a number of emperor penguins. Scientists hoped to study the birds in conditions that were more scientist-friendly.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> To make this new home fit the needs of the penguins, scientists had to make a world much like the real Antarctic. First it had to be cold—very cold—just like the Antarctic. The penguins’ home was built inside a giant room that was kept as cold as a freezer. The room was filled with thousands of pounds of ice. Two saltwater pools were also included. Special lights were made to mimic the light conditions in the Antarctic. The lights were put on timers so that they grew brighter and then dimmer over the course of a day, just like the natural light in the Antarctic.</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="74%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dmgrgrhfu/image/upload/v1767442959/k4ezca2u9avkt5n4hecn.png" alt="ASS_Y4_EN_13_4">


        </p>
        <p><em><strong>7 </strong></em>When the “new Antarctic” was complete, Todd and his team brought several hundred emperor penguins to California from the Antarctic. To keep the penguins comfortable during the trip, the temperature in the plane’s cargo bay was kept below zero. Once in California, the penguins quickly adjusted to their new environment. It took no time at all before they were sliding headfirst across the ice into the pools of water.</p>
        <p><strong><em>8</em></strong> The penguins’ new home is now open to the public. Visitors can see the emperors in a setting much like their natural home. The Penguin Encounter is a great place to get a close look at some cool birds.</p>

          <strong>Emperors of the Antarctic</strong>

        <p><em><strong>1 </strong></em>A large male emperor penguin waddles slowly across the ice to the water. He dives deep into the chilly salt water and then springs back onto the ice. Nearby a female penguin sleeps as her baby rests on the tops of her feet. A group of smaller, younger penguins gather together in a circle to keep warm. The penguins are enjoying another beautiful day of sunshine and freezing temperatures in the Penguin Encounter, a special home built just for them in sunny California.</p>

        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em>&nbsp;The Penguin Encounter is located at Sea World in San Diego, California. It is the home of several hundred penguins. The Penguin Encounter was built to help study the emperor penguin, the largest of all penguins. The emperor penguin’s natural home is in the Antarctic, near the South Pole. Because of changes in the environment, scientists are concerned about the future of the emperor’s home. Increases in Earth’s temperatures, called global warming, could cause large amounts of &nbsp;ice to break up and float into the ocean. Scientists fear that this <span class="txt-underline"><strong>drastic</strong></span> change in the environment could destroy many of the emperor’s nesting areas. This would cause the number of emperor penguins to greatly decrease. A new home for them seemed to be the perfect answer.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong>&nbsp;</em>Scientists wanted to make the Penguin Encounter a comfortable home for the black-andwhite feathered birds. A team of scientists was sent to the Antarctic to learn more about the emperor penguin. Scientist Frank Todd led the team. Todd is an expert on birds, especially penguins. He has spent more than 25 years studying them.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> Getting close enough to the emperor penguins in the Antarctic wasn’t difficult for the group of scientists. The penguins were quite curious. Sometimes they would waddle close to Todd and his team. The scientists deduced that this behavior could be the result of poor eyesight. Penguins are nearsighted, which allows them to see better in the water than on land. Another possible reason for their behavior was that they had little to fear on the ice. Their enemies, such as leopard seals and killer whales, hunt mainly in the water.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> Todd and his team spent many months studying the diet and social habits of the emperor penguins. It was easy to get close to the penguins, but it wasn’t easy to study them in the Antarctic. The temperature rarely rises above zero degrees—perfect weather for penguins but not for scientists. Once Todd and his team had finally gathered enough information, they made plans for a new home in California for a number of emperor penguins. Scientists hoped to study the birds in conditions that were more scientist-friendly.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> To make this new home fit the needs of the penguins, scientists had to make a world much like the real Antarctic. First it had to be cold—very cold—just like the Antarctic. The penguins’ home was built inside a giant room that was kept as cold as a freezer. The room was filled with thousands of pounds of ice. Two saltwater pools were also included. Special lights were made to mimic the light conditions in the Antarctic. The lights were put on timers so that they grew brighter and then dimmer over the course of a day, just like the natural light in the Antarctic.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>7 </strong></em>When the “new Antarctic” was complete, Todd and his team brought several hundred emperor penguins to California from the Antarctic. To keep the penguins comfortable during the trip, the temperature in the plane’s cargo bay was kept below zero. Once in California, the penguins quickly adjusted to their new environment. It took no time at all before they were sliding headfirst across the ice into the pools of water.</p>
        <p><strong><em>8</em></strong> The penguins’ new home is now open to the public. Visitors can see the emperors in a setting much like their natural home. The Penguin Encounter is a great place to get a close look at some cool birds.</p>

        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em>&nbsp;The Penguin Encounter is located at Sea World in San Diego, California. It is the home of several hundred penguins. The Penguin Encounter was built to help study the emperor penguin, the largest of all penguins. The emperor penguin’s natural home is in the Antarctic, near the South Pole. Because of changes in the environment, scientists are concerned about the future of the emperor’s home. Increases in Earth’s temperatures, called global warming, could cause large amounts of &nbsp;ice to break up and float into the ocean. Scientists fear that this <span class="txt-underline"><strong>drastic</strong></span> change in the environment could destroy many of the emperor’s nesting areas. This would cause the number of emperor penguins to greatly decrease. A new home for them seemed to be the perfect answer.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong>&nbsp;</em>Scientists wanted to make the Penguin Encounter a comfortable home for the black-andwhite feathered birds. A team of scientists was sent to the Antarctic to learn more about the emperor penguin. Scientist Frank Todd led the team. Todd is an expert on birds, especially penguins. He has spent more than 25 years studying them.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> Getting close enough to the emperor penguins in the Antarctic wasn’t difficult for the group of scientists. The penguins were quite curious. Sometimes they would waddle close to Todd and his team. The scientists deduced that this behavior could be the result of poor eyesight. Penguins are nearsighted, which allows them to see better in the water than on land. Another possible reason for their behavior was that they had little to fear on the ice. Their enemies, such as leopard seals and killer whales, hunt mainly in the water.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> Todd and his team spent many months studying the diet and social habits of the emperor penguins. It was easy to get close to the penguins, but it wasn’t easy to study them in the Antarctic. The temperature rarely rises above zero degrees—perfect weather for penguins but not for scientists. Once Todd and his team had finally gathered enough information, they made plans for a new home in California for a number of emperor penguins. Scientists hoped to study the birds in conditions that were more scientist-friendly.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> To make this new home fit the needs of the penguins, scientists had to make a world much like the real Antarctic. First it had to be cold—very cold—just like the Antarctic. The penguins’ home was built inside a giant room that was kept as cold as a freezer. The room was filled with thousands of pounds of ice. Two saltwater pools were also included. Special lights were made to mimic the light conditions in the Antarctic. The lights were put on timers so that they grew brighter and then dimmer over the course of a day, just like the natural light in the Antarctic.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>7 </strong></em>When the “new Antarctic” was complete, Todd and his team brought several hundred emperor penguins to California from the Antarctic. To keep the penguins comfortable during the trip, the temperature in the plane’s cargo bay was kept below zero. Once in California, the penguins quickly adjusted to their new environment. It took no time at all before they were sliding headfirst across the ice into the pools of water.</p>
        <p><strong><em>8</em></strong> The penguins’ new home is now open to the public. Visitors can see the emperors in a setting much like their natural home. The Penguin Encounter is a great place to get a close look at some cool birds.</p>

Increases in Earth’s temperatures, called global warming, could cause large amounts of &nbsp;ice to break up and float into the ocean. Scientists fear that this <span class="txt-underline"><strong>drastic</strong></span> change in the environment could destroy many of the emperor’s nesting areas. This would cause the number of emperor penguins to greatly decrease. A new home for them seemed to be the perfect answer.</p>

        <p><em><strong>3</strong>&nbsp;</em>Scientists wanted to make the Penguin Encounter a comfortable home for the black-andwhite feathered birds. A team of scientists was sent to the Antarctic to learn more about the emperor penguin. Scientist Frank Todd led the team. Todd is an expert on birds, especially penguins. He has spent more than 25 years studying them.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> Getting close enough to the emperor penguins in the Antarctic wasn’t difficult for the group of scientists. The penguins were quite curious. Sometimes they would waddle close to Todd and his team. The scientists deduced that this behavior could be the result of poor eyesight. Penguins are nearsighted, which allows them to see better in the water than on land. Another possible reason for their behavior was that they had little to fear on the ice. Their enemies, such as leopard seals and killer whales, hunt mainly in the water.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> Todd and his team spent many months studying the diet and social habits of the emperor penguins. It was easy to get close to the penguins, but it wasn’t easy to study them in the Antarctic. The temperature rarely rises above zero degrees—perfect weather for penguins but not for scientists. Once Todd and his team had finally gathered enough information, they made plans for a new home in California for a number of emperor penguins. Scientists hoped to study the birds in conditions that were more scientist-friendly.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> To make this new home fit the needs of the penguins, scientists had to make a world much like the real Antarctic. First it had to be cold—very cold—just like the Antarctic. The penguins’ home was built inside a giant room that was kept as cold as a freezer. The room was filled with thousands of pounds of ice. Two saltwater pools were also included. Special lights were made to mimic the light conditions in the Antarctic. The lights were put on timers so that they grew brighter and then dimmer over the course of a day, just like the natural light in the Antarctic.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>7 </strong></em>When the “new Antarctic” was complete, Todd and his team brought several hundred emperor penguins to California from the Antarctic. To keep the penguins comfortable during the trip, the temperature in the plane’s cargo bay was kept below zero. Once in California, the penguins quickly adjusted to their new environment. It took no time at all before they were sliding headfirst across the ice into the pools of water.</p>
        <p><strong><em>8</em></strong> The penguins’ new home is now open to the public. Visitors can see the emperors in a setting much like their natural home. The Penguin Encounter is a great place to get a close look at some cool birds.</p>

          <strong>Emperors of the Antarctic</strong>

        <p><em><strong>1 </strong></em>A large male emperor penguin waddles slowly across the ice to the water. He dives deep into the chilly salt water and then springs back onto the ice. Nearby a female penguin sleeps as her baby rests on the tops of her feet. A group of smaller, younger penguins gather together in a circle to keep warm. The penguins are enjoying another beautiful day of sunshine and freezing temperatures in the Penguin Encounter, a special home built just for them in sunny California.</p>

        <p><em><strong>3</strong>&nbsp;</em>Scientists wanted to make the Penguin Encounter a comfortable home for the black-andwhite feathered birds. A team of scientists was sent to the Antarctic to learn more about the emperor penguin. Scientist Frank Todd led the team. Todd is an expert on birds, especially penguins. He has spent more than 25 years studying them.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> Getting close enough to the emperor penguins in the Antarctic wasn’t difficult for the group of scientists. The penguins were quite curious. Sometimes they would waddle close to Todd and his team. The scientists deduced that this behavior could be the result of poor eyesight. Penguins are nearsighted, which allows them to see better in the water than on land. Another possible reason for their behavior was that they had little to fear on the ice. Their enemies, such as leopard seals and killer whales, hunt mainly in the water.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> Todd and his team spent many months studying the diet and social habits of the emperor penguins. It was easy to get close to the penguins, but it wasn’t easy to study them in the Antarctic. The temperature rarely rises above zero degrees—perfect weather for penguins but not for scientists. Once Todd and his team had finally gathered enough information, they made plans for a new home in California for a number of emperor penguins. Scientists hoped to study the birds in conditions that were more scientist-friendly.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> To make this new home fit the needs of the penguins, scientists had to make a world much like the real Antarctic. First it had to be cold—very cold—just like the Antarctic. The penguins’ home was built inside a giant room that was kept as cold as a freezer. The room was filled with thousands of pounds of ice. Two saltwater pools were also included. Special lights were made to mimic the light conditions in the Antarctic. The lights were put on timers so that they grew brighter and then dimmer over the course of a day, just like the natural light in the Antarctic.</p>

        <p><em><strong>7 </strong></em>When the “new Antarctic” was complete, Todd and his team brought several hundred emperor penguins to California from the Antarctic. To keep the penguins comfortable during the trip, the temperature in the plane’s cargo bay was kept below zero. Once in California, the penguins quickly adjusted to their new environment. It took no time at all before they were sliding headfirst across the ice into the pools of water.</p>
        <p><strong><em>8</em></strong> The penguins’ new home is now open to the public. Visitors can see the emperors in a setting much like their natural home. The Penguin Encounter is a great place to get a close look at some cool birds.</p>

          <strong>Emperors of the Antarctic</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Lynda Norwood</em>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1 </strong></em>A large male emperor penguin waddles slowly across the ice to the water. He dives deep into the chilly salt water and then springs back onto the ice. Nearby a female penguin sleeps as her baby rests on the tops of her feet. A group of smaller, younger penguins gather together in a circle to keep warm. The penguins are enjoying another beautiful day of sunshine and freezing temperatures in the Penguin Encounter, a special home built just for them in sunny California.</p>

        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em>&nbsp;The Penguin Encounter is located at Sea World in San Diego, California. It is the home of several hundred penguins. The Penguin Encounter was built to help study the emperor penguin, the largest of all penguins. The emperor penguin’s natural home is in the Antarctic, near the South Pole. Because of changes in the environment, scientists are concerned about the future of the emperor’s home. Increases in Earth’s temperatures, called global warming, could cause large amounts of &nbsp;ice to break up and float into the ocean. Scientists fear that this <span class="txt-underline"><strong>drastic</strong></span> change in the environment could destroy many of the emperor’s nesting areas. This would cause the number of emperor penguins to greatly decrease. A new home for them seemed to be the perfect answer.</p>

          <strong>Fighting Fires</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Rosie lives in a small Texas town. Her town has no paid firefighters. Instead, the town has a volunteer fire department. The volunteers are a group of men and women who have learned how to fight fires and help out when needed.</em>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> When Rosie came home from school, she was greeted by the sight of her father in the kitchen. He hadn’t shaved. The corners of her mouth turned down.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> “How did the job hunting go today?” Rosie asked.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> “There’s nothing out there right now,” Dad answered.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> Three weeks ago the machine-repair shop where Rosie’s father had worked for years had closed down. At first her father had been optimistic that he could quickly find a new job. But the days had passed without any offers. Rosie’s mother had just taken a second job part-time to help support the family.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> “I’m just starting dinner,” Dad said. “You want to help?”</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “Sorry, I have homework,” Rosie said. She poured herself a glass of juice, went into her room, and shut the door.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> Rosie usually loved helping in the kitchen, but she didn’t want her father to see how worried she was. Rosie’s mother was doing O.K. for the family, but her second job was only temporary. It would last only until October. Rosie knew her father was looking everywhere for a job, but he just wasn’t having any luck. She didn’t know what would happen if he didn’t find a job. To top it all off, she had to deal with the kids at school. She didn’t want anyone feeling sorry for her.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> After Rosie had finished her homework, she started writing about the day’s events in her diary. At the top of the page, she wrote, “What will happen if Dad can’t find a job?” She was just beginning to write about her fears when she heard her father shout, “Rosie! I just heard on the CB radio that Mr. Becket’s barn is on fire, and Mike said it’s bad. You’re going to have to come with me. Get a jacket and shoes on while I leave a note for your mom.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> For as long as Rosie could remember, her father had been a member of the town’s volunteer fire brigade. In all those years he had never failed to respond to a call to fight a fire. Rosie couldn’t believe she was actually going to be at the fire with him and the other volunteers. Tossing her pen and journal onto her bed, Rosie quickly scrambled to put on warm clothes. She ran into the hall.</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> As Rosie and her father drove onto Mr. Becket’s land, she saw a reddish glow in the sky. They hopped out of their truck, and Dad threw on his firefighter’s jacket. Snapping the strap of his helmet under his chin, he rushed over to help aim the heavy hose of the town’s only fire truck. All 10 of the town’s volunteer firefighters were there. They shouted to one another as they ran back and forth, throwing buckets of water on the fire and beating out the flames that were trying to spring up outside the barn. Rosie had never seen a fire raging like this one. It was like a hungry monster with a thousand yellow arms. The arms kept grabbing at the wooden sides of the barn, the grass, and the black sky itself.</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> The smell of charred wood filled Rosie’s nostrils. She stood next to Mr. Becket and watched as her father helped control the water hose and keep it on the flames that shot out from the barn. Each time the firefighters managed to extinguish one part of the fire, it seemed to flare up even more brightly somewhere else. Rosie gasped as one wall of the barn fell, and flames came close to her father’s face. But he didn’t give up. He and the others held tight to the hose. One smoke-blackened hour blurred into the next until finally the last little flame was beaten out.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> Rosie wandered into the crowd to find her father. She spotted him quickly. He was pulling off his soot-stained jacket. When he saw her, he put his arm around her shoulders and said, “Come on. The Hemingways down the road have food for us. Let’s go eat.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> The Hemingways were Mr. Becket’s nearest neighbors. They had made several pots of coffee and laid out platters of meat and cheese for the firefighters to make sandwiches. Rosie was tired and didn’t think she was hungry, but her stomach growled when she saw the food. She stood close to her father and chewed her sandwich as she listened to the conversation.</p>
        <p><em><strong>14</strong></em> Finally Dad said, “Time to go, Rosie. It’s almost one in the morning. Your mother will be waiting up for us.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>15</strong></em> Rosie couldn’t believe how much time had passed. All her earlier exhaustion had dropped away as she stood in the circle of brave firefighters. She listened as her father and the others shared memories of other fires they had handled over the years. She hadn’t realized how many emergencies her father had responded to.</p>
        <p><em><strong>16</strong></em> Rosie and Dad sat quietly as they drove down the winding roads that took them back home. Dad finally broke the silence. “Everything’s going to be fine, Rosie. I’ll get another job. It’s just a matter of time.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>17</strong></em> Back home Rosie saw her diary lying on her bed. She picked up her pen to finish writing what she had started earlier. But she wrote nothing. What she had planned to write didn’t seem quite right anymore.</p>
        <p><em><strong>18</strong></em> As she sat there staring at the page, her mind raced with images of her father fighting the fire. She thought about the words her father had said to her on their ride home. She closed her diary, put on her pajamas, and climbed into bed.</p>

          <strong>Fighting Fires</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Rosie lives in a small Texas town. Her town has no paid firefighters. Instead, the town has a volunteer fire department. The volunteers are a group of men and women who have learned how to fight fires and help out when needed.</em>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> When Rosie came home from school, she was greeted by the sight of her father in the kitchen. He hadn’t shaved. The corners of her mouth turned down.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> “How did the job hunting go today?” Rosie asked.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> “There’s nothing out there right now,” Dad answered.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> Three weeks ago the machine-repair shop where Rosie’s father had worked for years had closed down. At first her father had been optimistic that he could quickly find a new job. But the days had passed without any offers. Rosie’s mother had just taken a second job part-time to help support the family.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> “I’m just starting dinner,” Dad said. “You want to help?”</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “Sorry, I have homework,” Rosie said. She poured herself a glass of juice, went into her room, and shut the door.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> Rosie usually loved helping in the kitchen, but she didn’t want her father to see how worried she was. Rosie’s mother was doing O.K. for the family, but her second job was only temporary. It would last only until October. Rosie knew her father was looking everywhere for a job, but he just wasn’t having any luck. She didn’t know what would happen if he didn’t find a job. To top it all off, she had to deal with the kids at school. She didn’t want anyone feeling sorry for her.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> After Rosie had finished her homework, she started writing about the day’s events in her diary. At the top of the page, she wrote, “What will happen if Dad can’t find a job?” She was just beginning to write about her fears when she heard her father shout, “Rosie! I just heard on the CB radio that Mr. Becket’s barn is on fire, and Mike said it’s bad. You’re going to have to come with me. Get a jacket and shoes on while I leave a note for your mom.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> For as long as Rosie could remember, her father had been a member of the town’s volunteer fire brigade. In all those years he had never failed to respond to a call to fight a fire. Rosie couldn’t believe she was actually going to be at the fire with him and the other volunteers. Tossing her pen and journal onto her bed, Rosie quickly scrambled to put on warm clothes. She ran into the hall.</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> As Rosie and her father drove onto Mr. Becket’s land, she saw a reddish glow in the sky. They hopped out of their truck, and Dad threw on his firefighter’s jacket. Snapping the strap of his helmet under his chin, he rushed over to help aim the heavy hose of the town’s only fire truck. All 10 of the town’s volunteer firefighters were there. They shouted to one another as they ran back and forth, throwing buckets of water on the fire and beating out the flames that were trying to spring up outside the barn. Rosie had never seen a fire raging like this one. It was like a hungry monster with a thousand yellow arms. The arms kept grabbing at the wooden sides of the barn, the grass, and the black sky itself.</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> The smell of charred wood filled Rosie’s nostrils. She stood next to Mr. Becket and watched as her father helped control the water hose and keep it on the flames that shot out from the barn. Each time the firefighters managed to extinguish one part of the fire, it seemed to flare up even more brightly somewhere else. Rosie gasped as one wall of the barn fell, and flames came close to her father’s face. But he didn’t give up. He and the others held tight to the hose. One smoke-blackened hour blurred into the next until finally the last little flame was beaten out.</p>

        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> Rosie wandered into the crowd to find her father. She spotted him quickly. He was pulling off his soot-stained jacket. When he saw her, he put his arm around her shoulders and said, “Come on. The Hemingways down the road have food for us. Let’s go eat.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> The Hemingways were Mr. Becket’s nearest neighbors.

Rosie knew her father was looking everywhere for a job, but he just wasn’t having any luck. She didn’t know what would happen if he didn’t find a job. To top it all off, she had to deal with the kids at school. She didn’t want anyone feeling sorry for her.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> After Rosie had finished her homework, she started writing about the day’s events in her diary. At the top of the page, she wrote, “What will happen if Dad can’t find a job?” She was just beginning to write about her fears when she heard her father shout, “Rosie! I just heard on the CB radio that Mr. Becket’s barn is on fire, and Mike said it’s bad. You’re going to have to come with me. Get a jacket and shoes on while I leave a note for your mom.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> For as long as Rosie could remember, her father had been a member of the town’s volunteer fire brigade. In all those years he had never failed to respond to a call to fight a fire. Rosie couldn’t believe she was actually going to be at the fire with him and the other volunteers. Tossing her pen and journal onto her bed, Rosie quickly scrambled to put on warm clothes. She ran into the hall.</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> As Rosie and her father drove onto Mr. Becket’s land, she saw a reddish glow in the sky. They hopped out of their truck, and Dad threw on his firefighter’s jacket. Snapping the strap of his helmet under his chin, he rushed over to help aim the heavy hose of the town’s only fire truck. All 10 of the town’s volunteer firefighters were there. They shouted to one another as they ran back and forth, throwing buckets of water on the fire and beating out the flames that were trying to spring up outside the barn. Rosie had never seen a fire raging like this one. It was like a hungry monster with a thousand yellow arms. The arms kept grabbing at the wooden sides of the barn, the grass, and the black sky itself.</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> The smell of charred wood filled Rosie’s nostrils. She stood next to Mr. Becket and watched as her father helped control the water hose and keep it on the flames that shot out from the barn. Each time the firefighters managed to extinguish one part of the fire, it seemed to flare up even more brightly somewhere else. Rosie gasped as one wall of the barn fell, and flames came close to her father’s face. But he didn’t give up. He and the others held tight to the hose. One smoke-blackened hour blurred into the next until finally the last little flame was beaten out.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> Rosie wandered into the crowd to find her father. She spotted him quickly. He was pulling off his soot-stained jacket. When he saw her, he put his arm around her shoulders and said, “Come on. The Hemingways down the road have food for us. Let’s go eat.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> The Hemingways were Mr. Becket’s nearest neighbors. They had made several pots of coffee and laid out platters of meat and cheese for the firefighters to make sandwiches. Rosie was tired and didn’t think she was hungry, but her stomach growled when she saw the food. She stood close to her father and chewed her sandwich as she listened to the conversation.</p>
        <p><em><strong>14</strong></em> Finally Dad said, “Time to go, Rosie. It’s almost one in the morning. Your mother will be waiting up for us.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>15</strong></em> Rosie couldn’t believe how much time had passed. All her earlier exhaustion had dropped away as she stood in the circle of brave firefighters. She listened as her father and the others shared memories of other fires they had handled over the years. She hadn’t realized how many emergencies her father had responded to.</p>
        <p><em><strong>16</strong></em> Rosie and Dad sat quietly as they drove down the winding roads that took them back home. Dad finally broke the silence. “Everything’s going to be fine, Rosie. I’ll get another job. It’s just a matter of time.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>17</strong></em> Back home Rosie saw her diary lying on her bed. She picked up her pen to finish writing what she had started earlier. But she wrote nothing. What she had planned to write didn’t seem quite right anymore.</p>
        <p><em><strong>18</strong></em> As she sat there staring at the page, her mind raced with images of her father fighting the fire. She thought about the words her father had said to her on their ride home. She closed her diary, put on her pajamas, and climbed into bed.</p>

          <strong>Fighting Fires</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Rosie lives in a small Texas town. Her town has no paid firefighters. Instead, the town has a volunteer fire department. The volunteers are a group of men and women who have learned how to fight fires and help out when needed.</em>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> When Rosie came home from school, she was greeted by the sight of her father in the kitchen. He hadn’t shaved. The corners of her mouth turned down.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> “How did the job hunting go today?” Rosie asked.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> “There’s nothing out there right now,” Dad answered.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> Three weeks ago the machine-repair shop where Rosie’s father had worked for years had closed down. At first her father had been optimistic that he could quickly find a new job. But the days had passed without any offers. Rosie’s mother had just taken a second job part-time to help support the family.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> “I’m just starting dinner,” Dad said. “You want to help?”</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “Sorry, I have homework,” Rosie said. She poured herself a glass of juice, went into her room, and shut the door.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> Rosie usually loved helping in the kitchen, but she didn’t want her father to see how worried she was. Rosie’s mother was doing O.K. for the family, but her second job was only temporary. It would last only until October. Rosie knew her father was looking everywhere for a job, but he just wasn’t having any luck. She didn’t know what would happen if he didn’t find a job. To top it all off, she had to deal with the kids at school. She didn’t want anyone feeling sorry for her.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> After Rosie had finished her homework, she started writing about the day’s events in her diary. At the top of the page, she wrote, “What will happen if Dad can’t find a job?” She was just beginning to write about her fears when she heard her father shout, “Rosie! I just heard on the CB radio that Mr. Becket’s barn is on fire, and Mike said it’s bad. You’re going to have to come with me. Get a jacket and shoes on while I leave a note for your mom.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> For as long as Rosie could remember, her father had been a member of the town’s volunteer fire brigade. In all those years he had never failed to respond to a call to fight a fire. Rosie couldn’t believe she was actually going to be at the fire with him and the other volunteers. Tossing her pen and journal onto her bed, Rosie quickly scrambled to put on warm clothes. She ran into the hall.</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> As Rosie and her father drove onto Mr. Becket’s land, she saw a reddish glow in the sky. They hopped out of their truck, and Dad threw on his firefighter’s jacket. Snapping the strap of his helmet under his chin, he rushed over to help aim the heavy hose of the town’s only fire truck. All 10 of the town’s volunteer firefighters were there. They shouted to one another as they ran back and forth, throwing buckets of water on the fire and beating out the flames that were trying to spring up outside the barn. Rosie had never seen a fire raging like this one. It was like a hungry monster with a thousand yellow arms. The arms kept grabbing at the wooden sides of the barn, the grass, and the black sky itself.</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> The smell of charred wood filled Rosie’s nostrils. She stood next to Mr. Becket and watched as her father helped control the water hose and keep it on the flames that shot out from the barn. Each time the firefighters managed to extinguish one part of the fire, it seemed to flare up even more brightly somewhere else. Rosie gasped as one wall of the barn fell, and flames came close to her father’s face. But he didn’t give up. He and the others held tight to the hose. One smoke-blackened hour blurred into the next until finally the last little flame was beaten out.</p>

        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> When Rosie came home from school, she was greeted by the sight of her father in the kitchen. He hadn’t shaved. The corners of her mouth turned down.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> “How did the job hunting go today?” Rosie asked.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> “There’s nothing out there right now,” Dad answered.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> Three weeks ago the machine-repair shop where Rosie’s father had worked for years had closed down. At first her father had been optimistic that he could quickly find a new job. But the days had passed without any offers. Rosie’s mother had just taken a second job part-time to help support the family.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> “I’m just starting dinner,” Dad said. “You want to help?”</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “Sorry, I have homework,” Rosie said. She poured herself a glass of juice, went into her room, and shut the door.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> Rosie usually loved helping in the kitchen, but she didn’t want her father to see how worried she was. Rosie’s mother was doing O.K. for the family, but her second job was only temporary. It would last only until October. Rosie knew her father was looking everywhere for a job, but he just wasn’t having any luck. She didn’t know what would happen if he didn’t find a job. To top it all off, she had to deal with the kids at school. She didn’t want anyone feeling sorry for her.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> After Rosie had finished her homework, she started writing about the day’s events in her diary. At the top of the page, she wrote, “What will happen if Dad can’t find a job?” She was just beginning to write about her fears when she heard her father shout, “Rosie! I just heard on the CB radio that Mr. Becket’s barn is on fire, and Mike said it’s bad. You’re going to have to come with me. Get a jacket and shoes on while I leave a note for your mom.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> For as long as Rosie could remember, her father had been a member of the town’s volunteer fire brigade. In all those years he had never failed to respond to a call to fight a fire. Rosie couldn’t believe she was actually going to be at the fire with him and the other volunteers. Tossing her pen and journal onto her bed, Rosie quickly scrambled to put on warm clothes. She ran into the hall.</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> As Rosie and her father drove onto Mr. Becket’s land, she saw a reddish glow in the sky. They hopped out of their truck, and Dad threw on his firefighter’s jacket. Snapping the strap of his helmet under his chin, he rushed over to help aim the heavy hose of the town’s only fire truck. All 10 of the town’s volunteer firefighters were there. They shouted to one another as they ran back and forth, throwing buckets of water on the fire and beating out the flames that were trying to spring up outside the barn. Rosie had never seen a fire raging like this one. It was like a hungry monster with a thousand yellow arms. The arms kept grabbing at the wooden sides of the barn, the grass, and the black sky itself.</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> The smell of charred wood filled Rosie’s nostrils. She stood next to Mr. Becket and watched as her father helped control the water hose and keep it on the flames that shot out from the barn. Each time the firefighters managed to extinguish one part of the fire, it seemed to flare up even more brightly somewhere else. Rosie gasped as one wall of the barn fell, and flames came close to her father’s face. But he didn’t give up. He and the others held tight to the hose. One smoke-blackened hour blurred into the next until finally the last little flame was beaten out.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> Rosie wandered into the crowd to find her father. She spotted him quickly. He was pulling off his soot-stained jacket. When he saw her, he put his arm around her shoulders and said, “Come on. The Hemingways down the road have food for us. Let’s go eat.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> The Hemingways were Mr. Becket’s nearest neighbors. They had made several pots of coffee and laid out platters of meat and cheese for the firefighters to make sandwiches. Rosie was tired and didn’t think she was hungry, but her stomach growled when she saw the food. She stood close to her father and chewed her sandwich as she listened to the conversation.</p>
        <p><em><strong>14</strong></em> Finally Dad said, “Time to go, Rosie. It’s almost one in the morning. Your mother will be waiting up for us.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>15</strong></em> Rosie couldn’t believe how much time had passed. All her earlier exhaustion had dropped away as she stood in the circle of brave firefighters. She listened as her father and the others shared memories of other fires they had handled over the years. She hadn’t realized how many emergencies her father had responded to.</p>
        <p><em><strong>16</strong></em> Rosie and Dad sat quietly as they drove down the winding roads that took them back home. Dad finally broke the silence. “Everything’s going to be fine, Rosie. I’ll get another job. It’s just a matter of time.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>17</strong></em> Back home Rosie saw her diary lying on her bed. She picked up her pen to finish writing what she had started earlier. But she wrote nothing. What she had planned to write didn’t seem quite right anymore.</p>
        <p><em><strong>18</strong></em> As she sat there staring at the page, her mind raced with images of her father fighting the fire. She thought about the words her father had said to her on their ride home. She closed her diary, put on her pajamas, and climbed into bed.</p>

          <strong>Fighting Fires</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Rosie lives in a small Texas town. Her town has no paid firefighters. Instead, the town has a volunteer fire department. The volunteers are a group of men and women who have learned how to fight fires and help out when needed.</em>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> When Rosie came home from school, she was greeted by the sight of her father in the kitchen. He hadn’t shaved. The corners of her mouth turned down.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> “How did the job hunting go today?” Rosie asked.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> “There’s nothing out there right now,” Dad answered.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> Three weeks ago the machine-repair shop where Rosie’s father had worked for years had closed down. At first her father had been optimistic that he could quickly find a new job. But the days had passed without any offers. Rosie’s mother had just taken a second job part-time to help support the family.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> “I’m just starting dinner,” Dad said. “You want to help?”</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “Sorry, I have homework,” Rosie said. She poured herself a glass of juice, went into her room, and shut the door.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> Rosie usually loved helping in the kitchen, but she didn’t want her father to see how worried she was. Rosie’s mother was doing O.K. for the family, but her second job was only temporary. It would last only until October. Rosie knew her father was looking everywhere for a job, but he just wasn’t having any luck. She didn’t know what would happen if he didn’t find a job. To top it all off, she had to deal with the kids at school. She didn’t want anyone feeling sorry for her.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> After Rosie had finished her homework, she started writing about the day’s events in her diary. At the top of the page, she wrote, “What will happen if Dad can’t find a job?” She was just beginning to write about her fears when she heard her father shout, “Rosie! I just heard on the CB radio that Mr. Becket’s barn is on fire, and Mike said it’s bad. You’re going to have to come with me. Get a jacket and shoes on while I leave a note for your mom.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> For as long as Rosie could remember, her father had been a member of the town’s volunteer fire brigade. In all those years he had never failed to respond to a call to fight a fire. Rosie couldn’t believe she was actually going to be at the fire with him and the other volunteers. Tossing her pen and journal onto her bed, Rosie quickly scrambled to put on warm clothes. She ran into the hall.</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> As Rosie and her father drove onto Mr. Becket’s land, she saw a reddish glow in the sky. They hopped out of their truck, and Dad threw on his firefighter’s jacket. Snapping the strap of his helmet under his chin, he rushed over to help aim the heavy hose of the town’s only fire truck. All 10 of the town’s volunteer firefighters were there. They shouted to one another as they ran back and forth, throwing buckets of water on the fire and beating out the flames that were trying to spring up outside the barn. Rosie had never seen a fire raging like this one. It was like a hungry monster with a thousand yellow arms. The arms kept grabbing at the wooden sides of the barn, the grass, and the black sky itself.</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> The smell of charred wood filled Rosie’s nostrils. She stood next to Mr. Becket and watched as her father helped control the water hose and keep it on the flames that shot out from the barn. Each time the firefighters managed to extinguish one part of the fire, it seemed to flare up even more brightly somewhere else. Rosie gasped as one wall of the barn fell, and flames came close to her father’s face. But he didn’t give up. He and the others held tight to the hose. One smoke-blackened hour blurred into the next until finally the last little flame was beaten out.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> Rosie wandered into the crowd to find her father. She spotted him quickly. He was pulling off his soot-stained jacket. When he saw her, he put his arm around her shoulders and said, “Come on. The Hemingways down the road have food for us. Let’s go eat.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> The Hemingways were Mr. Becket’s nearest neighbors. They had made several pots of coffee and laid out platters of meat and cheese for the firefighters to make sandwiches. Rosie was tired and didn’t think she was hungry, but her stomach growled when she saw the food. She stood close to her father and chewed her sandwich as she listened to the conversation.</p>
        <p><em><strong>14</strong></em> Finally Dad said, “Time to go, Rosie. It’s almost one in the morning. Your mother will be waiting up for us.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>15</strong></em> Rosie couldn’t believe how much time had passed. All her earlier exhaustion had dropped away as she stood in the circle of brave firefighters. She listened as her father and the others shared memories of other fires they had handled over the years. She hadn’t realized how many emergencies her father had responded to.</p>
        <p><em><strong>16</strong></em> Rosie and Dad sat quietly as they drove down the winding roads that took them back home. Dad finally broke the silence. “Everything’s going to be fine, Rosie. I’ll get another job. It’s just a matter of time.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>17</strong></em> Back home Rosie saw her diary lying on her bed. She picked up her pen to finish writing what she had started earlier. But she wrote nothing. What she had planned to write didn’t seem quite right anymore.</p>
        <p><em><strong>18</strong></em> As she sat there staring at the page, her mind raced with images of her father fighting the fire. She thought about the words her father had said to her on their ride home. She closed her diary, put on her pajamas, and climbed into bed.</p>

          <strong>Fighting Fires</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Rosie lives in a small Texas town. Her town has no paid firefighters. Instead, the town has a volunteer fire department. The volunteers are a group of men and women who have learned how to fight fires and help out when needed.</em>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> When Rosie came home from school, she was greeted by the sight of her father in the kitchen. He hadn’t shaved. The corners of her mouth turned down.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> “How did the job hunting go today?” Rosie asked.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> “There’s nothing out there right now,” Dad answered.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> Three weeks ago the machine-repair shop where Rosie’s father had worked for years had closed down. At first her father had been optimistic that he could quickly find a new job. But the days had passed without any offers. Rosie’s mother had just taken a second job part-time to help support the family.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> “I’m just starting dinner,” Dad said. “You want to help?”</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> “Sorry, I have homework,” Rosie said. She poured herself a glass of juice, went into her room, and shut the door.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> Rosie usually loved helping in the kitchen, but she didn’t want her father to see how worried she was. Rosie’s mother was doing O.K. for the family, but her second job was only temporary. It would last only until October. Rosie knew her father was looking everywhere for a job, but he just wasn’t having any luck. She didn’t know what would happen if he didn’t find a job. To top it all off, she had to deal with the kids at school. She didn’t want anyone feeling sorry for her.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> After Rosie had finished her homework, she started writing about the day’s events in her diary. At the top of the page, she wrote, “What will happen if Dad can’t find a job?” She was just beginning to write about her fears when she heard her father shout, “Rosie! I just heard on the CB radio that Mr. Becket’s barn is on fire, and Mike said it’s bad. You’re going to have to come with me. Get a jacket and shoes on while I leave a note for your mom.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> For as long as Rosie could remember, her father had been a member of the town’s volunteer fire brigade. In all those years he had never failed to respond to a call to fight a fire. Rosie couldn’t believe she was actually going to be at the fire with him and the other volunteers. Tossing her pen and journal onto her bed, Rosie quickly scrambled to put on warm clothes. She ran into the hall.</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> As Rosie and her father drove onto Mr. Becket’s land, she saw a reddish glow in the sky. They hopped out of their truck, and Dad threw on his firefighter’s jacket. Snapping the strap of his helmet under his chin, he rushed over to help aim the heavy hose of the town’s only fire truck. All 10 of the town’s volunteer firefighters were there. They shouted to one another as they ran back and forth, throwing buckets of water on the fire and beating out the flames that were trying to spring up outside the barn. Rosie had never seen a fire raging like this one. It was like a hungry monster with a thousand yellow arms. The arms kept grabbing at the wooden sides of the barn, the grass, and the black sky itself.</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> The smell of charred wood filled Rosie’s nostrils. She stood next to Mr. Becket and watched as her father helped control the water hose and keep it on the flames that shot out from the barn. Each time the firefighters managed to extinguish one part of the fire, it seemed to flare up even more brightly somewhere else. Rosie gasped as one wall of the barn fell, and flames came close to her father’s face. But he didn’t give up. He and the others held tight to the hose. One smoke-blackened hour blurred into the next until finally the last little flame was beaten out.</p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> Rosie wandered into the crowd to find her father. She spotted him quickly. He was pulling off his soot-stained jacket. When he saw her, he put his arm around her shoulders and said, “Come on. The Hemingways down the road have food for us. Let’s go eat.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> The Hemingways were Mr. Becket’s nearest neighbors. They had made several pots of coffee and laid out platters of meat and cheese for the firefighters to make sandwiches. Rosie was tired and didn’t think she was hungry, but her stomach growled when she saw the food. She stood close to her father and chewed her sandwich as she listened to the conversation.</p>
        <p><em><strong>14</strong></em> Finally Dad said, “Time to go, Rosie. It’s almost one in the morning. Your mother will be waiting up for us.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>15</strong></em> Rosie couldn’t believe how much time had passed. All her earlier exhaustion had dropped away as she stood in the circle of brave firefighters. She listened as her father and the others shared memories of other fires they had handled over the years. She hadn’t realized how many emergencies her father had responded to.</p>
        <p><em><strong>16</strong></em> Rosie and Dad sat quietly as they drove down the winding roads that took them back home. Dad finally broke the silence. “Everything’s going to be fine, Rosie. I’ll get another job. It’s just a matter of time.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>17</strong></em> Back home Rosie saw her diary lying on her bed. She picked up her pen to finish writing what she had started earlier. But she wrote nothing. What she had planned to write didn’t seem quite right anymore.</p>
        <p><em><strong>18</strong></em> As she sat there staring at the page, her mind raced with images of her father fighting the fire. She thought about the words her father had said to her on their ride home. She closed her diary, put on her pajamas, and climbed into bed.</p>

          <strong>A Personal Achievement</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> “You’re next, Carl,” Mrs. Sosa said. Carl walked nervously to the stage. Why had he let his friend Neil talk him into trying out for the play? He hated standing in front of people.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> He had spent the weekend memorizing lines, but he knew he wouldn’t get the part. It was a small part anyway, not like the lead role he just knew Neil would get. Neil had already finished his audition. As always he had done well even though he hadn’t practiced at all.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> “You’re trying out for a guard?” Mrs. Sosa asked. “I’ll read the queen’s lines. Begin when you’re ready.”</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="86%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/db0yrhgnb/image/upload/v1767493352/vmwr8gkpuppzozyvcebr.png" alt="ASS_Y4_EN_32">


        </p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> Carl took a deep breath and tried to picture himself as a guard, just as his mother had suggested when she helped him practice. “Your majesty,” Carl began uncertainly, “the castle is under siege.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> “Call my knights!” Mrs. Sosa responded as the queen, sounding like Carl’s mother had. He almost smiled. At first he felt silly in front of the other students, but as he concentrated on his lines, he forgot about the people watching. It was as if he had really become a guard in a queen’s service!</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> After Carl finished, he walked over to Neil. As soon as Carl sat down, Neil asked, “Do you think I got the part of the knight?”</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> “I’m sure you did,” Carl mumbled. Sometimes he thought Neil just liked hearing how great he was. “It’s not like he doesn’t &nbsp;already hear what a great basketball player he is,” Carl thought. Neil was confident and talented. He seemed to succeed at everything without even trying, while Carl struggled just to be average.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “You should have made your voice sound like that actor in The Bank Caper,” Neil said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> “I had enough trouble just remembering my lines,” Carl said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> The next afternoon Carl went to Mrs. Sosa’s room to see who had been given the part of the guard. His name wasn’t listed. “Figures,” he muttered.</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> Mrs. Sosa walked up to Carl and said, “Rehearsals start tomorrow. There’s a lot of work to do.” Seeing Carl’s puzzled face, she said, “Oh, you haven’t heard.” She pointed to the top of the list. “You’re playing Sir Trawood. You had the best tryout of anyone, Carl.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> Carl was stunned. “But what about Neil?”</p>
        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> Mrs. Sosa sighed. “Neil was offered a smaller part, but he <span class="txt-underline"><strong>rejected</strong></span> it.”</p>
        <p><strong><em>14</em></strong> “He did?” Carl’s eyes widened. “But I can’t be in the play without Neil,” he said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>15</strong></em> Mrs. Sosa frowned. “But, Carl, you’re the best actor for this part.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>16</strong></em> Neil called Carl that night and said, “I guess you’re happy to get the best part. I have to admit I’m jealous.” Carl was silent. He couldn’t believe that Neil would be jealous of him .</p>

          <strong>A Personal Achievement</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> “You’re next, Carl,” Mrs. Sosa said. Carl walked nervously to the stage. Why had he let his friend Neil talk him into trying out for the play? He hated standing in front of people.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> He had spent the weekend memorizing lines, but he knew he wouldn’t get the part. It was a small part anyway, not like the lead role he just knew Neil would get. Neil had already finished his audition. As always he had done well even though he hadn’t practiced at all.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> “You’re trying out for a guard?” Mrs. Sosa asked. “I’ll read the queen’s lines. Begin when you’re ready.”</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> Carl took a deep breath and tried to picture himself as a guard, just as his mother had suggested when she helped him practice. “Your majesty,” Carl began uncertainly, “the castle is under siege.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> “Call my knights!” Mrs. Sosa responded as the queen, sounding like Carl’s mother had. He almost smiled. At first he felt silly in front of the other students, but as he concentrated on his lines, he forgot about the people watching. It was as if he had really become a guard in a queen’s service!</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> After Carl finished, he walked over to Neil. As soon as Carl sat down, Neil asked, “Do you think I got the part of the knight?”</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> “I’m sure you did,” Carl mumbled. Sometimes he thought Neil just liked hearing how great he was. “It’s not like he doesn’t &nbsp;already hear what a great basketball player he is,” Carl thought. Neil was confident and talented. He seemed to succeed at everything without even trying, while Carl struggled just to be average.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “You should have made your voice sound like that actor in The Bank Caper,” Neil said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> “I had enough trouble just remembering my lines,” Carl said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> The next afternoon Carl went to Mrs. Sosa’s room to see who had been given the part of the guard. His name wasn’t listed. “Figures,” he muttered.</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> Mrs. Sosa walked up to Carl and said, “Rehearsals start tomorrow. There’s a lot of work to do.” Seeing Carl’s puzzled face, she said, “Oh, you haven’t heard.” She pointed to the top of the list. “You’re playing Sir Trawood. You had the best tryout of anyone, Carl.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> Carl was stunned. “But what about Neil?”</p>
        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> Mrs. Sosa sighed. “Neil was offered a smaller part, but he <span class="txt-underline"><strong>rejected</strong></span> it.”</p>
        <p><strong><em>14</em></strong> “He did?” Carl’s eyes widened. “But I can’t be in the play without Neil,” he said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>15</strong></em> Mrs. Sosa frowned. “But, Carl, you’re the best actor for this part.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>16</strong></em> Neil called Carl that night and said, “I guess you’re happy to get the best part. I have to admit I’m jealous.” Carl was silent. He couldn’t believe that Neil would be jealous of him .</p>

          <strong>Star of the Show</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> “Begin when you’re ready, Neil,” Mrs. Sosa said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em>&nbsp;Neil started to speak. “Humph,” he coughed, trying to stall. He had looked at the script that morning, but now his mind was blank. Maybe he could <span class="txt-underline"><strong>improvise</strong></span>—make up his own words now and memorize his lines after he got the part. Then luckily he remembered. “Knights of the Royal Order,” he hissed, trying to sound like his favorite actor, “this means war!”</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em>&nbsp;He saw Mrs. Sosa raise her eyebrows. He could tell she was impressed. He stumbled over his words a couple more times, but he still felt confident when he had finished. He couldn’t wait to star in a real play. Most days he imagined himself as a basketball star, but sometimes he thought he would like to star in the movies. “Maybe I’ll be an actor after I retire from basketball,” he thought.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em>&nbsp;His friend Carl was next. Neil felt sorry for him. Carl looked terrified. When he started talking, he sounded as if he had swallowed a frog. Carl remembered all his lines, but he didn’t act very well. He just used his regular voice.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em>&nbsp;When Carl returned, Neil noticed that he was sullen. “Do you think I got the part of the knight?” he asked his friend, hoping to take Carl’s mind off his own tryout. “Maybe I’ll ask Mrs. Sosa to give Carl another chance,” Neil thought.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em>&nbsp;After basketball practice the next day, Neil rushed to Mrs. Sosa’s room to see who else was in the play. He noticed right away that Carl hadn’t gotten the part of the guard. Then Neil gasped. Carl had gotten the part of Sir Trawood! There had to be some mistake.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> “I’m afraid you didn’t get the part you wanted, Neil,” Mrs. Sosa said. “You’ll be playing the part of a messenger.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “But Carl didn’t even try out for Sir Trawood,” Neil protested.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em>&nbsp;Mrs. Sosa nodded. “Yes, but I think he’ll make an excellent knight.”</p>

          <strong>Star of the Show</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> “Begin when you’re ready, Neil,” Mrs. Sosa said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em>&nbsp;Neil started to speak. “Humph,” he coughed, trying to stall. He had looked at the script that morning, but now his mind was blank. Maybe he could <span class="txt-underline"><strong>improvise</strong></span>—make up his own words now and memorize his lines after he got the part. Then luckily he remembered. “Knights of the Royal Order,” he hissed, trying to sound like his favorite actor, “this means war!”</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em>&nbsp;He saw Mrs. Sosa raise her eyebrows. He could tell she was impressed. He stumbled over his words a couple more times, but he still felt confident when he had finished. He couldn’t wait to star in a real play. Most days he imagined himself as a basketball star, but sometimes he thought he would like to star in the movies. “Maybe I’ll be an actor after I retire from basketball,” he thought.</p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em>&nbsp;His friend Carl was next. Neil felt sorry for him. Carl looked terrified. When he started talking, he sounded as if he had swallowed a frog. Carl remembered all his lines, but he didn’t act very well. He just used his regular voice.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em>&nbsp;When Carl returned, Neil noticed that he was sullen. “Do you think I got the part of the knight?” he asked his friend, hoping to take Carl’s mind off his own tryout. “Maybe I’ll ask Mrs. Sosa to give Carl another chance,” Neil thought.</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em>&nbsp;After basketball practice the next day, Neil rushed to Mrs. Sosa’s room to see who else was in the play. He noticed right away that Carl hadn’t gotten the part of the guard. Then Neil gasped. Carl had gotten the part of Sir Trawood! There had to be some mistake.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> “I’m afraid you didn’t get the part you wanted, Neil,” Mrs. Sosa said. “You’ll be playing the part of a messenger.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “But Carl didn’t even try out for Sir Trawood,” Neil protested.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em>&nbsp;Mrs. Sosa nodded. “Yes, but I think he’ll make an excellent knight.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> “He didn’t even sound like an actor,” Neil complained.</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em>&nbsp;“That’s why he did so well,” Mrs. Sosa said. “You’ll see what I mean at practice tomorrow.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em>&nbsp;“No, I won’t,” Neil said. “I’m not going to be some stupid messenger.” He stormed out. As he walked home, he kept thinking it wasn’t fair. Carl probably wouldn’t even have tried out for the play if Neil hadn’t insisted. He felt angry that Carl would be in the play without him. “But I guess I should congratulate him,” he thought. “After all, I’m the school’s star basketball player, and Carl didn’t even make the team.”</p>

          <strong>A Personal Achievement</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> “You’re next, Carl,” Mrs. Sosa said. Carl walked nervously to the stage. Why had he let his friend Neil talk him into trying out for the play? He hated standing in front of people.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> He had spent the weekend memorizing lines, but he knew he wouldn’t get the part. It was a small part anyway, not like the lead role he just knew Neil would get. Neil had already finished his audition. As always he had done well even though he hadn’t practiced at all.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> “You’re trying out for a guard?” Mrs. Sosa asked. “I’ll read the queen’s lines. Begin when you’re ready.”</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="86%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyilvwllw/image/upload/v1767480325/mjlolbv4fbfx83o1kuim.png" alt="ASS_Y4_EN_32">


        </p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> Carl took a deep breath and tried to picture himself as a guard, just as his mother had suggested when she helped him practice. “Your majesty,” Carl began uncertainly, “the castle is under siege.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> “Call my knights!” Mrs. Sosa responded as the queen, sounding like Carl’s mother had. He almost smiled. At first he felt silly in front of the other students, but as he concentrated on his lines, he forgot about the people watching. It was as if he had really become a guard in a queen’s service!</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> After Carl finished, he walked over to Neil. As soon as Carl sat down, Neil asked, “Do you think I got the part of the knight?”</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> “I’m sure you did,” Carl mumbled. Sometimes he thought Neil just liked hearing how great he was. “It’s not like he doesn’t &nbsp;already hear what a great basketball player he is,” Carl thought. Neil was confident and talented. He seemed to succeed at everything without even trying, while Carl struggled just to be average.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “You should have made your voice sound like that actor in The Bank Caper,” Neil said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> “I had enough trouble just remembering my lines,” Carl said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> The next afternoon Carl went to Mrs. Sosa’s room to see who had been given the part of the guard. His name wasn’t listed. “Figures,” he muttered.</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> Mrs. Sosa walked up to Carl and said, “Rehearsals start tomorrow. There’s a lot of work to do.” Seeing Carl’s puzzled face, she said, “Oh, you haven’t heard.” She pointed to the top of the list. “You’re playing Sir Trawood. You had the best tryout of anyone, Carl.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> Carl was stunned. “But what about Neil?”</p>
        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> Mrs. Sosa sighed. “Neil was offered a smaller part, but he <span class="txt-underline"><strong>rejected</strong></span> it.”</p>
        <p><strong><em>14</em></strong> “He did?” Carl’s eyes widened. “But I can’t be in the play without Neil,” he said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>15</strong></em> Mrs. Sosa frowned. “But, Carl, you’re the best actor for this part.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>16</strong></em> Neil called Carl that night and said, “I guess you’re happy to get the best part. I have to admit I’m jealous.” Carl&nbsp;was silent. He couldn’t believe that Neil would be jealous of him .</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Star of the Show</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1&nbsp;</strong></em>“Begin when you’re ready, Neil,” Mrs. Sosa said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em>&nbsp;Neil started to speak. “Humph,” he coughed, trying to stall. He had looked at the script that morning, but now his mind was blank. Maybe he could <span class="txt-underline"><strong>improvise</strong></span>—make up his own words now and memorize his lines after he got the part. Then luckily he remembered. “Knights of the Royal Order,” he hissed, trying to sound like his favorite actor, “this means war!”</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em>&nbsp;He saw Mrs. Sosa raise her eyebrows. He could tell she was impressed. He stumbled over his words a couple more times, but he still felt confident when he had finished. He couldn’t wait to star in a real play. Most days he imagined himself as a basketball star, but sometimes he thought he would like to star in the movies. “Maybe I’ll be an actor after I retire from basketball,” he thought.</p>
        <p><strong><em>4&nbsp;</em></strong>His friend Carl was next. Neil felt sorry for him. Carl looked terrified. When he started talking, he sounded as if he had swallowed a frog. Carl remembered all his lines, but he didn’t act very well. He just used his regular voice.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em>&nbsp;When Carl returned, Neil noticed that he was sullen. “Do you think I got the part of the knight?” he asked his friend, hoping to take Carl’s mind off his own tryout. “Maybe I’ll ask Mrs. Sosa to give Carl another chance,” Neil thought.</p>
        <p><strong><em>6</em></strong>&nbsp;After basketball practice the next day, Neil rushed to Mrs. Sosa’s room to see who else was in the play. He noticed right away that Carl hadn’t gotten the part of the guard. Then Neil gasped. Carl had gotten the part of Sir Trawood! There had to be some mistake.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em>&nbsp;“I’m afraid you didn’t get the part you wanted, Neil,” Mrs. Sosa said. “You’ll be playing the part of a messenger.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em>&nbsp;“But Carl didn’t even try out for Sir Trawood,” Neil protested.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em>&nbsp;Mrs. Sosa nodded. “Yes, but I think he’ll make an excellent knight.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em>&nbsp;“He didn’t even sound like an actor,” Neil complained.</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em>&nbsp;“That’s why he did so well,” Mrs. Sosa said. “You’ll see what I mean at practice tomorrow.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em>&nbsp;“No, I won’t,” Neil said. “I’m not going to be some stupid messenger.” He stormed out. As he walked home, he kept thinking it wasn’t fair. Carl probably wouldn’t even have tried out for the play if Neil hadn’t insisted. He felt angry that Carl would be in the play without him. “But I guess I should congratulate him,” he thought. “After all, I’m the school’s star basketball player, and Carl didn’t even make the team.”</p>

          <strong>A Personal Achievement</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1</strong></em> “You’re next, Carl,” Mrs. Sosa said. Carl walked nervously to the stage. Why had he let his friend Neil talk him into trying out for the play? He hated standing in front of people.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em> He had spent the weekend memorizing lines, but he knew he wouldn’t get the part. It was a small part anyway, not like the lead role he just knew Neil would get. Neil had already finished his audition. As always he had done well even though he hadn’t practiced at all.</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em> “You’re trying out for a guard?” Mrs. Sosa asked. “I’ll read the queen’s lines. Begin when you’re ready.”</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="86%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyilvwllw/image/upload/v1767486201/kfwysihwmmwfohcbebu8.png" alt="ASS_Y4_EN_32">


        </p>
        <p><em><strong>4</strong></em> Carl took a deep breath and tried to picture himself as a guard, just as his mother had suggested when she helped him practice. “Your majesty,” Carl began uncertainly, “the castle is under siege.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em> “Call my knights!” Mrs. Sosa responded as the queen, sounding like Carl’s mother had. He almost smiled. At first he felt silly in front of the other students, but as he concentrated on his lines, he forgot about the people watching. It was as if he had really become a guard in a queen’s service!</p>
        <p><em><strong>6</strong></em> After Carl finished, he walked over to Neil. As soon as Carl sat down, Neil asked, “Do you think I got the part of the knight?”</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em> “I’m sure you did,” Carl mumbled. Sometimes he thought Neil just liked hearing how great he was. “It’s not like he doesn’t &nbsp;already hear what a great basketball player he is,” Carl thought. Neil was confident and talented. He seemed to succeed at everything without even trying, while Carl struggled just to be average.</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em> “You should have made your voice sound like that actor in The Bank Caper,” Neil said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em> “I had enough trouble just remembering my lines,” Carl said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em> The next afternoon Carl went to Mrs. Sosa’s room to see who had been given the part of the guard. His name wasn’t listed. “Figures,” he muttered.</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em> Mrs. Sosa walked up to Carl and said, “Rehearsals start tomorrow. There’s a lot of work to do.” Seeing Carl’s puzzled face, she said, “Oh, you haven’t heard.” She pointed to the top of the list. “You’re playing Sir Trawood. You had the best tryout of anyone, Carl.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em> Carl was stunned. “But what about Neil?”</p>
        <p><em><strong>13</strong></em> Mrs. Sosa sighed. “Neil was offered a smaller part, but he <span class="txt-underline"><strong>rejected</strong></span> it.”</p>
        <p><strong><em>14</em></strong> “He did?” Carl’s eyes widened. “But I can’t be in the play without Neil,” he said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>15</strong></em> Mrs. Sosa frowned. “But, Carl, you’re the best actor for this part.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>16</strong></em> Neil called Carl that night and said, “I guess you’re happy to get the best part. I have to admit I’m jealous.” Carl&nbsp;was silent. He couldn’t believe that Neil would be jealous of him .</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Star of the Show</strong>
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>1&nbsp;</strong></em>“Begin when you’re ready, Neil,” Mrs. Sosa said.</p>
        <p><em><strong>2</strong></em>&nbsp;Neil started to speak. “Humph,” he coughed, trying to stall. He had looked at the script that morning, but now his mind was blank. Maybe he could <span class="txt-underline"><strong>improvise</strong></span>—make up his own words now and memorize his lines after he got the part. Then luckily he remembered. “Knights of the Royal Order,” he hissed, trying to sound like his favorite actor, “this means war!”</p>
        <p><em><strong>3</strong></em>&nbsp;He saw Mrs. Sosa raise her eyebrows. He could tell she was impressed. He stumbled over his words a couple more times, but he still felt confident when he had finished. He couldn’t wait to star in a real play. Most days he imagined himself as a basketball star, but sometimes he thought he would like to star in the movies. “Maybe I’ll be an actor after I retire from basketball,” he thought.</p>
        <p><strong><em>4&nbsp;</em></strong>His friend Carl was next. Neil felt sorry for him. Carl looked terrified. When he started talking, he sounded as if he had swallowed a frog. Carl remembered all his lines, but he didn’t act very well. He just used his regular voice.</p>
        <p><em><strong>5</strong></em>&nbsp;When Carl returned, Neil noticed that he was sullen. “Do you think I got the part of the knight?” he asked his friend, hoping to take Carl’s mind off his own tryout. “Maybe I’ll ask Mrs. Sosa to give Carl another chance,” Neil thought.</p>
        <p><strong><em>6</em></strong>&nbsp;After basketball practice the next day, Neil rushed to Mrs. Sosa’s room to see who else was in the play. He noticed right away that Carl hadn’t gotten the part of the guard. Then Neil gasped. Carl had gotten the part of Sir Trawood! There had to be some mistake.</p>
        <p><em><strong>7</strong></em>&nbsp;“I’m afraid you didn’t get the part you wanted, Neil,” Mrs. Sosa said. “You’ll be playing the part of a messenger.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>8</strong></em>&nbsp;“But Carl didn’t even try out for Sir Trawood,” Neil protested.</p>
        <p><em><strong>9</strong></em>&nbsp;Mrs. Sosa nodded. “Yes, but I think he’ll make an excellent knight.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>10</strong></em>&nbsp;“He didn’t even sound like an actor,” Neil complained.</p>
        <p><em><strong>11</strong></em>&nbsp;“That’s why he did so well,” Mrs. Sosa said. “You’ll see what I mean at practice tomorrow.”</p>
        <p><em><strong>12</strong></em>&nbsp;“No, I won’t,” Neil said. “I’m not going to be some stupid messenger.” He stormed out. As he walked home, he kept thinking it wasn’t fair. Carl probably wouldn’t even have tried out for the play if Neil hadn’t insisted. He felt angry that Carl would be in the play without him. “But I guess I should congratulate him,” he thought. “After all, I’m the school’s star basketball player, and Carl didn’t even make the team.”</p>
