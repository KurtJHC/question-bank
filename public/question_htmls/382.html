        <p>Eventually, they made their way into the country. Joe found the historical markers that dotted the sides of the roadway interesting—the ones next to old colonial stone houses and scenic graveyards, and the like—and every now and then—this was a decidedly relaxed ride—he would pull over to read them.</p>
        <p>Somewhere in the middle of Pennsylvania, he spotted one that was about an old bridge. The bridge itself could barely be seen—a thicket of barren trees obscured it. But a shining band of bright white light could be seen. It was a river, and the sun was all over it.</p>
        <p>Joe sidled the car up to the sign. He hugged the outside of his door and took off his black sunglasses. Squinting, he read:</p>

          <em>ROCKVILLE BRIDGE</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>The longest stone masonry arch railroad bridge in the world, visible to the south, was built between 1900 and 1902. Named for the surrounding small settlement, it has forty-eight arches and a length of 3,820 feet. It is the third bridge constructed here by the Pennsylvania Railroad. A wooden structure has been built 1847-49, followed by an iron bridge in 1877.</em>
        </p>
        <p>The two pulled back onto the road and drove up a bit further where they found an opening in the trees. A clear site of the river spilled into view. It was the Susquehanna River that was branching out before them, beautiful and mighty. They looked at the bridge. It laid low along the water and was made out of weathered stone. One arch after another crossed the water. Above the bridge and the water alike, a sloping wooded mountaintop sat in the sky.</p>
        <p>The men drove on. A few miles down the road they ran into a town called Dauphin Borough. The town was located along a bend in the Susquehanna, just off its banks.</p>

  In revising this story, the author is considering taking out the reference to “One arch after another crossed the water” and instead describing the scene as “The bridge was made of many arches”. Which is better – the original or this alternative description – and why?

          <strong>Questions 20 – 23 relate to the following information</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Eventually, they made their way into the country. Joe found the historical markers that dotted the sides of the roadway interesting—the ones next to old colonial stone houses and scenic graveyards, and the like—and every now and then—this was a decidedly relaxed ride—he would pull over to read them.</p>
        <p>Somewhere in the middle of Pennsylvania, he spotted one that was about an old bridge. The bridge itself could barely be seen—a thicket of barren trees obscured it. But a shining band of bright white light could be seen. It was a river, and the sun was all over it.</p>
        <p>Joe sidled the car up to the sign. He hugged the outside of his door and took off his black sunglasses. Squinting, he read:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>ROCKVILLE BRIDGE</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>The longest stone masonry arch railroad bridge in the world, visible to the south, was built between 1900 and 1902. Named for the surrounding small settlement, it has forty-eight arches and a length of 3,820 feet. It is the third bridge constructed here by the Pennsylvania Railroad. A wooden structure has been built 1847-49, followed by an iron bridge in 1877.</em>
        </p>
        <p>The two pulled back onto the road and drove up a bit further where they found an opening in the trees. A clear site of the river spilled into view. It was the Susquehanna River that was branching out before them, beautiful and mighty. They looked at the bridge. It laid low along the water and was made out of weathered stone. One arch after another crossed the water. Above the bridge and the water alike, a sloping wooded mountaintop sat in the sky.</p>
        <p>The men drove on. A few miles down the road they ran into a town called Dauphin Borough. The town was located along a bend in the Susquehanna, just off its banks.</p>

          <strong>Questions 24 – 26 relate to the following information</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>What do dogs do with all of the information they collect with their noses? The scents that dogs pick up help them understand their surroundings. Dogs store what they learn, making memories that guide their future actions. When trained to discern tiny differences in scents, dogs can do remarkable things. For instance, dogs can learn to sniff out drugs and explosives (have you ever seen a dog with a security guard at a big office building or an airport?). They can also, with training, pick out the one stick thrown for them from a heap of many, based on the scent of their<br>
owner. With that kind of olfactory (“olfactory” means that something is related to the nose and scent talent), it’s no wonder dogs are often used in searches for missing hikers or people lost in avalanches!</p>
        <p>Also, dogs recognize one another by scent; a mother dog knows which puppies are hers by how they smell, for example. Plus, dogs can determine pretty quickly what another dog is like, and whether or not they’re going to get along, by detecting specific scents on other animals that<br>
indicate age, gender, and even mood.</p>
        <p>Dogs know humans by scent, too! You don’t notice it, but you have a unique scent, and your dog – and other people’s dogs – can tell the difference between you and someone else in large part because of your specific smell. Pets come to associate the scent of their owners with home and safety, as human and dog become more familiar with one another. Some scientists even think that dogs can tell how their owners are feeling based on smell, and one study in England tested the ability of dogs to detect cancer in human patients.</p>

          <strong>Questions 24 – 26 relate to the following information</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>What do dogs do with all of the information they collect with their noses? The scents that dogs pick up help them understand their surroundings. Dogs store what they learn, making memories that guide their future actions. When trained to discern tiny differences in scents, dogs can do remarkable things. For instance, dogs can learn to sniff out drugs and explosives (have you ever seen a dog with a security guard at a big office building or an airport?). They can also, with training, pick out the one stick thrown for them from a heap of many, based on the scent of their<br>
owner. With that kind of olfactory (“olfactory” means that something is related to the nose and scent talent), it’s no wonder dogs are often used in searches for missing hikers or people lost in avalanches!</p>
        <p>Also, dogs recognize one another by scent; a mother dog knows which puppies are hers by how they smell, for example. Plus, dogs can determine pretty quickly what another dog is like, and whether or not they’re going to get along, by detecting specific scents on other animals that<br>
indicate age, gender, and even mood.</p>
        <p>Dogs know humans by scent, too! You don’t notice it, but you have a unique scent, and your dog – and other people’s dogs – can tell the difference between you and someone else in large part because of your specific smell. Pets come to associate the scent of their owners with home and safety, as human and dog become more familiar with one another. Some scientists even think that dogs can tell how their owners are feeling based on smell, and one study in England tested the ability of dogs to detect cancer in human patients.</p>

  “Dogs know humans by scent, too! You don’t notice it, but you have a unique scent, and your dog – and other people’s dogs – can tell the difference between you and someone else in large part because of your specific smell.”<br>
Notice that some of this passage is written in the second person, employing the “you” pronoun.<br>
<br>
Considering the purpose of the writing, is this the best choice and why?

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Lion once fell in love with a beautiful maiden and proposed marriage to her parents.</p>
        <p>The old people did not know what to say.</p>
        <p>They did not like to give their daughter to the Lion, yet they did not wish to enrage the King of Beasts.</p>
        <p>At last the father said:</p>
        <p>
          <em>"We feel highly honoured by your Majesty's proposal, but you see our daughter is a tender young thing, and we fear that in the vehemence of your affection you might possibly do her some injury. Might I venture to suggest that your Majesty should have your claws removed, and your teeth extracted, then we would gladly consider your proposal again."</em>
        </p>
        <p>The Lion was so much in love that he had his claws trimmed and his big teeth taken out. But when he came again to the parents of the young girl they simply laughed in his face, and bade him do his worst.</p>

          <strong>Questions 27 – 28 relate to the following information</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Lion once fell in love with a beautiful maiden and proposed marriage to her parents.</p>
        <p>The old people did not know what to say.</p>
        <p>They did not like to give their daughter to the Lion, yet they did not wish to enrage the King of Beasts.</p>
        <p>At last the father said:</p>
        <p>
          <em>"We feel highly honoured by your Majesty's proposal, but you see our daughter is a tender young thing, and we fear that in the vehemence of your affection you might possibly do her some injury. Might I venture to suggest that your Majesty should have your claws removed, and your teeth extracted, then we would gladly consider your proposal again."</em>
        </p>
        <p>The Lion was so much in love that he had his claws trimmed and his big teeth taken out. But when he came again to the parents of the young girl they simply laughed in his face, and bade him do his worst.</p>

          <strong>Question 31 – 33 relate to the following information</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Water is vital for our existence. Not only do we drink it for survival, the majority of the human body is also composed of water. The earth’s weather patterns are closely linked to water too, as they are determined by the complex patterns of changes and movement of water in the atmosphere. Since the ocean covers 70% of the earth’s surface, it plays a major role determining what happens in the environment. One of its most important roles is distributing the heat around the world; it soaks up energy in the form of heat, and releases it more evenly across the earth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Water and Temperature</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Since the ocean is so effective at absorbing heat, the first few meters of the ocean’s surface hold as much heat as the earth’s entire atmosphere. But how does water control the earth’s weather?</p>
        <p>First, it’s important to know that the temperature of the water in the ocean and its salt content affect the water’s density. So the saltier or the colder the water, the denser it is. Denser water sinks to the bottom of the ocean, while less dense water floats at the surface. The temperature of water is closely related to ocean currents, since the former affects the latter.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ocean Currents</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Simply put, ice triggers the movement of ocean currents. As water freezes in the North and South Poles, the water surrounding the ice becomes saltier and colder, since the salt leaves the water upon freezing. The ice then cools the water surrounding it. The cold, salty water then sinks due to its increased density. Once it gets to the bottom of the ocean floor, it has to move somewhere, so it travels horizontally to spread out over the surface of the earth. This is cold current. Warm water replaces it on the surface and moves to the North. This motion is called the global conveyor belt. The global conveyor belt is a global-wide current that circulates cold and warm water around the earth. So, the warm water that replaces the cold on the surface travels northward, increasing the temperature of the Atlantic Ocean. That’s why countries that border the Atlantic Ocean are relatively warmer than landlocked countries during the wintertime.</p>

          <strong>Question 31 – 33 relate to the following information</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Water is vital for our existence. Not only do we drink it for survival, the majority of the human body is also composed of water. The earth’s weather patterns are closely linked to water too, as they are determined by the complex patterns of changes and movement of water in the atmosphere. Since the ocean covers 70% of the earth’s surface, it plays a major role determining what happens in the environment. One of its most important roles is distributing the heat around the world; it soaks up energy in the form of heat, and releases it more evenly across the earth.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Water and Temperature</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Since the ocean is so effective at absorbing heat, the first few meters of the ocean’s surface hold as much heat as the earth’s entire atmosphere. But how does water control the earth’s weather?</p>
        <p>First, it’s important to know that the temperature of the water in the ocean and its salt content affect the water’s density. So the saltier or the colder the water, the denser it is. Denser water sinks to the bottom of the ocean, while less dense water floats at the surface. The temperature of water is closely related to ocean currents, since the former affects the latter.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ocean Currents</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Simply put, ice triggers the movement of ocean currents. As water freezes in the North and South Poles, the water surrounding the ice becomes saltier and colder, since the salt leaves the water upon freezing. The ice then cools the water surrounding it. The cold, salty water then sinks due to its increased density. Once it gets to the bottom of the ocean floor, it has to move somewhere, so it travels horizontally to spread out over the surface of the earth. This is cold current. Warm water replaces it on the surface and moves to the North. This motion is called the global conveyor belt. The global conveyor belt is a global-wide current that circulates cold and warm water around the earth. So, the warm water that replaces the cold on the surface travels northward, increasing the temperature of the Atlantic Ocean. That’s why countries that border the Atlantic Ocean are relatively warmer than landlocked countries during the wintertime.</p>

          <strong>Read the following passage (from Joseph Conrad’s “Heart of Darkness) to answer questions 37 to 41.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Nellie, a cruising yawl, swung to her anchor without a flutter of the sails, and was at rest. The flood had made, the wind was nearly calm, and being bound down the river, the only thing for it was to come to and wait for the turn of the tide.</p>
        <p>The sea-reach of the Thames stretched before us like the beginning of an interminable waterway. In the offing the sea and the sky were welded together without a joint, and in the luminous space the tanned sails of the barges drifting up with the tide seemed to stand still in red clusters of canvas sharply peaked, with gleams of varnished sprits. A haze rested on the low shores that ran out to sea in vanishing flatness. The air was dark above Gravesend, and farther back still seemed condensed into a mournful gloom, brooding motionless over the biggest, and the greatest, town on earth.</p>
        <p>The Director of Companies was our captain and our host. We four affectionately watched his back as he stood in the bows looking to seaward. On the whole river there was nothing that looked half so nautical. He resembled a pilot, which to a seaman is trustworthiness personified. It was difficult to realize his work was not out there in the luminous estuary, but behind him, within the brooding gloom.</p>
        <p>Between us there was, as I have already said somewhere, the bond of the sea. Besides holding our hearts together through long periods of separation, it had the effect of making us tolerant of each other’s yarns—and even convictions. The Lawyer—the best of old fellows—had, because of his many years and many virtues, the only cushion on deck, and was lying on the only rug. The Accountant had brought out already a box of dominoes, and was toying architecturally with the bones. Marlow sat cross-legged right aft, leaning against the mizzen-mast. He had sunken cheeks, a yellow complexion, a straight back, an ascetic aspect, and, with his arms dropped, the palms of hands outwards, resembled an idol. The director, satisfied the anchor had good hold, made his way aft and sat down amongst us.</p>
        <p>We exchanged a few words lazily. Afterwards there was silence on board the yacht. For some reason or other we did not begin that game of dominoes. We felt meditative, and fit for nothing but <strong>placid</strong> staring. The day was ending in a serenity of still and exquisite brilliance. The water shone pacifically; the sky, without a speck, was a benign immensity of unstained light; the very mist on the Essex marsh was like a gauzy and radiant fabric, hung from the wooded rises inland, and draping the low shores in diaphanous folds. Only the gloom to the west, brooding over the upper reaches, became more sombre every minute, as if angered by the approach of the sun.</p>

          <strong>Read the following passage (from Joseph Conrad’s “Heart of Darkness) to answer questions 37 to 41.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Nellie, a cruising yawl, swung to her anchor without a flutter of the sails, and was at rest. The flood had made, the wind was nearly calm, and being bound down the river, the only thing for it was to come to and wait for the turn of the tide.</p>
        <p>The sea-reach of the Thames stretched before us like the beginning of an interminable waterway. In the offing the sea and the sky were welded together without a joint, and in the luminous space the tanned sails of the barges drifting up with the tide seemed to stand still in red clusters of canvas sharply peaked, with gleams of varnished sprits. A haze rested on the low shores that ran out to sea in vanishing flatness. The air was dark above Gravesend, and farther back still seemed condensed into a mournful gloom, brooding motionless over the biggest, and the greatest, town on earth.</p>
        <p>The Director of Companies was our captain and our host. We four affectionately watched his back as he stood in the bows looking to seaward. On the whole river there was nothing that looked half so nautical. He resembled a pilot, which to a seaman is trustworthiness personified. It was difficult to realize his work was not out there in the luminous estuary, but behind him, within the brooding gloom.</p>
        <p>Between us there was, as I have already said somewhere, the bond of the sea. Besides holding our hearts together through long periods of separation, it had the effect of making us tolerant of each other’s yarns—and even convictions. The Lawyer—the best of old fellows—had, because of his many years and many virtues, the only cushion on deck, and was lying on the only rug. The Accountant had brought out already a box of dominoes, and was toying architecturally with the bones. Marlow sat cross-legged right aft, leaning against the mizzen-mast. He had sunken cheeks, a yellow complexion, a straight back, an ascetic aspect, and, with his arms dropped, the palms of hands outwards, resembled an idol. The director, satisfied the anchor had good hold, made his way aft and sat down amongst us.</p>
        <p>We exchanged a few words lazily. Afterwards there was silence on board the yacht. For some reason or other we did not begin that game of dominoes. We felt meditative, and fit for nothing but <strong>placid</strong> staring. The day was ending in a serenity of still and exquisite brilliance. The water shone pacifically; the sky, without a speck, was a benign immensity of unstained light; the very mist on the Essex marsh was like a gauzy and radiant fabric, hung from the wooded rises inland, and draping the low shores in diaphanous folds. Only the gloom to the west, brooding over the upper reaches, became more sombre every minute, as if angered by the approach of the sun.</p>

          <strong>Read the following passage (from Joseph Conrad’s “Heart of Darkness) to answer questions 37 to 41.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Nellie, a cruising yawl, swung to her anchor without a flutter of the sails, and was at rest. The flood had made, the wind was nearly calm, and being bound down the river, the only thing for it was to come to and wait for the turn of the tide.</p>
        <p>The sea-reach of the Thames stretched before us like the beginning of an interminable waterway. In the offing the sea and the sky were welded together without a joint, and in the luminous space the tanned sails of the barges drifting up with the tide seemed to stand still in red clusters of canvas sharply peaked, with gleams of varnished sprits. A haze rested on the low shores that ran out to sea in vanishing flatness. The air was dark above Gravesend, and farther back still seemed condensed into a mournful gloom, brooding motionless over the biggest, and the greatest, town on earth.</p>
        <p>The Director of Companies was our captain and our host. We four affectionately watched his back as he stood in the bows looking to seaward. On the whole river there was nothing that looked half so nautical. He resembled a pilot, which to a seaman is trustworthiness personified. It was difficult to realize his work was not out there in the luminous estuary, but behind him, within the brooding gloom.</p>
        <p>Between us there was, as I have already said somewhere, the bond of the sea. Besides holding our hearts together through long periods of separation, it had the effect of making us tolerant of each other’s yarns—and even convictions. The Lawyer—the best of old fellows—had, because of his many years and many virtues, the only cushion on deck, and was lying on the only rug. The Accountant had brought out already a box of dominoes, and was toying architecturally with the bones. Marlow sat cross-legged right aft, leaning against the mizzen-mast. He had sunken cheeks, a yellow complexion, a straight back, an ascetic aspect, and, with his arms dropped, the palms of hands outwards, resembled an idol. The director, satisfied the anchor had good hold, made his way aft and sat down amongst us.</p>
        <p>We exchanged a few words lazily. Afterwards there was silence on board the yacht. For some reason or other we did not begin that game of dominoes. We felt meditative, and fit for nothing but <strong>placid</strong> staring. The day was ending in a serenity of still and exquisite brilliance. The water shone pacifically; the sky, without a speck, was a benign immensity of unstained light; the very mist on the Essex marsh was like a gauzy and radiant fabric, hung from the wooded rises inland, and draping the low shores in diaphanous folds. Only the gloom to the west, brooding over the upper reaches, became more sombre every minute, as if angered by the approach of the sun.</p>

          <strong>Read the following passage to answer the next three questions</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When Eve and Doug walked upstairs from the subway station onto a Manhattan sidewalk, the first thing they saw were tremendous skyscrapers standing thousands of feet high. The island of Manhattan is littered with hundreds of huge buildings that have become world famous for, not just their height, but also for their recognizable architecture and symbolism of mankind’s neverending desire to create. Doug and Eve immediately reached for their cameras and started taking some photos of buildings like the Empire State Building, the Freedom Tower and the Chrysler Building.</p>
        <p>Many of these skyscrapers are essentially incredibly large office spaces. Therefore, the buildings serve a vital function in the ecosystem in that they house many people throughout the day, while they are working on any number of projects that could help others. A large percentage of these buildings are also homes to restaurants and eateries where people not only enjoy plenty of available nourishing food, but commiserate with each other as well.</p>
        <p>Still, it is important to recognize that these buildings of Manhattan are, in some ways, as “natural” a thing as an anthill or a bird’s nest. First of all, human beings, who are undoubtedly a part of nature, have built them, and they have been built by raw materials taken up from the planet’s resources. Certainly, soil has been covered by concrete and iron, but there are plenty of places in nature where there is no rich soil, like Antarctica, for instance. The previously hilly island that had thousands of trees on it has simply been exchanged for an urban ecosystem containing different things that serve the same function as many others that are called more “natural.” In addition, skyscrapers still must be built with respect to many laws of nature. An elite architect along with a construction crew cannot simply erect a building that stretches to an infinite height. The effects of gravity, wind, and, yes, the density of soil still within the earth of Manhattan, must be considered in the planning and construction of a building.</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">***</p>
        <p>Eve knew that if she was going to have a successful day of photography, she and her husband would have to take a trip to Central Park. Central Park is located in the middle of Manhattan and takes up quite a chunk of land. It includes a couple of ponds, hundreds of trees, large grassy areas, rocky parts, and trails for urban “hiking.” Many species of animals call Central Park home, too. For some of them, it may be the only place within New York City where they can actually survive.</p>
        <p>Central Park was constructed because city planners knew that New Yorkers would need a getaway location, a place where they could reconnect with nature, or at least the parts of it that are more traditionally considered “natural.” It is still certainly the case that New Yorkers need this outlet, which explains why Central Park still exists today as the price of local real estate has only increased over the years. Parks like this one “soften” the urban experience, giving locals a place to relax and engage in important <strong>recreational</strong> activities. Many scientists note that, though cities are ecosystems and a growing part of nature, the loss of greenery is a severe problem that needs to change. The urban planners of today are becoming more sensitive to this by making sure to include parks, taking a page out of the books of those who helped create Central Park as they continue to build new cities and expand upon those that have already been founded.</p>
        <p>Doug and Eve strolled around the park for quite a while. They took tons of photos, ate lunch together, and even rode the famous merry-go-round. They were truly taking advantage of the pleasures allowed by the existence of such an incredible and unique location.</p>

Many scientists note that, though cities are ecosystems and a growing part of nature, the loss of greenery is a severe problem that needs to change. The urban planners of today are becoming more sensitive to this by making sure to include parks, taking a page out of the books of those who helped create Central Park as they continue to build new cities and expand upon those that have already been founded.</p>
        <p>Doug and Eve strolled around the park for quite a while. They took tons of photos, ate lunch together, and even rode the famous merry-go-round. They were truly taking advantage of the pleasures allowed by the existence of such an incredible and unique location.</p>

          <strong>Read the following passage to answer the next three questions</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When Eve and Doug walked upstairs from the subway station onto a Manhattan sidewalk, the first thing they saw were tremendous skyscrapers standing thousands of feet high. The island of Manhattan is littered with hundreds of huge buildings that have become world famous for, not just their height, but also for their recognizable architecture and symbolism of mankind’s neverending desire to create. Doug and Eve immediately reached for their cameras and started taking some photos of buildings like the Empire State Building, the Freedom Tower and the Chrysler Building.</p>
        <p>Many of these skyscrapers are essentially incredibly large office spaces. Therefore, the buildings serve a vital function in the ecosystem in that they house many people throughout the day, while they are working on any number of projects that could help others. A large percentage of these buildings are also homes to restaurants and eateries where people not only enjoy plenty of available nourishing food, but commiserate with each other as well.</p>
        <p>Still, it is important to recognize that these buildings of Manhattan are, in some ways, as “natural” a thing as an anthill or a bird’s nest. First of all, human beings, who are undoubtedly a part of nature, have built them, and they have been built by raw materials taken up from the planet’s resources. Certainly, soil has been covered by concrete and iron, but there are plenty of places in nature where there is no rich soil, like Antarctica, for instance. The previously hilly island that had thousands of trees on it has simply been exchanged for an urban ecosystem containing different things that serve the same function as many others that are called more “natural.” In addition, skyscrapers still must be built with respect to many laws of nature. An elite architect along with a construction crew cannot simply erect a building that stretches to an infinite height. The effects of gravity, wind, and, yes, the density of soil still within the earth of Manhattan, must be considered in the planning and construction of a building.</p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">***</p>
        <p>Eve knew that if she was going to have a successful day of photography, she and her husband would have to take a trip to Central Park. Central Park is located in the middle of Manhattan and takes up quite a chunk of land. It includes a couple of ponds, hundreds of trees, large grassy areas, rocky parts, and trails for urban “hiking.” Many species of animals call Central Park home, too. For some of them, it may be the only place within New York City where they can actually survive.</p>
        <p>Central Park was constructed because city planners knew that New Yorkers would need a getaway location, a place where they could reconnect with nature, or at least the parts of it that are more traditionally considered “natural.” It is still certainly the case that New Yorkers need this outlet, which explains why Central Park still exists today as the price of local real estate has only increased over the years. Parks like this one “soften” the urban experience, giving locals a place to relax and engage in important <strong>recreational</strong> activities. Many scientists note that, though cities are ecosystems and a growing part of nature, the loss of greenery is a severe problem that needs to change. The urban planners of today are becoming more sensitive to this by making sure to include parks, taking a page out of the books of those who helped create Central Park as they continue to build new cities and expand upon those that have already been founded.</p>
        <p>Doug and Eve strolled around the park for quite a while. They took tons of photos, ate lunch together, and even rode the famous merry-go-round. They were truly taking advantage of the pleasures allowed by the existence of such an incredible and unique location.</p>
