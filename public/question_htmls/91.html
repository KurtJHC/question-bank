          <strong>Dollars and $ense</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Americans spend more than they earn. Why should you save?</em>
        </p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Joseph Britton, 9, of Danbury, Connecticut, earns an allowance. He gets paid for doing chores—taking out the trash, making his bed, and washing the dishes. His classmate, Catherine VanWattum, 9, also gets money for helping out around the house. The two fourth graders are saving enough money to buy <em>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</em>, the sixth title in the popular book series.</p>
        <p>Joseph and Catherine may be managing their money better than most adults. The amount of money that Americans save is at its lowest since the Great Depression of the 1930s, when many people did not have jobs.</p>
        <p>Today, Americans, on average, are spending more than they earn, according to the United States Commerce Department. That means they are in <strong>debt</strong>, or owe money.</p>
        <p>What is causing this shrink in savings? “It seems that we’ve lost the culture and habit of savings,” says financial expert Nancy Register. “There’s so much . . . pressure to spend and buy. . . . And if you can’t buy it now, [you can] put it on your <strong>credit card</strong>.” A credit card purchase is a loan that needs to be paid back. Credit card companies charge money if the loan isn’t paid back on time. Americans owe more than $800 billion in credit card debt, according to the Center for Responsible Lending.</p>

            <strong>Bank on Savings</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; Although many adults are racking up credit card debt, some children are savvier about their savings. “I deposit some of my savings, like birthday checks from my grandparents, into my college fund,” Joseph told <em>Weekly Reader</em>. He often joins his mother on her trips to the bank.</p>
        <p>Banks offer people several ways of saving their money. Two popular options include savings accounts and <strong>savings bonds</strong>. In a <strong>savings account</strong>, a person deposits money in the bank. In turn, the bank pays the person interest, or a percentage of the savings. (See “What’s My Interest?” to learn how interest works.)</p>
        <p>Savings bonds are certificates that show a person has agreed to lend money to the U.S. government. The government uses the money to help pay its bills. Bonds also pay interest each year.</p>

          <strong>Money Habits for Life</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Experts stress that it’s never too early to learn how to make sense of your money. “You can’t wait until you are a grown-up to learn about personal finance,” financial expert Robert Duvall told <em>Weekly Reader</em>.</p>
        <p>Experts point out that saving money is about making good decisions and setting goals. “If you spend all your money on an iPod, you have to consider what you will not be able to have,” adds Duvall.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; Duvall also encourages kids to look to the future—and pick up tips on how to invest. When a person invests money, he or she buys something, such as a house or a <strong>stock</strong>, with the hope that it will become more valuable over time. When a person owns stock in a company, he or she invests money in it and owns part of the company.</p>
        <p>Money expert Laura Levine also emphasizes the importance of making smart money decisions. “Saving money is about establishing a good habit, like flossing your teeth,” she told <em>Weekly Reader</em>. “If you don’t develop the habit as a young person, it is hard to change as an adult.”</p>

          <strong>Keep Going</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>My toes don’t hurt anymore. That’s not good.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;All day, Ted’s feet had been feeling like someone was slowly moving a blowtorch back and forth beneath his soles. But now he couldn’t feel his toes at all. When he removed a boot to take a look, Ted was surprised by the waxy, grayish color of his feet. His toes felt like small nubs of wood between his fingers. He decided that he had preferred the pain.</p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Keep going.</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The snowfall had been epic. Ted didn’t know such a snowfall was possible, but Ted had never hiked the Sierra Nevadas in winter before. In fact, he had never hiked any mountains before. Being a city boy, the nearest thing to a mountain Ted had hiked had been the time he had done the Empire State Building climb—an annual race up the stairs of the landmark skyscraper. It was an incredible challenge that did absolutely nothing to prepare Ted for hiking the Sierra Nevada mountains in winter.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>So tired. Keep going.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The trip had been ill planned from the beginning. Ted and a few friends from school had decided on a whim to drive up to the mountains for a day hike. They threw a few things into school knapsacks—energy bars, water bottles, gum—and hit the road. Nobody bothered to check the weather report.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>&nbsp;I should sit down. No—Keep going.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody was sure how Ted got separated from the group. Even Ted wasn’t sure. They had all been hiking down a trail together when Ted paused, just paused, ever so briefly to look at a deer in the distance. He had never seen a deer in the wild before, and it took him by surprise. It occurred to Ted to take a picture, but as he fumbled for his camera, the deer spooked and ran off. Disappointed, Ted turned back to his friends. They weren’t there.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>This looks familiar. No, maybe it doesn’t. Keep going.</em></p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Ted set off quickly down the path. He thought he’d just jog a bit to catch up to them. But he was soon presented with a fork in the path. Left or right? Ted listened briefly and thought he heard voices in that direction. To the left. He ran.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Am I absolutely sure I have nothing to make fire? Yes, I’m sure. Check again.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After running for a while, Ted stopped and listened. He heard a lot of sounds—birds, wind, maybe fl owing water, creaking tree limbs—but no voices. No laughing. No people. In a fl ash Ted remembered his cell phone. The wave of relief that washed over him made him realize how&nbsp; uncomfortably close he had been to panic. He’d call one of his friends and they’d figure out how to find each other. Ted flipped open his phone. “No Service.”</p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Last piece of gum. I’ll swallow it. At least I’ll have something in my stomach.</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of finding his friends, Ted decided to find his way back to the car. He knew that they had been hiking downhill and away from the sun, so it made sense to hike uphill toward the sun. Ted thought the ridge ahead looked familiar. He crested the ridge only to find another, identical ridge before him. And so it went.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>So tired. Find a place to sit. Maybe a little further.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Ted walked all that first day. When it got dark, he used his cell phone as a flashlight to stumble his way along. It was only after the battery died that Ted made a bed of pine boughs and lay down for a fitful sleep. He was up with the first light of dawn, moving.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>I’ve been here before. I’m going in circles. I should stop.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The second day was much the same as the first—except for the weather. The temperature began to drop and the sky took on a menacing look. The snow started just after noon. The blizzard raged on. It was in the midst of this hundred-year blizzard that Ted discovered that he could no longer feel his toes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Maybe if I just sit and wait, someone will find me.</em></p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As Ted struggled to continue, he felt the great weight of his fatigue pushing him down.</p>
        <p>He slumped down in the snow. Two ridges over, a search party was on the move. They had been tracking Ted since a few hours after he had been separated from his friends. When they realized Ted was not with them, his friends immediately returned to the car and drove to a place where they could get a cell phone signal. A Ranger search party was on the scene within an hour.</p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I’ll wait.</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Since the beginning, the Rangers had been just behind Ted. He was never more than an hour or two from rescue. But the weather and Ted’s constant motion had left the Rangers struggling to keep up. They were amazed that he could keep going. If only he would stop for a while, they would soon catch up to him.</p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Someone will come soon.</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As Ted sat, his mind began to wander.</p>
        <p>25&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>&nbsp;A little boy walks through an aquarium with his classmates. He is a restless little boy, never wanting to linger at the exhibits like the other children. He always wants to see what’s around the next corner. Around that next corner are sharks. The tour guide explains that most sharks must keep moving in order to breathe. This small bit of trivia nestles itself deep within the boy’s mind. It makes sense to him.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Ted snapped back into the present. He forced himself to stand on his wooden feet.</p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Keep going.</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;His brain <span class="txt-underline">foggy</span> with fatigue and cold, Ted mistakenly set off in the direction he had come, following his own footsteps as if they were a guide trail. It was the first good decision he had made in days.</p>

          <strong>Keep Going</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>My toes don’t hurt anymore. That’s not good.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;All day, Ted’s feet had been feeling like someone was slowly moving a blowtorch back and forth beneath his soles. But now he couldn’t feel his toes at all. When he removed a boot to take a look, Ted was surprised by the waxy, grayish color of his feet. His toes felt like small nubs of wood between his fingers. He decided that he had preferred the pain.</p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Keep going.</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The snowfall had been epic. Ted didn’t know such a snowfall was possible, but Ted had never hiked the Sierra Nevadas in winter before. In fact, he had never hiked any mountains before. Being a city boy, the nearest thing to a mountain Ted had hiked had been the time he had done the Empire State Building climb—an annual race up the stairs of the landmark skyscraper. It was an incredible challenge that did absolutely nothing to prepare Ted for hiking the Sierra Nevada mountains in winter.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>So tired. Keep going.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The trip had been ill planned from the beginning. Ted and a few friends from school had decided on a whim to drive up to the mountains for a day hike. They threw a few things into school knapsacks—energy bars, water bottles, gum—and hit the road. Nobody bothered to check the weather report.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>&nbsp;I should sit down. No—Keep going.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody was sure how Ted got separated from the group. Even Ted wasn’t sure. They had all been hiking down a trail together when Ted paused, just paused, ever so briefly to look at a deer in the distance. He had never seen a deer in the wild before, and it took him by surprise. It occurred to Ted to take a picture, but as he fumbled for his camera, the deer spooked and ran off. Disappointed, Ted turned back to his friends. They weren’t there.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>This looks familiar. No, maybe it doesn’t. Keep going.</em></p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Ted set off quickly down the path. He thought he’d just jog a bit to catch up to them. But he was soon presented with a fork in the path. Left or right? Ted listened briefly and thought he heard voices in that direction. To the left. He ran.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Am I absolutely sure I have nothing to make fire? Yes, I’m sure. Check again.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After running for a while, Ted stopped and listened. He heard a lot of sounds—birds, wind, maybe fl owing water, creaking tree limbs—but no voices. No laughing. No people. In a fl ash Ted remembered his cell phone. The wave of relief that washed over him made him realize how&nbsp; uncomfortably close he had been to panic. He’d call one of his friends and they’d figure out how to find each other. Ted flipped open his phone. “No Service.”</p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Last piece of gum. I’ll swallow it. At least I’ll have something in my stomach.</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of finding his friends, Ted decided to find his way back to the car. He knew that they had been hiking downhill and away from the sun, so it made sense to hike uphill toward the sun. Ted thought the ridge ahead looked familiar. He crested the ridge only to find another, identical ridge before him. And so it went.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>So tired. Find a place to sit. Maybe a little further.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Ted walked all that first day. When it got dark, he used his cell phone as a flashlight to stumble his way along. It was only after the battery died that Ted made a bed of pine boughs and lay down for a fitful sleep. He was up with the first light of dawn, moving.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>I’ve been here before. I’m going in circles. I should stop.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The second day was much the same as the first—except for the weather. The temperature began to drop and the sky took on a menacing look. The snow started just after noon. The blizzard raged on. It was in the midst of this hundred-year blizzard that Ted discovered that he could no longer feel his toes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Maybe if I just sit and wait, someone will find me.</em></p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As Ted struggled to continue, he felt the great weight of his fatigue pushing him down.</p>
        <p>He slumped down in the snow. Two ridges over, a search party was on the move. They had been tracking Ted since a few hours after he had been separated from his friends. When they realized Ted was not with them, his friends immediately returned to the car and drove to a place where they could get a cell phone signal. A Ranger search party was on the scene within an hour.</p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I’ll wait.</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Since the beginning, the Rangers had been just behind Ted. He was never more than an hour or two from rescue. But the weather and Ted’s constant motion had left the Rangers struggling to keep up. They were amazed that he could keep going. If only he would stop for a while, they would soon catch up to him.</p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Someone will come soon.</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As Ted sat, his mind began to wander.</p>
        <p>25&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>&nbsp;A little boy walks through an aquarium with his classmates. He is a restless little boy, never wanting to linger at the exhibits like the other children. He always wants to see what’s around the next corner. Around that next corner are sharks. The tour guide explains that most sharks must keep moving in order to breathe. This small bit of trivia nestles itself deep within the boy’s mind. It makes sense to him.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Ted snapped back into the present. He forced himself to stand on his wooden feet.</p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Keep going.</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;His brain <span class="txt-underline">foggy</span> with fatigue and cold, Ted mistakenly set off in the direction he had come, following his own footsteps as if they were a guide trail. It was the first good decision he had made in days.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>My toes don’t hurt anymore. That’s not good.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;All day, Ted’s feet had been feeling like someone was slowly moving a blowtorch back and forth beneath his soles. But now he couldn’t feel his toes at all. When he removed a boot to take a look, Ted was surprised by the waxy, grayish color of his feet. His toes felt like small nubs of wood between his fingers. He decided that he had preferred the pain.</p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Keep going.</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The snowfall had been epic. Ted didn’t know such a snowfall was possible, but Ted had never hiked the Sierra Nevadas in winter before. In fact, he had never hiked any mountains before. Being a city boy, the nearest thing to a mountain Ted had hiked had been the time he had done the Empire State Building climb—an annual race up the stairs of the landmark skyscraper. It was an incredible challenge that did absolutely nothing to prepare Ted for hiking the Sierra Nevada mountains in winter.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>So tired. Keep going.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The trip had been ill planned from the beginning. Ted and a few friends from school had decided on a whim to drive up to the mountains for a day hike. They threw a few things into school knapsacks—energy bars, water bottles, gum—and hit the road. Nobody bothered to check the weather report.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>&nbsp;I should sit down. No—Keep going.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody was sure how Ted got separated from the group. Even Ted wasn’t sure. They had all been hiking down a trail together when Ted paused, just paused, ever so briefly to look at a deer in the distance. He had never seen a deer in the wild before, and it took him by surprise. It occurred to Ted to take a picture, but as he fumbled for his camera, the deer spooked and ran off. Disappointed, Ted turned back to his friends. They weren’t there.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>This looks familiar. No, maybe it doesn’t. Keep going.</em></p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Ted set off quickly down the path. He thought he’d just jog a bit to catch up to them. But he was soon presented with a fork in the path. Left or right? Ted listened briefly and thought he heard voices in that direction. To the left. He ran.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Am I absolutely sure I have nothing to make fire? Yes, I’m sure. Check again.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After running for a while, Ted stopped and listened. He heard a lot of sounds—birds, wind, maybe fl owing water, creaking tree limbs—but no voices. No laughing. No people. In a fl ash Ted remembered his cell phone. The wave of relief that washed over him made him realize how&nbsp; uncomfortably close he had been to panic. He’d call one of his friends and they’d figure out how to find each other. Ted flipped open his phone. “No Service.”</p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Last piece of gum. I’ll swallow it. At least I’ll have something in my stomach.</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of finding his friends, Ted decided to find his way back to the car. He knew that they had been hiking downhill and away from the sun, so it made sense to hike uphill toward the sun. Ted thought the ridge ahead looked familiar. He crested the ridge only to find another, identical ridge before him. And so it went.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>So tired. Find a place to sit. Maybe a little further.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Ted walked all that first day. When it got dark, he used his cell phone as a flashlight to stumble his way along. It was only after the battery died that Ted made a bed of pine boughs and lay down for a fitful sleep. He was up with the first light of dawn, moving.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>I’ve been here before. I’m going in circles. I should stop.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The second day was much the same as the first—except for the weather. The temperature began to drop and the sky took on a menacing look. The snow started just after noon. The blizzard raged on. It was in the midst of this hundred-year blizzard that Ted discovered that he could no longer feel his toes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Maybe if I just sit and wait, someone will find me.</em></p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As Ted struggled to continue, he felt the great weight of his fatigue pushing him down.</p>
        <p>He slumped down in the snow. Two ridges over, a search party was on the move. They had been tracking Ted since a few hours after he had been separated from his friends. When they realized Ted was not with them, his friends immediately returned to the car and drove to a place where they could get a cell phone signal. A Ranger search party was on the scene within an hour.</p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I’ll wait.</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Since the beginning, the Rangers had been just behind Ted. He was never more than an hour or two from rescue. But the weather and Ted’s constant motion had left the Rangers struggling to keep up. They were amazed that he could keep going. If only he would stop for a while, they would soon catch up to him.</p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Someone will come soon.</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As Ted sat, his mind began to wander.</p>
        <p>25&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>&nbsp;A little boy walks through an aquarium with his classmates. He is a restless little boy, never wanting to linger at the exhibits like the other children.

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Ted snapped back into the present. He forced himself to stand on his wooden feet.</p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Keep going.</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;His brain <span class="txt-underline">foggy</span> with fatigue and cold, Ted mistakenly set off in the direction he had come, following his own footsteps as if they were a guide trail. It was the first good decision he had made in days.</p>

          <strong>Keep Going</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>My toes don’t hurt anymore. That’s not good.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;All day, Ted’s feet had been feeling like someone was slowly moving a blowtorch back and forth beneath his soles. But now he couldn’t feel his toes at all. When he removed a boot to take a look, Ted was surprised by the waxy, grayish color of his feet. His toes felt like small nubs of wood between his fingers. He decided that he had preferred the pain.</p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Keep going.</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The snowfall had been epic. Ted didn’t know such a snowfall was possible, but Ted had never hiked the Sierra Nevadas in winter before. In fact, he had never hiked any mountains before. Being a city boy, the nearest thing to a mountain Ted had hiked had been the time he had done the Empire State Building climb—an annual race up the stairs of the landmark skyscraper. It was an incredible challenge that did absolutely nothing to prepare Ted for hiking the Sierra Nevada mountains in winter.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>So tired. Keep going.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The trip had been ill planned from the beginning. Ted and a few friends from school had decided on a whim to drive up to the mountains for a day hike. They threw a few things into school knapsacks—energy bars, water bottles, gum—and hit the road. Nobody bothered to check the weather report.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>&nbsp;I should sit down. No—Keep going.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody was sure how Ted got separated from the group. Even Ted wasn’t sure. They had all been hiking down a trail together when Ted paused, just paused, ever so briefly to look at a deer in the distance. He had never seen a deer in the wild before, and it took him by surprise. It occurred to Ted to take a picture, but as he fumbled for his camera, the deer spooked and ran off. Disappointed, Ted turned back to his friends. They weren’t there.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>This looks familiar. No, maybe it doesn’t. Keep going.</em></p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Ted set off quickly down the path. He thought he’d just jog a bit to catch up to them. But he was soon presented with a fork in the path. Left or right? Ted listened briefly and thought he heard voices in that direction. To the left. He ran.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Am I absolutely sure I have nothing to make fire? Yes, I’m sure. Check again.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After running for a while, Ted stopped and listened. He heard a lot of sounds—birds, wind, maybe fl owing water, creaking tree limbs—but no voices. No laughing. No people. In a fl ash Ted remembered his cell phone. The wave of relief that washed over him made him realize how&nbsp; uncomfortably close he had been to panic. He’d call one of his friends and they’d figure out how to find each other. Ted flipped open his phone. “No Service.”</p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Last piece of gum. I’ll swallow it. At least I’ll have something in my stomach.</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of finding his friends, Ted decided to find his way back to the car. He knew that they had been hiking downhill and away from the sun, so it made sense to hike uphill toward the sun. Ted thought the ridge ahead looked familiar. He crested the ridge only to find another, identical ridge before him. And so it went.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>So tired. Find a place to sit. Maybe a little further.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Ted walked all that first day. When it got dark, he used his cell phone as a flashlight to stumble his way along. It was only after the battery died that Ted made a bed of pine boughs and lay down for a fitful sleep. He was up with the first light of dawn, moving.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>I’ve been here before. I’m going in circles. I should stop.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The second day was much the same as the first—except for the weather. The temperature began to drop and the sky took on a menacing look. The snow started just after noon. The blizzard raged on. It was in the midst of this hundred-year blizzard that Ted discovered that he could no longer feel his toes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Maybe if I just sit and wait, someone will find me.</em></p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As Ted struggled to continue, he felt the great weight of his fatigue pushing him down.</p>
        <p>He slumped down in the snow. Two ridges over, a search party was on the move. They had been tracking Ted since a few hours after he had been separated from his friends. When they realized Ted was not with them, his friends immediately returned to the car and drove to a place where they could get a cell phone signal. A Ranger search party was on the scene within an hour.</p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I’ll wait.</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Since the beginning, the Rangers had been just behind Ted. He was never more than an hour or two from rescue. But the weather and Ted’s constant motion had left the Rangers struggling to keep up. They were amazed that he could keep going. If only he would stop for a while, they would soon catch up to him.</p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Someone will come soon.</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As Ted sat, his mind began to wander.</p>
        <p>25&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>&nbsp;A little boy walks through an aquarium with his classmates. He is a restless little boy, never wanting to linger at the exhibits like the other children. He always wants to see what’s around the next corner. Around that next corner are sharks. The tour guide explains that most sharks must keep moving in order to breathe. This small bit of trivia nestles itself deep within the boy’s mind. It makes sense to him.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Ted snapped back into the present. He forced himself to stand on his wooden feet.</p>
        <p>
          <em>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Keep going.</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;His brain <span class="txt-underline">foggy</span> with fatigue and cold, Ted mistakenly set off in the direction he had come, following his own footsteps as if they were a guide trail. It was the first good decision he had made in days.</p>

          <strong>Hall of Mirrors</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">
          <em>by Frederic Brown</em>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They didn’t use that style of furniture in Los Angeles—or anywhere else that you know of—in 1954. That thing over in the corner—you can’t even guess what it is. So might your grandfather, at your age, have looked at a television set.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You look down at yourself, at the shimmering garment that you found waiting for you. With thumb and forefinger you feel its texture.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It’s like nothing you’ve ever touched before.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>I am Norman Hastings. This is nineteen hundred and fifty-four.</em></p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suddenly you must know, and at once.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You go to the desk and pick up the envelope that lies upon it. Your name is typed on the outside: <em>Norman Hastings.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your hands shake a little as you open it. Do you blame them?</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are several pages, typewritten. “Dear Norman,” it starts. You turn quickly to the end to look for the signature. It is unsigned.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You turn back and start reading.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Do not be afraid. There is nothing to fear, but much to explain. Much that you must understand before the time lock opens that door. Much that you must accept and—obey.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You have already guessed that you are in the future—in what, to you, seems to be the future. The clothes and the room must have told you that. I planned it that way so the shock would not be too sudden, so you would realize it over the course of several minutes rather than read it here—and quite probably disbelieve what you read.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“The ‘closet’ from which you have just stepped is, as you have by now realized, a time machine.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From it you stepped into the world of 2004. The date is April 7th, just fifty years from the time you last remember.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You cannot return.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I did this to you and you may hate me for it; I do not know. That is up to you to decide, but it does not matter. What does matter, and not to you alone, is another decision which you must make.&nbsp;I am incapable of making it.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Who is writing this to you? I would rather not tell you just yet. By the time you have finished reading this, even though it is not signed (for I knew you would look first for a signature), I will not need to tell you who I am. You will know.</p>

          <em>by Frederic Brown</em>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They didn’t use that style of furniture in Los Angeles—or anywhere else that you know of—in 1954. That thing over in the corner—you can’t even guess what it is. So might your grandfather, at your age, have looked at a television set.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You look down at yourself, at the shimmering garment that you found waiting for you. With thumb and forefinger you feel its texture.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It’s like nothing you’ve ever touched before.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>I am Norman Hastings. This is nineteen hundred and fifty-four.</em></p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suddenly you must know, and at once.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You go to the desk and pick up the envelope that lies upon it. Your name is typed on the outside: <em>Norman Hastings.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your hands shake a little as you open it. Do you blame them?</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are several pages, typewritten. “Dear Norman,” it starts. You turn quickly to the end to look for the signature. It is unsigned.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You turn back and start reading.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Do not be afraid. There is nothing to fear, but much to explain. Much that you must understand before the time lock opens that door. Much that you must accept and—obey.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You have already guessed that you are in the future—in what, to you, seems to be the future. The clothes and the room must have told you that. I planned it that way so the shock would not be too sudden, so you would realize it over the course of several minutes rather than read it here—and quite probably disbelieve what you read.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“The ‘closet’ from which you have just stepped is, as you have by now realized, a time machine.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From it you stepped into the world of 2004. The date is April 7th, just fifty years from the time you last remember.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You cannot return.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I did this to you and you may hate me for it; I do not know. That is up to you to decide, but it does not matter. What does matter, and not to you alone, is another decision which you must make.&nbsp;I am incapable of making it.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Who is writing this to you? I would rather not tell you just yet. By the time you have finished reading this, even though it is not signed (for I knew you would look first for a signature), I will not need to tell you who I am. You will know.</p>

        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They didn’t use that style of furniture in Los Angeles—or anywhere else that you know of—in 1954. That thing over in the corner—you can’t even guess what it is. So might your grandfather, at your age, have looked at a television set.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You look down at yourself, at the shimmering garment that you found waiting for you. With thumb and forefinger you feel its texture.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It’s like nothing you’ve ever touched before.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>I am Norman Hastings. This is nineteen hundred and fifty-four.</em></p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Suddenly you must know, and at once.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You go to the desk and pick up the envelope that lies upon it. Your name is typed on the outside: <em>Norman Hastings.</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your hands shake a little as you open it. Do you blame them?</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are several pages, typewritten. “Dear Norman,” it starts. You turn quickly to the end to look for the signature. It is unsigned.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You turn back and start reading.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Do not be afraid. There is nothing to fear, but much to explain. Much that you must understand before the time lock opens that door. Much that you must accept and—obey.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You have already guessed that you are in the future—in what, to you, seems to be the future. The clothes and the room must have told you that. I planned it that way so the shock would not be too sudden, so you would realize it over the course of several minutes rather than read it here—and quite probably disbelieve what you read.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“The ‘closet’ from which you have just stepped is, as you have by now realized, a time machine.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From it you stepped into the world of 2004. The date is April 7th, just fifty years from the time you last remember.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“You cannot return.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I did this to you and you may hate me for it; I do not know. That is up to you to decide, but it does not matter. What does matter, and not to you alone, is another decision which you must make.&nbsp;I am incapable of making it.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Who is writing this to you? I would rather not tell you just yet. By the time you have finished reading this, even though it is not signed (for I knew you would look first for a signature), I will not need to tell you who I am. You will know.</p>

        <p>Sarah’s Russian Adventure</p>
        <p>by Mary R. Wood</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Finally, we’re in Russia,” Sarah wrote in her diary. “I really want to be a journalist just like Mom.</p>
        <p>I’d like to travel around the world and make lots of friends.” Sarah closed her diary, eager to begin her day.</p>
        <p>It was an unusually warm winter day in Moscow, 1987, and Sarah was glad that her mother wanted her to go to the bakery. The hardened mounds of coal-blackened snow were melting into deep, muddy puddles. Sarah couldn’t resist wading through them in her new boots. She pulled off her hand-knitted red sweater, a gift for her ninth birthday from her grandmother, and stuffed it into her tote bag.</p>
        <p>Sarah ran down the wide sidewalk of Leninskiy <strong><em>Prospekt</em></strong> but stopped to marvel at an unusual pink building that took up a whole block. Everything is so big and different in Moscow, she thought, wishing she could linger to take in her strange new surroundings. But she needed to get to the bakery.</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="92%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766030251/obdx8lve5eltdi1dbup1.png" alt="PSTT10_RC_25_1">


        </p>
        <p>To Sarah, Russian stores seemed so strange. The bakeries sold only baked goods, milk stores sold only milk, and meat stores sold only meat. What they need here, she thought, is a supermarket.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sarah sniffed at the aroma of freshly baked bread as she walked into the bakery. She smiled at a blond girl standing next to her mother. The girl followed Sarah with her ice-blue eyes until her mother pulled her away. Doesn’t anyone smile here? Sarah wondered.</p>
        <p>But at least, after two weeks in Moscow, Sarah felt she was now an expert at selecting bread. Just like the Russians she had seen testing bread, Sarah wanted to make sure that she got a fresh loaf. She poked her finger into a loaf of bread to check its freshness. A robust, kerchiefed woman frowned and shook her head, saying, “Nyet, nyet.” She handed Sarah a bent metal spoon with which to test the bread.</p>
        <p>Sarah tried not to laugh at the silly-looking spoon. “Thank you. <em><strong>Spasibo</strong></em>,” she said to the sullen-faced woman. She was proud that she spoke a few words in Russian. She already knew how to say yes (<em>da</em>), no (<em>nyet</em>), and thank you (<em>spasibo</em>).</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="92%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766030250/s8xgsvryhxgacxqflvsu.png" alt="PSTT10_RC_25_2">


        </p>
        <p>With two loaves of warm bread tucked under her arm, Sarah weaved her way to the cashier, only to find a long line of people. She stood at the end of the line and waited patiently. The line moved quickly. Sarah laid the bread on the counter, smiled, and handed her money to the ruddy-faced cashier. Without even a polite nod, the cashier dropped Sarah’s change into the metal dish.</p>
        <p>Sarah noticed many people gathering up packages on the other side of the store. She stuffed the bread into her bag and went over to satisfy her curiosity. As she entered this section of the store, she noticed that it had its own cashier. She picked up a blue paper-wrapped package, squeezed it and smelled it, but couldn’t guess what was inside. Shrugging her shoulders, she put it back into the wooden bin and headed toward the exit.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Above the noise of the hustle and bustle, someone in the store was shouting, <em>“Devochka, devochka!”</em> And as she went out the door, Sarah noticed some shoppers staring at her. Maybe they can tell I’m an American because of my clothes, she thought. They don’t look very friendly, though.</p>
        <p>Then Sarah heard running footsteps behind her. She swung around to see a big woman <strong>barreling</strong> toward her. The woman was shouting and shaking her finger at Sarah. Frightened, Sarah clutched her tote bag and began running as fast as she could. What does the woman want? she wondered. What did I do to get her angry?</p>
        <p>Sarah knew that a policeman could not be far away. In Moscow a policeman stood at almost every corner. Sarah ran up to the first one she saw. “Please help me!” she cried. “That lady is chasing me, and I don’t know why! I didn’t do anything wrong!”</p>
        <p>The tall policeman stooped down to speak to her. Sarah didn’t understand his Russian, nor did the policeman understand Sarah’s English.</p>
        <p>As the woman approached, Sarah hid behind the policeman. Huffing and puffing, the woman babbled on and on in Russian and pointed at Sarah’s bag.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sarah didn’t know what the woman was saying but knew she wanted something. Her two loaves of bread? But they were for her mother!</p>
        <p>“This is mine,” Sarah said, clutching her tote bag. “And my name isn’t <em>Devochka</em>. It’s Sarah.”</p>
        <p>The policeman held out his hand. Reluctantly, Sarah handed him her tote bag. He opened it in front of the woman, who stared inside. Then, puzzled, she shrugged her shoulders and walked away.</p>
        <p>The policeman handed back Sarah’s bag and gently motioned her to go.</p>
        <p>Sarah sighed and took her bag. As she continued home, she checked her tote bag and discovered that her sweater was missing. “My sweater. Oh no! I lost my sweater?” cried Sarah aloud. But I’m not going back there, she thought looking over her shoulder. That lady is crazy. What will I do now? Mom will kill me.</p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp; Feeling miserable, Sarah slowly walked home, wondering what could have happened. What will Grandma say? She worried, walking slower and slower.</p>
        <p>Then Sarah felt a tap on her shoulder. It was the Russian girl with the blond hair and the ice-blue eyes. She handed Sarah a sweater—Sarah’s red sweater that Grandma had made. “This is yours,” the Russian girl said.</p>
        <p>Sarah’s eyes widened in disbelief. “Where did you find it?”</p>
        <p>“In bread store,” said the Russian girl. “It fell from your bag.”</p>
        <p>“Thank you. <em>Spasibo</em>! You speak good English. What’s your name?”</p>
        <p>25 “Natasha.”</p>
        <p>“I’m Sarah. I don’t know why that lady was chasing me. She thought I was someone named <em>Devochka</em>.”</p>
        <p>“You are <em>devochka</em>,” said Natasha, grinning. “It means ‘young girl.’ You did wrong. I saw you pass cashier in candy section. You not open your bag for her and say nichevo. Cashier thought you take something and not pay. Next time you know. Yes?”</p>
        <p>“Da. I guess so. You have funny customs here in Russia.”</p>
        <p>“They are not funny to us,” Natasha replied. “I will be proud to tell you about our customs and also teach you more words. But I go now. See you tomorrow at bakery. Same time, yes?”</p>
        <p>30 “O.K., I’ll see you then.” Sarah hurried home clutching the sweater in one hand, her tote bag with the bread in the other. She couldn’t wait to write in her diary about today’s adventure and about her new friend, Natasha.</p>

        <p>Sarah’s Russian Adventure</p>

        <p>Then Sarah heard running footsteps behind her. She swung around to see a big woman <strong>barreling</strong> toward her. The woman was shouting and shaking her finger at Sarah. Frightened, Sarah clutched her tote bag and began running as fast as she could. What does the woman want? she wondered. What did I do to get her angry?</p>
        <p>Sarah knew that a policeman could not be far away. In Moscow a policeman stood at almost every corner. Sarah ran up to the first one she saw. “Please help me!” she cried. “That lady is chasing me, and I don’t know why! I didn’t do anything wrong!”</p>
        <p>The tall policeman stooped down to speak to her. Sarah didn’t understand his Russian, nor did the policeman understand Sarah’s English.</p>
        <p>As the woman approached, Sarah hid behind the policeman. Huffing and puffing, the woman babbled on and on in Russian and pointed at Sarah’s bag.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sarah didn’t know what the woman was saying but knew she wanted something. Her two loaves of bread? But they were for her mother!</p>
        <p>“This is mine,” Sarah said, clutching her tote bag. “And my name isn’t <em>Devochka</em>. It’s Sarah.”</p>
        <p>The policeman held out his hand. Reluctantly, Sarah handed him her tote bag. He opened it in front of the woman, who stared inside. Then, puzzled, she shrugged her shoulders and walked away.</p>
        <p>The policeman handed back Sarah’s bag and gently motioned her to go.</p>
        <p>Sarah sighed and took her bag. As she continued home, she checked her tote bag and discovered that her sweater was missing. “My sweater. Oh no! I lost my sweater?” cried Sarah aloud. But I’m not going back there, she thought looking over her shoulder. That lady is crazy. What will I do now? Mom will kill me.</p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp; Feeling miserable, Sarah slowly walked home, wondering what could have happened. What will Grandma say? She worried, walking slower and slower.</p>
        <p>Then Sarah felt a tap on her shoulder. It was the Russian girl with the blond hair and the ice-blue eyes. She handed Sarah a sweater—Sarah’s red sweater that Grandma had made. “This is yours,” the Russian girl said.</p>
        <p>Sarah’s eyes widened in disbelief. “Where did you find it?”</p>
        <p>“In bread store,” said the Russian girl. “It fell from your bag.”</p>
        <p>“Thank you. <em>Spasibo</em>! You speak good English. What’s your name?”</p>
        <p>25 “Natasha.”</p>
        <p>“I’m Sarah. I don’t know why that lady was chasing me. She thought I was someone named <em>Devochka</em>.”</p>
        <p>“You are <em>devochka</em>,” said Natasha, grinning. “It means ‘young girl.’ You did wrong. I saw you pass cashier in candy section. You not open your bag for her and say nichevo. Cashier thought you take something and not pay. Next time you know. Yes?”</p>
        <p>“Da. I guess so. You have funny customs here in Russia.”</p>
        <p>“They are not funny to us,” Natasha replied. “I will be proud to tell you about our customs and also teach you more words. But I go now. See you tomorrow at bakery. Same time, yes?”</p>
        <p>30 “O.K., I’ll see you then.” Sarah hurried home clutching the sweater in one hand, her tote bag with the bread in the other. She couldn’t wait to write in her diary about today’s adventure and about her new friend, Natasha.</p>

        <p>Sarah’s Russian Adventure</p>
        <p>by Mary R. Wood</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Finally, we’re in Russia,” Sarah wrote in her diary. “I really want to be a journalist just like Mom.</p>
        <p>I’d like to travel around the world and make lots of friends.” Sarah closed her diary, eager to begin her day.</p>
        <p>It was an unusually warm winter day in Moscow, 1987, and Sarah was glad that her mother wanted her to go to the bakery. The hardened mounds of coal-blackened snow were melting into deep, muddy puddles. Sarah couldn’t resist wading through them in her new boots. She pulled off her hand-knitted red sweater, a gift for her ninth birthday from her grandmother, and stuffed it into her tote bag.</p>
        <p>Sarah ran down the wide sidewalk of Leninskiy <strong><em>Prospekt</em></strong> but stopped to marvel at an unusual pink building that took up a whole block. Everything is so big and different in Moscow, she thought, wishing she could linger to take in her strange new surroundings. But she needed to get to the bakery.</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="92%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766032423/pu6cvkoik3l8q8ffuzkg.png" alt="PSTT10_RC_25_1">


        </p>
        <p>To Sarah, Russian stores seemed so strange. The bakeries sold only baked goods, milk stores sold only milk, and meat stores sold only meat. What they need here, she thought, is a supermarket.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sarah sniffed at the aroma of freshly baked bread as she walked into the bakery. She smiled at a blond girl standing next to her mother. The girl followed Sarah with her ice-blue eyes until her mother pulled her away. Doesn’t anyone smile here? Sarah wondered.</p>
        <p>But at least, after two weeks in Moscow, Sarah felt she was now an expert at selecting bread. Just like the Russians she had seen testing bread, Sarah wanted to make sure that she got a fresh loaf. She poked her finger into a loaf of bread to check its freshness. A robust, kerchiefed woman frowned and shook her head, saying, “Nyet, nyet.” She handed Sarah a bent metal spoon with which to test the bread.</p>
        <p>Sarah tried not to laugh at the silly-looking spoon. “Thank you. <em><strong>Spasibo</strong></em>,” she said to the sullen-faced woman. She was proud that she spoke a few words in Russian. She already knew how to say yes (<em>da</em>), no (<em>nyet</em>), and thank you (<em>spasibo</em>).</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="92%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766032422/wor0u9c7tw1x1ffg9ehq.png" alt="PSTT10_RC_25_2">


        </p>
        <p>With two loaves of warm bread tucked under her arm, Sarah weaved her way to the cashier, only to find a long line of people. She stood at the end of the line and waited patiently. The line moved quickly. Sarah laid the bread on the counter, smiled, and handed her money to the ruddy-faced cashier. Without even a polite nod, the cashier dropped Sarah’s change into the metal dish.</p>
        <p>Sarah noticed many people gathering up packages on the other side of the store. She stuffed the bread into her bag and went over to satisfy her curiosity. As she entered this section of the store, she noticed that it had its own cashier. She picked up a blue paper-wrapped package, squeezed it and smelled it, but couldn’t guess what was inside. Shrugging her shoulders, she put it back into the wooden bin and headed toward the exit.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Above the noise of the hustle and bustle, someone in the store was shouting, <em>“Devochka, devochka!”</em> And as she went out the door, Sarah noticed some shoppers staring at her. Maybe they can tell I’m an American because of my clothes, she thought. They don’t look very friendly, though.</p>
        <p>Then Sarah heard running footsteps behind her. She swung around to see a big woman <strong>barreling</strong> toward her. The woman was shouting and shaking her finger at Sarah. Frightened, Sarah clutched her tote bag and began running as fast as she could. What does the woman want? she wondered. What did I do to get her angry?</p>
        <p>Sarah knew that a policeman could not be far away. In Moscow a policeman stood at almost every corner. Sarah ran up to the first one she saw. “Please help me!” she cried. “That lady is chasing me, and I don’t know why! I didn’t do anything wrong!”</p>
        <p>The tall policeman stooped down to speak to her. Sarah didn’t understand his Russian, nor did the policeman understand Sarah’s English.</p>
        <p>As the woman approached, Sarah hid behind the policeman. Huffing and puffing, the woman babbled on and on in Russian and pointed at Sarah’s bag.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sarah didn’t know what the woman was saying but knew she wanted something. Her two loaves of bread? But they were for her mother!</p>
        <p>“This is mine,” Sarah said, clutching her tote bag. “And my name isn’t <em>Devochka</em>. It’s Sarah.”</p>

        <p>“Thank you. <em>Spasibo</em>! You speak good English. What’s your name?”</p>
        <p>25 “Natasha.”</p>
        <p>“I’m Sarah. I don’t know why that lady was chasing me. She thought I was someone named <em>Devochka</em>.”</p>
        <p>“You are <em>devochka</em>,” said Natasha, grinning. “It means ‘young girl.’ You did wrong. I saw you pass cashier in candy section. You not open your bag for her and say nichevo. Cashier thought you take something and not pay. Next time you know. Yes?”</p>

        <p>Sarah’s Russian Adventure</p>
        <p>by Mary R. Wood</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Finally, we’re in Russia,” Sarah wrote in her diary. “I really want to be a journalist just like Mom.</p>
        <p>I’d like to travel around the world and make lots of friends.” Sarah closed her diary, eager to begin her day.</p>
        <p>It was an unusually warm winter day in Moscow, 1987, and Sarah was glad that her mother wanted her to go to the bakery. The hardened mounds of coal-blackened snow were melting into deep, muddy puddles. Sarah couldn’t resist wading through them in her new boots. She pulled off her hand-knitted red sweater, a gift for her ninth birthday from her grandmother, and stuffed it into her tote bag.</p>
        <p>Sarah ran down the wide sidewalk of Leninskiy <strong><em>Prospekt</em></strong> but stopped to marvel at an unusual pink building that took up a whole block. Everything is so big and different in Moscow, she thought, wishing she could linger to take in her strange new surroundings. But she needed to get to the bakery.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>To Sarah, Russian stores seemed so strange. The bakeries sold only baked goods, milk stores sold only milk, and meat stores sold only meat. What they need here, she thought, is a supermarket.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sarah sniffed at the aroma of freshly baked bread as she walked into the bakery. She smiled at a blond girl standing next to her mother. The girl followed Sarah with her ice-blue eyes until her mother pulled her away. Doesn’t anyone smile here? Sarah wondered.</p>
        <p>But at least, after two weeks in Moscow, Sarah felt she was now an expert at selecting bread. Just like the Russians she had seen testing bread, Sarah wanted to make sure that she got a fresh loaf. She poked her finger into a loaf of bread to check its freshness. A robust, kerchiefed woman frowned and shook her head, saying, “Nyet, nyet.” She handed Sarah a bent metal spoon with which to test the bread.</p>
        <p>Sarah tried not to laugh at the silly-looking spoon. “Thank you. <em><strong>Spasibo</strong></em>,” she said to the sullen-faced woman. She was proud that she spoke a few words in Russian. She already knew how to say yes (<em>da</em>), no (<em>nyet</em>), and thank you (<em>spasibo</em>).</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="92%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766023338/hslsuhju3du0z1sspjl7.png" alt="PSTT10_RC_25_2">


        </p>
        <p>With two loaves of warm bread tucked under her arm, Sarah weaved her way to the cashier, only to find a long line of people. She stood at the end of the line and waited patiently. The line moved quickly. Sarah laid the bread on the counter, smiled, and handed her money to the ruddy-faced cashier. Without even a polite nod, the cashier dropped Sarah’s change into the metal dish.</p>
        <p>Sarah noticed many people gathering up packages on the other side of the store. She stuffed the bread into her bag and went over to satisfy her curiosity. As she entered this section of the store, she noticed that it had its own cashier. She picked up a blue paper-wrapped package, squeezed it and smelled it, but couldn’t guess what was inside. Shrugging her shoulders, she put it back into the wooden bin and headed toward the exit.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Above the noise of the hustle and bustle, someone in the store was shouting, <em>“Devochka, devochka!”</em> And as she went out the door, Sarah noticed some shoppers staring at her. Maybe they can tell I’m an American because of my clothes, she thought. They don’t look very friendly, though.</p>
        <p>Then Sarah heard running footsteps behind her. She swung around to see a big woman <strong>barreling</strong> toward her. The woman was shouting and shaking her finger at Sarah. Frightened, Sarah clutched her tote bag and began running as fast as she could. What does the woman want? she wondered. What did I do to get her angry?</p>
        <p>Sarah knew that a policeman could not be far away. In Moscow a policeman stood at almost every corner. Sarah ran up to the first one she saw. “Please help me!” she cried. “That lady is chasing me, and I don’t know why! I didn’t do anything wrong!”</p>
        <p>The tall policeman stooped down to speak to her. Sarah didn’t understand his Russian, nor did the policeman understand Sarah’s English.</p>
        <p>As the woman approached, Sarah hid behind the policeman. Huffing and puffing, the woman babbled on and on in Russian and pointed at Sarah’s bag.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sarah didn’t know what the woman was saying but knew she wanted something. Her two loaves of bread? But they were for her mother!</p>
        <p>“This is mine,” Sarah said, clutching her tote bag. “And my name isn’t <em>Devochka</em>. It’s Sarah.”</p>
        <p>The policeman held out his hand. Reluctantly, Sarah handed him her tote bag. He opened it in front of the woman, who stared inside. Then, puzzled, she shrugged her shoulders and walked away.</p>
        <p>The policeman handed back Sarah’s bag and gently motioned her to go.</p>
        <p>Sarah sighed and took her bag. As she continued home, she checked her tote bag and discovered that her sweater was missing. “My sweater. Oh no! I lost my sweater?” cried Sarah aloud. But I’m not going back there, she thought looking over her shoulder. That lady is crazy. What will I do now? Mom will kill me.</p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp; Feeling miserable, Sarah slowly walked home, wondering what could have happened. What will Grandma say? She worried, walking slower and slower.</p>
        <p>Then Sarah felt a tap on her shoulder. It was the Russian girl with the blond hair and the ice-blue eyes. She handed Sarah a sweater—Sarah’s red sweater that Grandma had made. “This is yours,” the Russian girl said.</p>
        <p>Sarah’s eyes widened in disbelief. “Where did you find it?”</p>
        <p>“In bread store,” said the Russian girl. “It fell from your bag.”</p>
        <p>“Thank you. <em>Spasibo</em>! You speak good English. What’s your name?”</p>
        <p>25 “Natasha.”</p>
        <p>“I’m Sarah. I don’t know why that lady was chasing me. She thought I was someone named <em>Devochka</em>.”</p>
        <p>“You are <em>devochka</em>,” said Natasha, grinning. “It means ‘young girl.’ You did wrong. I saw you pass cashier in candy section. You not open your bag for her and say nichevo. Cashier thought you take something and not pay. Next time you know. Yes?”</p>
        <p>“Da. I guess so. You have funny customs here in Russia.”</p>
        <p>“They are not funny to us,” Natasha replied. “I will be proud to tell you about our customs and also teach you more words. But I go now. See you tomorrow at bakery. Same time, yes?”</p>
        <p>30 “O.K., I’ll see you then.” Sarah hurried home clutching the sweater in one hand, her tote bag with the bread in the other. She couldn’t wait to write in her diary about today’s adventure and about her new friend, Natasha.</p>

        <p>Sarah’s Russian Adventure</p>
        <p>by Mary R. Wood</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“Finally, we’re in Russia,” Sarah wrote in her diary. “I really want to be a journalist just like Mom.</p>
        <p>I’d like to travel around the world and make lots of friends.” Sarah closed her diary, eager to begin her day.</p>
        <p>It was an unusually warm winter day in Moscow, 1987, and Sarah was glad that her mother wanted her to go to the bakery. The hardened mounds of coal-blackened snow were melting into deep, muddy puddles. Sarah couldn’t resist wading through them in her new boots. She pulled off her hand-knitted red sweater, a gift for her ninth birthday from her grandmother, and stuffed it into her tote bag.</p>
        <p>Sarah ran down the wide sidewalk of Leninskiy <strong><em>Prospekt</em></strong> but stopped to marvel at an unusual pink building that took up a whole block. Everything is so big and different in Moscow, she thought, wishing she could linger to take in her strange new surroundings. But she needed to get to the bakery.</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="92%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766046857/vilyfbn73fmcgl79uxg9.png" alt="PSTT10_RC_25_1">


        </p>
        <p>To Sarah, Russian stores seemed so strange. The bakeries sold only baked goods, milk stores sold only milk, and meat stores sold only meat. What they need here, she thought, is a supermarket.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sarah sniffed at the aroma of freshly baked bread as she walked into the bakery. She smiled at a blond girl standing next to her mother. The girl followed Sarah with her ice-blue eyes until her mother pulled her away. Doesn’t anyone smile here? Sarah wondered.</p>
        <p>But at least, after two weeks in Moscow, Sarah felt she was now an expert at selecting bread. Just like the Russians she had seen testing bread, Sarah wanted to make sure that she got a fresh loaf. She poked her finger into a loaf of bread to check its freshness. A robust, kerchiefed woman frowned and shook her head, saying, “Nyet, nyet.” She handed Sarah a bent metal spoon with which to test the bread.</p>
        <p>Sarah tried not to laugh at the silly-looking spoon. “Thank you. <em><strong>Spasibo</strong></em>,” she said to the sullen-faced woman. She was proud that she spoke a few words in Russian. She already knew how to say yes (<em>da</em>), no (<em>nyet</em>), and thank you (<em>spasibo</em>).</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="92%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766046856/wb8260f3uoqty47aw68h.png" alt="PSTT10_RC_25_2">


        </p>
        <p>With two loaves of warm bread tucked under her arm, Sarah weaved her way to the cashier, only to find a long line of people. She stood at the end of the line and waited patiently. The line moved quickly. Sarah laid the bread on the counter, smiled, and handed her money to the ruddy-faced cashier. Without even a polite nod, the cashier dropped Sarah’s change into the metal dish.</p>
        <p>Sarah noticed many people gathering up packages on the other side of the store. She stuffed the bread into her bag and went over to satisfy her curiosity. As she entered this section of the store, she noticed that it had its own cashier. She picked up a blue paper-wrapped package, squeezed it and smelled it, but couldn’t guess what was inside. Shrugging her shoulders, she put it back into the wooden bin and headed toward the exit.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Above the noise of the hustle and bustle, someone in the store was shouting, <em>“Devochka, devochka!”</em> And as she went out the door, Sarah noticed some shoppers staring at her. Maybe they can tell I’m an American because of my clothes, she thought. They don’t look very friendly, though.</p>
        <p>Then Sarah heard running footsteps behind her. She swung around to see a big woman <strong>barreling</strong> toward her. The woman was shouting and shaking her finger at Sarah. Frightened, Sarah clutched her tote bag and began running as fast as she could. What does the woman want? she wondered. What did I do to get her angry?</p>
        <p>Sarah knew that a policeman could not be far away. In Moscow a policeman stood at almost every corner. Sarah ran up to the first one she saw. “Please help me!” she cried. “That lady is chasing me, and I don’t know why! I didn’t do anything wrong!”</p>
        <p>The tall policeman stooped down to speak to her. Sarah didn’t understand his Russian, nor did the policeman understand Sarah’s English.</p>
        <p>As the woman approached, Sarah hid behind the policeman. Huffing and puffing, the woman babbled on and on in Russian and pointed at Sarah’s bag.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sarah didn’t know what the woman was saying but knew she wanted something. Her two loaves of bread? But they were for her mother!</p>
        <p>“This is mine,” Sarah said, clutching her tote bag. “And my name isn’t <em>Devochka</em>. It’s Sarah.”</p>
        <p>The policeman held out his hand. Reluctantly, Sarah handed him her tote bag. He opened it in front of the woman, who stared inside. Then, puzzled, she shrugged her shoulders and walked away.</p>
        <p>The policeman handed back Sarah’s bag and gently motioned her to go.</p>
        <p>Sarah sighed and took her bag. As she continued home, she checked her tote bag and discovered that her sweater was missing. “My sweater. Oh no! I lost my sweater?” cried Sarah aloud. But I’m not going back there, she thought looking over her shoulder. That lady is crazy. What will I do now? Mom will kill me.</p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp; Feeling miserable, Sarah slowly walked home, wondering what could have happened. What will Grandma say? She worried, walking slower and slower.</p>
        <p>Then Sarah felt a tap on her shoulder. It was the Russian girl with the blond hair and the ice-blue eyes. She handed Sarah a sweater—Sarah’s red sweater that Grandma had made. “This is yours,” the Russian girl said.</p>
        <p>Sarah’s eyes widened in disbelief. “Where did you find it?”</p>
        <p>“In bread store,” said the Russian girl. “It fell from your bag.”</p>
        <p>“Thank you. <em>Spasibo</em>! You speak good English. What’s your name?”</p>
        <p>25 “Natasha.”</p>
        <p>“I’m Sarah. I don’t know why that lady was chasing me. She thought I was someone named <em>Devochka</em>.”</p>
        <p>“You are <em>devochka</em>,” said Natasha, grinning. “It means ‘young girl.’ You did wrong. I saw you pass cashier in candy section. You not open your bag for her and say nichevo. Cashier thought you take something and not pay. Next time you know. Yes?”</p>
        <p>“Da. I guess so. You have funny customs here in Russia.”</p>
        <p>“They are not funny to us,” Natasha replied. “I will be proud to tell you about our customs and also teach you more words. But I go now. See you tomorrow at bakery. Same time, yes?”</p>
        <p>30 “O.K., I’ll see you then.” Sarah hurried home clutching the sweater in one hand, her tote bag with the bread in the other. She couldn’t wait to write in her diary about today’s adventure and about her new friend, Natasha.</p>

          <strong>The Deepest Place on Earth</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You may know that the highest place on Earth is the top of a mountain named Mt. Everest, but do you know what the deepest place on Earth is? It is a very unusual place called the Mariana Trench.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mariana Trench is located in the Pacific Ocean, south of Japan. It is named the Mariana Trench because it is near the Mariana Islands.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mariana Trench is like an enormous ditch at the bottom of the ocean. The trench is over 1,500 miles long, and some parts of the trench are 40 miles wide. If you could dive to the bottom of the trench, you would be over 35,000 feet deep. That is almost seven miles below the surface of the ocean!</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In fact, the Mariana Trench is so big and deep that Mt. Everest could fit inside the trench. And if Mt. Everest were inside the trench, there would still be about 7,000 feet of water between the top of the mountain and the surface of the ocean.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The water in the trench is so cold it is almost freezing. Some areas in the trench are very hot, though. These areas are called <strong>hydrothermal vents</strong>. The vents are openings in the earth through which very hot water shoots up through the ocean floor like smoke from a chimney. The water from the vents is so hot that in some places it is over 500°F (that is 300°C)!</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So can anything live in this very deep place where the water is either very cold or very hot? Let’s take a closer look.</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>Life at the Bottom</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>In the Mariana Trench there is no sunlight because the sun’s rays cannot reach so far down into the water. Without light, no plants can grow in the trench.</p>
        <p>There are some unusual animals that live here, though. These are animals that depend on senses other than sight to help them move around and find food. There are special types of crabs, clams, shrimps, and worms that live near the vents. Some of these animals can even produce light with&nbsp;a part of their body. One of these animals is the deep sea anglerfish. This fish is only about&nbsp; 5 inches long, but it is very scary-looking. It has a large mouth with very long sharp teeth. It cannot swim fast, but that is not a problem because the anglerfish has a body part called a photophore. The photophore sticks out from the head of the anglerfish and hangs over its mouth. It is a very special body part because it produces a blue-green light. When the anglerfish waves the light back and forth in the dark water, other fish come over for a look. When a fish comes too close, the anglerfish opens its huge mouth and captures its food!</p>
        <p>There is a lot going on in the Mariana Trench. It is very dangerous, though, for human divers to study the trench. So there is still much to be learned about the deepest place on Earth.</p>

          <strong>The Deepest Place on Earth</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You may know that the highest place on Earth is the top of a mountain named Mt. Everest, but do you know what the deepest place on Earth is? It is a very unusual place called the Mariana Trench.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mariana Trench is located in the Pacific Ocean, south of Japan. It is named the Mariana Trench because it is near the Mariana Islands.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mariana Trench is like an enormous ditch at the bottom of the ocean. The trench is over 1,500 miles long, and some parts of the trench are 40 miles wide. If you could dive to the bottom of the trench, you would be over 35,000 feet deep. That is almost seven miles below the surface of the ocean!</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In fact, the Mariana Trench is so big and deep that Mt. Everest could fit inside the trench. And if Mt. Everest were inside the trench, there would still be about 7,000 feet of water between the top of the mountain and the surface of the ocean.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The water in the trench is so cold it is almost freezing. Some areas in the trench are very hot, though. These areas are called <strong>hydrothermal vents</strong>. The vents are openings in the earth through which very hot water shoots up through the ocean floor like smoke from a chimney. The water from the vents is so hot that in some places it is over 500°F (that is 300°C)!</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So can anything live in this very deep place where the water is either very cold or very hot? Let’s take a closer look.</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>Life at the Bottom</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>In the Mariana Trench there is no sunlight because the sun’s rays cannot reach so far down into the water. Without light, no plants can grow in the trench.</p>
        <p>There are some unusual animals that live here, though. These are animals that depend on senses other than sight to help them move around and find food. There are special types of crabs, clams, shrimps, and worms that live near the vents. Some of these animals can even produce light with&nbsp;a part of their body. One of these animals is the deep sea anglerfish. This fish is only about&nbsp; 5 inches long, but it is very scary-looking. It has a large mouth with very long sharp teeth. It cannot swim fast, but that is not a problem because the anglerfish has a body part called a photophore. The photophore sticks out from the head of the anglerfish and hangs over its mouth. It is a very special body part because it produces a blue-green light. When the anglerfish waves the light back and forth in the dark water, other fish come over for a look. When a fish comes too close, the anglerfish opens its huge mouth and captures its food!</p>
        <p>There is a lot going on in the Mariana Trench. It is very dangerous, though, for human divers to study the trench. So there is still much to be learned about the deepest place on Earth.</p>

        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You may know that the highest place on Earth is the top of a mountain named Mt. Everest, but do you know what the deepest place on Earth is? It is a very unusual place called the Mariana Trench.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mariana Trench is located in the Pacific Ocean, south of Japan. It is named the Mariana Trench because it is near the Mariana Islands.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mariana Trench is like an enormous ditch at the bottom of the ocean. The trench is over 1,500 miles long, and some parts of the trench are 40 miles wide. If you could dive to the bottom of the trench, you would be over 35,000 feet deep. That is almost seven miles below the surface of the ocean!</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In fact, the Mariana Trench is so big and deep that Mt. Everest could fit inside the trench. And if Mt. Everest were inside the trench, there would still be about 7,000 feet of water between the top of the mountain and the surface of the ocean.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The water in the trench is so cold it is almost freezing. Some areas in the trench are very hot, though. These areas are called <strong>hydrothermal vents</strong>. The vents are openings in the earth through which very hot water shoots up through the ocean floor like smoke from a chimney. The water from the vents is so hot that in some places it is over 500°F (that is 300°C)!</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So can anything live in this very deep place where the water is either very cold or very hot? Let’s take a closer look.</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">
            <strong>Life at the Bottom</strong>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>In the Mariana Trench there is no sunlight because the sun’s rays cannot reach so far down into the water. Without light, no plants can grow in the trench.</p>
        <p>There are some unusual animals that live here, though. These are animals that depend on senses other than sight to help them move around and find food. There are special types of crabs, clams, shrimps, and worms that live near the vents. Some of these animals can even produce light with&nbsp;a part of their body. One of these animals is the deep sea anglerfish. This fish is only about&nbsp; 5 inches long, but it is very scary-looking. It has a large mouth with very long sharp teeth. It cannot swim fast, but that is not a problem because the anglerfish has a body part called a photophore. The photophore sticks out from the head of the anglerfish and hangs over its mouth. It is a very special body part because it produces a blue-green light. When the anglerfish waves the light back and forth in the dark water, other fish come over for a look. When a fish comes too close, the anglerfish opens its huge mouth and captures its food!</p>
        <p>There is a lot going on in the Mariana Trench. It is very dangerous, though, for human divers to study the trench. So there is still much to be learned about the deepest place on Earth.</p>

          <strong>Holiday Safety Tips</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Frenzied holiday shopping adds to the magic of the season. However, crowded malls and stores are prime targets for purse snatchers, pick pockets and thieves.</p>
        <p>Holiday shoppers are easy prey because they carry more cash than usual, use credit cards more frequently and become distracted by the hunt for that perfect gift.</p>
        <p>Check this list twice to protect your holiday treasures:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Park your car in a well-lit area. Check under and inside your car before getting in.</li>
          <li>Don’t shop alone. Shopping with a friend or family member is more fun and safer, too.</li>
          <li>Avoid carrying large sums of money or numerous credit cards.</li>
          <li>If you carry a purse, throw the strap over your shoulder and keep the bag close to your body, preferably in front of you.</li>
          <li>Wrap a rubber band or two around your wallet to keep it from slipping out of your pocket.</li>
          <li>Carry an extra car key with you.</li>
          <li>Double-check that doors and windows are securely closed and locked before leaving your car in a parking lot.</li>
          <li>Don’t open the car door or window if someone approaches your car. Instead, roll down the window a couple of inches to hear what they have to say.</li>
          <li>Don’t carry packages that obstruct your view.</li>
          <li>Don’t leave packages in open view. Lock them in the trunk or cover them with a blanket or coat.</li>
          <li>Don’t go back to your vehicle to store gifts. Prowlers watch for shoppers who leave their vehicles unattended. If you must store some packages, consider moving your car to another location before returning to the mall.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Most homeowners’ and renters’ insurance policies will cover the loss of personal belongings, including recently purchased gifts.</p>
