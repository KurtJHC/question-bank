        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Drought has significantly affected farmers in East Gippsland, Northern Victoria and parts of New South Wales and Queensland, while all other farmers are also affected by the drought to some degree because of increased feed and water costs. Drought can increase the price of feed and deplete water stores for animals and other farm uses. During these times farmers often need to make tough decisions which can affect their health and wellbeing. Climatic variability such as drought presents significant challenges for Australian farmers and their communities, including dairy farmers. Dry conditions can reduce the ability of farmers to grow feed and can also impact the availability and cost of bought in feed. Drought can also deplete water stores for animals and other farm uses. Current dry seasonal conditions across much of Australia have driven up feed and water prices, due to high demand and limited availability. This is impacting all farmers with the cost of grain alone being felt in all agricultural regions. During challenging seasonal conditions, farmers are encouraged to plan ahead and take action to prepare for the season ahead.<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Secretary of Agriculture, Claude R. Wickard, himself a farmer, told a meeting of the Future Farmers of America on October 10, 1944: “I like farming. It is a good life. After more than 30 years of it, I still would rather farm than do anything else. I envy you future farmers who have such great things ahead.” Dr. Baker - who may be regarded as a spokesman for the school of farming enthusiasts - said, “I have a son now less than 5 years old, and I hope when he grows up that he will decide to be a farmer.” Dr. Baker’s reasons for wanting his son to be a farmer were as follows. Firstly, a farmer has more and better food to eat than most people who live in cities. Secondly, he is healthier and will probably live longer. Thirdly, he is likely to enjoy his work more than most city people do. And fourthly, he is more likely to rear a family and thereby promote the future welfare of the nation.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Enough food is produced today to feed everyone on the planet, but hunger is on the rise in some parts of the world, and some 821 million people are considered to be “chronically undernourished”. What steps are being taken to ensure that everyone, worldwide, receives sufficient food? Whilst there is no silver bullet to solving hunger, the World Food Programme has outlined a vision that breaks the issue down into five steps. We will look at three of them that focus on food production. Firstly, reduce food waste. Around one third of the food produced each year is loss or wasted, costing the global economy some $1 trillion per year. Secondly, grow a wider variety of crops. Around 60 per cent of all calories consumed come from just four crops: rice, wheat, corn and soy. Ensuring food access and availability in the face of climate change will require the production of a wider range of foods by farmers. And thirdly, focus on using food for child nutrition. Good health and nutrition in a child’s first 1,000 days is essential to prevent stunting and promote healthy development.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
So, why and how did I become a farmer? With each passing day, I had a strong urge to break free of the consumerist shackles binding us in its vicious cycle. With every new learning I was moving towards slowly blending my carefully built modern lifestyle with more of the sensible tried and tested ways of life; with just a dash of modern comforts of course, which I can’t live without. When it came to farming, I wanted to do everything with an expert along my side, as we were novices in this field. But I guess that wasn’t part of the grand plan. We would wait and wait for the perfect timing to have an expert by our side to guide us step by step, and somehow it would never materialise. This happened quite a few times before we decided to take things in our own hands and to learn by doing, learn by making mistakes, if that’s what it takes.<br>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I am afraid.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Someone is coming. That is, I think someone is coming, though I am not sure, and I pray that I am wrong. I went into the church and prayed all this morning. I sprinkled water in front of the altar, and put some flowers on it, violets and dogwood.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But there is smoke. For three days there has been smoke, not like the time before. That time, last year, it rose in a great cloud a long way away, and stayed in the sky for two weeks. A forest fire in the dead woods, and then it rained and the smoke stopped. But this time it is a thin column, like a pole, not very high.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;And the column has come three times, each time in the late afternoon. At night I cannot see it, and in the morning, it is gone. But each afternoon it comes again, and it is nearer. At first it was behind Claypole Ridge, and I could see only the top of it, the smallest smudge. I thought it was a cloud, except that it was too grey, the wrong colour, and then I thought: there are no clouds anywhere else. I got the binoculars and saw that it was narrow and straight; it was smoke from a small fire. When we used to go in the truck, Claypole Ridge was fifteen miles, though it looks closer, and the smoke was coming from behind that.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond Claypole Ridge there is Ogdentown, about ten miles further. But there is no one left alive in Ogdentown. I know, because after the war ended, and all the telephones went dead, my father, my brother Joseph and my Cousin David went in the truck to find out what was happening, and the first place they went was Ogdentown. They went early in the morning: Joseph and David were really excited, but Father looked serious.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When they came back it was dark. Mother had been worrying – they took so long – so we were glad to see the truck lights finally coming over Burden hill, six miles away. They looked like beacons. They were the only lights anywhere, except in the house – no other cars had come down all day. We knew it was the truck because one of the lights, the left one, always blinked when it went over a bump. It came up to the house and they got out; the boys weren’t excited any more. They looked scared, and my father looked sick. Maybe he was beginning to be sick, but mainly I think he was distressed. My mother looked up at him as he climbed down.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“What did you find?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He said, “Bodies. Just dead bodies. They’re all dead.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“All?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;We went inside the house where the lamps were lit, the two boys following, not saying anything. My father sat down. “Terrible,” he said, and again, “terrible, terrible. We drove around, looking. We blew the horn. Then we went to the church and rang the bell. You can hear it five miles away. We waited for two hours, but nobody came. I went into a couple of houses – the Johnsons’, the Peters’ – they were all in there, all dead. There were dead birds all over the streets.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;My brother Joseph began to cry. He was fourteen. I think I had not heard him cry for six years.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It is coming closer. Today it was almost on top of the ridge, though not quite, because when I looked with the binoculars, I could not see the flame, but still only the smoke – rising very fast, not far above the fire. I know where it is: at the crossroads. Just on the other side of the ridge, the east-west highway, the Dean Town Road, crosses our road. It is route number nine, a State highway, bigger than our road, which is County road 793. He has stopped there and is deciding whether to follow number nine or come over the ridge. I say he because that is what I think of, though it could be they or even she. But I think it is he. If he decides to follow the highway he will go away, and everything will be all right again. Why would he come back? But if he comes to the top of the ridge, he is sure to come down here, because he will see the green leaves. On the other side of the ridge, even on the other side of Burden Hill, there are no leaves; everything is dead.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

It is route number nine, a State highway, bigger than our road, which is County road 793. He has stopped there and is deciding whether to follow number nine or come over the ridge. I say he because that is what I think of, though it could be they or even she. But I think it is he. If he decides to follow the highway he will go away, and everything will be all right again. Why would he come back? But if he comes to the top of the ridge, he is sure to come down here, because he will see the green leaves. On the other side of the ridge, even on the other side of Burden Hill, there are no leaves; everything is dead.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I am afraid.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Someone is coming. That is, I think someone is coming, though I am not sure, and I pray that I am wrong. I went into the church and prayed all this morning. I sprinkled water in front of the altar, and put some flowers on it, violets and dogwood.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But there is smoke. For three days there has been smoke, not like the time before. That time, last year, it rose in a great cloud a long way away, and stayed in the sky for two weeks. A forest fire in the dead woods, and then it rained and the smoke stopped. But this time it is a thin column, like a pole, not very high.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;And the column has come three times, each time in the late afternoon. At night I cannot see it, and in the morning, it is gone. But each afternoon it comes again, and it is nearer. At first it was behind Claypole Ridge, and I could see only the top of it, the smallest smudge. I thought it was a cloud, except that it was too grey, the wrong colour, and then I thought: there are no clouds anywhere else. I got the binoculars and saw that it was narrow and straight; it was smoke from a small fire. When we used to go in the truck, Claypole Ridge was fifteen miles, though it looks closer, and the smoke was coming from behind that.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond Claypole Ridge there is Ogdentown, about ten miles further. But there is no one left alive in Ogdentown. I know, because after the war ended, and all the telephones went dead, my father, my brother Joseph and my Cousin David went in the truck to find out what was happening, and the first place they went was Ogdentown. They went early in the morning: Joseph and David were really excited, but Father looked serious.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When they came back it was dark. Mother had been worrying – they took so long – so we were glad to see the truck lights finally coming over Burden hill, six miles away. They looked like beacons. They were the only lights anywhere, except in the house – no other cars had come down all day. We knew it was the truck because one of the lights, the left one, always blinked when it went over a bump. It came up to the house and they got out; the boys weren’t excited any more. They looked scared, and my father looked sick. Maybe he was beginning to be sick, but mainly I think he was distressed. My mother looked up at him as he climbed down.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“What did you find?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He said, “Bodies. Just dead bodies. They’re all dead.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“All?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;We went inside the house where the lamps were lit, the two boys following, not saying anything. My father sat down. “Terrible,” he said, and again, “terrible, terrible. We drove around, looking. We blew the horn. Then we went to the church and rang the bell. You can hear it five miles away. We waited for two hours, but nobody came. I went into a couple of houses – the Johnsons’, the Peters’ – they were all in there, all dead. There were dead birds all over the streets.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;My brother Joseph began to cry. He was fourteen. I think I had not heard him cry for six years.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;We went inside the house where the lamps were lit, the two boys following, not saying anything. My father sat down. “Terrible,” he said, and again, “terrible, terrible. We drove around, looking. We blew the horn. Then we went to the church and rang the bell. You can hear it five miles away. We waited for two hours, but nobody came. I went into a couple of houses – the Johnsons’, the Peters’ – they were all in there, all dead. There were dead birds all over the streets.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;My brother Joseph began to cry. He was fourteen. I think I had not heard him cry for six years.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It is coming closer. Today it was almost on top of the ridge, though not quite, because when I looked with the binoculars, I could not see the flame, but still only the smoke – rising very fast, not far above the fire. I know where it is: at the crossroads. Just on the other side of the ridge, the east-west highway, the Dean Town Road, crosses our road. It is route number nine, a State highway, bigger than our road, which is County road 793. He has stopped there and is deciding whether to follow number nine or come over the ridge. I say he because that is what I think of, though it could be they or even she. But I think it is he. If he decides to follow the highway he will go away, and everything will be all right again. Why would he come back? But if he comes to the top of the ridge, he is sure to come down here, because he will see the green leaves. On the other side of the ridge, even on the other side of Burden Hill, there are no leaves; everything is dead.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I am afraid.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Someone is coming. That is, I think someone is coming, though I am not sure, and I pray that I am wrong. I went into the church and prayed all this morning. I sprinkled water in front of the altar, and put some flowers on it, violets and dogwood.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But there is smoke. For three days there has been smoke, not like the time before. That time, last year, it rose in a great cloud a long way away, and stayed in the sky for two weeks. A forest fire in the dead woods, and then it rained and the smoke stopped. But this time it is a thin column, like a pole, not very high.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;And the column has come three times, each time in the late afternoon. At night I cannot see it, and in the morning, it is gone. But each afternoon it comes again, and it is nearer. At first it was behind Claypole Ridge, and I could see only the top of it, the smallest smudge. I thought it was a cloud, except that it was too grey, the wrong colour, and then I thought: there are no clouds anywhere else. I got the binoculars and saw that it was narrow and straight; it was smoke from a small fire. When we used to go in the truck, Claypole Ridge was fifteen miles, though it looks closer, and the smoke was coming from behind that.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond Claypole Ridge there is Ogdentown, about ten miles further. But there is no one left alive in Ogdentown. I know, because after the war ended, and all the telephones went dead, my father, my brother Joseph and my Cousin David went in the truck to find out what was happening, and the first place they went was Ogdentown. They went early in the morning: Joseph and David were really excited, but Father looked serious.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When they came back it was dark. Mother had been worrying – they took so long – so we were glad to see the truck lights finally coming over Burden hill, six miles away. They looked like beacons. They were the only lights anywhere, except in the house – no other cars had come down all day. We knew it was the truck because one of the lights, the left one, always blinked when it went over a bump. It came up to the house and they got out; the boys weren’t excited any more. They looked scared, and my father looked sick. Maybe he was beginning to be sick, but mainly I think he was distressed. My mother looked up at him as he climbed down.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“What did you find?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He said, “Bodies. Just dead bodies. They’re all dead.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“All?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;We went inside the house where the lamps were lit, the two boys following, not saying anything. My father sat down. “Terrible,” he said, and again, “terrible, terrible.

I know, because after the war ended, and all the telephones went dead, my father, my brother Joseph and my Cousin David went in the truck to find out what was happening, and the first place they went was Ogdentown. They went early in the morning: Joseph and David were really excited, but Father looked serious.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When they came back it was dark. Mother had been worrying – they took so long – so we were glad to see the truck lights finally coming over Burden hill, six miles away. They looked like beacons. They were the only lights anywhere, except in the house – no other cars had come down all day. We knew it was the truck because one of the lights, the left one, always blinked when it went over a bump. It came up to the house and they got out; the boys weren’t excited any more. They looked scared, and my father looked sick. Maybe he was beginning to be sick, but mainly I think he was distressed. My mother looked up at him as he climbed down.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“What did you find?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He said, “Bodies. Just dead bodies. They’re all dead.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“All?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;We went inside the house where the lamps were lit, the two boys following, not saying anything. My father sat down. “Terrible,” he said, and again, “terrible, terrible. We drove around, looking. We blew the horn. Then we went to the church and rang the bell. You can hear it five miles away. We waited for two hours, but nobody came. I went into a couple of houses – the Johnsons’, the Peters’ – they were all in there, all dead. There were dead birds all over the streets.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;My brother Joseph began to cry. He was fourteen. I think I had not heard him cry for six years.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It is coming closer. Today it was almost on top of the ridge, though not quite, because when I looked with the binoculars, I could not see the flame, but still only the smoke – rising very fast, not far above the fire. I know where it is: at the crossroads. Just on the other side of the ridge, the east-west highway, the Dean Town Road, crosses our road. It is route number nine, a State highway, bigger than our road, which is County road 793. He has stopped there and is deciding whether to follow number nine or come over the ridge. I say he because that is what I think of, though it could be they or even she. But I think it is he. If he decides to follow the highway he will go away, and everything will be all right again. Why would he come back? But if he comes to the top of the ridge, he is sure to come down here, because he will see the green leaves. On the other side of the ridge, even on the other side of Burden Hill, there are no leaves; everything is dead.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I am afraid.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Someone is coming. That is, I think someone is coming, though I am not sure, and I pray that I am wrong. I went into the church and prayed all this morning. I sprinkled water in front of the altar, and put some flowers on it, violets and dogwood.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But there is smoke. For three days there has been smoke, not like the time before. That time, last year, it rose in a great cloud a long way away, and stayed in the sky for two weeks. A forest fire in the dead woods, and then it rained and the smoke stopped. But this time it is a thin column, like a pole, not very high.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;And the column has come three times, each time in the late afternoon. At night I cannot see it, and in the morning, it is gone. But each afternoon it comes again, and it is nearer. At first it was behind Claypole Ridge, and I could see only the top of it, the smallest smudge. I thought it was a cloud, except that it was too grey, the wrong colour, and then I thought: there are no clouds anywhere else. I got the binoculars and saw that it was narrow and straight; it was smoke from a small fire. When we used to go in the truck, Claypole Ridge was fifteen miles, though it looks closer, and the smoke was coming from behind that.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond Claypole Ridge there is Ogdentown, about ten miles further. But there is no one left alive in Ogdentown. I know, because after the war ended, and all the telephones went dead, my father, my brother Joseph and my Cousin David went in the truck to find out what was happening, and the first place they went was Ogdentown.

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;But there is smoke. For three days there has been smoke, not like the time before. That time, last year, it rose in a great cloud a long way away, and stayed in the sky for two weeks. A forest fire in the dead woods, and then it rained and the smoke stopped. But this time it is a thin column, like a pole, not very high.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;And the column has come three times, each time in the late afternoon. At night I cannot see it, and in the morning, it is gone. But each afternoon it comes again, and it is nearer. At first it was behind Claypole Ridge, and I could see only the top of it, the smallest smudge. I thought it was a cloud, except that it was too grey, the wrong colour, and then I thought: there are no clouds anywhere else. I got the binoculars and saw that it was narrow and straight; it was smoke from a small fire. When we used to go in the truck, Claypole Ridge was fifteen miles, though it looks closer, and the smoke was coming from behind that.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond Claypole Ridge there is Ogdentown, about ten miles further. But there is no one left alive in Ogdentown. I know, because after the war ended, and all the telephones went dead, my father, my brother Joseph and my Cousin David went in the truck to find out what was happening, and the first place they went was Ogdentown. They went early in the morning: Joseph and David were really excited, but Father looked serious.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When they came back it was dark. Mother had been worrying – they took so long – so we were glad to see the truck lights finally coming over Burden hill, six miles away. They looked like beacons. They were the only lights anywhere, except in the house – no other cars had come down all day. We knew it was the truck because one of the lights, the left one, always blinked when it went over a bump. It came up to the house and they got out; the boys weren’t excited any more. They looked scared, and my father looked sick. Maybe he was beginning to be sick, but mainly I think he was distressed. My mother looked up at him as he climbed down.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“What did you find?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He said, “Bodies. Just dead bodies. They’re all dead.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“All?”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;We went inside the house where the lamps were lit, the two boys following, not saying anything. My father sat down. “Terrible,” he said, and again, “terrible, terrible. We drove around, looking. We blew the horn. Then we went to the church and rang the bell. You can hear it five miles away. We waited for two hours, but nobody came. I went into a couple of houses – the Johnsons’, the Peters’ – they were all in there, all dead. There were dead birds all over the streets.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;My brother Joseph began to cry. He was fourteen. I think I had not heard him cry for six years.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It is coming closer. Today it was almost on top of the ridge, though not quite, because when I looked with the binoculars, I could not see the flame, but still only the smoke – rising very fast, not far above the fire. I know where it is: at the crossroads. Just on the other side of the ridge, the east-west highway, the Dean Town Road, crosses our road. It is route number nine, a State highway, bigger than our road, which is County road 793. He has stopped there and is deciding whether to follow number nine or come over the ridge. I say he because that is what I think of, though it could be they or even she. But I think it is he. If he decides to follow the highway he will go away, and everything will be all right again. Why would he come back? But if he comes to the top of the ridge, he is sure to come down here, because he will see the green leaves. On the other side of the ridge, even on the other side of Burden Hill, there are no leaves; everything is dead.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Understanding Elephant Empathy and their Emotions</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>[Posted by World Animal Protection in the Animals in the wild blog by Dr Helen Lambert]</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Observing elephants in the wild is the best way to fully experience these incredible animals. Elephants are at their most awe-inspiring in the wild and some of the behaviours they exhibit show us just how emotionally complex they are. The intelligence of elephants is something which is often overlooked by humans. However, it is clear that they are very smart creatures. But exactly how smart are elephants? Elephants are considered to be one of the world’s most empathic species. <strong>15</strong> ………. &nbsp;This proves that they’re truly empathetic, social animals.<br>
<br>
Scientists have observed many cases of maternal and non-maternal elephants defending calves from dangerous situations such as chasing predators away, stopping aggressive play fights or pushing other individuals away. Such situations do not always elicit distress or pain signals in the calf. Therefore, we know the protector elephants are predicting their potential distress, rather than just responding to cues. Experts suggest that to do this, the elephants draw upon their past experiences and use this to consider the calf’s potential emotional state. <strong>16</strong> ………. &nbsp;This behaviour is very complex, and few species are known to be able to recognise and consider another’s feelings in this way.<br>
<br>
<strong>17</strong> ………. &nbsp;African elephants have huge complicated social groups ranging from tens to hundreds, whereas Asian elephants are often thought to be the loner elephants. Recent research however has shown this is not actually the case. Their social lives are so complex it has taken years of research to understand them, and we are still continuing to learn. Female Asian elephants will have anywhere from 10-50 friends, but they may not see them for long periods of time. Instead, they will communicate with them both chemically and acoustically.<br>
<br>
Elephants also recognise themselves in a mirror. It is not surprising to hear that, as well as being incredibly emotional and social, elephants are considered to be one of the world’s most intelligent species. Asian elephants have been found to pass the mirror test. Marks are placed on the animal to see whether they use the mirror to inspect themselves. When they successfully inspect themselves, this is considered to be evidence of a high level of intelligence. <strong>18</strong> ………. &nbsp;And the ability doesn’t emerge in human children until 18-24 months of age.<br>
<br>
Elephants make the most of their environment. Both Asian and African elephants have been known to use different objects as tools for conducting various tasks. For example, they've been seen using branches to swat flies, or using dead vegetation to bury the dead.<br>
The way that elephants are able to practically make the most of their environment and use imagination to complete different tasks shows how complex and thoughtful these animals really are. <strong>19</strong> ………. &nbsp;Rangers once saw African elephants break off nearby branches and dump them on to a new road, rendering it closed, repeating this four times when the branches were removed. Poignantly the road was built for an elephant cull.<br>
<br>
There is still so much to learn about these fascinating animals, and scientists have only really scratched the surface when it comes to understanding how intelligent and expressive elephants are. <strong>20</strong> ………. &nbsp;Sadly, elephants used for tourist rides do not have the chance to truly express these behaviours. Their lives in these facilities are so far removed from what they should be, they are almost an entirely different animal. We want to see elephants living in the natural environments they’re entitled to and we're working with responsible travel companies to make this happen. More than 80 companies have stopped selling elephant rides and shows to tourists. But to put an end to this cruel industry, we need more companies to take action. Join our movement to help end wildlife cruelty in the tourism industry.</p>

          <strong>Understanding Elephant Empathy and their Emotions</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>[Posted by World Animal Protection in the Animals in the wild blog by Dr Helen Lambert]</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Observing elephants in the wild is the best way to fully experience these incredible animals. Elephants are at their most awe-inspiring in the wild and some of the behaviours they exhibit show us just how emotionally complex they are. The intelligence of elephants is something which is often overlooked by humans. However, it is clear that they are very smart creatures. But exactly how smart are elephants? Elephants are considered to be one of the world’s most empathic species. <strong>15</strong> ………. &nbsp;This proves that they’re truly empathetic, social animals.<br>
<br>
Scientists have observed many cases of maternal and non-maternal elephants defending calves from dangerous situations such as chasing predators away, stopping aggressive play fights or pushing other individuals away. Such situations do not always elicit distress or pain signals in the calf. Therefore, we know the protector elephants are predicting their potential distress, rather than just responding to cues. Experts suggest that to do this, the elephants draw upon their past experiences and use this to consider the calf’s potential emotional state. <strong>16</strong> ………. &nbsp;This behaviour is very complex, and few species are known to be able to recognise and consider another’s feelings in this way.<br>
<br>
<strong>17</strong> ………. &nbsp;African elephants have huge complicated social groups ranging from tens to hundreds, whereas Asian elephants are often thought to be the loner elephants. Recent research however has shown this is not actually the case. Their social lives are so complex it has taken years of research to understand them, and we are still continuing to learn. Female Asian elephants will have anywhere from 10-50 friends, but they may not see them for long periods of time. Instead, they will communicate with them both chemically and acoustically.<br>
<br>
Elephants also recognise themselves in a mirror. It is not surprising to hear that, as well as being incredibly emotional and social, elephants are considered to be one of the world’s most intelligent species. Asian elephants have been found to pass the mirror test. Marks are placed on the animal to see whether they use the mirror to inspect themselves. When they successfully inspect themselves, this is considered to be evidence of a high level of intelligence. <strong>18</strong> ………. &nbsp;And the ability doesn’t emerge in human children until 18-24 months of age.<br>
<br>
Elephants make the most of their environment. Both Asian and African elephants have been known to use different objects as tools for conducting various tasks. For example, they've been seen using branches to swat flies, or using dead vegetation to bury the dead.<br>
The way that elephants are able to practically make the most of their environment and use imagination to complete different tasks shows how complex and thoughtful these animals really are. <strong>19</strong> ………. &nbsp;Rangers once saw African elephants break off nearby branches and dump them on to a new road, rendering it closed, repeating this four times when the branches were removed. Poignantly the road was built for an elephant cull.<br>
<br>
There is still so much to learn about these fascinating animals, and scientists have only really scratched the surface when it comes to understanding how intelligent and expressive elephants are. <strong>20</strong> ………. &nbsp;Sadly, elephants used for tourist rides do not have the chance to truly express these behaviours. Their lives in these facilities are so far removed from what they should be, they are almost an entirely different animal. We want to see elephants living in the natural environments they’re entitled to and we're working with responsible travel companies to make this happen. More than 80 companies have stopped selling elephant rides and shows to tourists. But to put an end to this cruel industry, we need more companies to take action. Join our movement to help end wildlife cruelty in the tourism industry.</p>

          <strong>Understanding Elephant Empathy and their Emotions</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>[Posted by World Animal Protection in the Animals in the wild blog by Dr Helen Lambert]</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Observing elephants in the wild is the best way to fully experience these incredible animals. Elephants are at their most awe-inspiring in the wild and some of the behaviours they exhibit show us just how emotionally complex they are. The intelligence of elephants is something which is often overlooked by humans. However, it is clear that they are very smart creatures. But exactly how smart are elephants? Elephants are considered to be one of the world’s most empathic species. <strong>15</strong> ………. &nbsp;This proves that they’re truly empathetic, social animals.<br>
<br>
Scientists have observed many cases of maternal and non-maternal elephants defending calves from dangerous situations such as chasing predators away, stopping aggressive play fights or pushing other individuals away. Such situations do not always elicit distress or pain signals in the calf. Therefore, we know the protector elephants are predicting their potential distress, rather than just responding to cues. Experts suggest that to do this, the elephants draw upon their past experiences and use this to consider the calf’s potential emotional state. <strong>16</strong> ………. &nbsp;This behaviour is very complex, and few species are known to be able to recognise and consider another’s feelings in this way.<br>
<br>
<strong>17</strong> ………. &nbsp;African elephants have huge complicated social groups ranging from tens to hundreds, whereas Asian elephants are often thought to be the loner elephants. Recent research however has shown this is not actually the case. Their social lives are so complex it has taken years of research to understand them, and we are still continuing to learn. Female Asian elephants will have anywhere from 10-50 friends, but they may not see them for long periods of time. Instead, they will communicate with them both chemically and acoustically.<br>
<br>
Elephants also recognise themselves in a mirror. It is not surprising to hear that, as well as being incredibly emotional and social, elephants are considered to be one of the world’s most intelligent species. Asian elephants have been found to pass the mirror test. Marks are placed on the animal to see whether they use the mirror to inspect themselves. When they successfully inspect themselves, this is considered to be evidence of a high level of intelligence. <strong>18</strong> ………. &nbsp;And the ability doesn’t emerge in human children until 18-24 months of age.<br>
<br>
Elephants make the most of their environment. Both Asian and African elephants have been known to use different objects as tools for conducting various tasks. For example, they've been seen using branches to swat flies, or using dead vegetation to bury the dead.<br>
The way that elephants are able to practically make the most of their environment and use imagination to complete different tasks shows how complex and thoughtful these animals really are. <strong>19</strong> ………. &nbsp;Rangers once saw African elephants break off nearby branches and dump them on to a new road, rendering it closed, repeating this four times when the branches were removed. Poignantly the road was built for an elephant cull.<br>
<br>
There is still so much to learn about these fascinating animals, and scientists have only really scratched the surface when it comes to understanding how intelligent and expressive elephants are. <strong>20</strong> ………. &nbsp;Sadly, elephants used for tourist rides do not have the chance to truly express these behaviours. Their lives in these facilities are so far removed from what they should be, they are almost an entirely different animal. We want to see elephants living in the natural environments they’re entitled to and we're working with responsible travel companies to make this happen. More than 80 companies have stopped selling elephant rides and shows to tourists. But to put an end to this cruel industry, we need more companies to take action. Join our movement to help end wildlife cruelty in the tourism industry.</p>

          <strong>Understanding Elephant Empathy and their Emotions</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>[Posted by World Animal Protection in the Animals in the wild blog by Dr Helen Lambert]</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Observing elephants in the wild is the best way to fully experience these incredible animals. Elephants are at their most awe-inspiring in the wild and some of the behaviours they exhibit show us just how emotionally complex they are. The intelligence of elephants is something which is often overlooked by humans. However, it is clear that they are very smart creatures. But exactly how smart are elephants? Elephants are considered to be one of the world’s most empathic species. <strong>15</strong> ………. &nbsp;This proves that they’re truly empathetic, social animals.<br>
<br>
Scientists have observed many cases of maternal and non-maternal elephants defending calves from dangerous situations such as chasing predators away, stopping aggressive play fights or pushing other individuals away. Such situations do not always elicit distress or pain signals in the calf. Therefore, we know the protector elephants are predicting their potential distress, rather than just responding to cues. Experts suggest that to do this, the elephants draw upon their past experiences and use this to consider the calf’s potential emotional state. <strong>16</strong> ………. &nbsp;This behaviour is very complex, and few species are known to be able to recognise and consider another’s feelings in this way.<br>
<br>
<strong>17</strong> ………. &nbsp;African elephants have huge complicated social groups ranging from tens to hundreds, whereas Asian elephants are often thought to be the loner elephants. Recent research however has shown this is not actually the case. Their social lives are so complex it has taken years of research to understand them, and we are still continuing to learn. Female Asian elephants will have anywhere from 10-50 friends, but they may not see them for long periods of time. Instead, they will communicate with them both chemically and acoustically.<br>
<br>
Elephants also recognise themselves in a mirror. It is not surprising to hear that, as well as being incredibly emotional and social, elephants are considered to be one of the world’s most intelligent species. Asian elephants have been found to pass the mirror test. Marks are placed on the animal to see whether they use the mirror to inspect themselves. When they successfully inspect themselves, this is considered to be evidence of a high level of intelligence. <strong>18</strong> ………. &nbsp;And the ability doesn’t emerge in human children until 18-24 months of age.<br>
<br>
Elephants make the most of their environment. Both Asian and African elephants have been known to use different objects as tools for conducting various tasks. For example, they've been seen using branches to swat flies, or using dead vegetation to bury the dead.<br>
The way that elephants are able to practically make the most of their environment and use imagination to complete different tasks shows how complex and thoughtful these animals really are. <strong>19</strong> ………. &nbsp;Rangers once saw African elephants break off nearby branches and dump them on to a new road, rendering it closed, repeating this four times when the branches were removed. Poignantly the road was built for an elephant cull.<br>
<br>
There is still so much to learn about these fascinating animals, and scientists have only really scratched the surface when it comes to understanding how intelligent and expressive elephants are. <strong>20</strong> ………. &nbsp;Sadly, elephants used for tourist rides do not have the chance to truly express these behaviours. Their lives in these facilities are so far removed from what they should be, they are almost an entirely different animal. We want to see elephants living in the natural environments they’re entitled to and we're working with responsible travel companies to make this happen. More than 80 companies have stopped selling elephant rides and shows to tourists. But to put an end to this cruel industry, we need more companies to take action. Join our movement to help end wildlife cruelty in the tourism industry.</p>

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
"The Martian" film about an astronaut surviving on the desolate planet, Mars, is at heart a shipwreck story, one that just happens to take the form of a science fiction adventure. But although the outline offers no surprises, the details and the tone feel new. Like all the variants of "Robinson Crusoe" films —including "Cast Away" and, of course, "Robinson Crusoe on Mars"—this film is about a man, Mark Watney (Matt Damon), who summons all of his ingenuity and courage to endure a seemingly impossible situation. He must then deal with loneliness on top of it all. If you've ever seen a film, you know going in that things are going to turn out fine for Mark—that no studio is going to pay for a special effects driven epic about a smart, likable castaway who dies in the last five minutes. You also know that, despite the Lone Man Against Nature plot line, there's a reason why the filmmakers cast Oscar nominee Jessica Chastain as the captain of the mission that's forced to abort its exploration of the planet's surface and leave Mark for dead—and it wasn't so that she could turn tail and head for Earth with her crew in the first ten minutes and never return. You also know that, despite the heated discussions back on earth of how risky, time consuming and expensive a rescue mission would be, NASA will still have to stage one, and that any objections will be waved off in the name of doing what's right.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
There’s no way around it - due to their orbits, Mars and the Earth have to stop communicating with each other for about two weeks every two years. This quiet period is called solar conjunction, and for the Perseverance team that means we can’t send new instructions to the rover between sols 217-235 (Sept. 28 – Oct. 17, 2021). We’ve already sent the discovery vehicle, Rover a set of commands so it can perform science activities without posing a risk to the Rover’s safety, and the team won’t need to check that they were successfully completed each day. In my role on the science team as a Long-Term Planner, I work on the strategic plan for what the rover will do in the next days, weeks and months. Lately, that includes experiments that can be repeated before and after the conjunction break, which are unique opportunities to monitor longer-term changes to the rocks and soils around the Rover. To look for differences in the terrain due to the wind, sand and dust, we will take a 360-degree view with Navcam on sol 214, and on sol 236.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man’s and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their business, they were scrutinised and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise bugs that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacency men went to and fro over the Earth, serene in their assurance of their control over all matter. No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources of human danger, nor thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable. It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of those departed days. At most, men fancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to welcome a human enterprise. Yet across the gulf of space, minds - that are to our minds as ours are to those of animals; intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic - regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us. And early in the twentieth century came the great disaster.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
At one time, astronomers believed the surface of Mars was crisscrossed by canal systems of water. This in turn gave rise to speculation that Mars was very much like Earth, capable of supporting life and home to a native civilisation. But as human satellites and rovers began to conduct flybys and surveys of the planet, this vision of Mars quickly dissolved, replaced by one in which the Red Planet was a cold and lifeless world. However, over the past few decades, scientists have learned a great deal about the history of Mars that has altered this view. We now know that Mars may currently be very cold, very dry, and very inhospitable, but this wasn't always the case. Earth is almost twice the diameter of Mars. If Earth were the size of a baseball, Mars would be the size of a ping-pong ball. Nearly 70 percent of Earth is covered with liquid water; Mars has none. The sun warms Earth's surface to more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit. On Mars the temperature rarely surpasses the freezing mark. Yet in many ways, Mars is more like Earth than any other planet in the solar system. Both have valleys and mountains, weather and seasons, and volcanoes and ice caps. At 24 hours and 39 minutes, the Martian day is only a little bit longer than Earth's. And although dry today, Mars may at one time have had enough liquid water to support primitive forms of life.<br>

You also know that, despite the heated discussions back on earth of how risky, time consuming and expensive a rescue mission would be, NASA will still have to stage one, and that any objections will be waved off in the name of doing what's right.<br>

There’s no way around it - due to their orbits, Mars and the Earth have to stop communicating with each other for about two weeks every two years. This quiet period is called solar conjunction, and for the Perseverance team that means we can’t send new instructions to the rover between sols 217-235 (Sept. 28 – Oct. 17, 2021). We’ve already sent the discovery vehicle, Rover a set of commands so it can perform science activities without posing a risk to the Rover’s safety, and the team won’t need to check that they were successfully completed each day. In my role on the science team as a Long-Term Planner, I work on the strategic plan for what the rover will do in the next days, weeks and months. Lately, that includes experiments that can be repeated before and after the conjunction break, which are unique opportunities to monitor longer-term changes to the rocks and soils around the Rover. To look for differences in the terrain due to the wind, sand and dust, we will take a 360-degree view with Navcam on sol 214, and on sol 236.<br>

No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man’s and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their business, they were scrutinised and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise bugs that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacency men went to and fro over the Earth, serene in their assurance of their control over all matter. No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources of human danger, nor thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable. It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of those departed days. At most, men fancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to welcome a human enterprise. Yet across the gulf of space, minds - that are to our minds as ours are to those of animals; intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic - regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us. And early in the twentieth century came the great disaster.<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
At one time, astronomers believed the surface of Mars was crisscrossed by canal systems of water. This in turn gave rise to speculation that Mars was very much like Earth, capable of supporting life and home to a native civilisation. But as human satellites and rovers began to conduct flybys and surveys of the planet, this vision of Mars quickly dissolved, replaced by one in which the Red Planet was a cold and lifeless world. However, over the past few decades, scientists have learned a great deal about the history of Mars that has altered this view. We now know that Mars may currently be very cold, very dry, and very inhospitable, but this wasn't always the case. Earth is almost twice the diameter of Mars. If Earth were the size of a baseball, Mars would be the size of a ping-pong ball. Nearly 70 percent of Earth is covered with liquid water; Mars has none. The sun warms Earth's surface to more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit. On Mars the temperature rarely surpasses the freezing mark. Yet in many ways, Mars is more like Earth than any other planet in the solar system. Both have valleys and mountains, weather and seasons, and volcanoes and ice caps. At 24 hours and 39 minutes, the Martian day is only a little bit longer than Earth's. And although dry today, Mars may at one time have had enough liquid water to support primitive forms of life.<br>

"The Martian" film about an astronaut surviving on the desolate planet, Mars, is at heart a shipwreck story, one that just happens to take the form of a science fiction adventure. But although the outline offers no surprises, the details and the tone feel new. Like all the variants of "Robinson Crusoe" films —including "Cast Away" and, of course, "Robinson Crusoe on Mars"—this film is about a man, Mark Watney (Matt Damon), who summons all of his ingenuity and courage to endure a seemingly impossible situation. He must then deal with loneliness on top of it all. If you've ever seen a film, you know going in that things are going to turn out fine for Mark—that no studio is going to pay for a special effects driven epic about a smart, likable castaway who dies in the last five minutes.

No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man’s and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their business, they were scrutinised and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise bugs that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacency men went to and fro over the Earth, serene in their assurance of their control over all matter. No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources of human danger, nor thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable. It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of those departed days. At most, men fancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to welcome a human enterprise. Yet across the gulf of space, minds - that are to our minds as ours are to those of animals; intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic - regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us. And early in the twentieth century came the great disaster.<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
At one time, astronomers believed the surface of Mars was crisscrossed by canal systems of water. This in turn gave rise to speculation that Mars was very much like Earth, capable of supporting life and home to a native civilisation. But as human satellites and rovers began to conduct flybys and surveys of the planet, this vision of Mars quickly dissolved, replaced by one in which the Red Planet was a cold and lifeless world. However, over the past few decades, scientists have learned a great deal about the history of Mars that has altered this view. We now know that Mars may currently be very cold, very dry, and very inhospitable, but this wasn't always the case. Earth is almost twice the diameter of Mars. If Earth were the size of a baseball, Mars would be the size of a ping-pong ball. Nearly 70 percent of Earth is covered with liquid water; Mars has none. The sun warms Earth's surface to more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit. On Mars the temperature rarely surpasses the freezing mark. Yet in many ways, Mars is more like Earth than any other planet in the solar system. Both have valleys and mountains, weather and seasons, and volcanoes and ice caps. At 24 hours and 39 minutes, the Martian day is only a little bit longer than Earth's. And although dry today, Mars may at one time have had enough liquid water to support primitive forms of life.<br>
