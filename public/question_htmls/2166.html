&nbsp; &nbsp;He stood in the shallows and waited, again and again. The small fish came closer and closer and he lunged time after time but was always too slow. He tried throwing it, jabbing it, everything but flailing with it, and it didn’t work. The fish were just too fast.<br>
He had been so sure, so absolutely certain that it would work the night before. Sitting by the fire he had taken the willow and carefully peeled the bark until he had a straight staff about six feet long and just under an inch thick at the base, the thickest end.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Then, propping the hatchet in a crack in the rock wall, he had pulled the head of his spear against it, carving a thin piece off each time, until the thick end tapered down to a needle point. Still not satisfied he could not imagine hitting one of the fish with a single point—he carefully used the hatchet to split the point up the middle for eight or ten inches and jammed a piece of wood up into the split to make a two-prong spear with the points about two inches apart. It was crude, but it looked effective and seemed to have good balance when he stood outside the shelter and hefted the spear.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;He had worked on the fish spear until it had become more than just a tool. He’d spent hours and hours on it, and now it didn’t work. He moved into the shallows and stood and the fish came to him. Just as before they swarmed around his legs, some of them almost six inches long, but no matter how he tried they were too fast. At first he tried throwing it but that had no chance. As soon as he brought his arm back-well before he threw -the movement frightened them. Next he tried lunging at them, having the spear ready just above the water and thrusting with it. Finally he actually put the spear in the water and waited until the fish were right in front of it, but still somehow he telegraphed his motion before he thrust and they saw it and flashed away.<br>
He needed something to spring the spear forward, some way to make it move faster than the fish-some motive force. A string that snapped or a bow. A bow and arrow. A thin, long arrow with the point in the water and the bow pulled back so that all he had to do was release the arrow... yes. That was it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;He had to “invent” the bow and arrow he almost laughed as he moved out of the water and put his shoes on. The morning sun was getting hot and he took his shirt off. Maybe that was how it really happened, way back when some primitive man tried to spear fish and it didn’t work and he “invented” the bow and arrow. Maybe it was always that way, discoveries happened because they needed to happen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;He had not eaten anything yet this morning so he took a moment to dig up the eggs and eat one, then he reburied them, banked the fire with a couple of thicker pieces of wood, settled the hatchet on his belt and took the spear in his right hand and set off up the lake to find wood to make a bow. He went without a shirt but something about the wood smoke smell on him kept the insects from bothering him as he walked to the berry patch. The raspberries were starting to become overripe, just in two days, and he would have to pick as many as possible after he found the wood but he did take a little time now to pick a few and eat them. They were full and sweet and when he picked one, two others would fall off the limbs into the grass and soon his hands and cheeks were covered with red berry juice and he was full. That surprised him being full.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;He hadn’t thought he would ever be full again, knew only the hunger, and here he was full. One turtle egg and a few handfuls of berries and he felt full. He looked down at his stomach and saw that it was still caved in- did not bulge out as it would have with two hamburgers and a freezy slush. It must have shrunk. And there was still hunger there, but not like it was- not tearing at him. This was hunger that he knew would be there always, even when he had food-a hunger that made him look for things, see things. A hunger to make him hunt.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;He swung his eyes across the berries to make sure the bear wasn’t there, at his back, then he moved down to the lake. The spear went out before him automatically, moving the brush away from his face as he walked, and when he came to the water’s edge he swung left. Not sure what he was looking for, not knowing what wood might be best for a bow-he had never made a bow, never shot a bow in his life but it seemed that it would be along the lake, near the water.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;He saw some young birch, and they were springy, but they lacked snap somehow, as did the willows. Not enough whip-back.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Halfway up the lake, just as he started to step over a log, he was absolutely terrified by an explosion under his feet. Something like a feathered bomb blew up and away in a flurry of leaves and thunder. It frightened him so badly that he fell back and down and then it was gone, leaving only an image in his mind.</p>

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;He had to “invent” the bow and arrow he almost laughed as he moved out of the water and put his shoes on. The morning sun was getting hot and he took his shirt off. Maybe that was how it really happened, way back when some primitive man tried to spear fish and it didn’t work and he “invented” the bow and arrow. Maybe it was always that way, discoveries happened because they needed to happen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;He had not eaten anything yet this morning so he took a moment to dig up the eggs and eat one, then he reburied them, banked the fire with a couple of thicker pieces of wood, settled the hatchet on his belt and took the spear in his right hand and set off up the lake to find wood to make a bow. He went without a shirt but something about the wood smoke smell on him kept the insects from bothering him as he walked to the berry patch. The raspberries were starting to become overripe, just in two days, and he would have to pick as many as possible after he found the wood but he did take a little time now to pick a few and eat them. They were full and sweet and when he picked one, two others would fall off the limbs into the grass and soon his hands and cheeks were covered with red berry juice and he was full. That surprised him being full.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;He hadn’t thought he would ever be full again, knew only the hunger, and here he was full. One turtle egg and a few handfuls of berries and he felt full. He looked down at his stomach and saw that it was still caved in- did not bulge out as it would have with two hamburgers and a freezy slush. It must have shrunk. And there was still hunger there, but not like it was- not tearing at him. This was hunger that he knew would be there always, even when he had food-a hunger that made him look for things, see things. A hunger to make him hunt.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;He swung his eyes across the berries to make sure the bear wasn’t there, at his back, then he moved down to the lake. The spear went out before him automatically, moving the brush away from his face as he walked, and when he came to the water’s edge he swung left. Not sure what he was looking for, not knowing what wood might be best for a bow-he had never made a bow, never shot a bow in his life but it seemed that it would be along the lake, near the water.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;He saw some young birch, and they were springy, but they lacked snap somehow, as did the willows. Not enough whip-back.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Halfway up the lake, just as he started to step over a log, he was absolutely terrified by an explosion under his feet. Something like a feathered bomb blew up and away in a flurry of leaves and thunder. It frightened him so badly that he fell back and down and then it was gone, leaving only an image in his mind.</p>

&nbsp; &nbsp;He stood in the shallows and waited, again and again. The small fish came closer and closer and he lunged time after time but was always too slow. He tried throwing it, jabbing it, everything but flailing with it, and it didn’t work. The fish were just too fast.<br>
He had been so sure, so absolutely certain that it would work the night before. Sitting by the fire he had taken the willow and carefully peeled the bark until he had a straight staff about six feet long and just under an inch thick at the base, the thickest end.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Then, propping the hatchet in a crack in the rock wall, he had pulled the head of his spear against it, carving a thin piece off each time, until the thick end tapered down to a needle point. Still not satisfied he could not imagine hitting one of the fish with a single point—he carefully used the hatchet to split the point up the middle for eight or ten inches and jammed a piece of wood up into the split to make a two-prong spear with the points about two inches apart. It was crude, but it looked effective and seemed to have good balance when he stood outside the shelter and hefted the spear.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;He had worked on the fish spear until it had become more than just a tool. He’d spent hours and hours on it, and now it didn’t work. He moved into the shallows and stood and the fish came to him. Just as before they swarmed around his legs, some of them almost six inches long, but no matter how he tried they were too fast. At first he tried throwing it but that had no chance. As soon as he brought his arm back-well before he threw -the movement frightened them. Next he tried lunging at them, having the spear ready just above the water and thrusting with it. Finally he actually put the spear in the water and waited until the fish were right in front of it, but still somehow he telegraphed his motion before he thrust and they saw it and flashed away.<br>

Something like a feathered bomb blew up and away in a flurry of leaves and thunder. It frightened him so badly that he fell back and down and then it was gone, leaving only an image in his mind.</p>

          <strong>Chapter 3</strong>
        </p>
        <p>There!</p>
        <p>Not quite in front but slightly to the right he saw a lake. L-shaped, with rounded corners, and the plane was nearly aimed at the long part of the L, coming from the bottom and heading to the top. Just a tiny bit to the right. He pushed the right rudder pedal gently and the nose moved over.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But the turn cost him speed and now the lake was above the nose. He pulled back on the wheel slightly and the nose came up. This caused the plane to slow dramatically and almost seem to stop and wallow in the air. The controls became very loose feeling and frightened Brian, making him push the wheel back in. This increased the speed a bit, but fiIled the windshield once more with nothing but trees, and put the lake well above the nose and out of reach.</p>
        <p>For a space of three or four seconds, things seemed to hang, almost to stop. The plane was flying, but so slowly, so slowly...it would never reach the lake. Brian looked out to the side and saw a small pond and at the edge of the pond some large animal, he thought, a moose standing out in the water. All so still looking, so stopped, the pond and the moose and the trees, as he slid over them now only three or four hundred feet off the ground all like a picture.</p>
        <p>Then everything happened at once. Trees suddenly took on detail, filled his whole field of vision with green, and he knew he would hit and die, would die, but his luck held and just as he was to hit, he came into an open lane, a channel of fallen trees, a wide place leading to the lake.</p>
        <p>The plane, committed now to landing, to crashing, fell into the wide place like a stone, and Brian eased back on the wheel and braced himself for the crash. But there was a tiny bit of speed left and when he pulled on the wheel the nose came up and he saw in front the blue of the lake and at that instant the plane hit the trees.</p>
        <p>There was a great wrenching as the wings caught the pines at the side of the clearing and broke back, ripping back just outside the main braces. Dust and dirt blew off the floor into his face so hard he thought there must have been some kind of explosion. He was momentarily blinded and slammed forward in the seat, smashing his head on the wheel.</p>
        <p>Then a wild crashing sound, ripping of metal, and the plane rolled to the right and blew through the trees, out over the water and down, down to slam into the lake, skip once on water as hard as concrete, water that tore the windshield out and shattered the side windows, water that drove him back into the seat. Somebody was screaming, screaming as the plane drove down into the water. Someone screamed tight animal, screams of fear and pain and he did not know that it was his sound, that he roared against the water that took him and the plane still deeper, down in the water. He saw nothing but sensed blue, cold blue-green, and he raked at the seatbelt catch, tore his nails loose on one hand. He ripped at it until it released and somehow-the water trying to kill him, to end him - somehow he pulled himself out of the shattered front window and clawed up into the blue, felt something hold him back, felt his windbreaker tear and he was free.</p>
        <p>Tearing free. Ripping free.</p>
        <p>But so far! So far to the surface and his lungs could not do this thing, could not hold and were through, and he sucked water, took a great pull of water that would finally-win, finally take him, and his head broke into light and he vomited and swam, pulling without knowing what he was, what he was doing. Without knowing anything.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Pulling until his hands caught at weeds and muck, pulling and screaming until his hands caught at last in grass and brush and he felt his chest on land, felt his face in the coarse blades of grass and he stopped, everything stopped. A colour came that he had never seen before, a colour that exploded in his mind with the pain and he was gone, gone from it all, spiralling out into the world, spiralling out into nothing.</p>
        <p>Nothing.<br>

          <strong>Chapter 3</strong>
        </p>
        <p>There!</p>
        <p>Not quite in front but slightly to the right he saw a lake. L-shaped, with rounded corners, and the plane was nearly aimed at the long part of the L, coming from the bottom and heading to the top. Just a tiny bit to the right. He pushed the right rudder pedal gently and the nose moved over.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But the turn cost him speed and now the lake was above the nose. He pulled back on the wheel slightly and the nose came up. This caused the plane to slow dramatically and almost seem to stop and wallow in the air. The controls became very loose feeling and frightened Brian, making him push the wheel back in. This increased the speed a bit, but fiIled the windshield once more with nothing but trees, and put the lake well above the nose and out of reach.</p>
        <p>For a space of three or four seconds, things seemed to hang, almost to stop. The plane was flying, but so slowly, so slowly...it would never reach the lake. Brian looked out to the side and saw a small pond and at the edge of the pond some large animal, he thought, a moose standing out in the water. All so still looking, so stopped, the pond and the moose and the trees, as he slid over them now only three or four hundred feet off the ground all like a picture.</p>
        <p>Then everything happened at once. Trees suddenly took on detail, filled his whole field of vision with green, and he knew he would hit and die, would die, but his luck held and just as he was to hit, he came into an open lane, a channel of fallen trees, a wide place leading to the lake.</p>
        <p>The plane, committed now to landing, to crashing, fell into the wide place like a stone, and Brian eased back on the wheel and braced himself for the crash. But there was a tiny bit of speed left and when he pulled on the wheel the nose came up and he saw in front the blue of the lake and at that instant the plane hit the trees.</p>
        <p>There was a great wrenching as the wings caught the pines at the side of the clearing and broke back, ripping back just outside the main braces. Dust and dirt blew off the floor into his face so hard he thought there must have been some kind of explosion. He was momentarily blinded and slammed forward in the seat, smashing his head on the wheel.</p>
        <p>Then a wild crashing sound, ripping of metal, and the plane rolled to the right and blew through the trees, out over the water and down, down to slam into the lake, skip once on water as hard as concrete, water that tore the windshield out and shattered the side windows, water that drove him back into the seat. Somebody was screaming, screaming as the plane drove down into the water. Someone screamed tight animal, screams of fear and pain and he did not know that it was his sound, that he roared against the water that took him and the plane still deeper, down in the water. He saw nothing but sensed blue, cold blue-green, and he raked at the seatbelt catch, tore his nails loose on one hand. He ripped at it until it released and somehow-the water trying to kill him, to end him - somehow he pulled himself out of the shattered front window and clawed up into the blue, felt something hold him back, felt his windbreaker tear and he was free.</p>
        <p>Tearing free. Ripping free.</p>
        <p>But so far! So far to the surface and his lungs could not do this thing, could not hold and were through, and he sucked water, took a great pull of water that would finally-win, finally take him, and his head broke into light and he vomited and swam, pulling without knowing what he was, what he was doing. Without knowing anything.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Pulling until his hands caught at weeds and muck, pulling and screaming until his hands caught at last in grass and brush and he felt his chest on land, felt his face in the coarse blades of grass and he stopped, everything stopped. A colour came that he had never seen before, a colour that exploded in his mind with the pain and he was gone, gone from it all, spiralling out into the world, spiralling out into nothing.</p>
        <p>Nothing.<br>

        <p>Not quite in front but slightly to the right he saw a lake. L-shaped, with rounded corners, and the plane was nearly aimed at the long part of the L, coming from the bottom and heading to the top. Just a tiny bit to the right. He pushed the right rudder pedal gently and the nose moved over.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But the turn cost him speed and now the lake was above the nose. He pulled back on the wheel slightly and the nose came up. This caused the plane to slow dramatically and almost seem to stop and wallow in the air. The controls became very loose feeling and frightened Brian, making him push the wheel back in. This increased the speed a bit, but fiIled the windshield once more with nothing but trees, and put the lake well above the nose and out of reach.</p>
        <p>For a space of three or four seconds, things seemed to hang, almost to stop. The plane was flying, but so slowly, so slowly...it would never reach the lake. Brian looked out to the side and saw a small pond and at the edge of the pond some large animal, he thought, a moose standing out in the water. All so still looking, so stopped, the pond and the moose and the trees, as he slid over them now only three or four hundred feet off the ground all like a picture.</p>
        <p>Then everything happened at once. Trees suddenly took on detail, filled his whole field of vision with green, and he knew he would hit and die, would die, but his luck held and just as he was to hit, he came into an open lane, a channel of fallen trees, a wide place leading to the lake.</p>
        <p>The plane, committed now to landing, to crashing, fell into the wide place like a stone, and Brian eased back on the wheel and braced himself for the crash. But there was a tiny bit of speed left and when he pulled on the wheel the nose came up and he saw in front the blue of the lake and at that instant the plane hit the trees.</p>
        <p>There was a great wrenching as the wings caught the pines at the side of the clearing and broke back, ripping back just outside the main braces. Dust and dirt blew off the floor into his face so hard he thought there must have been some kind of explosion. He was momentarily blinded and slammed forward in the seat, smashing his head on the wheel.</p>
        <p>Then a wild crashing sound, ripping of metal, and the plane rolled to the right and blew through the trees, out over the water and down, down to slam into the lake, skip once on water as hard as concrete, water that tore the windshield out and shattered the side windows, water that drove him back into the seat. Somebody was screaming, screaming as the plane drove down into the water. Someone screamed tight animal, screams of fear and pain and he did not know that it was his sound, that he roared against the water that took him and the plane still deeper, down in the water. He saw nothing but sensed blue, cold blue-green, and he raked at the seatbelt catch, tore his nails loose on one hand. He ripped at it until it released and somehow-the water trying to kill him, to end him - somehow he pulled himself out of the shattered front window and clawed up into the blue, felt something hold him back, felt his windbreaker tear and he was free.</p>
        <p>Tearing free. Ripping free.</p>
        <p>But so far! So far to the surface and his lungs could not do this thing, could not hold and were through, and he sucked water, took a great pull of water that would finally-win, finally take him, and his head broke into light and he vomited and swam, pulling without knowing what he was, what he was doing. Without knowing anything.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Pulling until his hands caught at weeds and muck, pulling and screaming until his hands caught at last in grass and brush and he felt his chest on land, felt his face in the coarse blades of grass and he stopped, everything stopped. A colour came that he had never seen before, a colour that exploded in his mind with the pain and he was gone, gone from it all, spiralling out into the world, spiralling out into nothing.</p>
        <p>Nothing.<br>

          <strong>Chapter 5 - 6</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Brian leaned against the rock and stared out at the lake. What, in all of this, was there to eat? He was so used to having food just be there, just always being there. When he was hungry, he went to the icebox, or to the store, or sat down at a meal his mother cooked.</p>
        <p>Oh, he thought, remembering a meal now. It was the last Thanksgiving, last year, the last Thanksgiving they had as a family before his mother demanded the divorce and his father moved out in the following January. Brian already knew the Secret but did not know it would cause them to break up and thought it might work out, the Secret that his father still did not know but that he would try to tell him. When he saw him.</p>
        <p>The meal had been turkey and they cooked it in the back yard in the barbecue over charcoal with the lid down tight. His father had put hickory chips on the charcoal and the smell of the cooking turkey and the hickory smoke had filled the yard. When his father took the lid off, smiling, the smell that had come out was unbelievable, and when they sat to eat, the meat was wet with juice and rich with the taste of the smoke in it. …</p>
        <p>He had to stop this. His mouth was full of saliva and his stomach was twisting and growling.</p>
        <p>What was there to eat?</p>
        <p>What did they do in the movies when they got stranded like this? Oh, yes, the hero usually found some kind of plant that he knew was good to eat and that took care of it. Just ate the plant until he was full or used some kind of cute trap to catch an animal and cook it over a slick little fire and pretty soon he had a full eight-course meal.</p>
        <p>The trouble, Brian thought, looking around, was that all he could see was grass and brush. There was nothing obvious to eat and aside from about a million birds and the beaver he hadn’t seen animals to trap and cook, and even if he got one somehow he didn’t have any matches so he couldn’t have a fire...</p>
        <p>Nothing.</p>
        <p>It kept coming back to that. He had nothing.</p>
        <p>Well, almost nothing. As a matter of fact, he thought, I don’t know what I’ve got or haven’t got. Maybe I should try and figure out just how I stand. It will give me something to do-keep me from thinking of food. Until they come to find me.<br>
Brian had once had an English teacher, a guy named Perpich, who was always talking about being positive, thinking positive, staying on top of things. That’s how Perpich had put it-stay positive and stay on top of things. Brian thought of him now and wondered how to stay positive and stay on top of this. All Perpich would say is that I have to get motivated. He was always telling kids to get motivated.</p>
        <p>Brian changed position so he was sitting on his knees. He reached into his pockets and took out everything he had and laid it on the grass in front of him. It was pitiful enough. A quarter, three dimes, a nickel, and two pennies. A fingernail clipper. A billfold with a twenty-dollar bill - “In case you get stranded at the airport in some small town and have to buy food,” his mother had said-and some odd pieces of paper.</p>
        <p>And on his belt, somehow still there, the hatchet his mother had given him. He had forgotten it and now reached around and took it out and put it in the grass. There was a touch of rust already forming on the cutting edge of the blade and he rubbed it off with his thumb.</p>
        <p>That was it.</p>
        <p>He frowned. No, wait-if he was going to play the game, might as well play it right. Perpich would tell him to quit messing around. Get motivated.</p>
        <p>Look at all of it, Robeson.</p>
        <p>He had on a pair of good tennis shoes, now almost dry. And socks. And jeans and underwear and a thin leather belt and a T-shirt with a windbreaker so torn it hung on him in tatters. And a watch. He had a digital watch still on his wrist, but it was broken from the crash - the little screen blank - and he took it off and almost threw it away but stopped the hand motion and lay the watch on the grass with the rest of it.</p>
        <p>There. That was it.</p>
        <p>No, wait. One other thing. Those were all the things he had, but he also had himself. Perpich used to drum that into them-’You are your most valuable asset. Don’t forget that. You are the best thing you have.”</p>
        <p>Brian looked around again. I wish you were here, Perpich. I’m hungry and I’d trade everything I have for a hamburger.<br>
“I’m hungry.” He said it aloud. In normal tones at first, then louder and louder until he was yelling it. “I’m hungry, I’m hungry, I’m hungry!”</p>
        <p>When he stopped there was sudden silence, not just from him but the clicks and blurps and bird sounds of the forest as well. The noise of his voice had startled everything, and it was quiet. He looked around, listened with his mouth open, and realized that in all his life he had never heard silence before. Complete silence. There had always been some sound, some kind of sound. It lasted only a few seconds, but it was so intense that it seemed to become part of him. Nothing.</p>
        <p>There was no sound. Then the bird started again, and some kind of buzzing insect, and then a chattering and a cawing, and soon there was the same background of sound.</p>
        <p>Which left him still hungry.</p>

          <strong>Chapter 5 - 6</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Brian leaned against the rock and stared out at the lake. What, in all of this, was there to eat? He was so used to having food just be there, just always being there. When he was hungry, he went to the icebox, or to the store, or sat down at a meal his mother cooked.</p>
        <p>Oh, he thought, remembering a meal now. It was the last Thanksgiving, last year, the last Thanksgiving they had as a family before his mother demanded the divorce and his father moved out in the following January. Brian already knew the Secret but did not know it would cause them to break up and thought it might work out, the Secret that his father still did not know but that he would try to tell him. When he saw him.</p>
        <p>The meal had been turkey and they cooked it in the back yard in the barbecue over charcoal with the lid down tight. His father had put hickory chips on the charcoal and the smell of the cooking turkey and the hickory smoke had filled the yard. When his father took the lid off, smiling, the smell that had come out was unbelievable, and when they sat to eat, the meat was wet with juice and rich with the taste of the smoke in it. …</p>
        <p>He had to stop this. His mouth was full of saliva and his stomach was twisting and growling.</p>
        <p>What was there to eat?</p>
        <p>What did they do in the movies when they got stranded like this? Oh, yes, the hero usually found some kind of plant that he knew was good to eat and that took care of it. Just ate the plant until he was full or used some kind of cute trap to catch an animal and cook it over a slick little fire and pretty soon he had a full eight-course meal.</p>
        <p>The trouble, Brian thought, looking around, was that all he could see was grass and brush. There was nothing obvious to eat and aside from about a million birds and the beaver he hadn’t seen animals to trap and cook, and even if he got one somehow he didn’t have any matches so he couldn’t have a fire...</p>
        <p>Nothing.</p>
        <p>It kept coming back to that. He had nothing.</p>
        <p>Well, almost nothing. As a matter of fact, he thought, I don’t know what I’ve got or haven’t got. Maybe I should try and figure out just how I stand. It will give me something to do-keep me from thinking of food. Until they come to find me.<br>
Brian had once had an English teacher, a guy named Perpich, who was always talking about being positive, thinking positive, staying on top of things. That’s how Perpich had put it-stay positive and stay on top of things. Brian thought of him now and wondered how to stay positive and stay on top of this. All Perpich would say is that I have to get motivated. He was always telling kids to get motivated.</p>
        <p>Brian changed position so he was sitting on his knees. He reached into his pockets and took out everything he had and laid it on the grass in front of him. It was pitiful enough. A quarter, three dimes, a nickel, and two pennies. A fingernail clipper. A billfold with a twenty-dollar bill - “In case you get stranded at the airport in some small town and have to buy food,” his mother had said-and some odd pieces of paper.</p>
        <p>And on his belt, somehow still there, the hatchet his mother had given him. He had forgotten it and now reached around and took it out and put it in the grass. There was a touch of rust already forming on the cutting edge of the blade and he rubbed it off with his thumb.</p>
        <p>That was it.</p>
        <p>He frowned. No, wait-if he was going to play the game, might as well play it right. Perpich would tell him to quit messing around. Get motivated.</p>
        <p>Look at all of it, Robeson.</p>
        <p>He had on a pair of good tennis shoes, now almost dry. And socks. And jeans and underwear and a thin leather belt and a T-shirt with a windbreaker so torn it hung on him in tatters. And a watch. He had a digital watch still on his wrist, but it was broken from the crash - the little screen blank - and he took it off and almost threw it away but stopped the hand motion and lay the watch on the grass with the rest of it.</p>
        <p>There. That was it.</p>
        <p>No, wait. One other thing. Those were all the things he had, but he also had himself. Perpich used to drum that into them-’You are your most valuable asset. Don’t forget that. You are the best thing you have.”</p>
        <p>Brian looked around again. I wish you were here, Perpich. I’m hungry and I’d trade everything I have for a hamburger.<br>
“I’m hungry.” He said it aloud. In normal tones at first, then louder and louder until he was yelling it. “I’m hungry, I’m hungry, I’m hungry!”</p>
        <p>When he stopped there was sudden silence, not just from him but the clicks and blurps and bird sounds of the forest as well. The noise of his voice had startled everything, and it was quiet. He looked around, listened with his mouth open, and realized that in all his life he had never heard silence before.

          <strong>Chapter 5 - 6</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Brian leaned against the rock and stared out at the lake. What, in all of this, was there to eat? He was so used to having food just be there, just always being there. When he was hungry, he went to the icebox, or to the store, or sat down at a meal his mother cooked.</p>
        <p>Oh, he thought, remembering a meal now. It was the last Thanksgiving, last year, the last Thanksgiving they had as a family before his mother demanded the divorce and his father moved out in the following January. Brian already knew the Secret but did not know it would cause them to break up and thought it might work out, the Secret that his father still did not know but that he would try to tell him. When he saw him.</p>
        <p>The meal had been turkey and they cooked it in the back yard in the barbecue over charcoal with the lid down tight. His father had put hickory chips on the charcoal and the smell of the cooking turkey and the hickory smoke had filled the yard. When his father took the lid off, smiling, the smell that had come out was unbelievable, and when they sat to eat, the meat was wet with juice and rich with the taste of the smoke in it. …</p>
        <p>He had to stop this. His mouth was full of saliva and his stomach was twisting and growling.</p>
        <p>What was there to eat?</p>
        <p>What did they do in the movies when they got stranded like this? Oh, yes, the hero usually found some kind of plant that he knew was good to eat and that took care of it. Just ate the plant until he was full or used some kind of cute trap to catch an animal and cook it over a slick little fire and pretty soon he had a full eight-course meal.</p>
        <p>The trouble, Brian thought, looking around, was that all he could see was grass and brush. There was nothing obvious to eat and aside from about a million birds and the beaver he hadn’t seen animals to trap and cook, and even if he got one somehow he didn’t have any matches so he couldn’t have a fire...</p>
        <p>Nothing.</p>
        <p>It kept coming back to that. He had nothing.</p>
        <p>Well, almost nothing. As a matter of fact, he thought, I don’t know what I’ve got or haven’t got. Maybe I should try and figure out just how I stand. It will give me something to do-keep me from thinking of food. Until they come to find me.<br>
Brian had once had an English teacher, a guy named Perpich, who was always talking about being positive, thinking positive, staying on top of things. That’s how Perpich had put it-stay positive and stay on top of things. Brian thought of him now and wondered how to stay positive and stay on top of this. All Perpich would say is that I have to get motivated. He was always telling kids to get motivated.</p>
        <p>Brian changed position so he was sitting on his knees. He reached into his pockets and took out everything he had and laid it on the grass in front of him. It was pitiful enough. A quarter, three dimes, a nickel, and two pennies. A fingernail clipper. A billfold with a twenty-dollar bill - “In case you get stranded at the airport in some small town and have to buy food,” his mother had said-and some odd pieces of paper.</p>
        <p>And on his belt, somehow still there, the hatchet his mother had given him. He had forgotten it and now reached around and took it out and put it in the grass. There was a touch of rust already forming on the cutting edge of the blade and he rubbed it off with his thumb.</p>
        <p>That was it.</p>
        <p>He frowned. No, wait-if he was going to play the game, might as well play it right. Perpich would tell him to quit messing around. Get motivated.</p>
        <p>Look at all of it, Robeson.</p>
        <p>He had on a pair of good tennis shoes, now almost dry. And socks. And jeans and underwear and a thin leather belt and a T-shirt with a windbreaker so torn it hung on him in tatters. And a watch. He had a digital watch still on his wrist, but it was broken from the crash - the little screen blank - and he took it off and almost threw it away but stopped the hand motion and lay the watch on the grass with the rest of it.</p>
        <p>There. That was it.</p>
        <p>No, wait. One other thing. Those were all the things he had, but he also had himself. Perpich used to drum that into them-’You are your most valuable asset. Don’t forget that. You are the best thing you have.”</p>
        <p>Brian looked around again. I wish you were here, Perpich. I’m hungry and I’d trade everything I have for a hamburger.<br>
“I’m hungry.” He said it aloud. In normal tones at first, then louder and louder until he was yelling it. “I’m hungry, I’m hungry, I’m hungry!”</p>
        <p>When he stopped there was sudden silence, not just from him but the clicks and blurps and bird sounds of the forest as well. The noise of his voice had startled everything, and it was quiet. He looked around, listened with his mouth open, and realized that in all his life he had never heard silence before. Complete silence. There had always been some sound, some kind of sound. It lasted only a few seconds, but it was so intense that it seemed to become part of him. Nothing.</p>
        <p>There was no sound. Then the bird started again, and some kind of buzzing insect, and then a chattering and a cawing, and soon there was the same background of sound.</p>
        <p>Which left him still hungry.</p>

          <strong>Chapter 5 - 6</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Brian leaned against the rock and stared out at the lake. What, in all of this, was there to eat? He was so used to having food just be there, just always being there. When he was hungry, he went to the icebox, or to the store, or sat down at a meal his mother cooked.</p>
        <p>Oh, he thought, remembering a meal now. It was the last Thanksgiving, last year, the last Thanksgiving they had as a family before his mother demanded the divorce and his father moved out in the following January. Brian already knew the Secret but did not know it would cause them to break up and thought it might work out, the Secret that his father still did not know but that he would try to tell him. When he saw him.</p>
        <p>The meal had been turkey and they cooked it in the back yard in the barbecue over charcoal with the lid down tight. His father had put hickory chips on the charcoal and the smell of the cooking turkey and the hickory smoke had filled the yard. When his father took the lid off, smiling, the smell that had come out was unbelievable, and when they sat to eat, the meat was wet with juice and rich with the taste of the smoke in it. …</p>
        <p>He had to stop this. His mouth was full of saliva and his stomach was twisting and growling.</p>
        <p>What was there to eat?</p>
        <p>What did they do in the movies when they got stranded like this? Oh, yes, the hero usually found some kind of plant that he knew was good to eat and that took care of it. Just ate the plant until he was full or used some kind of cute trap to catch an animal and cook it over a slick little fire and pretty soon he had a full eight-course meal.</p>
        <p>The trouble, Brian thought, looking around, was that all he could see was grass and brush. There was nothing obvious to eat and aside from about a million birds and the beaver he hadn’t seen animals to trap and cook, and even if he got one somehow he didn’t have any matches so he couldn’t have a fire...</p>
        <p>Nothing.</p>
        <p>It kept coming back to that. He had nothing.</p>
        <p>Well, almost nothing. As a matter of fact, he thought, I don’t know what I’ve got or haven’t got. Maybe I should try and figure out just how I stand. It will give me something to do-keep me from thinking of food. Until they come to find me.<br>
Brian had once had an English teacher, a guy named Perpich, who was always talking about being positive, thinking positive, staying on top of things. That’s how Perpich had put it-stay positive and stay on top of things. Brian thought of him now and wondered how to stay positive and stay on top of this. All Perpich would say is that I have to get motivated. He was always telling kids to get motivated.</p>
        <p>Brian changed position so he was sitting on his knees. He reached into his pockets and took out everything he had and laid it on the grass in front of him. It was pitiful enough. A quarter, three dimes, a nickel, and two pennies. A fingernail clipper. A billfold with a twenty-dollar bill - “In case you get stranded at the airport in some small town and have to buy food,” his mother had said-and some odd pieces of paper.</p>
        <p>And on his belt, somehow still there, the hatchet his mother had given him. He had forgotten it and now reached around and took it out and put it in the grass. There was a touch of rust already forming on the cutting edge of the blade and he rubbed it off with his thumb.</p>
        <p>That was it.</p>
        <p>He frowned. No, wait-if he was going to play the game, might as well play it right. Perpich would tell him to quit messing around. Get motivated.</p>
        <p>Look at all of it, Robeson.</p>
        <p>He had on a pair of good tennis shoes, now almost dry. And socks. And jeans and underwear and a thin leather belt and a T-shirt with a windbreaker so torn it hung on him in tatters. And a watch. He had a digital watch still on his wrist, but it was broken from the crash - the little screen blank - and he took it off and almost threw it away but stopped the hand motion and lay the watch on the grass with the rest of it.</p>
        <p>There. That was it.</p>
        <p>No, wait. One other thing. Those were all the things he had, but he also had himself. Perpich used to drum that into them-’You are your most valuable asset. Don’t forget that. You are the best thing you have.”</p>
        <p>Brian looked around again. I wish you were here, Perpich. I’m hungry and I’d trade everything I have for a hamburger.<br>
“I’m hungry.” He said it aloud. In normal tones at first, then louder and louder until he was yelling it. “I’m hungry, I’m hungry, I’m hungry!”</p>
        <p>When he stopped there was sudden silence, not just from him but the clicks and blurps and bird sounds of the forest as well. The noise of his voice had startled everything, and it was quiet. He looked around, listened with his mouth open, and realized that in all his life he had never heard silence before. Complete silence. There had always been some sound, some kind of sound. It lasted only a few seconds, but it was so intense that it seemed to become part of him. Nothing.</p>
        <p>There was no sound. Then the bird started again, and some kind of buzzing insect, and then a chattering and a cawing, and soon there was the same background of sound.</p>
        <p>Which left him still hungry.</p>

          <strong>Chapter 5 - 6</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Brian leaned against the rock and stared out at the lake. What, in all of this, was there to eat? He was so used to having food just be there, just always being there. When he was hungry, he went to the icebox, or to the store, or sat down at a meal his mother cooked.</p>
        <p>Oh, he thought, remembering a meal now. It was the last Thanksgiving, last year, the last Thanksgiving they had as a family before his mother demanded the divorce and his father moved out in the following January. Brian already knew the Secret but did not know it would cause them to break up and thought it might work out, the Secret that his father still did not know but that he would try to tell him. When he saw him.</p>
        <p>The meal had been turkey and they cooked it in the back yard in the barbecue over charcoal with the lid down tight. His father had put hickory chips on the charcoal and the smell of the cooking turkey and the hickory smoke had filled the yard. When his father took the lid off, smiling, the smell that had come out was unbelievable, and when they sat to eat, the meat was wet with juice and rich with the taste of the smoke in it. …</p>
        <p>He had to stop this. His mouth was full of saliva and his stomach was twisting and growling.</p>
        <p>What was there to eat?</p>
        <p>What did they do in the movies when they got stranded like this? Oh, yes, the hero usually found some kind of plant that he knew was good to eat and that took care of it. Just ate the plant until he was full or used some kind of cute trap to catch an animal and cook it over a slick little fire and pretty soon he had a full eight-course meal.</p>
        <p>The trouble, Brian thought, looking around, was that all he could see was grass and brush. There was nothing obvious to eat and aside from about a million birds and the beaver he hadn’t seen animals to trap and cook, and even if he got one somehow he didn’t have any matches so he couldn’t have a fire...</p>
        <p>Nothing.</p>
        <p>It kept coming back to that. He had nothing.</p>
        <p>Well, almost nothing. As a matter of fact, he thought, I don’t know what I’ve got or haven’t got. Maybe I should try and figure out just how I stand. It will give me something to do-keep me from thinking of food. Until they come to find me.<br>
Brian had once had an English teacher, a guy named Perpich, who was always talking about being positive, thinking positive, staying on top of things. That’s how Perpich had put it-stay positive and stay on top of things. Brian thought of him now and wondered how to stay positive and stay on top of this. All Perpich would say is that I have to get motivated. He was always telling kids to get motivated.</p>
        <p>Brian changed position so he was sitting on his knees. He reached into his pockets and took out everything he had and laid it on the grass in front of him. It was pitiful enough. A quarter, three dimes, a nickel, and two pennies. A fingernail clipper. A billfold with a twenty-dollar bill - “In case you get stranded at the airport in some small town and have to buy food,” his mother had said-and some odd pieces of paper.</p>
        <p>And on his belt, somehow still there, the hatchet his mother had given him. He had forgotten it and now reached around and took it out and put it in the grass. There was a touch of rust already forming on the cutting edge of the blade and he rubbed it off with his thumb.</p>
        <p>That was it.</p>
        <p>He frowned. No, wait-if he was going to play the game, might as well play it right. Perpich would tell him to quit messing around. Get motivated.</p>
        <p>Look at all of it, Robeson.</p>
        <p>He had on a pair of good tennis shoes, now almost dry. And socks. And jeans and underwear and a thin leather belt and a T-shirt with a windbreaker so torn it hung on him in tatters. And a watch. He had a digital watch still on his wrist, but it was broken from the crash - the little screen blank - and he took it off and almost threw it away but stopped the hand motion and lay the watch on the grass with the rest of it.</p>
        <p>There. That was it.</p>
        <p>No, wait. One other thing. Those were all the things he had, but he also had himself. Perpich used to drum that into them-’You are your most valuable asset. Don’t forget that. You are the best thing you have.”</p>
        <p>Brian looked around again. I wish you were here, Perpich. I’m hungry and I’d trade everything I have for a hamburger.<br>
“I’m hungry.” He said it aloud. In normal tones at first, then louder and louder until he was yelling it. “I’m hungry, I’m hungry, I’m hungry!”</p>
        <p>When he stopped there was sudden silence, not just from him but the clicks and blurps and bird sounds of the forest as well. The noise of his voice had startled everything, and it was quiet. He looked around, listened with his mouth open, and realized that in all his life he had never heard silence before. Complete silence. There had always been some sound, some kind of sound. It lasted only a few seconds, but it was so intense that it seemed to become part of him. Nothing.</p>
        <p>There was no sound. Then the bird started again, and some kind of buzzing insect, and then a chattering and a cawing, and soon there was the same background of sound.</p>
        <p>Which left him still hungry.</p>

          <strong>Chapter 5 - 6</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Brian leaned against the rock and stared out at the lake. What, in all of this, was there to eat? He was so used to having food just be there, just always being there. When he was hungry, he went to the icebox, or to the store, or sat down at a meal his mother cooked.</p>
        <p>Oh, he thought, remembering a meal now. It was the last Thanksgiving, last year, the last Thanksgiving they had as a family before his mother demanded the divorce and his father moved out in the following January. Brian already knew the Secret but did not know it would cause them to break up and thought it might work out, the Secret that his father still did not know but that he would try to tell him. When he saw him.</p>
        <p>The meal had been turkey and they cooked it in the back yard in the barbecue over charcoal with the lid down tight. His father had put hickory chips on the charcoal and the smell of the cooking turkey and the hickory smoke had filled the yard. When his father took the lid off, smiling, the smell that had come out was unbelievable, and when they sat to eat, the meat was wet with juice and rich with the taste of the smoke in it. …</p>
        <p>He had to stop this. His mouth was full of saliva and his stomach was twisting and growling.</p>
        <p>What was there to eat?</p>
        <p>What did they do in the movies when they got stranded like this? Oh, yes, the hero usually found some kind of plant that he knew was good to eat and that took care of it. Just ate the plant until he was full or used some kind of cute trap to catch an animal and cook it over a slick little fire and pretty soon he had a full eight-course meal.</p>
        <p>The trouble, Brian thought, looking around, was that all he could see was grass and brush. There was nothing obvious to eat and aside from about a million birds and the beaver he hadn’t seen animals to trap and cook, and even if he got one somehow he didn’t have any matches so he couldn’t have a fire...</p>
        <p>Nothing.</p>
        <p>It kept coming back to that. He had nothing.</p>
        <p>Well, almost nothing. As a matter of fact, he thought, I don’t know what I’ve got or haven’t got. Maybe I should try and figure out just how I stand. It will give me something to do-keep me from thinking of food. Until they come to find me.<br>
Brian had once had an English teacher, a guy named Perpich, who was always talking about being positive, thinking positive, staying on top of things. That’s how Perpich had put it-stay positive and stay on top of things. Brian thought of him now and wondered how to stay positive and stay on top of this. All Perpich would say is that I have to get motivated. He was always telling kids to get motivated.</p>
        <p>Brian changed position so he was sitting on his knees. He reached into his pockets and took out everything he had and laid it on the grass in front of him. It was pitiful enough. A quarter, three dimes, a nickel, and two pennies. A fingernail clipper. A billfold with a twenty-dollar bill - “In case you get stranded at the airport in some small town and have to buy food,” his mother had said-and some odd pieces of paper.</p>
        <p>And on his belt, somehow still there, the hatchet his mother had given him. He had forgotten it and now reached around and took it out and put it in the grass. There was a touch of rust already forming on the cutting edge of the blade and he rubbed it off with his thumb.</p>
        <p>That was it.</p>
        <p>He frowned. No, wait-if he was going to play the game, might as well play it right. Perpich would tell him to quit messing around. Get motivated.</p>
        <p>Look at all of it, Robeson.</p>
        <p>He had on a pair of good tennis shoes, now almost dry. And socks. And jeans and underwear and a thin leather belt and a T-shirt with a windbreaker so torn it hung on him in tatters. And a watch. He had a digital watch still on his wrist, but it was broken from the crash - the little screen blank - and he took it off and almost threw it away but stopped the hand motion and lay the watch on the grass with the rest of it.</p>
        <p>There. That was it.</p>
        <p>No, wait. One other thing. Those were all the things he had, but he also had himself. Perpich used to drum that into them-’You are your most valuable asset. Don’t forget that. You are the best thing you have.”</p>
        <p>Brian looked around again. I wish you were here, Perpich. I’m hungry and I’d trade everything I have for a hamburger.<br>
“I’m hungry.” He said it aloud. In normal tones at first, then louder and louder until he was yelling it. “I’m hungry, I’m hungry, I’m hungry!”</p>
        <p>When he stopped there was sudden silence, not just from him but the clicks and blurps and bird sounds of the forest as well. The noise of his voice had startled everything, and it was quiet. He looked around, listened with his mouth open, and realized that in all his life he had never heard silence before. Complete silence. There had always been some sound, some kind of sound. It lasted only a few seconds, but it was so intense that it seemed to become part of him. Nothing.</p>
        <p>There was no sound. Then the bird started again, and some kind of buzzing insect, and then a chattering and a cawing, and soon there was the same background of sound.</p>
        <p>Which left him still hungry.</p>

          <strong>Chapter 5 - 6</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Brian leaned against the rock and stared out at the lake. What, in all of this, was there to eat? He was so used to having food just be there, just always being there. When he was hungry, he went to the icebox, or to the store, or sat down at a meal his mother cooked.</p>
        <p>Oh, he thought, remembering a meal now. It was the last Thanksgiving, last year, the last Thanksgiving they had as a family before his mother demanded the divorce and his father moved out in the following January. Brian already knew the Secret but did not know it would cause them to break up and thought it might work out, the Secret that his father still did not know but that he would try to tell him. When he saw him.</p>
        <p>The meal had been turkey and they cooked it in the back yard in the barbecue over charcoal with the lid down tight. His father had put hickory chips on the charcoal and the smell of the cooking turkey and the hickory smoke had filled the yard. When his father took the lid off, smiling, the smell that had come out was unbelievable, and when they sat to eat, the meat was wet with juice and rich with the taste of the smoke in it. …</p>
        <p>He had to stop this. His mouth was full of saliva and his stomach was twisting and growling.</p>
        <p>What was there to eat?</p>
        <p>What did they do in the movies when they got stranded like this? Oh, yes, the hero usually found some kind of plant that he knew was good to eat and that took care of it. Just ate the plant until he was full or used some kind of cute trap to catch an animal and cook it over a slick little fire and pretty soon he had a full eight-course meal.</p>
        <p>The trouble, Brian thought, looking around, was that all he could see was grass and brush. There was nothing obvious to eat and aside from about a million birds and the beaver he hadn’t seen animals to trap and cook, and even if he got one somehow he didn’t have any matches so he couldn’t have a fire...</p>
        <p>Nothing.</p>
        <p>It kept coming back to that. He had nothing.</p>
        <p>Well, almost nothing. As a matter of fact, he thought, I don’t know what I’ve got or haven’t got. Maybe I should try and figure out just how I stand. It will give me something to do-keep me from thinking of food. Until they come to find me.<br>
Brian had once had an English teacher, a guy named Perpich, who was always talking about being positive, thinking positive, staying on top of things. That’s how Perpich had put it-stay positive and stay on top of things. Brian thought of him now and wondered how to stay positive and stay on top of this. All Perpich would say is that I have to get motivated. He was always telling kids to get motivated.</p>
        <p>Brian changed position so he was sitting on his knees. He reached into his pockets and took out everything he had and laid it on the grass in front of him. It was pitiful enough. A quarter, three dimes, a nickel, and two pennies. A fingernail clipper. A billfold with a twenty-dollar bill - “In case you get stranded at the airport in some small town and have to buy food,” his mother had said-and some odd pieces of paper.</p>
        <p>And on his belt, somehow still there, the hatchet his mother had given him. He had forgotten it and now reached around and took it out and put it in the grass. There was a touch of rust already forming on the cutting edge of the blade and he rubbed it off with his thumb.</p>
        <p>That was it.</p>
        <p>He frowned. No, wait-if he was going to play the game, might as well play it right. Perpich would tell him to quit messing around. Get motivated.</p>
        <p>Look at all of it, Robeson.</p>
        <p>He had on a pair of good tennis shoes, now almost dry. And socks. And jeans and underwear and a thin leather belt and a T-shirt with a windbreaker so torn it hung on him in tatters. And a watch. He had a digital watch still on his wrist, but it was broken from the crash - the little screen blank - and he took it off and almost threw it away but stopped the hand motion and lay the watch on the grass with the rest of it.</p>
        <p>There. That was it.</p>
        <p>No, wait. One other thing. Those were all the things he had, but he also had himself. Perpich used to drum that into them-’You are your most valuable asset. Don’t forget that. You are the best thing you have.”</p>
        <p>Brian looked around again. I wish you were here, Perpich. I’m hungry and I’d trade everything I have for a hamburger.<br>
“I’m hungry.” He said it aloud. In normal tones at first, then louder and louder until he was yelling it. “I’m hungry, I’m hungry, I’m hungry!”</p>
        <p>When he stopped there was sudden silence, not just from him but the clicks and blurps and bird sounds of the forest as well. The noise of his voice had startled everything, and it was quiet. He looked around, listened with his mouth open, and realized that in all his life he had never heard silence before. Complete silence. There had always been some sound, some kind of sound. It lasted only a few seconds, but it was so intense that it seemed to become part of him. Nothing.</p>
        <p>There was no sound. Then the bird started again, and some kind of buzzing insect, and then a chattering and a cawing, and soon there was the same background of sound.</p>
        <p>Which left him still hungry.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Chapter 6</strong>
        </p>
        <p>What was there to eat?</p>
        <p>What had he read or seen that told him about food in the wilderness? Hadn’t there been something? A show, yes, a show on television about air force pilots and some kind of course they took A survival course. All right, he had the show coming into his thoughts now. The pilots had to live in the desert. They put them in the desert down in Arizona or someplace and they had to live for a week. They had to find food and water for a week For water they had made a sheet of plastic into a dew-gathering device and for food they ate lizards.</p>
        <p>That was it. Of course Brian had lots of water and there weren’t too many lizards in the Canadian woods, that he knew. One of the pilots had used a watch crystal as a magnifying glass to focus the sun and start a fire so thev didn’t have to eat the lizards raw. But Brian had a digital watch, without a crystal, broken at that. So the show didn’t help him much.</p>
        <p>Wait, there was one thing. One of the pilots, a woman, had found some kind of beans on a bush and she had used them with her lizard meat to make a little stew in a tin can she had found. Bean lizard stew. There weren’t any beans here, but there must be berries. There had to be berry bushes around.</p>
        <p>Sure, the woods were full of berry bushes. That’s what everybody always said. Well, he’d actually never heard anybody say it. But he felt that it should be true.</p>
        <p>There must be berry bushes.</p>
        <p>He stood and moved out into the sand and looked up at the sun. It was still high. He didn’t know what time it must be. At home it would be one or two if the sun were that high. At home at one or two his mother would be putting away the lunch dishes and getting ready for her exercise class. No, that would have been yesterday. Today she would be going to see him. Today was Thursday and she always went to see him on Thursdays. Wednesday was the exercise class and Thursdays she went to see him. Hot little jets of hate worked into his thoughts, pushed once, moved back If his mother hadn’t begun to see him and forced the divorce, Brian wouldn’t be here now.</p>
        <p>He shook his head. Had to stop that kind of thinking. The sun was still high and that meant that he had some time before darkness to find berries. He didn’t want to be away from his-he almost thought of it as home--shelter when it came to be dark</p>
        <p>He didn’t want to be anywhere in the woods when it came to be dark And he didn’t want to get lost-which was a real problem. All he knew in the world was the lake in front of him and the hill at his back and the ridge-if he lost sight of them there was a really good chance that he would get turned around and not find his way back</p>
        <p>So he had to look for berry bushes, but keep the lake or the rock ridge in sight at all times. He looked up the lake shore, to the north. For a good distance, perhaps two hundred yards, it was fairly clear. There were tall pines, the kind with no limbs until very close to the top, with a gentle breeze sighing in them, but not too much low brush.</p>
        <p>Two hundred yards up there seemed to be a belt of thicket lower brush starting-about ten or twelve feet high-and that formed a wall he could not see through. It seemed to go on around the lake, thick and lushly green, but he could not be sure. If there were berries they would be in that brush, he felt, and as long as he stayed close to the lake, so he could keep the water on his right and know it was there, he wouldn’t get lost When he was done or found berries, he thought, he would just turn around so the water was on his left and walk back until he came to the ridge and his shelter.</p>
        <p>Simple. Keep it simple. I am Brian Robeson. I have been in a plane crash. I am going to find some food. I am going to find berries.</p>
        <p>He walked slowly--still a bit pained in his joints and weak from hunger-up along the side of the lake. The trees were full of birds singing ahead of him in the sun. Some he knew, some he didn’t. He saw a robin, and some kind of sparrows, and a flock of reddish orange birds with thick beaks. Twenty or thirty of them were sitting in one of the pines.</p>
        <p>They made much noise and flew away ahead of him when he walked under the tree. He watched them fly, their colour a bright slash in solid green, and in this way he found the berries. The birds landed in some taller willow type of undergrowth with wide leaves and started jumping and making noise. At first he was too far away to see what they were doing, but their colour drew him and he moved toward them, keeping the lake in sight on his right, and when he got closer he saw they were eating berries.</p>
        <p>He could not believe it was that easy. It was as if the birds had taken him right to the berries. The slender branches went up about twenty feet and were heavy, drooping with clusters of bright red berries. They were half as big as grapes but hung in bunches much like grapes and when Brian saw them, glistening red in the sunlight, he almost yelled.</p>
        <p>His pace quickened and he was in them in moments, scattering the birds, grabbing branches, stripping them to fill his mouth with berries.</p>

          <strong>Chapter 6</strong>
        </p>
        <p>What was there to eat?</p>
        <p>What had he read or seen that told him about food in the wilderness? Hadn’t there been something? A show, yes, a show on television about air force pilots and some kind of course they took A survival course. All right, he had the show coming into his thoughts now. The pilots had to live in the desert. They put them in the desert down in Arizona or someplace and they had to live for a week. They had to find food and water for a week For water they had made a sheet of plastic into a dew-gathering device and for food they ate lizards.</p>
        <p>That was it. Of course Brian had lots of water and there weren’t too many lizards in the Canadian woods, that he knew. One of the pilots had used a watch crystal as a magnifying glass to focus the sun and start a fire so thev didn’t have to eat the lizards raw. But Brian had a digital watch, without a crystal, broken at that. So the show didn’t help him much.</p>
        <p>Wait, there was one thing. One of the pilots, a woman, had found some kind of beans on a bush and she had used them with her lizard meat to make a little stew in a tin can she had found. Bean lizard stew. There weren’t any beans here, but there must be berries. There had to be berry bushes around.</p>
        <p>Sure, the woods were full of berry bushes. That’s what everybody always said. Well, he’d actually never heard anybody say it. But he felt that it should be true.</p>
        <p>There must be berry bushes.</p>
        <p>He stood and moved out into the sand and looked up at the sun. It was still high. He didn’t know what time it must be. At home it would be one or two if the sun were that high. At home at one or two his mother would be putting away the lunch dishes and getting ready for her exercise class. No, that would have been yesterday. Today she would be going to see him. Today was Thursday and she always went to see him on Thursdays. Wednesday was the exercise class and Thursdays she went to see him. Hot little jets of hate worked into his thoughts, pushed once, moved back If his mother hadn’t begun to see him and forced the divorce, Brian wouldn’t be here now.</p>
        <p>He shook his head. Had to stop that kind of thinking. The sun was still high and that meant that he had some time before darkness to find berries. He didn’t want to be away from his-he almost thought of it as home--shelter when it came to be dark</p>
        <p>He didn’t want to be anywhere in the woods when it came to be dark And he didn’t want to get lost-which was a real problem. All he knew in the world was the lake in front of him and the hill at his back and the ridge-if he lost sight of them there was a really good chance that he would get turned around and not find his way back</p>
        <p>So he had to look for berry bushes, but keep the lake or the rock ridge in sight at all times. He looked up the lake shore, to the north. For a good distance, perhaps two hundred yards, it was fairly clear. There were tall pines, the kind with no limbs until very close to the top, with a gentle breeze sighing in them, but not too much low brush.</p>
        <p>Two hundred yards up there seemed to be a belt of thicket lower brush starting-about ten or twelve feet high-and that formed a wall he could not see through. It seemed to go on around the lake, thick and lushly green, but he could not be sure. If there were berries they would be in that brush, he felt, and as long as he stayed close to the lake, so he could keep the water on his right and know it was there, he wouldn’t get lost When he was done or found berries, he thought, he would just turn around so the water was on his left and walk back until he came to the ridge and his shelter.</p>
        <p>Simple. Keep it simple. I am Brian Robeson. I have been in a plane crash. I am going to find some food. I am going to find berries.</p>
        <p>He walked slowly--still a bit pained in his joints and weak from hunger-up along the side of the lake. The trees were full of birds singing ahead of him in the sun. Some he knew, some he didn’t. He saw a robin, and some kind of sparrows, and a flock of reddish orange birds with thick beaks. Twenty or thirty of them were sitting in one of the pines.</p>
        <p>They made much noise and flew away ahead of him when he walked under the tree. He watched them fly, their colour a bright slash in solid green, and in this way he found the berries. The birds landed in some taller willow type of undergrowth with wide leaves and started jumping and making noise. At first he was too far away to see what they were doing, but their colour drew him and he moved toward them, keeping the lake in sight on his right, and when he got closer he saw they were eating berries.</p>
        <p>He could not believe it was that easy. It was as if the birds had taken him right to the berries. The slender branches went up about twenty feet and were heavy, drooping with clusters of bright red berries. They were half as big as grapes but hung in bunches much like grapes and when Brian saw them, glistening red in the sunlight, he almost yelled.</p>
        <p>His pace quickened and he was in them in moments, scattering the birds, grabbing branches, stripping them to fill his mouth with berries.</p>

A show, yes, a show on television about air force pilots and some kind of course they took A survival course. All right, he had the show coming into his thoughts now. The pilots had to live in the desert. They put them in the desert down in Arizona or someplace and they had to live for a week. They had to find food and water for a week For water they had made a sheet of plastic into a dew-gathering device and for food they ate lizards.</p>
        <p>That was it. Of course Brian had lots of water and there weren’t too many lizards in the Canadian woods, that he knew. One of the pilots had used a watch crystal as a magnifying glass to focus the sun and start a fire so thev didn’t have to eat the lizards raw. But Brian had a digital watch, without a crystal, broken at that. So the show didn’t help him much.</p>
        <p>Wait, there was one thing. One of the pilots, a woman, had found some kind of beans on a bush and she had used them with her lizard meat to make a little stew in a tin can she had found. Bean lizard stew. There weren’t any beans here, but there must be berries. There had to be berry bushes around.</p>
        <p>Sure, the woods were full of berry bushes. That’s what everybody always said. Well, he’d actually never heard anybody say it. But he felt that it should be true.</p>
        <p>There must be berry bushes.</p>
        <p>He stood and moved out into the sand and looked up at the sun. It was still high. He didn’t know what time it must be. At home it would be one or two if the sun were that high. At home at one or two his mother would be putting away the lunch dishes and getting ready for her exercise class. No, that would have been yesterday. Today she would be going to see him. Today was Thursday and she always went to see him on Thursdays. Wednesday was the exercise class and Thursdays she went to see him. Hot little jets of hate worked into his thoughts, pushed once, moved back If his mother hadn’t begun to see him and forced the divorce, Brian wouldn’t be here now.</p>
        <p>He shook his head. Had to stop that kind of thinking. The sun was still high and that meant that he had some time before darkness to find berries. He didn’t want to be away from his-he almost thought of it as home--shelter when it came to be dark</p>
        <p>He didn’t want to be anywhere in the woods when it came to be dark And he didn’t want to get lost-which was a real problem. All he knew in the world was the lake in front of him and the hill at his back and the ridge-if he lost sight of them there was a really good chance that he would get turned around and not find his way back</p>
        <p>So he had to look for berry bushes, but keep the lake or the rock ridge in sight at all times. He looked up the lake shore, to the north. For a good distance, perhaps two hundred yards, it was fairly clear. There were tall pines, the kind with no limbs until very close to the top, with a gentle breeze sighing in them, but not too much low brush.</p>
        <p>Two hundred yards up there seemed to be a belt of thicket lower brush starting-about ten or twelve feet high-and that formed a wall he could not see through. It seemed to go on around the lake, thick and lushly green, but he could not be sure. If there were berries they would be in that brush, he felt, and as long as he stayed close to the lake, so he could keep the water on his right and know it was there, he wouldn’t get lost When he was done or found berries, he thought, he would just turn around so the water was on his left and walk back until he came to the ridge and his shelter.</p>
        <p>Simple. Keep it simple. I am Brian Robeson. I have been in a plane crash. I am going to find some food. I am going to find berries.</p>
        <p>He walked slowly--still a bit pained in his joints and weak from hunger-up along the side of the lake. The trees were full of birds singing ahead of him in the sun. Some he knew, some he didn’t. He saw a robin, and some kind of sparrows, and a flock of reddish orange birds with thick beaks. Twenty or thirty of them were sitting in one of the pines.</p>
        <p>They made much noise and flew away ahead of him when he walked under the tree. He watched them fly, their colour a bright slash in solid green, and in this way he found the berries. The birds landed in some taller willow type of undergrowth with wide leaves and started jumping and making noise. At first he was too far away to see what they were doing, but their colour drew him and he moved toward them, keeping the lake in sight on his right, and when he got closer he saw they were eating berries.</p>
        <p>He could not believe it was that easy. It was as if the birds had taken him right to the berries. The slender branches went up about twenty feet and were heavy, drooping with clusters of bright red berries. They were half as big as grapes but hung in bunches much like grapes and when Brian saw them, glistening red in the sunlight, he almost yelled.</p>
        <p>His pace quickened and he was in them in moments, scattering the birds, grabbing branches, stripping them to fill his mouth with berries.</p>

        <p>He shook his head. Had to stop that kind of thinking. The sun was still high and that meant that he had some time before darkness to find berries. He didn’t want to be away from his-he almost thought of it as home--shelter when it came to be dark</p>
        <p>He didn’t want to be anywhere in the woods when it came to be dark And he didn’t want to get lost-which was a real problem. All he knew in the world was the lake in front of him and the hill at his back and the ridge-if he lost sight of them there was a really good chance that he would get turned around and not find his way back</p>
        <p>So he had to look for berry bushes, but keep the lake or the rock ridge in sight at all times. He looked up the lake shore, to the north. For a good distance, perhaps two hundred yards, it was fairly clear. There were tall pines, the kind with no limbs until very close to the top, with a gentle breeze sighing in them, but not too much low brush.</p>
        <p>Two hundred yards up there seemed to be a belt of thicket lower brush starting-about ten or twelve feet high-and that formed a wall he could not see through. It seemed to go on around the lake, thick and lushly green, but he could not be sure. If there were berries they would be in that brush, he felt, and as long as he stayed close to the lake, so he could keep the water on his right and know it was there, he wouldn’t get lost When he was done or found berries, he thought, he would just turn around so the water was on his left and walk back until he came to the ridge and his shelter.</p>
        <p>Simple. Keep it simple. I am Brian Robeson. I have been in a plane crash. I am going to find some food. I am going to find berries.</p>
        <p>He walked slowly--still a bit pained in his joints and weak from hunger-up along the side of the lake. The trees were full of birds singing ahead of him in the sun. Some he knew, some he didn’t. He saw a robin, and some kind of sparrows, and a flock of reddish orange birds with thick beaks. Twenty or thirty of them were sitting in one of the pines.</p>
        <p>They made much noise and flew away ahead of him when he walked under the tree. He watched them fly, their colour a bright slash in solid green, and in this way he found the berries. The birds landed in some taller willow type of undergrowth with wide leaves and started jumping and making noise. At first he was too far away to see what they were doing, but their colour drew him and he moved toward them, keeping the lake in sight on his right, and when he got closer he saw they were eating berries.</p>
        <p>He could not believe it was that easy. It was as if the birds had taken him right to the berries. The slender branches went up about twenty feet and were heavy, drooping with clusters of bright red berries. They were half as big as grapes but hung in bunches much like grapes and when Brian saw them, glistening red in the sunlight, he almost yelled.</p>
        <p>His pace quickened and he was in them in moments, scattering the birds, grabbing branches, stripping them to fill his mouth with berries.</p>

          <strong>Chapter 9</strong>
        </p>
        <p>He positioned his spark nest - as he thought of it- at the base of the rock, used his thumb to make a small depression in the middle, and slammed the back of the hatchet down across the black rock. A cloud of sparks rained down, most of them missing the nest, but some, perhaps thirty or so, hit in the depression and of those six or seven found fuel and grew, smouldered and caused the bark to take on the red glow.</p>
        <p>Then they went out.</p>
        <p>Close - he was close. He repositioned the nest, made a new and smaller dent with his thumb, and struck again. More sparks, a slight glow then nothing.</p>
        <p>It’s me, he thought. I’m doing something wrong. I do not know this-a cave dweller would have had a fire by now, a Cro-Magnon man would have a fire by now but I don’t know this. I don’t know how to make a fire.</p>
        <p>Maybe not enough sparks. He settled the nest in place once more and hit the rock with a series of blows, as fast as he could. The sparks poured like a golden waterfall. At first they seemed to take, there were several, many sparks that found life and took briefly, but they all died.</p>
        <p>Starved.</p>
        <p>He leaned back They are like me. They are starving. It wasn’t quantity, there were plenty of sparks, but they needed more.</p>
        <p>I would kill, he thought suddenly, for a book of matches. Just one book. Just one match. I would kill.</p>
        <p>What makes fire? He thought back to school. To all those science classes. Had he ever learned what made a fire? Did a teacher ever stand up there and say, “This is what makes a fire. . . “ He shook his head, tried to focus his thoughts.</p>
        <p>What did it take? You have to have fuel, he thought-and he had that. The bark was fuel. Oxygen-there had to be air. He needed to add air. He had to fan on it, blow on it.</p>
        <p>He made the nest ready again, held the hatchet backward, tensed, and struck four quick blows. Sparks came down and he leaned forward as fast as he could and blew.</p>
        <p>Too hard. There was a bright, almost intense glow, then it was gone. He had blown it out. Another set of strikes, more sparks. He leaned and blew, but gently this time, holding back and aiming the stream of air from his mouth to hit the brightest spot. Five or six sparks had fallen in a tight mass of bark hair and Brian centred his efforts there.</p>
        <p>The sparks grew with his gentle breath. The red glow moved from the sparks themselves into the bark, moved and grew and became worms, glowing red worms that crawled up the bark hairs and caught other threads of bark and grew until there was a pocket of red as big as a quarter, a $owing red coal of heat. And when he ran out of breath and paused to inhale, the red ball suddenly burst into flame.</p>
        <p>“Fire!” He yelled. “I’ve got fire! I’ve got it, I’ve got it, I’ve got it . . . “</p>
        <p>But the flames were thick and oily and burning fast, consuming the ball of bark as fast as if it were gasoline. He had to feed the flames, keep them going. Stoking as fast as he could he carefully placed the dried grass and wood pieces he had tried at first on top of the bark and was gratified to see them take.</p>
        <p>But they would go fast. He needed more, and more. He could not let the flames go out. He ran from the shelter to the pines and started breaking off the low, dead smdl limbs. These he threw in the shelter, went back for more, threw those in, and squatted to break and feed the hungry flames. When the small wood was going well he went out and found larger wood and did not relax until that was going. Then he leaned back against the wood brace of his door opening and smiled.</p>
        <p>I have a friend, he thought-I have a friend now. A hungry friend, but a good one.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I have a friend named fire.</p>
        <p>“Hello, fire... “</p>
        <p>The curve of the rock back made an almost perfect drawing flue that carried the smoke up through the cracks of the roof but held the heat. If he kept the fire small it would be perfect and would keep anything like the porcupine from coming through the door again.</p>
