</p><p>Doris Lessing, author of The Golden Notebook and this year's&nbsp;winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature,&nbsp;had her Nobel lecture delivered in Stockholm on 7 December. Entitled&nbsp;"On Not Winning the Nobel Prize", Ms Lessing's singular voice comes through&nbsp;in her observations on how we read, and why we should.</p><p><span class="txt-underline"><strong>ON NOT WINNING THE NOBEL PRIZE</strong></span></p><p>I am standing in a doorway looking through clouds of blowing dust to where I am told there is still uncut forest. Yesterday I drove through miles of stumps, and charred remains of fires where, in ‘56, there was the most wonderful forest I have ever seen, all now destroyed. People have to eat. They have to get fuel for fires.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
This is north-west Zimbabwe in the early eighties, and I am visiting a friend who was a teacher in a school in London. He is here “to help Africa”, as we put it. He is a gently <strong>idealistic</strong> soul and what he found in this school shocked him into a depression, from which it was hard to recover. This school is like every other built after Independence. It consists of four large brick rooms side by side, put straight into the dust, one two three four, with a half room at one end, which is&nbsp;

<p>the library. In these classrooms are blackboards, but my friend keeps the chalks in his pocket, as otherwise they would be stolen. There is no atlas or globe in the school, no textbooks, no exercise books, or biros. In the library there are no books of the kind the pupils would like to read, but only <strong>tomes</strong> from American universities, hard even to lift, rejects from white libraries, detective stories, or novels with titles like<em> Weekend in Paris and Felicity Finds Love</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is a goat trying to find sustenance in some aged grass. The headmaster has <strong>embezzled</strong> the school funds and is suspended, arousing the question familiar to all of us but usually in more <strong>august</strong> contexts: How is it these people behave like this when they must know everyone is watching them?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>My friend doesn’t have any money because everyone, pupils and teachers, borrow from him when he is paid and will probably never pay him back. The pupils range from six to twenty-six, because some who did not get schooling as children are here to make it up. Some pupils walk many miles every morning, rain or shine and across rivers. They cannot do homework because there is no electricity in the villages, and you can’t study easily by the light of a burning log. The girls have to fetch water and cook before they set off for school and when they get back.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As I sit with my friend in his room, people drop in shyly, and everyone begs for books. “Please send us books when you get back to London,” one man says. “They taught us to read but we have no books.” Everybody I met, everyone, begged for books.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was there some days. The dust blew. The pumps had broken and the women were having to fetch water from the river. Another idealistic teacher from England was rather ill after seeing what this “school” was like.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the last day they slaughtered the goat. They cut it into bits and cooked it in a great tin. This was the much anticipated end-of-term feast: boiled goat and porridge. I drove away while it was still going on, back through the charred remains and stumps of the forest.</p>

<p>I do not think many of the pupils of this school will get prizes.</p>

          <strong>Mystery of the Tattooed Mummy</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Kristin Baird Rattini</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Deep inside an ancient pyramid in Peru, a mummy lay hidden in a gold-filled tomb. The underground chamber remained a secret for nearly 1,600 years, until an archaeologist noticed rectangular patches of soft clay in the pyramid's floor – a telltale sign of a grave. His heartbeat quickened. He suspected that someone powerful would be buried here.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The archaeologist was standing in a sacred location, a courtyard near the peak of the biggest pyramid at El Brujo – a ceremonial site of the ancient Moche (MO-chay) people. The civilization's rulers, who controlled the north coast of Peru from A.D. 100 to 800, probably reserved this spot for a king or a great warrior. What valuable treasures would lie inside this leader's tomb?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">The Mummy Unwrapped</span>
        </p>
        <p>Finally, after weeks of careful digging, the scientists peered through the ancient dust. In front of them lay one of the world's largest and best-preserved mummies. As they unwrapped the bundled layers, hundreds of treasures were revealed, including gold nose rings and necklaces, sparkling crowns, and huge war clubs usually reserved for the Moche's greatest warriors.</p>
        <p>But when archaeologists lifted a gold bowl covering the mummy's face, they found the biggest surprise yet. The mummy wasn't a king or a male warrior; it was a young Moche woman – and she was covered in mysterious tattoos!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">The Moche Way</span>
        </p>
        <p>Until now research had shown that only men ruled Moche society – a warrior culture in which prisoners were captured in battle and sacrificed in bloody rituals atop this very pyramid. Where did this 20-something woman fit in? Was she a queen? A high priestess? A warrior princess?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One thing's for sure: This Moche VIP would have received star treatment. When visiting her people, servants would have carried her high above the crowds on a litter, a special platform reserved for only the most elite figures. Says anthropologist John Verano: "Her gold objects would have shimmered&nbsp;so brightly you could have seen them from miles away."</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">Twenty Questions</span>
        </p>
        <p>Today this mystery woman is making headlines again. Her well-sealed tomb helped preserve hundreds of ancient artifacts – even her dresses and braided hair. "It's like going back in a time machine to A.D. 450 and seeing her just as she was," says Verano. But now the scientists have unearthed more questions than answers.<br>
What did the mummy's elaborate tattoos mean? With drawings of snakes, spiders, crabs, and imaginary animals crawling along her arms, legs, and feet, she has more body art than any known Moche mummy. No one knows for sure what these creatures mean, but the Moche may have believed the animals would bring healthy harvests.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And why was the mummy buried with 23 spear throwers? Even the most powerful male leaders were buried with only one or two. Did her bodyguards leave the weapons to protect her in the afterlife?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Most important, why did this adored woman die at such a young age? The skeleton showed no sign of disease or injury. Some experts think she may have died while giving birth, but researchers are still uncertain.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">Tomb Be Continued</span>
        </p>
        <p>Whoever this woman was, it’s clear from her elaborate burial that she was a star among her people. And now the ancient heroine’s tomb is helping experts re-create her life and the world of the Moche people.</p>

          <strong>Mystery of the Tattooed Mummy</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Kristin Baird Rattini</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Deep inside an ancient pyramid in Peru, a mummy lay hidden in a gold-filled tomb. The underground chamber remained a secret for nearly 1,600 years, until an archaeologist noticed rectangular patches of soft clay in the pyramid's floor – a telltale sign of a grave. His heartbeat quickened. He suspected that someone powerful would be buried here.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The archaeologist was standing in a sacred location, a courtyard near the peak of the biggest pyramid at El Brujo – a ceremonial site of the ancient Moche (MO-chay) people. The civilization's rulers, who controlled the north coast of Peru from A.D. 100 to 800, probably reserved this spot for a king or a great warrior. What valuable treasures would lie inside this leader's tomb?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">The Mummy Unwrapped</span>
        </p>
        <p>Finally, after weeks of careful digging, the scientists peered through the ancient dust. In front of them lay one of the world's largest and best-preserved mummies. As they unwrapped the bundled layers, hundreds of treasures were revealed, including gold nose rings and necklaces, sparkling crowns, and huge war clubs usually reserved for the Moche's greatest warriors.</p>
        <p>But when archaeologists lifted a gold bowl covering the mummy's face, they found the biggest surprise yet. The mummy wasn't a king or a male warrior; it was a young Moche woman – and she was covered in mysterious tattoos!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">The Moche Way</span>
        </p>
        <p>Until now research had shown that only men ruled Moche society – a warrior culture in which prisoners were captured in battle and sacrificed in bloody rituals atop this very pyramid. Where did this 20-something woman fit in? Was she a queen? A high priestess? A warrior princess?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One thing's for sure: This Moche VIP would have received star treatment. When visiting her people, servants would have carried her high above the crowds on a litter, a special platform reserved for only the most elite figures. Says anthropologist John Verano: "Her gold objects would have shimmered&nbsp;so brightly you could have seen them from miles away."</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">Twenty Questions</span>
        </p>
        <p>Today this mystery woman is making headlines again. Her well-sealed tomb helped preserve hundreds of ancient artifacts – even her dresses and braided hair. "It's like going back in a time machine to A.D. 450 and seeing her just as she was," says Verano. But now the scientists have unearthed more questions than answers.<br>
What did the mummy's elaborate tattoos mean? With drawings of snakes, spiders, crabs, and imaginary animals crawling along her arms, legs, and feet, she has more body art than any known Moche mummy. No one knows for sure what these creatures mean, but the Moche may have believed the animals would bring healthy harvests.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And why was the mummy buried with 23 spear throwers? Even the most powerful male leaders were buried with only one or two. Did her bodyguards leave the weapons to protect her in the afterlife?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Most important, why did this adored woman die at such a young age? The skeleton showed no sign of disease or injury. Some experts think she may have died while giving birth, but researchers are still uncertain.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">Tomb Be Continued</span>
        </p>
        <p>Whoever this woman was, it’s clear from her elaborate burial that she was a star among her people. And now the ancient heroine’s tomb is helping experts re-create her life and the world of the Moche people.</p>

          <strong>Mystery of the Tattooed Mummy</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Kristin Baird Rattini</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Deep inside an ancient pyramid in Peru, a mummy lay hidden in a gold-filled tomb. The underground chamber remained a secret for nearly 1,600 years, until an archaeologist noticed rectangular patches of soft clay in the pyramid's floor – a telltale sign of a grave. His heartbeat quickened. He suspected that someone powerful would be buried here.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The archaeologist was standing in a sacred location, a courtyard near the peak of the biggest pyramid at El Brujo – a ceremonial site of the ancient Moche (MO-chay) people. The civilization's rulers, who controlled the north coast of Peru from A.D. 100 to 800, probably reserved this spot for a king or a great warrior. What valuable treasures would lie inside this leader's tomb?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">The Mummy Unwrapped</span>
        </p>
        <p>Finally, after weeks of careful digging, the scientists peered through the ancient dust. In front of them lay one of the world's largest and best-preserved mummies. As they unwrapped the bundled layers, hundreds of treasures were revealed, including gold nose rings and necklaces, sparkling crowns, and huge war clubs usually reserved for the Moche's greatest warriors.</p>
        <p>But when archaeologists lifted a gold bowl covering the mummy's face, they found the biggest surprise yet. The mummy wasn't a king or a male warrior; it was a young Moche woman – and she was covered in mysterious tattoos!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">The Moche Way</span>
        </p>
        <p>Until now research had shown that only men ruled Moche society – a warrior culture in which prisoners were captured in battle and sacrificed in bloody rituals atop this very pyramid. Where did this 20-something woman fit in? Was she a queen? A high priestess? A warrior princess?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One thing's for sure: This Moche VIP would have received star treatment. When visiting her people, servants would have carried her high above the crowds on a litter, a special platform reserved for only the most elite figures. Says anthropologist John Verano: "Her gold objects would have shimmered&nbsp;so brightly you could have seen them from miles away."</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">Twenty Questions</span>
        </p>
        <p>Today this mystery woman is making headlines again. Her well-sealed tomb helped preserve hundreds of ancient artifacts – even her dresses and braided hair. "It's like going back in a time machine to A.D. 450 and seeing her just as she was," says Verano. But now the scientists have unearthed more questions than answers.<br>
What did the mummy's elaborate tattoos mean? With drawings of snakes, spiders, crabs, and imaginary animals crawling along her arms, legs, and feet, she has more body art than any known Moche mummy. No one knows for sure what these creatures mean, but the Moche may have believed the animals would bring healthy harvests.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And why was the mummy buried with 23 spear throwers? Even the most powerful male leaders were buried with only one or two. Did her bodyguards leave the weapons to protect her in the afterlife?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Most important, why did this adored woman die at such a young age? The skeleton showed no sign of disease or injury. Some experts think she may have died while giving birth, but researchers are still uncertain.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <span class="txt-underline">Tomb Be Continued</span>
        </p>
        <p>Whoever this woman was, it’s clear from her elaborate burial that she was a star among her people. And now the ancient heroine’s tomb is helping experts re-create her life and the world of the Moche people.</p>

        <p>Start with four cords (or two doubled cords). Use different colours like in the following directions to make it easier for you to follow.</p>
        <p>The two inside (yellow) cords are your "core" cords and will remain stationary as you make your knot.</p>
        <p>The outside cords (orange and brown) are your knotting cords.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Place the right hand (brown) cord over the two core (yellow) cords.<br>
Place it under the left hand (orange) cord.</p>

                  <img width="14%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyrnctlu4/image/upload/v1766046742/ve6dgd9nemmtqz5loiag.png" alt="NAP_Y5_D1_RC_Q07_2">


        </p>
        <p>Bring the left hand (orange) cord under the two core cords and up through the loop formed by the core cord and the brown cord.</p>
        <p>Tighten by pulling gently on the knotting cords.</p>
        <p>Repeating this knot over and over will create a spiral.</p>

        <p><strong>ELIZA CROSSING THE RIVER&nbsp;</strong><br><em>by Harriet Beecher Stowe</em><br><br>
From her resting-place by the trader chased,&nbsp;<br>
Through the winter evening cold,&nbsp;<br>
Eliza came with her boy at last,&nbsp;<br>
Where a broad deep river rolled.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Great blocks of the floating ice were there,&nbsp;<br>
And the water's roar was wild,&nbsp;<br>
But the cruel trader's step was near,&nbsp;<br>
Who would take her only child.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Poor Harry clung around her neck,&nbsp;<br>
But a word he could not say,&nbsp;<br>
For his very heart was faint with fear,&nbsp;<br>
And with flying all that day.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Her arms about the boy grew tight,&nbsp;<br>
With a loving clasp, and brave;&nbsp;<br>
"Hold fast! Hold fast, now, Harry dear,&nbsp;<br>
And it may be God will save."&nbsp;<br>
<br>
From the river's bank to the floating ice&nbsp;<br>
She took a sudden bound,&nbsp;<br>
And the great block swayed beneath her feet&nbsp;<br>
With a dull and heavy sound.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
So over the roaring rushing flood,&nbsp;<br>
From block to block she sprang,&nbsp;<br>
And ever her cry for God's good help&nbsp;<br>
Above the waters rang.&nbsp;<br>
And God did hear that mother's cry,&nbsp;<br>
For never an ice-block sank;&nbsp;<br>
While the cruel trader and his men&nbsp;<br>
Stood wondering on the bank.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
A good man saw on the further side,&nbsp;<br>
And gave her his helping hand;&nbsp;<br>
So poor Eliza, with her boy,&nbsp;<br>
Stood safe upon the land.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><br>
A blessing on that good man's arm,&nbsp;<br>
On his house, and field, and store;&nbsp;<br>
May he never want a friendly hand&nbsp;<br>
To help him to the shore!&nbsp;<br>
<br>
A blessing on all that make such haste,&nbsp;<br>
Whatever their hands can do!&nbsp;<br>
For they that succour the sore distressed,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Our Lord will help them too.</p>

        <p><strong>ELIZA CROSSING THE RIVER&nbsp;</strong><br><em>by Harriet Beecher Stowe</em><br><br>
From her resting-place by the trader chased,&nbsp;<br>
Through the winter evening cold,&nbsp;<br>
Eliza came with her boy at last,&nbsp;<br>
Where a broad deep river rolled.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Great blocks of the floating ice were there,&nbsp;<br>
And the water's roar was wild,&nbsp;<br>
But the cruel trader's step was near,&nbsp;<br>
Who would take her only child.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Poor Harry clung around her neck,&nbsp;<br>
But a word he could not say,&nbsp;<br>
For his very heart was faint with fear,&nbsp;<br>
And with flying all that day.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Her arms about the boy grew tight,&nbsp;<br>
With a loving clasp, and brave;&nbsp;<br>
"Hold fast! Hold fast, now, Harry dear,&nbsp;<br>
And it may be God will save."&nbsp;<br>
<br>
From the river's bank to the floating ice&nbsp;<br>
She took a sudden bound,&nbsp;<br>
And the great block swayed beneath her feet&nbsp;<br>
With a dull and heavy sound.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
So over the roaring rushing flood,&nbsp;<br>
From block to block she sprang,&nbsp;<br>
And ever her cry for God's good help&nbsp;<br>
Above the waters rang.&nbsp;<br>
And God did hear that mother's cry,&nbsp;<br>
For never an ice-block sank;&nbsp;<br>
While the cruel trader and his men&nbsp;<br>
Stood wondering on the bank.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
A good man saw on the further side,&nbsp;<br>
And gave her his helping hand;&nbsp;<br>
So poor Eliza, with her boy,&nbsp;<br>
Stood safe upon the land.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><br>
A blessing on that good man's arm,&nbsp;<br>
On his house, and field, and store;&nbsp;<br>
May he never want a friendly hand&nbsp;<br>
To help him to the shore!&nbsp;<br>
<br>
A blessing on all that make such haste,&nbsp;<br>
Whatever their hands can do!&nbsp;<br>
For they that succour the sore distressed,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Our Lord will help them too.</p>

          <strong>THE PRINCESS AND THE PIRATE</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>By Eoin Colfer</em>
        </p>
        <p><br>
Conor Broekhart was a remarkable boy, a fact that became evident very early in his idyllic childhood. Nature is usually grudging with her gifts, dispensing them sparingly, but she favoured Conor with everything she had to offer. It seemed as though all the talents of his ancestors had been bestowed upon him. Intelligence, strong features and grace.</p>
        <p><br>
Conor was fortunate in his situation too. He was born into an affluent community, where the values of equality and justice were actually being applied, on the surface at least. He grew up with a strong belief in right and wrong, which was not muddied by poverty or violence. It was straightforward for the young boy. Right was Great Saltee, wrong was Little Saltee.</p>
        <p><br>
It is an easy matter now, to pluck some events from Conor's early years and say, There it is. The boy who became the man. We should have seen it. But hindsight is an unreliable science and, in truth, there was perhaps a single incident during Conor's early days at the palace that hinted at his potential.</p>
        <p><br>
The incident in question occurred when Conor was nine years old and roaming the serving corridors that snaked behind the walls of the castle chapel and main building. His partner on these excursions was the Princess Isabella, one year his senior and always the more adventurous of the two.</p>
        <p><br>
Isabella and Conor were rarely seen without each other, and often so daubed with mud, blood and nothing good that the boy was barely distinguishable from the princess.<br>
On this particular summer afternoon, they had exhausted the fun to be had tracking an unused chimney to its source and had decided to launch a surprise pirate attack on the king's apartment.</p>
        <p><br>
'You can be Captain Crow,' said little Conor, licking some soot from round his mouth, `and I can be the cabin boy that stuck an axe in his head.'</p>
        <p><br>
Isabella was a pretty thing, with elfin face and round brown eyes, but at that moment she looked more like a sweep's urchin than a princess.</p>
        <p>`No, Conor. You are Captain Crow, and I am the princess hostage.'</p>
        <p>`There is no princess hostage,' declared Conor firmly, worried that Isabella was once again about to mould the legend to suit herself. In previous games, she had included a unicorn and a fairy that were definitely not part of the original story.</p>
        <p><br>
`Of course there is,' said Isabella belligerently. 'There is because I say there is, and I am an actual princess, whereas you were born in a balloon.'</p>
        <p><br>
Isabella intended this as an insult, but to Conor being born in a balloon was about the finest place to be born. `Thank you,' he said, grinning.</p>
        <p><br>
`That's not a good thing,' squealed Isabella. `Doctor John says that your lungs were probably crushed by the alti-too.'</p>
        <p>`My lungs're better than yours. See!' And Conor hooted at the sky to show just how healthy his lungs were.</p>
        <p><br>
`Very well,' said Isabella, impressed. `But I am still the princess hostage. And you should remember that I can have you executed if you displease me.'</p>
        <p><br>
Conor was not unduly concerned about Isabella having him executed as she ordered him hung at least a dozen times a day and it hadn't happened yet. He was more worried that Isabella was not turning out to be as good a playmate as he had hoped. Basically he wanted someone who would play the games he fancied playing, which generally involved flying paper gliders or eating insects. But lately Isabella had been veering towards dressing-up and kissing, and she would only explore chimneys if Conor agreed to pretend they were the legendary lovers Diarmuid and Grainne, escaping from Fionn's castle.</p>
        <p><br>
Needless to say, Conor had no wish to be a legendary lover. Legendary lovers rarely flew anywhere, and hardly ever ate insects.</p>
        <p><br>
`Very well,' he moaned. `You are the princess hostage.'</p>
        <p>`Excellent, Captain,' Isabella said sweetly. `Now, you may drag me to my father's chamber and demand ransom.'</p>
        <p>`Drag? said Conor hopefully.</p>
        <p><br>
`Play drag, not real drag, or I shall have you hung.' Conor thought, with remarkable wit&nbsp;</p>
        <p>for a nine-year-old, that if he had actually been hung every time Isabella ordered it, his neck would be longer than a Serengeti giraffe's.</p>
        <p>`Play drag, then. Can I kill anyone we meet?'</p>
        <p>'Absolutely anyone. Not Papa, though, until after I see how sad he is.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Absolutely anyone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That's something, thought Conor, swishing his wooden sword, thinking how it cut the air like a gull's wing. Just like a wing.</p>

          <strong>THE PRINCESS AND THE PIRATE</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>By Eoin Colfer</em>
        </p>
        <p><br>
Conor Broekhart was a remarkable boy, a fact that became evident very early in his idyllic childhood. Nature is usually grudging with her gifts, dispensing them sparingly, but she favoured Conor with everything she had to offer. It seemed as though all the talents of his ancestors had been bestowed upon him. Intelligence, strong features and grace.</p>
        <p><br>
Conor was fortunate in his situation too. He was born into an affluent community, where the values of equality and justice were actually being applied, on the surface at least. He grew up with a strong belief in right and wrong, which was not muddied by poverty or violence. It was straightforward for the young boy. Right was Great Saltee, wrong was Little Saltee.</p>
        <p><br>
It is an easy matter now, to pluck some events from Conor's early years and say, There it is. The boy who became the man. We should have seen it. But hindsight is an unreliable science and, in truth, there was perhaps a single incident during Conor's early days at the palace that hinted at his potential.</p>
        <p><br>
The incident in question occurred when Conor was nine years old and roaming the serving corridors that snaked behind the walls of the castle chapel and main building. His partner on these excursions was the Princess Isabella, one year his senior and always the more adventurous of the two.</p>
        <p><br>
Isabella and Conor were rarely seen without each other, and often so daubed with mud, blood and nothing good that the boy was barely distinguishable from the princess.<br>
On this particular summer afternoon, they had exhausted the fun to be had tracking an unused chimney to its source and had decided to launch a surprise pirate attack on the king's apartment.</p>
        <p><br>
'You can be Captain Crow,' said little Conor, licking some soot from round his mouth, `and I can be the cabin boy that stuck an axe in his head.'</p>
        <p><br>
Isabella was a pretty thing, with elfin face and round brown eyes, but at that moment she looked more like a sweep's urchin than a princess.</p>
        <p>`No, Conor. You are Captain Crow, and I am the princess hostage.'</p>
        <p>`There is no princess hostage,' declared Conor firmly, worried that Isabella was once again about to mould the legend to suit herself. In previous games, she had included a unicorn and a fairy that were definitely not part of the original story.</p>
        <p><br>
`Of course there is,' said Isabella belligerently. 'There is because I say there is, and I am an actual princess, whereas you were born in a balloon.'</p>
        <p><br>
Isabella intended this as an insult, but to Conor being born in a balloon was about the finest place to be born. `Thank you,' he said, grinning.</p>
        <p><br>
`That's not a good thing,' squealed Isabella. `Doctor John says that your lungs were probably crushed by the alti-too.'</p>
        <p>`My lungs're better than yours. See!' And Conor hooted at the sky to show just how healthy his lungs were.</p>
        <p><br>
`Very well,' said Isabella, impressed. `But I am still the princess hostage. And you should remember that I can have you executed if you displease me.'</p>
        <p><br>
Conor was not unduly concerned about Isabella having him executed as she ordered him hung at least a dozen times a day and it hadn't happened yet. He was more worried that Isabella was not turning out to be as good a playmate as he had hoped. Basically he wanted someone who would play the games he fancied playing, which generally involved flying paper gliders or eating insects. But lately Isabella had been veering towards dressing-up and kissing, and she would only explore chimneys if Conor agreed to pretend they were the legendary lovers Diarmuid and Grainne, escaping from Fionn's castle.</p>
        <p><br>
Needless to say, Conor had no wish to be a legendary lover. Legendary lovers rarely flew anywhere, and hardly ever ate insects.</p>
        <p><br>
`Very well,' he moaned. `You are the princess hostage.'</p>
        <p>`Excellent, Captain,' Isabella said sweetly. `Now, you may drag me to my father's chamber and demand ransom.'</p>
        <p>`Drag? said Conor hopefully.</p>
        <p><br>
`Play drag, not real drag, or I shall have you hung.' Conor thought, with remarkable wit&nbsp;</p>
        <p>for a nine-year-old, that if he had actually been hung every time Isabella ordered it, his neck would be longer than a Serengeti giraffe's.</p>
        <p>`Play drag, then. Can I kill anyone we meet?'</p>
        <p>'Absolutely anyone. Not Papa, though, until after I see how sad he is.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Absolutely anyone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That's something, thought Conor, swishing his wooden sword, thinking how it cut the air like a gull's wing. Just like a wing.</p>

          <strong>THE PRINCESS AND THE PIRATE</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>By Eoin Colfer</em>
        </p>
        <p><br>
Conor Broekhart was a remarkable boy, a fact that became evident very early in his idyllic childhood. Nature is usually grudging with her gifts, dispensing them sparingly, but she favoured Conor with everything she had to offer. It seemed as though all the talents of his ancestors had been bestowed upon him. Intelligence, strong features and grace.</p>
        <p><br>
Conor was fortunate in his situation too. He was born into an affluent community, where the values of equality and justice were actually being applied, on the surface at least. He grew up with a strong belief in right and wrong, which was not muddied by poverty or violence. It was straightforward for the young boy. Right was Great Saltee, wrong was Little Saltee.</p>
        <p><br>
It is an easy matter now, to pluck some events from Conor's early years and say, There it is. The boy who became the man. We should have seen it. But hindsight is an unreliable science and, in truth, there was perhaps a single incident during Conor's early days at the palace that hinted at his potential.</p>
        <p><br>
The incident in question occurred when Conor was nine years old and roaming the serving corridors that snaked behind the walls of the castle chapel and main building. His partner on these excursions was the Princess Isabella, one year his senior and always the more adventurous of the two.</p>
        <p><br>
Isabella and Conor were rarely seen without each other, and often so daubed with mud, blood and nothing good that the boy was barely distinguishable from the princess.<br>
On this particular summer afternoon, they had exhausted the fun to be had tracking an unused chimney to its source and had decided to launch a surprise pirate attack on the king's apartment.</p>
        <p><br>
'You can be Captain Crow,' said little Conor, licking some soot from round his mouth, `and I can be the cabin boy that stuck an axe in his head.'</p>
        <p><br>
Isabella was a pretty thing, with elfin face and round brown eyes, but at that moment she looked more like a sweep's urchin than a princess.</p>
        <p>`No, Conor. You are Captain Crow, and I am the princess hostage.'</p>
        <p>`There is no princess hostage,' declared Conor firmly, worried that Isabella was once again about to mould the legend to suit herself. In previous games, she had included a unicorn and a fairy that were definitely not part of the original story.</p>
        <p><br>
`Of course there is,' said Isabella belligerently. 'There is because I say there is, and I am an actual princess, whereas you were born in a balloon.'</p>
        <p><br>
Isabella intended this as an insult, but to Conor being born in a balloon was about the finest place to be born. `Thank you,' he said, grinning.</p>
        <p><br>
`That's not a good thing,' squealed Isabella. `Doctor John says that your lungs were probably crushed by the alti-too.'</p>
        <p>`My lungs're better than yours. See!' And Conor hooted at the sky to show just how healthy his lungs were.</p>
        <p><br>
`Very well,' said Isabella, impressed. `But I am still the princess hostage. And you should remember that I can have you executed if you displease me.'</p>
        <p><br>
Conor was not unduly concerned about Isabella having him executed as she ordered him hung at least a dozen times a day and it hadn't happened yet. He was more worried that Isabella was not turning out to be as good a playmate as he had hoped. Basically he wanted someone who would play the games he fancied playing, which generally involved flying paper gliders or eating insects. But lately Isabella had been veering towards dressing-up and kissing, and she would only explore chimneys if Conor agreed to pretend they were the legendary lovers Diarmuid and Grainne, escaping from Fionn's castle.</p>
        <p><br>
Needless to say, Conor had no wish to be a legendary lover. Legendary lovers rarely flew anywhere, and hardly ever ate insects.</p>
        <p><br>
`Very well,' he moaned. `You are the princess hostage.'</p>
        <p>`Excellent, Captain,' Isabella said sweetly. `Now, you may drag me to my father's chamber and demand ransom.'</p>
        <p>`Drag? said Conor hopefully.</p>
        <p><br>
`Play drag, not real drag, or I shall have you hung.' Conor thought, with remarkable wit&nbsp;</p>
        <p>for a nine-year-old, that if he had actually been hung every time Isabella ordered it, his neck would be longer than a Serengeti giraffe's.</p>
        <p>`Play drag, then. Can I kill anyone we meet?'</p>
        <p>'Absolutely anyone. Not Papa, though, until after I see how sad he is.'</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Absolutely anyone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That's something, thought Conor, swishing his wooden sword, thinking how it cut the air like a gull's wing. Just like a wing.</p>
