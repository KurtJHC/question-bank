        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Native Americans were great inventors. For example, corn was cultivated by ancient farmers 10,000 years ago. Native Americans then taught European colonists to grow the crop. Everybody knows corn, but they don’t know it’s a food that wouldn’t exist without human intervention. Farmers in southern Mexico selectively bred a wild grass, for many generations to enlarge the ear and develop kernels that were soft enough for humans to eat. Later, their invention spread throughout the Western Hemisphere.<br>
<br>
Native American inventions were appropriated by Europeans with their trading networks and manufacturing infrastructure, who sometimes added improvements. For example, rubber was developed by Native Americans, and then Columbus took a rubber ball back to Europe. After Charles Goodyear developed the vulcanisation process in the 1830s to allow rubber to withstand heat and cold, colonisers developed vast rubber tree plantations in Asia to produce the raw material for factories. Now, rubber is used all over the world.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The Inuit in the Arctic developed the concept of a small, narrow boat, with a sealed cockpit to protect the paddler from sinking in the event that the craft capsized. The classic vessels were fashioned entirely from natural materials, with wood or whalebone frames covered by stitched sealskin or other animal hides. Today, the kayaks in use across the world are sometimes built from modern materials such as plastic and carbon fibre, but the design is still essentially the same.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Forty million years ago, horses first emerged in North America, but after migrating to Asia, horses disappeared from this continent at least 10,000 years ago. So, for millennia, Native Americans travelled and hunted on foot, relying on dogs as miniature pack animals.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
When Christopher Columbus brought two dozen horses on his second voyage to the New World in 1493, he couldn’t have imagined how reintroducing the horse to North America would transform Native American life, especially for the buffalo-hunting Plains Indians, for whom the swift and loyal horse was a marriage made in heaven.<br>
<br>
When Columbus and other Spanish explorers arrived in Hispaniola on horseback, the native Taíno of the Caribbean were terrified by what they saw as a half-man, half-beast. They had never seen a creature that had human beings riding on it. As more Native tribes encountered the horse, that initial fear gave way to awe for the animal’s speed and power. With the dog as their closest reference, Indians gave this mythical new creature names like “elk dog”, “sky dog” and “holy dog”. The Spanish quickly realised that the last thing they wanted was for Indians to have horses, because that would put them on equal footing, but that’s exactly what happened.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
In the early 1800s, the sovereign Cherokee nation covered a vast region that included northwest Georgia and adjacent land in Tennessee, North Carolina and Alabama. Under the terms of an 1819 treaty, the United States guaranteed that Cherokee land would be off-limits to white settlers forever. Forever lasted less than 20 years. Although the treaty mandated the removal of “all white people who have intruded, or may hereafter intrude, on the lands of the Cherokees,” the United States instead forcibly removed more than 15,000 Cherokees in 1838 and 1839.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
As many as 4,000 died of disease, starvation and exposure during their detention and forced migration through nine states that became known as the “Trail of Tears”. The last of the Cherokee completed the Trail of Tears in March 1839. Decades later, a Confederate soldier who participated in the forced migration recalled, “I fought through the Civil War and saw men shot to pieces and slaughtered by the thousands, but the Cherokee removal was the cruelest work I ever knew.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Before European contact, the temperate, hospitable California area had more people (+/- 300,000 in 1600’s) than any other. It was also more diverse. Its estimated 100 different tribes and groups spoke more spoke over 200 dialects. In fact, California’s language landscape was more complex than that of Europe.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Despite this great diversity, most native Californians lived very similar lives. They did not practise much agriculture. Instead, they organised themselves into small, family-based bands of hunter-gatherers known as tribelets. Inter-tribelet relationships, based on wellestablished systems of trade and common rights, were generally peaceful.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But although gold spelled prosperity and power for the white settlers who arrived in California in 1849 and after, it meant disaster for the state’s peaceful indigenous population. An estimated 100,000 Native Americans died during the first two years of the Gold Rush alone. Today, despite all odds, California has the United States’ largest Native American population and is home to 109 federally recognised tribes.&nbsp;<br>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So, when it came to buying a car, they were all determined that it shouldn't be just any car, but something a bit different from everyone else's - not one of those black-beetle saloon cars that look much the same back and front so that, in the distance, you don't know if they're coming or going - but something rather special, something rather adventurous.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Well, they hunted all that afternoon and all the next day. They looked at brand-new cars and they visited the second-hand showrooms, where smart salesmen offered Commander and Mrs Pott cigarettes and Jeremy and Jemima sweets just to try and tempt them to buy. But Commander Pott knew pretty well all there is to know about cars, having been an engineer officer in the Navy and being an inventor as well, and one look under the bonnet and one trial, listening carefully to the sound of the engine, was generally enough for him—even if he didn't notice that the speedometer had been disconnected or that the chassis was bent because of some crash whose scratches and dents the salesman had carefully painted over.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And then at the end of the second day, they came to a broken-down little garage run by a once famous racing-driver. It was really only a big tin shed with a couple of grimy petrol pumps outside, and inside, the concrete floor was slippery with oil and everywhere there were bits and pieces of old cars that the garage man had been tinkering with, really, as far as one could see, just for the fun of it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But he was the sort of enthusiast Commander Pott always had a warm corner in his heart for. The two of them went on talking for a long time while Mimsie and Jeremy and Jemima grew more and more impatient.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Suddenly, they were surprised to see Commander Pott follow the garage man round to the back of his shed, where there was a long, low object hidden under a tarpaulin. The garage man looked Commander Pott and the family, each one, carefully up and down, and then he went to one end of the tarpaulin and slowly rolled it back.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Well, I can't tell you how disappointed Mimsie and the children were. From the way the garage man had behaved, they thought there must be some splendid treasure of a car under the tarpaulin. But what did they see? A wreck—that's all. Just the remains, rusty and broken and bent, of a very long, low, four-seater, open motor-car without a hood and with the green paint peeling off in strips.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Well, there she is," said the garage man sadly. "She once knew every racing-track in Europe. In the old days, there wasn't a famous driver in Britain who hadn't driven her at one time or another. She's still wearing England's racing green as you can see—that was from early in the 'thirties. She's a twelve-cylinder, eight-litre, supercharged Paragon&nbsp;Panther. They only made one of them and then the firm went broke. This is the only one in the world. Doesn't look much, does she? I'm afraid she's due for the scrap-heap. Can't afford to go on giving her living space. They're coming to tow her away next week, as a matter of fact—take her to the dump, pick her up in a big grab and drop her between one of those giant hydraulic presses. One crunch and it just squashes them into a sort of square metal biscuit. Then, she'll go to a smelting works to be melted down just for the raw metal. Seems a shame, doesn't it? You can almost see from her eyes—those big Marchal racing headlights—that she knows what's in store for her. But there it is. You can see the shape she's in and it would need hundreds of pounds to get her on the road again—even supposing there was someone nowadays who could afford to run her."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Commander Pott was looking curiously excited. "Mind if I look her over?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Go ahead." The garage man shook his head sadly. "She'd appreciate a last look-over by someone like you who knows what real quality used to be."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The whole family picked their way over and through the patches of oily ground. While Commander Pott looked under the bonnet, Mimsie and Jeremy and Jemima prodded the once-beautiful soft leather upholstery (moths flew out!) and looked under the carpets, front and back (beetles scuttled about!), and examined the knobs and switches and dials on the dashboard (there were dozens of them, all rusty and mildewed) and tried the big old boaconstrictor horn that worked with an India-rubber bulb. But nothing happened except that a lot of dust blew out of the end into Commander Pott's face as he bent over the engine, peering and tinkering. The children looked at Mimsie and Mimsie looked back at them, and do you know what? They didn't just dolefully shake their heads at each other. They all had the same look in their eyes. The look said, "This must once have been the most beautiful car in the world. If the engine's more or less all right and if we all set to and scrub and paint and mend and polish, do you suppose we could put her back as she used to be? It wouldn't be like having just one of those black beetles that the factories turn out in hundreds and thousands and that all look alike. We'd have a real jewel of a car, something to love and cherish and look after as if it was one of the family!"&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Ian Fleming&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So, when it came to buying a car, they were all determined that it shouldn't be just any car, but something a bit different from everyone else's - not one of those black-beetle saloon cars that look much the same back and front so that, in the distance, you don't know if they're coming or going - but something rather special, something rather adventurous.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Well, they hunted all that afternoon and all the next day. They looked at brand-new cars and they visited the second-hand showrooms, where smart salesmen offered Commander and Mrs Pott cigarettes and Jeremy and Jemima sweets just to try and tempt them to buy. But Commander Pott knew pretty well all there is to know about cars, having been an engineer officer in the Navy and being an inventor as well, and one look under the bonnet and one trial, listening carefully to the sound of the engine, was generally enough for him—even if he didn't notice that the speedometer had been disconnected or that the chassis was bent because of some crash whose scratches and dents the salesman had carefully painted over.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And then at the end of the second day, they came to a broken-down little garage run by a once famous racing-driver. It was really only a big tin shed with a couple of grimy petrol pumps outside, and inside, the concrete floor was slippery with oil and everywhere there were bits and pieces of old cars that the garage man had been tinkering with, really, as far as one could see, just for the fun of it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But he was the sort of enthusiast Commander Pott always had a warm corner in his heart for. The two of them went on talking for a long time while Mimsie and Jeremy and Jemima grew more and more impatient.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Suddenly, they were surprised to see Commander Pott follow the garage man round to the back of his shed, where there was a long, low object hidden under a tarpaulin. The garage man looked Commander Pott and the family, each one, carefully up and down, and then he went to one end of the tarpaulin and slowly rolled it back.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Well, I can't tell you how disappointed Mimsie and the children were. From the way the garage man had behaved, they thought there must be some splendid treasure of a car under the tarpaulin. But what did they see? A wreck—that's all. Just the remains, rusty and broken and bent, of a very long, low, four-seater, open motor-car without a hood and with the green paint peeling off in strips.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Well, there she is," said the garage man sadly. "She once knew every racing-track in Europe. In the old days, there wasn't a famous driver in Britain who hadn't driven her at one time or another. She's still wearing England's racing green as you can see—that was from early in the 'thirties. She's a twelve-cylinder, eight-litre, supercharged Paragon&nbsp;Panther. They only made one of them and then the firm went broke. This is the only one in the world. Doesn't look much, does she? I'm afraid she's due for the scrap-heap. Can't afford to go on giving her living space. They're coming to tow her away next week, as a matter of fact—take her to the dump, pick her up in a big grab and drop her between one of those giant hydraulic presses. One crunch and it just squashes them into a sort of square metal biscuit. Then, she'll go to a smelting works to be melted down just for the raw metal. Seems a shame, doesn't it? You can almost see from her eyes—those big Marchal racing headlights—that she knows what's in store for her. But there it is. You can see the shape she's in and it would need hundreds of pounds to get her on the road again—even supposing there was someone nowadays who could afford to run her."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Commander Pott was looking curiously excited. "Mind if I look her over?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Go ahead." The garage man shook his head sadly. "She'd appreciate a last look-over by someone like you who knows what real quality used to be."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The whole family picked their way over and through the patches of oily ground. While Commander Pott looked under the bonnet, Mimsie and Jeremy and Jemima prodded the once-beautiful soft leather upholstery (moths flew out!) and looked under the carpets, front and back (beetles scuttled about!), and examined the knobs and switches and dials on the dashboard (there were dozens of them, all rusty and mildewed) and tried the big old boaconstrictor horn that worked with an India-rubber bulb. But nothing happened except that a lot of dust blew out of the end into Commander Pott's face as he bent over the engine, peering and tinkering. The children looked at Mimsie and Mimsie looked back at them, and do you know what? They didn't just dolefully shake their heads at each other. They all had the same look in their eyes. The look said, "This must once have been the most beautiful car in the world. If the engine's more or less all right and if we all set to and scrub and paint and mend and polish, do you suppose we could put her back as she used to be? It wouldn't be like having just one of those black beetles that the factories turn out in hundreds and thousands and that all look alike. We'd have a real jewel of a car, something to love and cherish and look after as if it was one of the family!"&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Ian Fleming&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So, when it came to buying a car, they were all determined that it shouldn't be just any car, but something a bit different from everyone else's - not one of those black-beetle saloon cars that look much the same back and front so that, in the distance, you don't know if they're coming or going - but something rather special, something rather adventurous.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Well, they hunted all that afternoon and all the next day. They looked at brand-new cars and they visited the second-hand showrooms, where smart salesmen offered Commander and Mrs Pott cigarettes and Jeremy and Jemima sweets just to try and tempt them to buy. But Commander Pott knew pretty well all there is to know about cars, having been an engineer officer in the Navy and being an inventor as well, and one look under the bonnet and one trial, listening carefully to the sound of the engine, was generally enough for him—even if he didn't notice that the speedometer had been disconnected or that the chassis was bent because of some crash whose scratches and dents the salesman had carefully painted over.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And then at the end of the second day, they came to a broken-down little garage run by a once famous racing-driver. It was really only a big tin shed with a couple of grimy petrol pumps outside, and inside, the concrete floor was slippery with oil and everywhere there were bits and pieces of old cars that the garage man had been tinkering with, really, as far as one could see, just for the fun of it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But he was the sort of enthusiast Commander Pott always had a warm corner in his heart for. The two of them went on talking for a long time while Mimsie and Jeremy and Jemima grew more and more impatient.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Suddenly, they were surprised to see Commander Pott follow the garage man round to the back of his shed, where there was a long, low object hidden under a tarpaulin. The garage man looked Commander Pott and the family, each one, carefully up and down, and then he went to one end of the tarpaulin and slowly rolled it back.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Well, I can't tell you how disappointed Mimsie and the children were. From the way the garage man had behaved, they thought there must be some splendid treasure of a car under the tarpaulin. But what did they see? A wreck—that's all. Just the remains, rusty and broken and bent, of a very long, low, four-seater, open motor-car without a hood and with the green paint peeling off in strips.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Well, there she is," said the garage man sadly. "She once knew every racing-track in Europe. In the old days, there wasn't a famous driver in Britain who hadn't driven her at one time or another. She's still wearing England's racing green as you can see—that was from early in the 'thirties. She's a twelve-cylinder, eight-litre, supercharged Paragon&nbsp;Panther. They only made one of them and then the firm went broke. This is the only one in the world. Doesn't look much, does she? I'm afraid she's due for the scrap-heap. Can't afford to go on giving her living space. They're coming to tow her away next week, as a matter of fact—take her to the dump, pick her up in a big grab and drop her between one of those giant hydraulic presses. One crunch and it just squashes them into a sort of square metal biscuit. Then, she'll go to a smelting works to be melted down just for the raw metal. Seems a shame, doesn't it? You can almost see from her eyes—those big Marchal racing headlights—that she knows what's in store for her. But there it is. You can see the shape she's in and it would need hundreds of pounds to get her on the road again—even supposing there was someone nowadays who could afford to run her."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Commander Pott was looking curiously excited. "Mind if I look her over?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Go ahead." The garage man shook his head sadly. "She'd appreciate a last look-over by someone like you who knows what real quality used to be."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The whole family picked their way over and through the patches of oily ground. While Commander Pott looked under the bonnet, Mimsie and Jeremy and Jemima prodded the once-beautiful soft leather upholstery (moths flew out!) and looked under the carpets, front and back (beetles scuttled about!), and examined the knobs and switches and dials on the dashboard (there were dozens of them, all rusty and mildewed) and tried the big old boaconstrictor horn that worked with an India-rubber bulb. But nothing happened except that a lot of dust blew out of the end into Commander Pott's face as he bent over the engine, peering and tinkering. The children looked at Mimsie and Mimsie looked back at them, and do you know what? They didn't just dolefully shake their heads at each other. They all had the same look in their eyes. The look said, "This must once have been the most beautiful car in the world. If the engine's more or less all right and if we all set to and scrub and paint and mend and polish, do you suppose we could put her back as she used to be? It wouldn't be like having just one of those black beetles that the factories turn out in hundreds and thousands and that all look alike. We'd have a real jewel of a car, something to love and cherish and look after as if it was one of the family!"&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>by Ian Fleming&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>So, when it came to buying a car, they were all determined that it shouldn't be just any car, but something a bit different from everyone else's - not one of those black-beetle saloon cars that look much the same back and front so that, in the distance, you don't know if they're coming or going - but something rather special, something rather adventurous.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Well, they hunted all that afternoon and all the next day. They looked at brand-new cars and they visited the second-hand showrooms, where smart salesmen offered Commander and Mrs Pott cigarettes and Jeremy and Jemima sweets just to try and tempt them to buy. But Commander Pott knew pretty well all there is to know about cars, having been an engineer officer in the Navy and being an inventor as well, and one look under the bonnet and one trial, listening carefully to the sound of the engine, was generally enough for him—even if he didn't notice that the speedometer had been disconnected or that the chassis was bent because of some crash whose scratches and dents the salesman had carefully painted over.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And then at the end of the second day, they came to a broken-down little garage run by a once famous racing-driver. It was really only a big tin shed with a couple of grimy petrol pumps outside, and inside, the concrete floor was slippery with oil and everywhere there were bits and pieces of old cars that the garage man had been tinkering with, really, as far as one could see, just for the fun of it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But he was the sort of enthusiast Commander Pott always had a warm corner in his heart for. The two of them went on talking for a long time while Mimsie and Jeremy and Jemima grew more and more impatient.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Suddenly, they were surprised to see Commander Pott follow the garage man round to the back of his shed, where there was a long, low object hidden under a tarpaulin. The garage man looked Commander Pott and the family, each one, carefully up and down, and then he went to one end of the tarpaulin and slowly rolled it back.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Well, I can't tell you how disappointed Mimsie and the children were. From the way the garage man had behaved, they thought there must be some splendid treasure of a car under the tarpaulin. But what did they see? A wreck—that's all. Just the remains, rusty and broken and bent, of a very long, low, four-seater, open motor-car without a hood and with the green paint peeling off in strips.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Well, there she is," said the garage man sadly. "She once knew every racing-track in Europe. In the old days, there wasn't a famous driver in Britain who hadn't driven her at one time or another. She's still wearing England's racing green as you can see—that was from early in the 'thirties. She's a twelve-cylinder, eight-litre, supercharged Paragon&nbsp;Panther. They only made one of them and then the firm went broke. This is the only one in the world. Doesn't look much, does she? I'm afraid she's due for the scrap-heap. Can't afford to go on giving her living space. They're coming to tow her away next week, as a matter of fact—take her to the dump, pick her up in a big grab and drop her between one of those giant hydraulic presses. One crunch and it just squashes them into a sort of square metal biscuit. Then, she'll go to a smelting works to be melted down just for the raw metal. Seems a shame, doesn't it? You can almost see from her eyes—those big Marchal racing headlights—that she knows what's in store for her. But there it is. You can see the shape she's in and it would need hundreds of pounds to get her on the road again—even supposing there was someone nowadays who could afford to run her."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Commander Pott was looking curiously excited. "Mind if I look her over?"&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>"Go ahead." The garage man shook his head sadly. "She'd appreciate a last look-over by someone like you who knows what real quality used to be."&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The whole family picked their way over and through the patches of oily ground. While Commander Pott looked under the bonnet, Mimsie and Jeremy and Jemima prodded the once-beautiful soft leather upholstery (moths flew out!) and looked under the carpets, front and back (beetles scuttled about!), and examined the knobs and switches and dials on the dashboard (there were dozens of them, all rusty and mildewed) and tried the big old boaconstrictor horn that worked with an India-rubber bulb. But nothing happened except that a lot of dust blew out of the end into Commander Pott's face as he bent over the engine, peering and tinkering. The children looked at Mimsie and Mimsie looked back at them, and do you know what? They didn't just dolefully shake their heads at each other. They all had the same look in their eyes. The look said, "This must once have been the most beautiful car in the world. If the engine's more or less all right and if we all set to and scrub and paint and mend and polish, do you suppose we could put her back as she used to be? It wouldn't be like having just one of those black beetles that the factories turn out in hundreds and thousands and that all look alike. We'd have a real jewel of a car, something to love and cherish and look after as if it was one of the family!"&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Where the Pelican Builds&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em>[The unexplored parts of Australia are sometimes spoken of by the bushmen of Western Queensland as the home of the pelican, a bird whose nesting place, so far as the writer knows, is seldom, if ever found.]&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The horses were ready, the rails were down,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But the riders lingered still,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>One had a parting word to say,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And one had his pipe to fill.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Then they mounted, one with a granted prayer,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And one with a grief unguessed.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“We are going” they said, as they rode away,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“Where the pelican builds her nest!”&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They had told us of pastures wide and green,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To be sought past the sunset's glow;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Of rifts* in the ranges by opal lit,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And gold 'neath the river's flow.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And thirst and hunger were banished words&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When they spoke of that unknown West;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>No drought they dreaded, no flood they feared,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Where the pelican builds her nest!&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The creek at the ford** was but fetlock*** deep&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When we watched them crossing there;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The rains have replenished it thrice since then&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And thrice has the rock lain bare.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But the waters of Hope have flowed and fled,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And never from blue hill's breast&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Come back - by the sun and the sands devoured,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Where the pelican builds her nest!&nbsp;</p>

        </p>
        <p>Taj Mahal, the magnificent monument that stands at the heart of India, has a story that has been melting the hearts of millions of listeners since the time Taj Mahal has been visible. It is a story, that although ending back in 1631, continues to live on in the concrete form of Taj Mahal and is considered a living example of eternal love. <strong>15 ………. </strong>These two people from the course of history have set an example for the people living in the present and the future. As the poet, Edwin Arnold describes it, "Not a piece of architecture, as other buildings are, but the proud passion of an emperor's love wrought in living stones." The story that follows next will prove why that statement is true.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Shah Jahan, initially named Prince Khurram, was born in the year 1592. He was the son of Jehangir, the fourth Mughal emperor of India and the grandson of Akbar the Great. In 1607, Shah Jahan strolled down the Meena Bazaar, accompanied by a string of fawning courtiers. <strong>16 ……….</strong> It was love at first sight and the girl was Mumtaz Mahal, who was known as Arjumand Banu Begum at that time. At that time, he was 14 years old and she, a Muslim Persian princess, was 15. After meeting her, Shah Jahan went back to his father and declared that he wanted to marry her. The match was solemnised five years later i.e., in the year 1612.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was in the year 1628 that Shah Jahan became the Emperor and he entrusted Arjumand Banu with the royal seal. <strong>17 ………. </strong>Though Shah Jahan also had other wives, Mumtaz Mahal was his favourite and accompanied him everywhere, even on military campaigns. In the year 1631, when Mumtaz Mahal was giving birth to their 14th child, she died due to some complications. While Mumtaz was on her deathbed, Shah Jahan promised her that he would never remarry and would build the richest mausoleum over her grave.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It is said that Shah Jahan was so heartbroken after her death that he ordered the court into mourning for two years. Sometime after her death, Shah Jahan undertook the task of creating the world's most beautiful monument in the memory of his beloved. It took 22 years and the labour of 22,000 workers to construct the monument. <strong>18 ………. </strong>This magnificent monument came to be known as "Taj Mahal" and now counts amongst the Seven Wonders of the World. It is the true story of the Taj Mahal of India which has mesmerised many people with its bewitching beauty</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Shah Jahan was wealthy enough to support the Taj Mahal and its mighty maintenance costs. However, over the centuries, the Mughal Empire lost its riches and the Taj Mahal fell into ruins. By the 1800s, the British ousted the Mughals and took over India. The Taj Mahal was dissected for its beauty—the British cut gemstones from its walls, stole silver candlesticks and doors, and even tried to sell the white marble overseas. <strong>19 ……….</strong> Rather than looting the Taj Mahal, Curzon worked to restore it.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Taj Mahal has once again become a magnificent place with 2.5 million visitors each year. <strong>20 ………. </strong>Once a month, visitors also have the opportunity to make a short visit during a full moon to see how the Taj Mahal seems to glow from the inside out in the moonlight. The Taj Mahal was placed on the World Heritage List by UNESCO in 1983, but this protection has not guaranteed its safety. It is now at the mercy of pollutants from nearby factories and excessive humidity from the breath of its visitors.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Taj Mahal, the magnificent monument that stands at the heart of India, has a story that has been melting the hearts of millions of listeners since the time Taj Mahal has been visible. It is a story, that although ending back in 1631, continues to live on in the concrete form of Taj Mahal and is considered a living example of eternal love. <strong>15 ………. </strong>These two people from the course of history have set an example for the people living in the present and the future. As the poet, Edwin Arnold describes it, "Not a piece of architecture, as other buildings are, but the proud passion of an emperor's love wrought in living stones." The story that follows next will prove why that statement is true.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Shah Jahan, initially named Prince Khurram, was born in the year 1592. He was the son of Jehangir, the fourth Mughal emperor of India and the grandson of Akbar the Great. In 1607, Shah Jahan strolled down the Meena Bazaar, accompanied by a string of fawning courtiers. <strong>16 ……….</strong> It was love at first sight and the girl was Mumtaz Mahal, who was known as Arjumand Banu Begum at that time. At that time, he was 14 years old and she, a Muslim Persian princess, was 15. After meeting her, Shah Jahan went back to his father and declared that he wanted to marry her. The match was solemnised five years later i.e., in the year 1612.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was in the year 1628 that Shah Jahan became the Emperor and he entrusted Arjumand Banu with the royal seal. <strong>17 ………. </strong>Though Shah Jahan also had other wives, Mumtaz Mahal was his favourite and accompanied him everywhere, even on military campaigns. In the year 1631, when Mumtaz Mahal was giving birth to their 14th child, she died due to some complications. While Mumtaz was on her deathbed, Shah Jahan promised her that he would never remarry and would build the richest mausoleum over her grave.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It is said that Shah Jahan was so heartbroken after her death that he ordered the court into mourning for two years. Sometime after her death, Shah Jahan undertook the task of creating the world's most beautiful monument in the memory of his beloved. It took 22 years and the labour of 22,000 workers to construct the monument. <strong>18 ………. </strong>This magnificent monument came to be known as "Taj Mahal" and now counts amongst the Seven Wonders of the World. It is the true story of the Taj Mahal of India which has mesmerised many people with its bewitching beauty</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Shah Jahan was wealthy enough to support the Taj Mahal and its mighty maintenance costs. However, over the centuries, the Mughal Empire lost its riches and the Taj Mahal fell into ruins. By the 1800s, the British ousted the Mughals and took over India. The Taj Mahal was dissected for its beauty—the British cut gemstones from its walls, stole silver candlesticks and doors, and even tried to sell the white marble overseas. <strong>19 ……….</strong> Rather than looting the Taj Mahal, Curzon worked to restore it.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Taj Mahal has once again become a magnificent place with 2.5 million visitors each year. <strong>20 ………. </strong>Once a month, visitors also have the opportunity to make a short visit during a full moon to see how the Taj Mahal seems to glow from the inside out in the moonlight. The Taj Mahal was placed on the World Heritage List by UNESCO in 1983, but this protection has not guaranteed its safety. It is now at the mercy of pollutants from nearby factories and excessive humidity from the breath of its visitors.</p>

        <p>Taj Mahal, the magnificent monument that stands at the heart of India, has a story that has been melting the hearts of millions of listeners since the time Taj Mahal has been visible. It is a story, that although ending back in 1631, continues to live on in the concrete form of Taj Mahal and is considered a living example of eternal love. <strong>15 ………. </strong>These two people from the course of history have set an example for the people living in the present and the future. As the poet, Edwin Arnold describes it, "Not a piece of architecture, as other buildings are, but the proud passion of an emperor's love wrought in living stones." The story that follows next will prove why that statement is true.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Shah Jahan, initially named Prince Khurram, was born in the year 1592. He was the son of Jehangir, the fourth Mughal emperor of India and the grandson of Akbar the Great. In 1607, Shah Jahan strolled down the Meena Bazaar, accompanied by a string of fawning courtiers. <strong>16 ……….</strong> It was love at first sight and the girl was Mumtaz Mahal, who was known as Arjumand Banu Begum at that time. At that time, he was 14 years old and she, a Muslim Persian princess, was 15. After meeting her, Shah Jahan went back to his father and declared that he wanted to marry her. The match was solemnised five years later i.e., in the year 1612.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was in the year 1628 that Shah Jahan became the Emperor and he entrusted Arjumand Banu with the royal seal. <strong>17 ………. </strong>Though Shah Jahan also had other wives, Mumtaz Mahal was his favourite and accompanied him everywhere, even on military campaigns. In the year 1631, when Mumtaz Mahal was giving birth to their 14th child, she died due to some complications. While Mumtaz was on her deathbed, Shah Jahan promised her that he would never remarry and would build the richest mausoleum over her grave.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It is said that Shah Jahan was so heartbroken after her death that he ordered the court into mourning for two years. Sometime after her death, Shah Jahan undertook the task of creating the world's most beautiful monument in the memory of his beloved. It took 22 years and the labour of 22,000 workers to construct the monument. <strong>18 ………. </strong>This magnificent monument came to be known as "Taj Mahal" and now counts amongst the Seven Wonders of the World. It is the true story of the Taj Mahal of India which has mesmerised many people with its bewitching beauty</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Shah Jahan was wealthy enough to support the Taj Mahal and its mighty maintenance costs. However, over the centuries, the Mughal Empire lost its riches and the Taj Mahal fell into ruins. By the 1800s, the British ousted the Mughals and took over India. The Taj Mahal was dissected for its beauty—the British cut gemstones from its walls, stole silver candlesticks and doors, and even tried to sell the white marble overseas. <strong>19 ……….</strong> Rather than looting the Taj Mahal, Curzon worked to restore it.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Taj Mahal has once again become a magnificent place with 2.5 million visitors each year. <strong>20 ………. </strong>Once a month, visitors also have the opportunity to make a short visit during a full moon to see how the Taj Mahal seems to glow from the inside out in the moonlight. The Taj Mahal was placed on the World Heritage List by UNESCO in 1983, but this protection has not guaranteed its safety. It is now at the mercy of pollutants from nearby factories and excessive humidity from the breath of its visitors.</p>

        <p>Taj Mahal, the magnificent monument that stands at the heart of India, has a story that has been melting the hearts of millions of listeners since the time Taj Mahal has been visible. It is a story, that although ending back in 1631, continues to live on in the concrete form of Taj Mahal and is considered a living example of eternal love. <strong>15 ………. </strong>These two people from the course of history have set an example for the people living in the present and the future. As the poet, Edwin Arnold describes it, "Not a piece of architecture, as other buildings are, but the proud passion of an emperor's love wrought in living stones." The story that follows next will prove why that statement is true.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Shah Jahan, initially named Prince Khurram, was born in the year 1592. He was the son of Jehangir, the fourth Mughal emperor of India and the grandson of Akbar the Great. In 1607, Shah Jahan strolled down the Meena Bazaar, accompanied by a string of fawning courtiers. <strong>16 ……….</strong> It was love at first sight and the girl was Mumtaz Mahal, who was known as Arjumand Banu Begum at that time. At that time, he was 14 years old and she, a Muslim Persian princess, was 15. After meeting her, Shah Jahan went back to his father and declared that he wanted to marry her. The match was solemnised five years later i.e., in the year 1612.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It was in the year 1628 that Shah Jahan became the Emperor and he entrusted Arjumand Banu with the royal seal. <strong>17 ………. </strong>Though Shah Jahan also had other wives, Mumtaz Mahal was his favourite and accompanied him everywhere, even on military campaigns. In the year 1631, when Mumtaz Mahal was giving birth to their 14th child, she died due to some complications. While Mumtaz was on her deathbed, Shah Jahan promised her that he would never remarry and would build the richest mausoleum over her grave.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It is said that Shah Jahan was so heartbroken after her death that he ordered the court into mourning for two years. Sometime after her death, Shah Jahan undertook the task of creating the world's most beautiful monument in the memory of his beloved. It took 22 years and the labour of 22,000 workers to construct the monument. <strong>18 ………. </strong>This magnificent monument came to be known as "Taj Mahal" and now counts amongst the Seven Wonders of the World. It is the true story of the Taj Mahal of India which has mesmerised many people with its bewitching beauty</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Shah Jahan was wealthy enough to support the Taj Mahal and its mighty maintenance costs. However, over the centuries, the Mughal Empire lost its riches and the Taj Mahal fell into ruins. By the 1800s, the British ousted the Mughals and took over India. The Taj Mahal was dissected for its beauty—the British cut gemstones from its walls, stole silver candlesticks and doors, and even tried to sell the white marble overseas. <strong>19 ……….</strong> Rather than looting the Taj Mahal, Curzon worked to restore it.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Taj Mahal has once again become a magnificent place with 2.5 million visitors each year. <strong>20 ………. </strong>Once a month, visitors also have the opportunity to make a short visit during a full moon to see how the Taj Mahal seems to glow from the inside out in the moonlight. The Taj Mahal was placed on the World Heritage List by UNESCO in 1983, but this protection has not guaranteed its safety. It is now at the mercy of pollutants from nearby factories and excessive humidity from the breath of its visitors.</p>

        <p>It is said that Shah Jahan was so heartbroken after her death that he ordered the court into mourning for two years. Sometime after her death, Shah Jahan undertook the task of creating the world's most beautiful monument in the memory of his beloved. It took 22 years and the labour of 22,000 workers to construct the monument. <strong>18 ………. </strong>This magnificent monument came to be known as "Taj Mahal" and now counts amongst the Seven Wonders of the World. It is the true story of the Taj Mahal of India which has mesmerised many people with its bewitching beauty</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Shah Jahan was wealthy enough to support the Taj Mahal and its mighty maintenance costs. However, over the centuries, the Mughal Empire lost its riches and the Taj Mahal fell into ruins. By the 1800s, the British ousted the Mughals and took over India. The Taj Mahal was dissected for its beauty—the British cut gemstones from its walls, stole silver candlesticks and doors, and even tried to sell the white marble overseas. <strong>19 ……….</strong> Rather than looting the Taj Mahal, Curzon worked to restore it.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Taj Mahal has once again become a magnificent place with 2.5 million visitors each year. <strong>20 ………. </strong>Once a month, visitors also have the opportunity to make a short visit during a full moon to see how the Taj Mahal seems to glow from the inside out in the moonlight. The Taj Mahal was placed on the World Heritage List by UNESCO in 1983, but this protection has not guaranteed its safety. It is now at the mercy of pollutants from nearby factories and excessive humidity from the breath of its visitors.</p>

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Mark Twain said that “Humour is the great thing, the saving thing after all. The minute it crops up, all our hardnesses yield, all our irritations, and resentments flit away and a sunny spirit takes their place.”<br>
<br>
He is certainly not wrong. Humour may very well be the great thing. It touches upon nearly every facet of life — 90 percent of men and 81 percent of women report that a sense of humour is the most important quality in a partner, it’s a crucial quality for leaders and it’s even been shown to improve cancer treatments.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Humour doesn’t just guard against depression. It also improves people’s overall quality of life. Researchers have found that people who score highly in certain types of humour have better self-esteem, more positive affect, greater self-competency, more control over anxiety and better performance in social interactions.<br>
<br>
In addition to working as a mental immune system, research has shown that humour can actually improve your physical immune system.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Laughter can also improve cardiovascular health and lowers heart rates, blood pressure, and muscular tension. Aside from improving your health, laughter can also lead to greater creativity and a productivity tool as well. This is because laughter lights up the anterior cingulate cortex, an area of the brain associated with attention and decision-making.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There’s no doubt that humour is a life skill that everybody needs, but how do we define it? Can it be taught? The jury is still out on those issues.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
A colleague accused me of having a tendency to over-react, so I have no choice but to burn down his house and wish him only bad luck. Fair’s fair, right? I learned to respond strongly to things from a former boss who used to say the following sentence at least once a day: “Some fool has moved my (random object) and when I find out who did it, God help me, I am going to tear this place down… oh, there it is.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Some people think overreacting is a bad thing but look at the evidence. The richest country in the world is the United States, from which a reader has just sent me a video of a man riding a moped pursued by 12 police cars. A moped, for those who don’t know, is a motorbike powered by an engine with the strength of a mosquito suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But just days later, the US record on maximum overreaction was beaten by a news report sent to me by a reader in Canada. Twelve police squad cars and a tactical attack squad were sent to a block of flats in Winnipeg, Ontario, after an unknown person slammed a door in the building.<br>
<br>
This makes me want to live in Canada. I’ve lived in places where the police don’t even react to murders unless they happen at the actual police station, and even then, the only reaction is an irritated desk sergeant looking up from Candy Crush and raising an eyebrow.&nbsp;<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Learning how to be funny is an essential people skill. Most people don’t realise you can learn how to be funny. In fact, I want to convince you that the funniest people hone their witty craft. And being funny matters.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
You’ll be more successful if you know how to make people laugh … but only the good kind of laugh, not the awkward kind: So, this is how you do it. Give the opposite answer to yes/no questions. Play with Numbers e.g. only 2000 people at the small party. Use The Rule of 3, that establishes a pattern, then ends with something unexpected. Use a Character Switch e.g. if you meet a bear in the woods, scary for the bear! Use “Whatever” as Your Secret Weapon. Use real-life stories, not jokes. Delay the funny. Now, I am going to end on something you know: practise makes perfect.<br>

Let me try it one more time: Shut this book and put it back right now. I see we have an extremely difficult customer here. Take my advice, shut this book and put it back on the shelf. It's for your own good. There are BAD things in this book. REALLY BAD things. Not convinced? Then I'm going to have to list some of the things in this book. Don't blame me if it upsets you. It's not my fault; I warned you. VIOLENCE. Yep. There's blood in this book. Red stuff. It's nasty. It's yucky. It's downright gory. SAD THINGS.

Mark Twain said that “Humour is the great thing, the saving thing after all. The minute it crops up, all our hardnesses yield, all our irritations, and resentments flit away and a sunny spirit takes their place.”<br>
<br>
He is certainly not wrong. Humour may very well be the great thing. It touches upon nearly every facet of life — 90 percent of men and 81 percent of women report that a sense of humour is the most important quality in a partner, it’s a crucial quality for leaders and it’s even been shown to improve cancer treatments.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Humour doesn’t just guard against depression. It also improves people’s overall quality of life. Researchers have found that people who score highly in certain types of humour have better self-esteem, more positive affect, greater self-competency, more control over anxiety and better performance in social interactions.<br>
<br>
In addition to working as a mental immune system, research has shown that humour can actually improve your physical immune system.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Laughter can also improve cardiovascular health and lowers heart rates, blood pressure, and muscular tension. Aside from improving your health, laughter can also lead to greater creativity and a productivity tool as well. This is because laughter lights up the anterior cingulate cortex, an area of the brain associated with attention and decision-making.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There’s no doubt that humour is a life skill that everybody needs, but how do we define it? Can it be taught? The jury is still out on those issues.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
A colleague accused me of having a tendency to over-react, so I have no choice but to burn down his house and wish him only bad luck. Fair’s fair, right? I learned to respond strongly to things from a former boss who used to say the following sentence at least once a day: “Some fool has moved my (random object) and when I find out who did it, God help me, I am going to tear this place down… oh, there it is.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Some people think overreacting is a bad thing but look at the evidence. The richest country in the world is the United States, from which a reader has just sent me a video of a man riding a moped pursued by 12 police cars. A moped, for those who don’t know, is a motorbike powered by an engine with the strength of a mosquito suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But just days later, the US record on maximum overreaction was beaten by a news report sent to me by a reader in Canada. Twelve police squad cars and a tactical attack squad were sent to a block of flats in Winnipeg, Ontario, after an unknown person slammed a door in the building.<br>
<br>
This makes me want to live in Canada. I’ve lived in places where the police don’t even react to murders unless they happen at the actual police station, and even then, the only reaction is an irritated desk sergeant looking up from Candy Crush and raising an eyebrow.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Learning how to be funny is an essential people skill. Most people don’t realise you can learn how to be funny. In fact, I want to convince you that the funniest people hone their witty craft. And being funny matters.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
You’ll be more successful if you know how to make people laugh … but only the good kind of laugh, not the awkward kind: So, this is how you do it. Give the opposite answer to yes/no questions. Play with Numbers e.g. only 2000 people at the small party. Use The Rule of 3, that establishes a pattern, then ends with something unexpected. Use a Character Switch e.g. if you meet a bear in the woods, scary for the bear! Use “Whatever” as Your Secret Weapon. Use real-life stories, not jokes. Delay the funny. Now, I am going to end on something you know: practise makes perfect.<br>

Hey, you don't read this book. Do NOT read this book. Just shut it quietly and put it back where you found it. Look, bozo, I'm not kidding. What is there about the last sentence that you don't understand? Are you being rude or are you just really, really stupid? Can you even read? Let me try it one more time: Shut this book and put it back right now. I see we have an extremely difficult customer here. Take my advice, shut this book and put it back on the shelf. It's for your own good. There are BAD things in this book. REALLY BAD things. Not convinced? Then I'm going to have to list some of the things in this book. Don't blame me if it upsets you. It's not my fault; I warned you. VIOLENCE. Yep. There's blood in this book. Red stuff. It's nasty. It's yucky. It's downright gory. SAD THINGS. I'm talking about accidents, people going insane, even dying. We take no responsibility for any deeply traumatic condition that may yuck up your life if you are stupid enough to read this book despite the loads and loads of warnings telling you not to. Good grief! You really are a pest, aren't you? Well, this is your final chance. Put the book down quietly and go away.<br>

        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Mark Twain said that “Humour is the great thing, the saving thing after all. The minute it crops up, all our hardnesses yield, all our irritations, and resentments flit away and a sunny spirit takes their place.”<br>
<br>
He is certainly not wrong. Humour may very well be the great thing. It touches upon nearly every facet of life — 90 percent of men and 81 percent of women report that a sense of humour is the most important quality in a partner, it’s a crucial quality for leaders and it’s even been shown to improve cancer treatments.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Humour doesn’t just guard against depression. It also improves people’s overall quality of life. Researchers have found that people who score highly in certain types of humour have better self-esteem, more positive affect, greater self-competency, more control over anxiety and better performance in social interactions.<br>
<br>
In addition to working as a mental immune system, research has shown that humour can actually improve your physical immune system.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Laughter can also improve cardiovascular health and lowers heart rates, blood pressure, and muscular tension. Aside from improving your health, laughter can also lead to greater creativity and a productivity tool as well. This is because laughter lights up the anterior cingulate cortex, an area of the brain associated with attention and decision-making.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There’s no doubt that humour is a life skill that everybody needs, but how do we define it? Can it be taught? The jury is still out on those issues.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
A colleague accused me of having a tendency to over-react, so I have no choice but to burn down his house and wish him only bad luck. Fair’s fair, right? I learned to respond strongly to things from a former boss who used to say the following sentence at least once a day: “Some fool has moved my (random object) and when I find out who did it, God help me, I am going to tear this place down… oh, there it is.”&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Some people think overreacting is a bad thing but look at the evidence. The richest country in the world is the United States, from which a reader has just sent me a video of a man riding a moped pursued by 12 police cars. A moped, for those who don’t know, is a motorbike powered by an engine with the strength of a mosquito suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
But just days later, the US record on maximum overreaction was beaten by a news report sent to me by a reader in Canada. Twelve police squad cars and a tactical attack squad were sent to a block of flats in Winnipeg, Ontario, after an unknown person slammed a door in the building.<br>
<br>
This makes me want to live in Canada. I’ve lived in places where the police don’t even react to murders unless they happen at the actual police station, and even then, the only reaction is an irritated desk sergeant looking up from Candy Crush and raising an eyebrow.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Learning how to be funny is an essential people skill. Most people don’t realise you can learn how to be funny. In fact, I want to convince you that the funniest people hone their witty craft. And being funny matters.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
You’ll be more successful if you know how to make people laugh … but only the good kind of laugh, not the awkward kind: So, this is how you do it. Give the opposite answer to yes/no questions. Play with Numbers e.g. only 2000 people at the small party. Use The Rule of 3, that establishes a pattern, then ends with something unexpected. Use a Character Switch e.g. if you meet a bear in the woods, scary for the bear! Use “Whatever” as Your Secret Weapon. Use real-life stories, not jokes. Delay the funny. Now, I am going to end on something you know: practise makes perfect.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Hey, you don't read this book. Do NOT read this book. Just shut it quietly and put it back where you found it. Look, bozo, I'm not kidding. What is there about the last sentence that you don't understand? Are you being rude or are you just really, really stupid? Can you even read? Let me try it one more time: Shut this book and put it back right now. I see we have an extremely difficult customer here. Take my advice, shut this book and put it back on the shelf. It's for your own good. There are BAD things in this book. REALLY BAD things. Not convinced? Then I'm going to have to list some of the things in this book. Don't blame me if it upsets you. It's not my fault; I warned you. VIOLENCE. Yep. There's blood in this book. Red stuff. It's nasty. It's yucky. It's downright gory. SAD THINGS. I'm talking about accidents, people going insane, even dying. We take no responsibility for any deeply traumatic condition that may yuck up your life if you are stupid enough to read this book despite the loads and loads of warnings telling you not to. Good grief! You really are a pest, aren't you? Well, this is your final chance. Put the book down quietly and go away.<br>
