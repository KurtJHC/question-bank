There are countless movies about the holidays and Christmas, but none compare to movies about Santa Claus. Santa has become a clearly recognisable figure during the holidays and has appeared in so many movies that it's difficult to choose just a few to watch during the winter season. Here are the two best movies featuring the iconic Santa Claus in familiar classic roles and new and inventive roles as well.<br>
<br>
Runner up is “The Santa Clause” (1994). This rendition of how Santa came to be is a Christmas must-have that families love to watch during this season. A divorced husband becomes Santa and has to deal with this new job while trying to convince his family and friends that he hasn't lost his mind. It is full of fun and Christmas spirit and it is one that many families have watched for ages every time Christmas rolls around. Tim Allen brings Santa to life, but, with the help of Eric Lloyd and Wendy Crewson, the movie turns into a homerun hit.<br>
<br>
It might seem strange that a movie from the 1970s, “Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town” (1970) is at the top of our list, but it is a classic that can't be beaten. It is a heartfelt story about the origins of Santa Claus himself and the foes he was up against, like Winter and the Burgermeister. There are plenty of catchy tunes that you will be singing throughout the Christmas season, and it has an old-timey feel that fits right in with the holidays. It is a Santa movie no family can go without, which is why we have rated this as the best one of all time.<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
If you were to ask people where the legend of Santa Claus began, they’d probably start by telling you that the name “Santa” is merely a moniker for Saint Nicholas, a man who existed a long time ago and was renowned for his generosity towards children. We hear about Saint Nick in carols like Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, and stories like The Night Before Christmas, but beyond that the man remains a bit of a mystery.<br>
<br>
By all accounts, his story begins in the fourth century AD in what is now modern-day Turkey. A man named Nicholas became the bishop of a village called Myra. He soon became one of the most popular saints in Christianity. That’s about all we know for sure but much of the folklore surrounding Saint Nick speaks of his kindness and generosity towards children, in a world where those attitudes weren’t easy to find. Despite being the patron saint of many European countries including Russia, Austria, Belgium, France and Germany, it was in the Netherlands where we first began to see some semblance of the Santa Claus we’re familiar with today.<br>
<br>
Each year, the much-loved saint was honoured during the Feast of Saint Nicholas (or Sint- Nikolaas), where parents would leave gifts out for their children, who naturally believed Saint Nicholas had paid them a visit during the night.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
What are Santa’s reindeer like? Are they mischievous? Are they funny? Clement C. Moore used secretive means to reveal the names of eight reindeer in his poem “Twas the Night Before Christmas." But once the world found out, people began to make songs about them, and Santa started using their names every time he took off in the sled.<br>
<br>
Traditionally, there are eight reindeer (Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, and Blitzen). Rudolph is the ninth addition (made famous by the song about his red nose). And then there's Olive, the other reindeer. What are these reindeer like, and what do they do during their time off? You can find out more about their histories and personalities.<br>
<br>
Santa's reindeer are typically portrayed as male in pop culture (Rudolph is referred to as a "him" in the song), but according to two professors at the University of Edinburgh, Santa's reindeer are actually all female because male reindeer shed their antlers during the winter, while female reindeer retain their antlers, and Santa's reindeer are always depicted with antlers. Male reindeer also lose nourishment and vitality during the winter months, so only the females are strong and healthy enough to pull a sleigh full of toys and a 260-lb man.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Many children today know Santa Claus as that jolly man in red who delivers presents to children on Christmas Eve. But the legend of Santa stretches back hundreds of years to a monk named St. Nicholas. Although the notion of a man flying around the world in a sleigh led by flying reindeer is humanly impossible, the magic of Santa Claus is a long standing tradition.<br>
<br>
For many families, incorporating Santa traditions into their holiday celebrations creates joyful and fun experiences. It also provides opportunities for shared belief and play, reliving and sharing childhood memories, and encouraging empathy, kindness and generosity. Believing in Santa Claus can also benefit children’s development as an avenue for creativity, imagination and play. There are developmentally appropriate ways to sensitively and honestly respond to your child’s questions about him.<br>

What are Santa’s reindeer like? Are they mischievous? Are they funny? Clement C. Moore used secretive means to reveal the names of eight reindeer in his poem “Twas the Night Before Christmas."

Traditionally, there are eight reindeer (Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, and Blitzen). Rudolph is the ninth addition (made famous by the song about his red nose). And then there's Olive, the other reindeer. What are these reindeer like, and what do they do during their time off? You can find out more about their histories and personalities.<br>
<br>
Santa's reindeer are typically portrayed as male in pop culture (Rudolph is referred to as a "him" in the song), but according to two professors at the University of Edinburgh, Santa's reindeer are actually all female because male reindeer shed their antlers during the winter, while female reindeer retain their antlers, and Santa's reindeer are always depicted with antlers. Male reindeer also lose nourishment and vitality during the winter months, so only the females are strong and healthy enough to pull a sleigh full of toys and a 260-lb man.<br>

Many children today know Santa Claus as that jolly man in red who delivers presents to children on Christmas Eve. But the legend of Santa stretches back hundreds of years to a monk named St. Nicholas. Although the notion of a man flying around the world in a sleigh led by flying reindeer is humanly impossible, the magic of Santa Claus is a long standing tradition.<br>
<br>
For many families, incorporating Santa traditions into their holiday celebrations creates joyful and fun experiences. It also provides opportunities for shared belief and play, reliving and sharing childhood memories, and encouraging empathy, kindness and generosity. Believing in Santa Claus can also benefit children’s development as an avenue for creativity, imagination and play. There are developmentally appropriate ways to sensitively and honestly respond to your child’s questions about him.<br>

There are countless movies about the holidays and Christmas, but none compare to movies about Santa Claus. Santa has become a clearly recognisable figure during the holidays and has appeared in so many movies that it's difficult to choose just a few to watch during the winter season. Here are the two best movies featuring the iconic Santa Claus in familiar classic roles and new and inventive roles as well.<br>
<br>
Runner up is “The Santa Clause” (1994). This rendition of how Santa came to be is a Christmas must-have that families love to watch during this season. A divorced husband becomes Santa and has to deal with this new job while trying to convince his family and friends that he hasn't lost his mind. It is full of fun and Christmas spirit and it is one that many families have watched for ages every time Christmas rolls around. Tim Allen brings Santa to life, but, with the help of Eric Lloyd and Wendy Crewson, the movie turns into a homerun hit.<br>
<br>
It might seem strange that a movie from the 1970s, “Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town” (1970) is at the top of our list, but it is a classic that can't be beaten. It is a heartfelt story about the origins of Santa Claus himself and the foes he was up against, like Winter and the Burgermeister. There are plenty of catchy tunes that you will be singing throughout the Christmas season, and it has an old-timey feel that fits right in with the holidays. It is a Santa movie no family can go without, which is why we have rated this as the best one of all time.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
If you were to ask people where the legend of Santa Claus began, they’d probably start by telling you that the name “Santa” is merely a moniker for Saint Nicholas, a man who existed a long time ago and was renowned for his generosity towards children. We hear about Saint Nick in carols like Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, and stories like The Night Before Christmas, but beyond that the man remains a bit of a mystery.<br>
<br>
By all accounts, his story begins in the fourth century AD in what is now modern-day Turkey. A man named Nicholas became the bishop of a village called Myra. He soon became one of the most popular saints in Christianity. That’s about all we know for sure but much of the folklore surrounding Saint Nick speaks of his kindness and generosity towards children, in a world where those attitudes weren’t easy to find.
