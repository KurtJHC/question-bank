          <strong>Alex Wants a Three Corner</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; When people hear “Polly wants a cracker,” most imagine a parrot speaking. Parrots are well known for their ability to learn words or say simple sentences. In fact, that ability is one of the main reasons people like to have them as pets. Do parrots really know what they are saying though? Does Polly really want a cracker, or is she just making noise?</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Until recently most scientists and animal experts believed that parrots were only good at mimicking sounds they heard. Many research scientists believe that talking birds repeat sounds that bring them praise or treats. Beyond this, they claim words probably have no meaning to parrots. If we say that someone is just “parroting the answer,” we mean that the person is repeating a memorized response without understanding it. The term “bird brain” is another example of a phrase that people use because they think that birds have limited mental abilities. Many think that a brain that is small in size cannot possess much intelligence or real language skills.</p>

        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Other researchers are beginning to question this limited view of birds, particularly parrots. Dr. Irene Pepperberg is one of those researchers. In 1990 she published a research paper sharing the results of an exciting study. The study involved an African Grey parrot named Alex that seemed to communicate in a meaningful way. This study and Dr. Pepperberg’s continuing work with Alex have helped to change some people’s views about the mental abilities of parrots.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Pepperberg wanted to find out if parrots know what they are saying. She had read communication research on apes and dolphins. Some chimpanzees and gorillas can communicate with humans by using sign language. Dolphins can be taught to “talk” to people by pushing buttons labeled with symbols. Tests have shown that these animals know the meaning of what they are “saying.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In 1977 Dr. Pepperberg bought Alex at a Chicago pet store. African Grey parrots are known as talented talkers. Some of them have been trained to use hundreds of words and phrases. Dr. Pepperberg wanted to see if Alex could be taught to speak meaningfully, so she and her <span class="txt-underline">assistant</span> began to train him. Every time Alex repeated what they were saying, he was rewarded.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;By 1997 Alex could name more than one hundred objects in Dr. Pepperberg’s laboratory. Alex could name various toys and favorite foods. He invented a word for his favorite treat, an apple slice, which he called a “banerry.”</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Alex also recognized and named colors, numbers up to eight, materials, and shapes. In one test, Dr. Pepperberg showed him a wooden triangle and asked, “What shape is the wood?”</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Alex replied, “Three corner.” As a reward, Alex was allowed to play with the block. In another test, the researchers showed Alex a tray holding several triangular blocks of different colors. The researchers then asked Alex to say what all of the blocks had in common.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The bird replied, “Shape.” He could also tell which block was the largest or smallest. When Alex became tired of working, he would say, “Go away!”</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“All of the tests we’ve done with dolphins and apes to investigate their intelligence, we’ve done with Alex,” Dr. Pepperberg said in a 1997 interview. “He scored as well as they did in many of them, better in some.”</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In 1997 Dr. Pepperberg and her assistants also began teaching Alex to recognize letters and to say their sounds. Alex might even learn to read! Whether or not he does, Alex is a very special bird.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Some critics say that the studies should not be taken seriously. They think that Alex is much more intelligent than other parrots or that he just has an excellent trainer. However, Dr. Pepperberg and other scientists do believe that Alex’s abilities show that parrots’ intelligence is similar to that of dolphins and apes.</p>

          <strong>Virginia Apgar: Healthy Babies</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Until 1952, all care after a baby’s birth was focused on the mother. Consequently, many babies suffered from medical problems because all the attention was on the mother’s condition. Dr. Virginia Apgar was instrumental in changing the medical care babies receive.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Apgar chose to become a doctor and entered medical school in 1929. She was one of just a handful of female medical students. Apgar chose to specialize in surgery when she graduated.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Anesthesiologists give patients medicines to block pain. Some even put patients to sleep during surgery. Apgar entered the field at a time when potent medicines were being introduced. Thus, doctors, instead of nurses, needed to administer these medicines to patients.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There were almost no female surgeons at the time. Apgar was an excellent student, but the chairman of the department worried that few patients would agree to be operated on by a woman. Apgar decided to follow the chairman’s advice to switch to the new field of anesthesiology.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After 10 years, Apgar specialized in the field even further by working solely to help control the pain of expectant mothers during the delivery of their babies. Apgar observed how pain medicines affected both mothers and newborn babies. Apgar was present for enough deliveries to observe how little care newborn babies received following delivery. No one checked vital signs of a baby’s health, the strength of it's heartbeats, reflexes, and skin color in the minutes after a baby’s birth. Through careful study, Apgar developed a system to evaluate and measure newborn health.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Apgar was destined to become a leader. Being in a new field of medicine was difficult for anesthesiologists because they were often not seen as equal to other doctors. She was only the second woman accepted as an anesthesiologist. Soon afterward, Apgar was asked to lead the Anesthesiology Department at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. She became the first female department head at the hospital.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Apgar’s system assigned zero to two points to five different areas: appearance, respiration, muscle tone, color, and reflexes. Babies testing at a two in each area were in good health. Those receiving a one in some areas warranted extra care.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Apgar’s system was highly successful, and soon hospitals worldwide were using it. To honor Apgar, her name was made an acronym for the test. A for appearance, P for pulse, G for grimace (or reflex irritability), A for activity (or muscle tone), and R for respiration. Thanks to Dr. Apgar, babies’ medical care was made forever better.</p>

          <strong>Virginia Apgar: Healthy Babies</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="txt-ctr">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Until 1952, all care after a baby’s birth was focused on the mother. Consequently, many babies suffered from medical problems because all the attention was on the mother’s condition. Dr. Virginia Apgar was instrumental in changing the medical care babies receive.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Apgar chose to become a doctor and entered medical school in 1929. She was one of just a handful of female medical students. Apgar chose to specialize in surgery when she graduated.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Anesthesiologists give patients medicines to block pain. Some even put patients to sleep during surgery. Apgar entered the field at a time when potent medicines were being introduced. Thus, doctors, instead of nurses, needed to administer these medicines to patients.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There were almost no female surgeons at the time. Apgar was an excellent student, but the chairman of the department worried that few patients would agree to be operated on by a woman. Apgar decided to follow the chairman’s advice to switch to the new field of anesthesiology.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After 10 years, Apgar specialized in the field even further by working solely to help control the pain of expectant mothers during the delivery of their babies. Apgar observed how pain medicines affected both mothers and newborn babies. Apgar was present for enough deliveries to observe how little care newborn babies received following delivery. No one checked vital signs of a baby’s health, the strength of it's heartbeats, reflexes, and skin color in the minutes after a baby’s birth. Through careful study, Apgar developed a system to evaluate and measure newborn health.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Apgar was destined to become a leader. Being in a new field of medicine was difficult for anesthesiologists because they were often not seen as equal to other doctors. She was only the second woman accepted as an anesthesiologist. Soon afterward, Apgar was asked to lead the Anesthesiology Department at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. She became the first female department head at the hospital.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Apgar’s system assigned zero to two points to five different areas: appearance, respiration, muscle tone, color, and reflexes. Babies testing at a two in each area were in good health. Those receiving a one in some areas warranted extra care.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Apgar’s system was highly successful, and soon hospitals worldwide were using it. To honor Apgar, her name was made an acronym for the test. A for appearance, P for pulse, G for grimace (or reflex irritability), A for activity (or muscle tone), and R for respiration. Thanks to Dr. Apgar, babies’ medical care was made forever better.</p>

          <strong>Virginia Apgar: Healthy Babies</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; Until 1952, all care after a baby’s birth was focused on the mother. Consequently, many babies suffered from medical problems because all the attention was on the mother’s condition. Dr. Virginia Apgar was instrumental in changing the medical care babies receive.</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Apgar chose to become a doctor and entered medical school in 1929. She was one of just a handful of female medical students. Apgar chose to specialize in surgery when she graduated.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Anesthesiologists give patients medicines to block pain. Some even put patients to sleep during surgery. Apgar entered the field at a time when potent medicines were being introduced. Thus, doctors, instead of nurses, needed to administer these medicines to patients.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There were almost no female surgeons at the time. Apgar was an excellent student, but the chairman of the department worried that few patients would agree to be operated on by a woman. Apgar decided to follow the chairman’s advice to switch to the new field of anesthesiology.</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After 10 years, Apgar specialized in the field even further by working solely to help control the pain of expectant mothers during the delivery of their babies. Apgar observed how pain medicines affected both mothers and newborn babies. Apgar was present for enough deliveries to observe how little care newborn babies received following delivery. No one checked vital signs of a baby’s health, the strength of it's heartbeats, reflexes, and skin color in the minutes after a baby’s birth. Through careful study, Apgar developed a system to evaluate and measure newborn health.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Apgar was destined to become a leader. Being in a new field of medicine was difficult for anesthesiologists because they were often not seen as equal to other doctors. She was only the second woman accepted as an anesthesiologist. Soon afterward, Apgar was asked to lead the Anesthesiology Department at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. She became the first female department head at the hospital.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Apgar’s system assigned zero to two points to five different areas: appearance, respiration, muscle tone, color, and reflexes. Babies testing at a two in each area were in good health. Those receiving a one in some areas warranted extra care.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Apgar’s system was highly successful, and soon hospitals worldwide were using it. To honor Apgar, her name was made an acronym for the test. A for appearance, P for pulse, G for grimace (or reflex irritability), A for activity (or muscle tone), and R for respiration. Thanks to Dr. Apgar, babies’ medical care was made forever better.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I never could remember dates</p>
        <p>Of treaties, wars, and such.</p>
        <p>Reciting lists of Presidents</p>
        <p>Did not impress me much.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But stories of the pioneers&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5</p>
        <p>And settlers of this land?</p>
        <p>Now, them I liked to read about,</p>
        <p>That sturdy, stalwart&nbsp;band.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The loaded Conestogas&nbsp;rolled</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Across the Western plains.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;10</p>
        <p>And many people traveled in</p>
        <p>Those early wagon trains.</p>
        <p>They came from homes in Tennessee,</p>
        <p>And Pennsylvania too,</p>
        <p>&nbsp; Left settled towns for untamed lands,&nbsp; &nbsp;15</p>
        <p>Where everything was new.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>How hard they worked to clear their farms!</p>
        <p>They reared<sup>1</sup> their children there.</p>
        <p>The men built homes, the women cooked,</p>
        <p>&nbsp; And sewed warm clothes to wear.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;20</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They never chose to write their names</p>
        <p>In books of history,</p>
        <p>But I think all of these heroes</p>
        <p>Lived lives of bravery.</p>

          <strong>Recycled Bicycle</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; “When you finish in that corner, would you come help me over here, Emma?”</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Sure thing, Mrs. Ames.” Emma said cheerfully. Emma was helping her neighbor clean the small barn behind her house. Mrs. Ames had grown up in the farmhouse that was still her home, and the city had grown up around the house. The barn was a reminder that the neighborhood used to be farmland.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“What do you want me to do with the bales of hay?” Emma asked.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“They will be good mulch around all those tomato plants I'm going to grow,” said Mrs. Ames. “Please leave them right there.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Emma smiled. Mrs. Ames had her dream, and Emma had hers. She had been working to save money to buy a new bike and dreamed of riding to school in the mornings and to soccer practice in the afternoons. She knew just which bike she wanted too: a gleaming, candy-apple red, ten-speed bike with cast aluminum rims and racing tires. It had to have racing tires.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Emma carefully sorted the debris. Mrs. Ames had commented that for the past forty years, the barn had been a place to “defer decisions” about whether or not to discard old or broken items. Now Emma and Mrs. Ames were making decisions about items that had been adding up over the last four decades. The burlap sacks, if they were still sound, went into a “recycle” pile. In addition to being useful for carrying things, they had fascinating logos of long-disappeared companies printed on them in faded reds and blues. Someone would be sure to use them again.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Near the back of the barn, where dust specks danced in shafts of light, Emma saw an old canvas tarp. Lifting the heavy cloth revealed a bicycle. It was very rusty and had rotten, cracked tires. Apparently, this was one of those "deferred decisions” of which Mrs. Ames had spoken. Well, Emma thought, this clearly goes out on the junk heap.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Still, she thought, someone had once cared enough for this wreck to cover it with a tarp. Emma studied the ruin and shook her head. It was nothing like the bike <em>she</em> wanted.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;No, it was as different as it could be from the bike of her dreams. Instead of a straight bar of metal tubing across the center, this old bike featured a flowing, curved center with scalloped indentations. Emma took an old burlap sack and brushed at the metal for a bit to reveal midnight blue paint that seemed darker because of the shadowy recess of the barn. Against the background was a bright star with a trailing tail. The word “Comet” was emblazoned across it, its letters slightly trailing to indicate speed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="100%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dmgrgrhfu/image/upload/v1767442062/pcdojrcc9gk3rk2yytqb.png" alt="V_SE05_RC_13">


        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Emma stepped back to look at the bike again. It had a full fender over the back tire and a half fender over the front. A thick metal guard covered the chain. There was something about it... something that stuck with Emma and reminded her of... of the antique cars she had seen in the downtown parade one year. The flowing fenders, the curved fins on the back—it all fit. It was a wreck, Emma thought, but it was no piece of junk: it was a classic—an antique. Emma stared at the bike, trying to imagine the bike when it was new. She smiled and nodded.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh, you found my bike!” said Mrs. Ames, interrupting Emma's daydream. “That certainly brings back some memories.”</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“How old is it?” Emma asked.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Younger than I am!” Mrs. Ames said, chuckling. “I bought the bicycle with ‘egg money’, money I made by selling eggs. I used to walk into town, carrying that basket to sell them,” she said pointing to the bike. “Later, I put it on the bike and rode to town with the eggs in it.”</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Was ‘Comet’ a fancy brand name back then?”</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“No. I stenciled that on there myself. You see, there was a comet that year—1948—that was very special. No one knew it was there until we had a solar eclipse. Then everyone could see the comet next to the sun. That’s when I named my bicycle Comet. It seemed like I was traveling as fast as a comet when I went flying into town with those eggs. The funny thing is I never broke one either! Later, I even had a paper route. That basket could actually hold 72 copies of the afternoon paper—if they were folded properly:”</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Mrs. Ames ... your bike ...it’s not like any other bike I've ever seen. I know you still love your bike.” Emma hesitated and then asked tentatively, “Would you consider giving me your bike instead of paying me for helping you?”</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Are you sure you would want this bike? It’s nothing like the bike you told me you wanted.”</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“I can see that this bike is special, Mrs. Ames, and I’m sure I can fix it up. It just needs a couple of new tires, a drop or two of oil on the chain, and a little polishing.”</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh, I don't know. It might need a new horn, too,” said Mrs. Ames, reaching out and honking the old one. Instead of a hearty squeak, the horn let out a tired sigh. “You have yourself a deal, Emma.”</p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Emma beamed as she wheeled the bike into the light. She could really see it now: the gleaming midnight blue Comet flying down the streets. It would be just the thing for getting to school or soccer practice—or even delivering papers.</p>

          <strong>Recycled Bicycle</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; “When you finish in that corner, would you come help me over here, Emma?”</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Sure thing, Mrs. Ames.” Emma said cheerfully. Emma was helping her neighbor clean the small barn behind her house. Mrs. Ames had grown up in the farmhouse that was still her home, and the city had grown up around the house. The barn was a reminder that the neighborhood used to be farmland.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“What do you want me to do with the bales of hay?” Emma asked.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“They will be good mulch around all those tomato plants I'm going to grow,” said Mrs. Ames. “Please leave them right there.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Emma smiled. Mrs. Ames had her dream, and Emma had hers. She had been working to save money to buy a new bike and dreamed of riding to school in the mornings and to soccer practice in the afternoons. She knew just which bike she wanted too: a gleaming, candy-apple red, ten-speed bike with cast aluminum rims and racing tires. It had to have racing tires.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Emma carefully sorted the debris. Mrs. Ames had commented that for the past forty years, the barn had been a place to “defer decisions” about whether or not to discard old or broken items. Now Emma and Mrs. Ames were making decisions about items that had been adding up over the last four decades. The burlap sacks, if they were still sound, went into a “recycle” pile. In addition to being useful for carrying things, they had fascinating logos of long-disappeared companies printed on them in faded reds and blues. Someone would be sure to use them again.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Near the back of the barn, where dust specks danced in shafts of light, Emma saw an old canvas tarp. Lifting the heavy cloth revealed a bicycle. It was very rusty and had rotten, cracked tires. Apparently, this was one of those "deferred decisions” of which Mrs. Ames had spoken. Well, Emma thought, this clearly goes out on the junk heap.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Still, she thought, someone had once cared enough for this wreck to cover it with a tarp. Emma studied the ruin and shook her head. It was nothing like the bike <em>she</em> wanted.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;No, it was as different as it could be from the bike of her dreams. Instead of a straight bar of metal tubing across the center, this old bike featured a flowing, curved center with scalloped indentations. Emma took an old burlap sack and brushed at the metal for a bit to reveal midnight blue paint that seemed darker because of the shadowy recess of the barn. Against the background was a bright star with a trailing tail. The word “Comet” was emblazoned across it, its letters slightly trailing to indicate speed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="100%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyilvwllw/image/upload/v1767484736/lof7sxshvuyrkvu6qjf3.png" alt="V_SE05_RC_13">


        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Emma stepped back to look at the bike again. It had a full fender over the back tire and a half fender over the front. A thick metal guard covered the chain. There was something about it... something that stuck with Emma and reminded her of... of the antique cars she had seen in the downtown parade one year. The flowing fenders, the curved fins on the back—it all fit. It was a wreck, Emma thought, but it was no piece of junk: it was a classic—an antique. Emma stared at the bike, trying to imagine the bike when it was new. She smiled and nodded.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh, you found my bike!” said Mrs. Ames, interrupting Emma's daydream. “That certainly brings back some memories.”</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“How old is it?” Emma asked.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Younger than I am!” Mrs. Ames said, chuckling. “I bought the bicycle with ‘egg money’, money I made by selling eggs. I used to walk into town, carrying that basket to sell them,” she said pointing to the bike. “Later, I put it on the bike and rode to town with the eggs in it.”</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Was ‘Comet’ a fancy brand name back then?”</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“No. I stenciled that on there myself. You see, there was a comet that year—1948—that was very special. No one knew it was there until we had a solar eclipse. Then everyone could see the comet next to the sun. That’s when I named my bicycle Comet. It seemed like I was traveling as fast as a comet when I went flying into town with those eggs. The funny thing is I never broke one either! Later, I even had a paper route. That basket could actually hold 72 copies of the afternoon paper—if they were folded properly:”</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Mrs. Ames ... your bike ...it’s not like any other bike I've ever seen. I know you still love your bike.” Emma hesitated and then asked tentatively, “Would you consider giving me your bike instead of paying me for helping you?”</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Are you sure you would want this bike? It’s nothing like the bike you told me you wanted.”</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“I can see that this bike is special, Mrs. Ames, and I’m sure I can fix it up. It just needs a couple of new tires, a drop or two of oil on the chain, and a little polishing.”</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh, I don't know. It might need a new horn, too,” said Mrs. Ames, reaching out and honking the old one. Instead of a hearty squeak, the horn let out a tired sigh. “You have yourself a deal, Emma.”</p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Emma beamed as she wheeled the bike into the light. She could really see it now: the gleaming midnight blue Comet flying down the streets. It would be just the thing for getting to school or soccer practice—or even delivering papers.</p>

        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Younger than I am!” Mrs. Ames said, chuckling. “I bought the bicycle with ‘egg money’, money I made by selling eggs. I used to walk into town, carrying that basket to sell them,” she said pointing to the bike. “Later, I put it on the bike and rode to town with the eggs in it.”</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Was ‘Comet’ a fancy brand name back then?”</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“No. I stenciled that on there myself. You see, there was a comet that year—1948—that was very special. No one knew it was there until we had a solar eclipse. Then everyone could see the comet next to the sun. That’s when I named my bicycle Comet. It seemed like I was traveling as fast as a comet when I went flying into town with those eggs. The funny thing is I never broke one either! Later, I even had a paper route. That basket could actually hold 72 copies of the afternoon paper—if they were folded properly:”</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Mrs. Ames ... your bike ...it’s not like any other bike I've ever seen. I know you still love your bike.” Emma hesitated and then asked tentatively, “Would you consider giving me your bike instead of paying me for helping you?”</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Are you sure you would want this bike? It’s nothing like the bike you told me you wanted.”</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“I can see that this bike is special, Mrs. Ames, and I’m sure I can fix it up. It just needs a couple of new tires, a drop or two of oil on the chain, and a little polishing.”</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh, I don't know. It might need a new horn, too,” said Mrs. Ames, reaching out and honking the old one. Instead of a hearty squeak, the horn let out a tired sigh. “You have yourself a deal, Emma.”</p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Emma beamed as she wheeled the bike into the light. She could really see it now: the gleaming midnight blue Comet flying down the streets. It would be just the thing for getting to school or soccer practice—or even delivering papers.</p>

          <strong>Recycled Bicycle</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; “When you finish in that corner, would you come help me over here, Emma?”</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Sure thing, Mrs. Ames.” Emma said cheerfully. Emma was helping her neighbor clean the small barn behind her house. Mrs. Ames had grown up in the farmhouse that was still her home, and the city had grown up around the house. The barn was a reminder that the neighborhood used to be farmland.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“What do you want me to do with the bales of hay?” Emma asked.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“They will be good mulch around all those tomato plants I'm going to grow,” said Mrs. Ames. “Please leave them right there.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Emma smiled. Mrs. Ames had her dream, and Emma had hers. She had been working to save money to buy a new bike and dreamed of riding to school in the mornings and to soccer practice in the afternoons. She knew just which bike she wanted too: a gleaming, candy-apple red, ten-speed bike with cast aluminum rims and racing tires. It had to have racing tires.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Emma carefully sorted the debris. Mrs. Ames had commented that for the past forty years, the barn had been a place to “defer decisions” about whether or not to discard old or broken items. Now Emma and Mrs. Ames were making decisions about items that had been adding up over the last four decades. The burlap sacks, if they were still sound, went into a “recycle” pile. In addition to being useful for carrying things, they had fascinating logos of long-disappeared companies printed on them in faded reds and blues. Someone would be sure to use them again.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Near the back of the barn, where dust specks danced in shafts of light, Emma saw an old canvas tarp. Lifting the heavy cloth revealed a bicycle. It was very rusty and had rotten, cracked tires. Apparently, this was one of those "deferred decisions” of which Mrs. Ames had spoken. Well, Emma thought, this clearly goes out on the junk heap.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Still, she thought, someone had once cared enough for this wreck to cover it with a tarp. Emma studied the ruin and shook her head. It was nothing like the bike <em>she</em> wanted.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;No, it was as different as it could be from the bike of her dreams. Instead of a straight bar of metal tubing across the center, this old bike featured a flowing, curved center with scalloped indentations. Emma took an old burlap sack and brushed at the metal for a bit to reveal midnight blue paint that seemed darker because of the shadowy recess of the barn. Against the background was a bright star with a trailing tail. The word “Comet” was emblazoned across it, its letters slightly trailing to indicate speed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
                  <img width="100%" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dmgrgrhfu/image/upload/v1767446673/aiipvxovntsckciceqyh.png" alt="V_SE05_RC_13">


        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Emma stepped back to look at the bike again. It had a full fender over the back tire and a half fender over the front. A thick metal guard covered the chain. There was something about it... something that stuck with Emma and reminded her of... of the antique cars she had seen in the downtown parade one year. The flowing fenders, the curved fins on the back—it all fit. It was a wreck, Emma thought, but it was no piece of junk: it was a classic—an antique. Emma stared at the bike, trying to imagine the bike when it was new. She smiled and nodded.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh, you found my bike!” said Mrs. Ames, interrupting Emma's daydream. “That certainly brings back some memories.”</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“How old is it?” Emma asked.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Younger than I am!” Mrs. Ames said, chuckling. “I bought the bicycle with ‘egg money’, money I made by selling eggs. I used to walk into town, carrying that basket to sell them,” she said pointing to the bike. “Later, I put it on the bike and rode to town with the eggs in it.”</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Was ‘Comet’ a fancy brand name back then?”</p>

        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“I can see that this bike is special, Mrs. Ames, and I’m sure I can fix it up. It just needs a couple of new tires, a drop or two of oil on the chain, and a little polishing.”</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh, I don't know. It might need a new horn, too,” said Mrs. Ames, reaching out and honking the old one. Instead of a hearty squeak, the horn let out a tired sigh. “You have yourself a deal, Emma.”</p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Emma beamed as she wheeled the bike into the light. She could really see it now: the gleaming midnight blue Comet flying down the streets. It would be just the thing for getting to school or soccer practice—or even delivering papers.</p>

          <strong>Recycled Bicycle</strong>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>1&nbsp; &nbsp; “When you finish in that corner, would you come help me over here, Emma?”</p>
        <p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Sure thing, Mrs. Ames.” Emma said cheerfully. Emma was helping her neighbor clean the small barn behind her house. Mrs. Ames had grown up in the farmhouse that was still her home, and the city had grown up around the house. The barn was a reminder that the neighborhood used to be farmland.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“What do you want me to do with the bales of hay?” Emma asked.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“They will be good mulch around all those tomato plants I'm going to grow,” said Mrs. Ames. “Please leave them right there.”</p>
        <p>5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Emma smiled. Mrs. Ames had her dream, and Emma had hers. She had been working to save money to buy a new bike and dreamed of riding to school in the mornings and to soccer practice in the afternoons. She knew just which bike she wanted too: a gleaming, candy-apple red, ten-speed bike with cast aluminum rims and racing tires. It had to have racing tires.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Emma carefully sorted the debris. Mrs. Ames had commented that for the past forty years, the barn had been a place to “defer decisions” about whether or not to discard old or broken items. Now Emma and Mrs. Ames were making decisions about items that had been adding up over the last four decades. The burlap sacks, if they were still sound, went into a “recycle” pile. In addition to being useful for carrying things, they had fascinating logos of long-disappeared companies printed on them in faded reds and blues. Someone would be sure to use them again.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Near the back of the barn, where dust specks danced in shafts of light, Emma saw an old canvas tarp. Lifting the heavy cloth revealed a bicycle. It was very rusty and had rotten, cracked tires. Apparently, this was one of those "deferred decisions” of which Mrs. Ames had spoken. Well, Emma thought, this clearly goes out on the junk heap.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Still, she thought, someone had once cared enough for this wreck to cover it with a tarp. Emma studied the ruin and shook her head. It was nothing like the bike <em>she</em> wanted.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;No, it was as different as it could be from the bike of her dreams. Instead of a straight bar of metal tubing across the center, this old bike featured a flowing, curved center with scalloped indentations. Emma took an old burlap sack and brushed at the metal for a bit to reveal midnight blue paint that seemed darker because of the shadowy recess of the barn. Against the background was a bright star with a trailing tail. The word “Comet” was emblazoned across it, its letters slightly trailing to indicate speed.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>10&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Emma stepped back to look at the bike again. It had a full fender over the back tire and a half fender over the front. A thick metal guard covered the chain. There was something about it... something that stuck with Emma and reminded her of... of the antique cars she had seen in the downtown parade one year. The flowing fenders, the curved fins on the back—it all fit. It was a wreck, Emma thought, but it was no piece of junk: it was a classic—an antique. Emma stared at the bike, trying to imagine the bike when it was new. She smiled and nodded.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh, you found my bike!” said Mrs. Ames, interrupting Emma's daydream. “That certainly brings back some memories.”</p>
        <p>12&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“How old is it?” Emma asked.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Younger than I am!” Mrs. Ames said, chuckling. “I bought the bicycle with ‘egg money’, money I made by selling eggs. I used to walk into town, carrying that basket to sell them,” she said pointing to the bike. “Later, I put it on the bike and rode to town with the eggs in it.”</p>
        <p>14&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Was ‘Comet’ a fancy brand name back then?”</p>
        <p>15&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“No. I stenciled that on there myself. You see, there was a comet that year—1948—that was very special. No one knew it was there until we had a solar eclipse. Then everyone could see the comet next to the sun. That’s when I named my bicycle Comet. It seemed like I was traveling as fast as a comet when I went flying into town with those eggs. The funny thing is I never broke one either! Later, I even had a paper route. That basket could actually hold 72 copies of the afternoon paper—if they were folded properly:”</p>
        <p>16&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Mrs. Ames ... your bike ...it’s not like any other bike I've ever seen. I know you still love your bike.” Emma hesitated and then asked tentatively, “Would you consider giving me your bike instead of paying me for helping you?”</p>
        <p>17&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Are you sure you would want this bike? It’s nothing like the bike you told me you wanted.”</p>
        <p>18&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“I can see that this bike is special, Mrs. Ames, and I’m sure I can fix it up. It just needs a couple of new tires, a drop or two of oil on the chain, and a little polishing.”</p>
        <p>19&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh, I don't know. It might need a new horn, too,” said Mrs. Ames, reaching out and honking the old one. Instead of a hearty squeak, the horn let out a tired sigh. “You have yourself a deal, Emma.”</p>
        <p>20&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Emma beamed as she wheeled the bike into the light. She could really see it now: the gleaming midnight blue Comet flying down the streets. It would be just the thing for getting to school or soccer practice—or even delivering papers.</p>
