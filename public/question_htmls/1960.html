<p>Most people around the world have heard of Disney but people may not know about who Walt Disney was as a man and all of his fantastic achievements. Walter Elias Disney was born on 5<sup>th</sup> December 1901, in Chicago, USA. He was a motion picture and television producer as well as a pioneer of cartoon films. He created the extraordinarily famous cartoon character, Mickey Mouse and was the founder of the thrilling and family fun theme parks, Disneyland and Disney World.<br>
<br>
On 15<sup>th</sup> December 1966, Disney sadly died from lung cancer. Soon after his death, a very bizarre rumour began spreading that Disney’s body was frozen and buried beneath the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland California. It was thought that somehow when medical technology was advanced enough, he could be brought back to life. Disney’s daughter, Diane, has stated that this is definitely just a rumour but can anyone really be sure?<br>

Disney and his brother, Roy founded The Walt Disney Studios after working at Kansas City Film Ad Company. During his time working at the ad company, he made cut out animated commercials and started playing around with hand drawn animation using cameras. This really sparked his interest in animation and led to him opening up his own studio.<br>
<br>
In the late 1920s, the cartoons featuring Mickey Mouse and his friends were created. The first successful film starring the lovable Mickey Mouse was called Steamboat Willie. It’s hard to imagine now, with all the technology we have today, but at the time, sound was only just beginning to be available in films. Walt Disney voiced Mickey Mouse and the character was drawn by Ub Iwerks, the chief animator at the studio. Steamboat Willie and Mickey Mouse were an immediate hit with the general public. This was the start of the popularity of the enthusiastic, little mouse whom we still love today.<br>

During the time that Disney was alive, he produced more than 100 feature films. His first full-length animated film premiered in 1937 and that film was Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. It was so unbelievably successful that it generated $1.499 million. That was a huge amount of money in those days and an even greater achievement because it was during the Great Depression. The Great Depression (1929-1939) was the worst economic crisis in the history of the industrialised world. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs also won eight Oscars, which are awards for artistic and technical excellence in the film industry.</p>

<p>This immense success motivated The Walt Disney Studios to keep producing full-length films. In 1964, Walt Disney’s final masterpiece was the motion picture Mary Poppins. He produced it by himself and it was a mix of live action and animation. Since his death in 1966, The Walt Disney Studios has produced a massive number of entertaining and very iconic films and television shows. There are simply too many to mention here!<br>

At the multiple Disney Resorts, families can stay in variety of Disney themed hotel rooms, villas, bungalows and even camp, to have the ultimate, unforgettable Disney experience.<br>

<p>Most people around the world have heard of Disney but people may not know about who Walt Disney was as a man and all of his fantastic achievements. Walter Elias Disney was born on 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;December 1901, in Chicago, USA. He was a motion picture and television producer as well as a pioneer of cartoon films. He created the extraordinarily famous cartoon character, Mickey Mouse and was the founder of the thrilling and family fun theme parks, Disneyland and Disney World.<br>
<br>
On 15<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;December 1966, Disney sadly died from lung cancer. Soon after his death, a very bizarre rumour began spreading that Disney’s body was frozen and buried beneath the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland California. It was thought that somehow when medical technology was advanced enough, he could be brought back to life. Disney’s daughter, Diane, has stated that this is definitely just a rumour but can anyone really be sure?<br>
&nbsp;<br>

Disney and his brother, Roy founded The Walt Disney Studios after working at Kansas City Film Ad Company. During his time working at the ad company, he made cut out animated commercials and started playing around with hand drawn animation using cameras. This really sparked his interest in animation and led to him opening up his own studio.<br>
<br>
In the late 1920s, the cartoons featuring Mickey Mouse and his friends were created. The first successful film starring the lovable Mickey Mouse was called Steamboat Willie. It’s hard to imagine now, with all the technology we have today, but at the time, sound was only just beginning to be available in films. Walt Disney voiced Mickey Mouse and the character was drawn by Ub Iwerks, the chief animator at the studio. Steamboat Willie and Mickey Mouse were an immediate hit with the general public. This was the start of the popularity of the enthusiastic, little mouse whom we still love today.<br>

During the time that Disney was alive, he produced more than 100 feature films. His first full-length animated film premiered in 1937 and that film was Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. It was so unbelievably successful that it generated $1.499 million. That was a huge amount of money in those days and an even greater achievement because it was during the Great Depression. The Great Depression (1929-1939) was the worst economic crisis in the history of the industrialised world. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs also won eight Oscars, which are awards for artistic and technical excellence in the film industry.</p>

<p>This immense success motivated The Walt Disney Studios to keep producing full-length films. In 1964, Walt Disney’s final masterpiece was the motion picture Mary Poppins. He produced it by himself and it was a mix of live action and animation. Since his death in 1966, The Walt Disney Studios has produced a massive number of entertaining and very iconic films and television shows. There are simply too many to mention here!<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
In 1955, in California, USA, Disney opened its first, fantastic, family friendly theme park called Disneyland. The land was once an orange grove and was transformed into a world of wonder, excitement and where dreams come true. Disneyland soon had a reputation as the ultimate family destination. Children and adults alike could enjoy the food, rides and meet the all-important and special Disney characters. The theme park was very profitable and tourists were swiftly coming from all over the world. Disneyland theme parks are now located in Orlando, Florida, Tokyo, Paris, Hong Kong and Shanghai. There are now several Disney Worlds and Disney Resorts. At the multiple Disney Resorts, families can stay in variety of Disney themed hotel rooms, villas, bungalows and even camp, to have the ultimate, unforgettable Disney experience.<br>

Miscommunication happens often enough face to face. But it happens far more frequently over text messages.<br>
<br>
Alice was texting back and forth with her friend when suddenly she went silent after a simple question. In the middle of a meeting, John received a three-page text message from his wife. Sandy accidently sent a personal text message to the wrong person causing a series of awkward responses. All of these misunderstandings could be avoided by following a few simple guidelines.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Here are the top texting rules: Know your audience. Double check everything. Text alone. Texting is casual conversation only, not serious. Always respond, but don’t open a text message unless you intend to respond immediately. Know the difference between useful and non-useful texting. Remember that pictures are not secure and don’t presume that texting is confidential.<br>
<br>

In 2021, buying the best phone means looking for something that should last you a few years. Smartphones’ upgrade cycles are slowing down for a reason. Even at lower prices, it’s getting harder and harder to buy a lemon. In other words, you don’t have to spend a huge amount to get something great, as a bunch of great smartphones are available for around $800.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
It’s harder than ever to decide between everything in that range, but for most people, our pick for the best phone is the Apple iPhone 12. Luckily, if you’re looking for a nocompromise smartphone at any price, the choices over a thousand dollars are much clearer. If you like Android, the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra is incredibly good. And if you want to get the best smartphone on a budget, you can find something really good for under $500 or even under $400.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
By texting less and calling more, I was reminded that people are always nicer on the phone than on text. Face to face they are even nicer than that. Arguments are resolved more quickly. But talking on the phone scares people. Technology has created a new rigidity when it comes to conversation. Calling is usually planned and scheduled. I still text all the time. But I am calling more too. I am back in the habit, and for me, it is infinitely more satisfying to have a conversation that is two sided and flexible and unpredictable. No device will be ever able to replace personal conversation.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Should a young child have a mobile? Most mobiles offer almost complete access to the internet and are much harder to filter and control than your home computer. A mobile also gives the outside world, including undesirables, another way to communicate with a child.&nbsp;<br>

Mobiles also put your child at risk for getting in trouble if limits aren’t in place. Or a child might make prank calls or be blamed for them if a classmate takes their phone and uses it to make inappropriate calls.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Whether or not your child is ready for or needs a mobile is something you will have to decide for yourself. Make sure that your child can handle the responsibility for a mobile before you buy one. When getting your younger child, a mobile, consider putting some limits in place.&nbsp;<br>

Miscommunication happens often enough face to face. But it happens far more frequently over text messages.<br>

Alice was texting back and forth with her friend when suddenly she went silent after a simple question. In the middle of a meeting, John received a three-page text message from his wife. Sandy accidently sent a personal text message to the wrong person causing a series of awkward responses. All of these misunderstandings could be avoided by following a few simple guidelines.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Here are the top texting rules: Know your audience. Double check everything. Text alone. Texting is casual conversation only, not serious. Always respond, but don’t open a text message unless you intend to respond immediately. Know the difference between useful and non-useful texting. Remember that pictures are not secure and don’t presume that texting is confidential.<br>

In 2021, buying the best phone means looking for something that should last you a few years. Smartphones’ upgrade cycles are slowing down for a reason. Even at lower prices, it’s getting harder and harder to buy a lemon. In other words, you don’t have to spend a huge amount to get something great, as a bunch of great smartphones are available for around $800.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
It’s harder than ever to decide between everything in that range, but for most people, our pick for the best phone is the Apple iPhone 12. Luckily, if you’re looking for a nocompromise smartphone at any price, the choices over a thousand dollars are much clearer. If you like Android, the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra is incredibly good. And if you want to get the best smartphone on a budget, you can find something really good for under $500 or even under $400.<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
By texting less and calling more, I was reminded that people are always nicer on the phone than on text. Face to face they are even nicer than that. Arguments are resolved more quickly. But talking on the phone scares people. Technology has created a new rigidity when it comes to conversation. Calling is usually planned and scheduled. I still text all the time. But I am calling more too. I am back in the habit, and for me, it is infinitely more satisfying to have a conversation that is two sided and flexible and unpredictable. No device will be ever able to replace personal conversation.&nbsp;<br>

Miscommunication happens often enough face to face. But it happens far more frequently over text messages.<br>
<br>
Alice was texting back and forth with her friend when suddenly she went silent after a simple question. In the middle of a meeting, John received a three-page text message from his wife. Sandy accidently sent a personal text message to the wrong person causing a series of awkward responses. All of these misunderstandings could be avoided by following a few simple guidelines.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Here are the top texting rules: Know your audience. Double check everything. Text alone. Texting is casual conversation only, not serious. Always respond, but don’t open a text message unless you intend to respond immediately. Know the difference between useful and non-useful texting. Remember that pictures are not secure and don’t presume that texting is confidential.<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract B</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
In 2021, buying the best phone means looking for something that should last you a few years. Smartphones’ upgrade cycles are slowing down for a reason. Even at lower prices, it’s getting harder and harder to buy a lemon. In other words, you don’t have to spend a huge amount to get something great, as a bunch of great smartphones are available for around $800.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
It’s harder than ever to decide between everything in that range, but for most people, our pick for the best phone is the Apple iPhone 12. Luckily, if you’re looking for a nocompromise smartphone at any price, the choices over a thousand dollars are much clearer. If you like Android, the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra is incredibly good. And if you want to get the best smartphone on a budget, you can find something really good for under $500 or even under $400.<br>
<br>
{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract C</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
By texting less and calling more, I was reminded that people are always nicer on the phone than on text. Face to face they are even nicer than that. Arguments are resolved more quickly. But talking on the phone scares people. Technology has created a new rigidity when it comes to conversation. Calling is usually planned and scheduled. I still text all the time. But I am calling more too. I am back in the habit, and for me, it is infinitely more satisfying to have a conversation that is two sided and flexible and unpredictable. No device will be ever able to replace personal conversation.&nbsp;<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
Should a young child have a mobile? Most mobiles offer almost complete access to the internet and are much harder to filter and control than your home computer. A mobile also gives the outside world, including undesirables, another way to communicate with a child.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Mobiles also put your child at risk for getting in trouble if limits aren’t in place. Or a child might make prank calls or be blamed for them if a classmate takes their phone and uses it to make inappropriate calls.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Whether or not your child is ready for or needs a mobile is something you will have to decide for yourself. Make sure that your child can handle the responsibility for a mobile before you buy one. When getting your younger child, a mobile, consider putting some limits in place.&nbsp;<br>
