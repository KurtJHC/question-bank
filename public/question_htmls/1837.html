          <strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Elvis Presley</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Elvis Aaron Presley was born to Vernon and Gladys Presley in a two-room house in Tupelo, Mississippi, on January 8, 1935. His twin brother, Jessie Garon, was stillborn, leaving Elvis to grow up as an only child. On Elvis' eleventh birthday, his parents bought him a guitar. With the help of his uncle Johnny (Smith) and pastor Frank Smith of the Assembly of God Church, which the Presleys were now attending, he learned some basic cords. However, while Elvis did play rhythm in the 1950's he never progressed further as a guitar player. <strong>15</strong> ………… .&nbsp; When you have a voice as good as Elvis Presley's, you are not motivated to learn more, instead he concentrated on improving his voice to get it where he wanted, to be able to sing the bigger songs like ‘Are You Lonesome Tonight?’, ‘It's Now Or Never’, both from 1960, and songs such as ‘My Way’ in the 1970s, just to name a few.</p>
        <p>Elvis and his parents moved to Memphis, Tennessee, in 1948. Elvis graduated from Humes High School there in 1953. Elvis' musical influences were the pop and country music of the time, the gospel music he heard in church, the all-night gospel events he frequently attended, and the black R&amp;B he absorbed on historic Beale Street as a Memphis teenager. In 1954, Elvis began his singing career with the legendary Sun Records label in Memphis. In late 1955, his recording contract was sold to RCA Victor. &nbsp;<strong>16</strong> ………… .</p>
        <p>Elvis had a sound and style that uniquely combined diverse musical influences and blurred and challenged the social and racial barriers of the time. <strong>17</strong> ………… .&nbsp; Elvis Presley's dynamic life story from his humble beginnings through his rise to stardom is a fascinating journey. It has earned Elvis his still undefeated title of the 'King of Rock 'N Roll'.</p>
        <p>His songs are unforgettable - they have stood the test of time, especially his singles of the 1950s, a decade in which he had a song at No. 1. for a full 6 months of a year. An even more incredible statistic is Elvis only started at RCA in January of 1956. <strong>18</strong> ………… .&nbsp; A testament to his incredible break-through is the fact that he managed to sell twice as many records in the entire decade of the 1950s (with only two years of recording) than any other performer at that time. (There were also the SUN years 1954-1955 but these were not huge for record sales, like when he became a national sensation in 1956).</p>
        <p><strong>19</strong> ………… .&nbsp; Who could know what the next one would be like? Elvis liberally altered his style to suit each song. There were the early country-boy rockabillies sung in a breathless high pitch, of which ‘My Baby Left Me’, ‘Milkcow Blues Boogie’ and ‘Money Honey’ are examples. His more mature, aggressive rock 'n' roll stance came out with songs such as ‘Blue Suede Shoes’, ‘One Night’ and ‘A Big Hunk O' Love’. His approach to ballads ranged from the ethereal vocal effects on the guitar-tapping version of ‘Blue Moon’ to smooth crooning on ‘As Long As I Have You’, ‘Can't Help Falling In Love’ and many other slow numbers and movie songs.</p>
        <p>Elvis Presley died of heart failure at his home, ‘Graceland’ in Memphis, Tennessee on August 16, 1977. He was 42 years old. Elvis starred in 33 movies, made history with his television appearances and live concert performances on tour and in Las Vegas. Globally, he has sold over one billion records, more than any other artist had ever done. His American sales have earned him gold, platinum or multi-platinum awards for 131 different albums and singles, far more than any other artist. Among his many awards were 14 Grammy nominations (3 wins) from the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences, the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, which he received at age 36. <strong>20 </strong>………… . Known the world over by his first name, he is regarded as one of the most important figures of twentieth century popular culture.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>An elephant’s nose is like a human or another animal’s nose. It can be used for breathing and for smelling things. But it is quite unique. It can be used to help the elephant drink water. It can also be used for making sounds, which can trumpet loudly. Now, this is the thing; it can also be used like a human arm to grab things, like a branch with leaves it wants to eat. It has about 40 000 muscles in it. And it has two fingerlike features on the end of the trunk that can be used to grab small items.</p>
        <p><strong>Angie</strong>:&nbsp; “Wow! I never knew that. An elephant sucks water down its nose into its body.”</p>
