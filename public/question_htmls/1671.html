          <strong>Extract A</strong>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Holden Equinox</strong>: While the Holden Equinox was a comparatively late entrant into the medium-sized SUV market, it has quickly established itself as one of the very best.</p>
        <p>Boasting a massive goodie bag of features, including a 7-inch touchscreen, active noise cancellation, 17-inch alloy wheels, a reversing camera, and automatic headlights, the Equinox is certainly top of its class when it comes to kit.</p>
        <p>In terms of on-road performance, the Equinox fares equally well, offering a comfortable ride with a ton of storage space, highlighted by an engine that delivers a stunning 188kW of power – far more than any of its competitors. Of course, this added power doesn’t compromise the safety or practicality you would expect from a top of the line medium-sized SUV.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Extract B</strong>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Hyundai Tucson</strong>: The Hyundai Tucson has everything that you would expect from a high-quality medium-sized SUV – comfort, safety, an eye-catching design, and a long list of features.</p>
        <p>However, what really sets it apart from competitors is its on-road performance, offering a smooth, comfortable ride unmatched by any other opponents, highlighted by top-notch suspension, a refined engine, and reliable steering.</p>
        <p>In terms of safety, the Tucson is also a winner, delivering six airbags (including dual front airbags), as well as front-side and full-length curtain airbags, and electronic stability control. Partner this with an extremely spacious boot and&nbsp;ISOFIX&nbsp;anchor points, and the Hyundai Tucson is sure to appeal to parents.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Extract C</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Mitsubishi Outlander: If you’re lucky enough to land in an Outlander, you’ll quickly see why this roomy SUV has been making waves. The Mitsubishi Outlander is equipped with 7 seats – a rare sight among its closest competitors in the medium-sized SUV market, exceeding expectancies of what a medium-sized SUV is often presumed to be. This makes for an extremely spacious interior, and no lack of storage room.</p>
        <p>Also setting it apart from other medium-sized SUVs, the Outlander features a turbo-diesel engine, which makes for a refined and effortless driving experience. Between the seven seats and the diesel engine, the Mitsubishi Outlander is in a class all of its own when it comes to medium-sized SUVs. Pair this with a solid entertainment system, a standard list of safety features and an intuitive design, and the Mitsubishi Outlander is a real standout!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Extract D</strong>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Mazda CX-9</strong>: The Mazda CX-9 is a large SUV loaded with a little luxury. Upon entering the CX-9, you could be forgiven for mistaking it for a smaller, flashier model. Mazda obviously don’t believe in trading size for comfort, with the large CX-9 featuring an elegant leather steering wheel, paired with black cloth seat covers, which round out an exceptionally well-designed interior. Really, there are little touches of class wherever you look.</p>
        <p>The CX-9 also knocks it out of the park when it comes to safety beating all of its competitors, including a rear-view camera, blind-spot monitoring, autonomous braking in case of emergency, ISOFIX connection points, rear sensors for parking, and six airbags.</p>

          <strong>Extract A</strong>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Holden Equinox</strong>: While the Holden Equinox was a comparatively late entrant into the medium-sized SUV market, it has quickly established itself as one of the very best.</p>
        <p>Boasting a massive goodie bag of features, including a 7-inch touchscreen, active noise cancellation, 17-inch alloy wheels, a reversing camera, and automatic headlights, the Equinox is certainly top of its class when it comes to kit.</p>
        <p>In terms of on-road performance, the Equinox fares equally well, offering a comfortable ride with a ton of storage space, highlighted by an engine that delivers a stunning 188kW of power – far more than any of its competitors. Of course, this added power doesn’t compromise the safety or practicality you would expect from a top of the line medium-sized SUV.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Extract B</strong>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Hyundai Tucson</strong>: The Hyundai Tucson has everything that you would expect from a high-quality medium-sized SUV – comfort, safety, an eye-catching design, and a long list of features.</p>
        <p>However, what really sets it apart from competitors is its on-road performance, offering a smooth, comfortable ride unmatched by any other opponents, highlighted by top-notch suspension, a refined engine, and reliable steering.</p>
        <p>In terms of safety, the Tucson is also a winner, delivering six airbags (including dual front airbags), as well as front-side and full-length curtain airbags, and electronic stability control. Partner this with an extremely spacious boot and&nbsp;ISOFIX&nbsp;anchor points, and the Hyundai Tucson is sure to appeal to parents.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Extract C</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Mitsubishi Outlander: If you’re lucky enough to land in an Outlander, you’ll quickly see why this roomy SUV has been making waves. The Mitsubishi Outlander is equipped with 7 seats – a rare sight among its closest competitors in the medium-sized SUV market, exceeding expectancies of what a medium-sized SUV is often presumed to be. This makes for an extremely spacious interior, and no lack of storage room.</p>
        <p>Also setting it apart from other medium-sized SUVs, the Outlander features a turbo-diesel engine, which makes for a refined and effortless driving experience. Between the seven seats and the diesel engine, the Mitsubishi Outlander is in a class all of its own when it comes to medium-sized SUVs. Pair this with a solid entertainment system, a standard list of safety features and an intuitive design, and the Mitsubishi Outlander is a real standout!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Extract D</strong>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Mazda CX-9</strong>: The Mazda CX-9 is a large SUV loaded with a little luxury. Upon entering the CX-9, you could be forgiven for mistaking it for a smaller, flashier model. Mazda obviously don’t believe in trading size for comfort, with the large CX-9 featuring an elegant leather steering wheel, paired with black cloth seat covers, which round out an exceptionally well-designed interior. Really, there are little touches of class wherever you look.</p>
        <p>The CX-9 also knocks it out of the park when it comes to safety beating all of its competitors, including a rear-view camera, blind-spot monitoring, autonomous braking in case of emergency, ISOFIX connection points, rear sensors for parking, and six airbags.</p>

They move slowly downward from the pull of gravity. Most of the world’s glaciers exist in the polar regions, in areas like Greenland, the Canadian Arctic, and Antarctica. Glaciers can also be found closer to the Equator in some mountain regions. The Andes Mountain range in South America contains some of the world’s largest tropical glaciers. About 2 percent of all the water on Earth is frozen in glaciers.</div>
