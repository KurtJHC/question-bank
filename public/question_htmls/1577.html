        <p>{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract A</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
"The Martian" film about an astronaut surviving on the desolate planet, Mars, is at heart a shipwreck story, one that just happens to take the form of a science fiction adventure. But although the outline offers no surprises, the details and the tone feel new. Like all the variants of "Robinson Crusoe" films —including "Cast Away" and, of course, "Robinson Crusoe on Mars"—this film is about a man, Mark Watney (Matt Damon), who summons all of his ingenuity and courage to endure a seemingly impossible situation. He must then deal with loneliness on top of it all. If you've ever seen a film, you know going in that things are going to turn out fine for Mark—that no studio is going to pay for a special effects driven epic about a smart, likable castaway who dies in the last five minutes. You also know that, despite the Lone Man Against Nature plot line, there's a reason why the filmmakers cast Oscar nominee Jessica Chastain as the captain of the mission that's forced to abort its exploration of the planet's surface and leave Mark for dead—and it wasn't so that she could turn tail and head for Earth with her crew in the first ten minutes and never return. You also know that, despite the heated discussions back on earth of how risky, time consuming and expensive a rescue mission would be, NASA will still have to stage one, and that any objections will be waved off in the name of doing what's right.<br>

There’s no way around it - due to their orbits, Mars and the Earth have to stop communicating with each other for about two weeks every two years. This quiet period is called solar conjunction, and for the Perseverance team that means we can’t send new instructions to the rover between sols 217-235 (Sept. 28 – Oct. 17, 2021). We’ve already sent the discovery vehicle, Rover a set of commands so it can perform science activities without posing a risk to the Rover’s safety, and the team won’t need to check that they were successfully completed each day. In my role on the science team as a Long-Term Planner, I work on the strategic plan for what the rover will do in the next days, weeks and months. Lately, that includes experiments that can be repeated before and after the conjunction break, which are unique opportunities to monitor longer-term changes to the rocks and soils around the Rover. To look for differences in the terrain due to the wind, sand and dust, we will take a 360-degree view with Navcam on sol 214, and on sol 236.<br>

No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man’s and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their business, they were scrutinised and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise bugs that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacency men went to and fro over the Earth, serene in their assurance of their control over all matter. No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources of human danger, nor thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable. It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of those departed days. At most, men fancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to welcome a human enterprise. Yet across the gulf of space, minds - that are to our minds as ours are to those of animals; intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic - regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us. And early in the twentieth century came the great disaster.<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
At one time, astronomers believed the surface of Mars was crisscrossed by canal systems of water. This in turn gave rise to speculation that Mars was very much like Earth, capable of supporting life and home to a native civilisation. But as human satellites and rovers began to conduct flybys and surveys of the planet, this vision of Mars quickly dissolved, replaced by one in which the Red Planet was a cold and lifeless world. However, over the past few decades, scientists have learned a great deal about the history of Mars that has altered this view. We now know that Mars may currently be very cold, very dry, and very inhospitable, but this wasn't always the case. Earth is almost twice the diameter of Mars. If Earth were the size of a baseball, Mars would be the size of a ping-pong ball. Nearly 70 percent of Earth is covered with liquid water; Mars has none. The sun warms Earth's surface to more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit. On Mars the temperature rarely surpasses the freezing mark. Yet in many ways, Mars is more like Earth than any other planet in the solar system. Both have valleys and mountains, weather and seasons, and volcanoes and ice caps. At 24 hours and 39 minutes, the Martian day is only a little bit longer than Earth's. And although dry today, Mars may at one time have had enough liquid water to support primitive forms of life.<br>

      <div class="col-6"><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>My Childhood</strong><br><br><em>by Rebecca Priestley</em><br><br>
&nbsp;I started school in London. As a newly single mother with two pre-school children, my mother, Ruth, had embraced the freedoms of the 1970s, and had taken us to live in London for six months where she took sculpture and dance classes and sold hand-painted and embroidered clothes to north London boutiques. When we returned to our rented house on a hillside acre in the ‘semi-rural’ suburb of Korokoro in Wellington, a young family were living in one room of the house: Jane and Paul and baby Toby.<br>
&nbsp;
<p><span class="txt-underline">&nbsp;<strong>‘This is <em>our</em> house,’</strong></span> I proclaimed as they greeted us at the door. My hostility was short-lived—it was fun having a baby around and soon sharing a house with another family was what we did. We had returned to New Zealand in summer, but it was months before Rachel and I would venture further than the rectangle of cracked concrete outside the back door, the size of our London backyard. Once I was confident in our expanse of garden I would run from the house, past an enormous veggie patch, past an enormous kōwhai tree that always bloomed in time for Rachel’s birthday, past a high bank crawling with banana passionfruit and topped by damson trees. At the end of the garden, next to a line of trees that marked the next-door boundary, was an old wooden shed. If you dared look inside, you could see—through the darkness and the ubiquitous spiders’ webs—dead seagulls hanging from the ceiling. It was art, or somewhere in the process of becoming art.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Inside the house, in Jane and Paul’s room, was a large stuffed owl looking down from a high dresser. In the living room, more birds watched me: black-and white photographs of the birds and Paul’s own drawings, all safely behind glass.<br>
<br>
We were often taken to exhibition openings where we would inevitably have our photos taken. In the London scrapbooks Ruth made for us—they continued for a few months after our return—is a clipping from the front page of the Dominion from August 1973. It shows a large picture of Rachel, knees and hands on the floor, forehead resting on a <span class="txt-underline"><strong>block of rubber on top of two bricks</strong></span>. Beside the installation was a sign: <em>Kneel on pillow and bounce forehead against rubber until enlightened</em>. Sometimes it was Ruth’s art on show. In their coverage of a ‘preview to their exhibition of paintings’ by Ruth and Joanna Paul, the newspaper printed a photo of me, aged five, and Rachel, three, wearing embroidered clothes and looking straight at the camera. Rachel is smiling. ‘These wistful little girls attracted almost as much attention as their mum’s paintings,’ said the caption.<br>
<br>
Some of the openings I don’t need a picture of to remember. One time the architect, Ian Athfield, and another man — both grinning behind their beards — strode into a gallery, where the men all wore jeans and the women dresses and everyone had long hair, and poured a bucket of cold baked beans onto the floor. Straight away Rachel and Toby got down onto the floor and used their fingers to draw patterns in the beans. Toby put a few beans in his mouth. It was art. By now I knew the photographers were watching and I was too self-conscious to join in. Besides, I was the oldest. I didn’t do finger painting.<br>
<br>
Locals called our house ‘the commune’. My mother was a ‘Ms’, or just ‘Ruth’. I wore handmade or second-hand clothes and we ate brown rice and lentil curries. I didn’t even wish I was like the other kids; I just knew that I wasn’t. Being a white- socked, neat haired girl with a Mr and a Mrs for parents and Mallowpuffs in the kitchen and a colour TV in the living room was way beyond my reach.</p>

When we returned to our rented house on a hillside acre in the ‘semi-rural’ suburb of Korokoro in Wellington, a young family were living in one room of the house: Jane and Paul and baby Toby.<br>
&nbsp;
<p><span class="txt-underline">&nbsp;<strong>‘This is <em>our</em> house,’</strong></span> I proclaimed as they greeted us at the door. My hostility was short-lived—it was fun having a baby around and soon sharing a house with another family was what we did. We had returned to New Zealand in summer, but it was months before Rachel and I would venture further than the rectangle of cracked concrete outside the back door, the size of our London backyard. Once I was confident in our expanse of garden I would run from the house, past an enormous veggie patch, past an enormous kōwhai tree that always bloomed in time for Rachel’s birthday, past a high bank crawling with banana passionfruit and topped by damson trees. At the end of the garden, next to a line of trees that marked the next-door boundary, was an old wooden shed. If you dared look inside, you could see—through the darkness and the ubiquitous spiders’ webs—dead seagulls hanging from the ceiling. It was art, or somewhere in the process of becoming art.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Inside the house, in Jane and Paul’s room, was a large stuffed owl looking down from a high dresser. In the living room, more birds watched me: black-and white photographs of the birds and Paul’s own drawings, all safely behind glass.<br>
<br>
We were often taken to exhibition openings where we would inevitably have our photos taken. In the London scrapbooks Ruth made for us—they continued for a few months after our return—is a clipping from the front page of the Dominion from August 1973. It shows a large picture of Rachel, knees and hands on the floor, forehead resting on a <span class="txt-underline"><strong>block of rubber on top of two bricks</strong></span>. Beside the installation was a sign: <em>Kneel on pillow and bounce forehead against rubber until enlightened</em>. Sometimes it was Ruth’s art on show. In their coverage of a ‘preview to their exhibition of paintings’ by Ruth and Joanna Paul, the newspaper printed a photo of me, aged five, and Rachel, three, wearing embroidered clothes and looking straight at the camera. Rachel is smiling. ‘These wistful little girls attracted almost as much attention as their mum’s paintings,’ said the caption.<br>
<br>
Some of the openings I don’t need a picture of to remember. One time the architect, Ian Athfield, and another man — both grinning behind their beards — strode into a gallery, where the men all wore jeans and the women dresses and everyone had long hair, and poured a bucket of cold baked beans onto the floor. Straight away Rachel and Toby got down onto the floor and used their fingers to draw patterns in the beans. Toby put a few beans in his mouth. It was art. By now I knew the photographers were watching and I was too self-conscious to join in. Besides, I was the oldest. I didn’t do finger painting.<br>
<br>
Locals called our house ‘the commune’. My mother was a ‘Ms’, or just ‘Ruth’. I wore handmade or second-hand clothes and we ate brown rice and lentil curries. I didn’t even wish I was like the other kids; I just knew that I wasn’t. Being a white- socked, neat haired girl with a Mr and a Mrs for parents and Mallowpuffs in the kitchen and a colour TV in the living room was way beyond my reach.</p>

My hostility was short-lived—it was fun having a baby around and soon sharing a house with another family was what we did. We had returned to New Zealand in summer, but it was months before Rachel and I would venture further than the rectangle of cracked concrete outside the back door, the size of our London backyard. Once I was confident in our expanse of garden I would run from the house, past an enormous veggie patch, past an enormous kōwhai tree that always bloomed in time for Rachel’s birthday, past a high bank crawling with banana passionfruit and topped by damson trees. At the end of the garden, next to a line of trees that marked the next-door boundary, was an old wooden shed. If you dared look inside, you could see—through the darkness and the ubiquitous spiders’ webs—dead seagulls hanging from the ceiling. It was art, or somewhere in the process of becoming art.<br>

&nbsp;Inside the house, in Jane and Paul’s room, was a large stuffed owl looking down from a high dresser. In the living room, more birds watched me: black-and white photographs of the birds and Paul’s own drawings, all safely behind glass.<br>

      <div class="col-6"><em>Read the text below then answer the questions.</em><br><br><strong>My Childhood</strong><br><br><em>by Rebecca Priestley</em><br><br>
&nbsp;I started school in London. As a newly single mother with two pre-school children, my mother, Ruth, had embraced the freedoms of the 1970s, and had taken us to live in London for six months where she took sculpture and dance classes and sold hand-painted and embroidered clothes to north London boutiques. When we returned to our rented house on a hillside acre in the ‘semi-rural’ suburb of Korokoro in Wellington, a young family were living in one room of the house: Jane and Paul and baby Toby.<br>
&nbsp;
<p><span class="txt-underline">&nbsp;<strong>‘This is <em>our</em> house,’</strong></span> I proclaimed as they greeted us at the door. My hostility was short-lived—it was fun having a baby around and soon sharing a house with another family was what we did. We had returned to New Zealand in summer, but it was months before Rachel and I would venture further than the rectangle of cracked concrete outside the back door, the size of our London backyard. Once I was confident in our expanse of garden I would run from the house, past an enormous veggie patch, past an enormous kōwhai tree that always bloomed in time for Rachel’s birthday, past a high bank crawling with banana passionfruit and topped by damson trees. At the end of the garden, next to a line of trees that marked the next-door boundary, was an old wooden shed. If you dared look inside, you could see—through the darkness and the ubiquitous spiders’ webs—dead seagulls hanging from the ceiling. It was art, or somewhere in the process of becoming art.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Inside the house, in Jane and Paul’s room, was a large stuffed owl looking down from a high dresser. In the living room, more birds watched me: black-and white photographs of the birds and Paul’s own drawings, all safely behind glass.<br>
<br>
We were often taken to exhibition openings where we would inevitably have our photos taken. In the London scrapbooks Ruth made for us—they continued for a few months after our return—is a clipping from the front page of the Dominion from August 1973. It shows a large picture of Rachel, knees and hands on the floor, forehead resting on a <span class="txt-underline"><strong>block of rubber on top of two bricks</strong></span>. Beside the installation was a sign: <em>Kneel on pillow and bounce forehead against rubber until enlightened</em>. Sometimes it was Ruth’s art on show. In their coverage of a ‘preview to their exhibition of paintings’ by Ruth and Joanna Paul, the newspaper printed a photo of me, aged five, and Rachel, three, wearing embroidered clothes and looking straight at the camera. Rachel is smiling. ‘These wistful little girls attracted almost as much attention as their mum’s paintings,’ said the caption.<br>
<br>
Some of the openings I don’t need a picture of to remember. One time the architect, Ian Athfield, and another man — both grinning behind their beards — strode into a gallery, where the men all wore jeans and the women dresses and everyone had long hair, and poured a bucket of cold baked beans onto the floor. Straight away Rachel and Toby got down onto the floor and used their fingers to draw patterns in the beans. Toby put a few beans in his mouth. It was art. By now I knew the photographers were watching and I was too self-conscious to join in. Besides, I was the oldest. I didn’t do finger painting.<br>
<br>
Locals called our house ‘the commune’. My mother was a ‘Ms’, or just ‘Ruth’. I wore handmade or second-hand clothes and we ate brown rice and lentil curries. I didn’t even wish I was like the other kids; I just knew that I wasn’t. Being a white- socked, neat haired girl with a Mr and a Mrs for parents and Mallowpuffs in the kitchen and a colour TV in the living room was way beyond my reach.</p>

&nbsp;I started school in London. As a newly single mother with two pre-school children, my mother, Ruth, had embraced the freedoms of the 1970s, and had taken us to live in London for six months where she took sculpture and dance classes and sold hand-painted and embroidered clothes to north London boutiques. When we returned to our rented house on a hillside acre in the ‘semi-rural’ suburb of Korokoro in Wellington, a young family were living in one room of the house: Jane and Paul and baby Toby.<br>
&nbsp;
<p><span class="txt-underline">&nbsp;<strong>‘This is <em>our</em> house,’</strong></span> I proclaimed as they greeted us at the door. My hostility was short-lived—it was fun having a baby around and soon sharing a house with another family was what we did. We had returned to New Zealand in summer, but it was months before Rachel and I would venture further than the rectangle of cracked concrete outside the back door, the size of our London backyard. Once I was confident in our expanse of garden I would run from the house, past an enormous veggie patch, past an enormous kōwhai tree that always bloomed in time for Rachel’s birthday, past a high bank crawling with banana passionfruit and topped by damson trees. At the end of the garden, next to a line of trees that marked the next-door boundary, was an old wooden shed. If you dared look inside, you could see—through the darkness and the ubiquitous spiders’ webs—dead seagulls hanging from the ceiling. It was art, or somewhere in the process of becoming art.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Inside the house, in Jane and Paul’s room, was a large stuffed owl looking down from a high dresser. In the living room, more birds watched me: black-and white photographs of the birds and Paul’s own drawings, all safely behind glass.<br>
<br>
We were often taken to exhibition openings where we would inevitably have our photos taken. In the London scrapbooks Ruth made for us—they continued for a few months after our return—is a clipping from the front page of the Dominion from August 1973. It shows a large picture of Rachel, knees and hands on the floor, forehead resting on a <span class="txt-underline"><strong>block of rubber on top of two bricks</strong></span>. Beside the installation was a sign: <em>Kneel on pillow and bounce forehead against rubber until enlightened</em>. Sometimes it was Ruth’s art on show. In their coverage of a ‘preview to their exhibition of paintings’ by Ruth and Joanna Paul, the newspaper printed a photo of me, aged five, and Rachel, three, wearing embroidered clothes and looking straight at the camera. Rachel is smiling. ‘These wistful little girls attracted almost as much attention as their mum’s paintings,’ said the caption.<br>
<br>
Some of the openings I don’t need a picture of to remember. One time the architect, Ian Athfield, and another man — both grinning behind their beards — strode into a gallery, where the men all wore jeans and the women dresses and everyone had long hair, and poured a bucket of cold baked beans onto the floor. Straight away Rachel and Toby got down onto the floor and used their fingers to draw patterns in the beans. Toby put a few beans in his mouth. It was art. By now I knew the photographers were watching and I was too self-conscious to join in. Besides, I was the oldest. I didn’t do finger painting.<br>
<br>
Locals called our house ‘the commune’. My mother was a ‘Ms’, or just ‘Ruth’. I wore handmade or second-hand clothes and we ate brown rice and lentil curries. I didn’t even wish I was like the other kids; I just knew that I wasn’t. Being a white- socked, neat haired girl with a Mr and a Mrs for parents and Mallowpuffs in the kitchen and a colour TV in the living room was way beyond my reach.</p>

<p>I am the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>bridge</strong></span><br>
Between what was and what can be.<br>
I am the pathway to a new life.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am made of mush,<br>
Because my heart melted when I saw you<br>
matted and sore, limping, depressed,<br>
Lonely, unwanted, afraid to love.<br>

For one little time you are mine.<br>
I will feed you with my own hand<br>
I will love you with my whole heart<br>
I will make you whole.<br>
<span class="txt-underline"><strong>I am made of steel.</strong></span><br>

Because when the time comes,<br>
When you are well, and sleek,<br>
When your eyes shine,<br>
And your tail wags with joy<br>
Then comes the <span class="txt-underline"><strong>hard part.</strong></span><br>
<br>
I will let you go – not without a tear,<br>
But without a regret.<br>
For you are safe forever -<br>
A new dog needs me now.</p>

<br>
<strong>How do ants communicate?</strong><br>
<br>
How does an ant society actually function? The ants are unable to talk to each other, and their eyes are nowhere near our human eyes. So how do they communicate with each other? When presented with the word communication, most humans would probably associate it with language or speech. <strong>15 .......... </strong>This way, we can create an infinite amount of words and as a result tell extremely complex stories.&nbsp; The communication of ants is not quite as advanced, but most people would probably agree that it is impressingly refined.<br>
<br>
An ant colony can consist of several millions of workers. How can such a large society be the well-organised machinery we’ve observed it to be? The ants solve the barriers of communication in several ways: scent (pheromones); touch; body language; and sound. <strong>16 .......... </strong>Using them and with the help of an advanced system of pheromones they can “smell” a wide range of topics, ranging from colony activity to territorial conquest. Through millions of years the ants have developed specific pheromone-cocktails to communicate different things to fellow ants. To receive the messages they use their antennas, much the same way we would use our nose if blind and deaf. Of course, all scents aren’t known by man, but we do know a lot about their system. For example, each colony carries their own unique set of pheromones, making it possible to tell friend from foe. For a human being it might seem odd that an ant can sort this out in a matter of milliseconds, but through scent it is possible, and it often comes in very handy.<br>
<br>
Ants communicate through motion and touch. Myrmecologists, Bert Hölldobler and Edward O. Wilson gives an account of observations of weaver ant communication (Oecophylla longinoda) in their book <em>Journey to the Ants</em>. It is clear that it is all actually quite advanced. For example, the ants tend to lay out scent trails to food sources, like breadcrumbs, for other workers to find and follow. When a single worker has found something they will run back to the colony whilst sprinkling small drops of pheromones on the ground for other workers to follow. The myrmecologists explains that there are five different ways the ants can mix and vary these signals. When a worker ant meets a member of the colony, they can tell it things by moving their body in a specific manner, or simply by the touching of antennas. <strong>17 ..........</strong> If the first ant has found something edible, they will most likely give the other ant a taste of it from a sample out of their mouth.<br>
<br>
Ants also communicate through body language. Just like humans, the ants use body language to communicate things. <strong>18 ..........</strong> This way, they can combine signals of pheromones with that of touch and body language, providing an advanced form of communication. One example of a peculiar dialogue is when the ants, by lightly pressing a section of another ant’s head, can produce a jaw reflex, giving the first ant the opportunity&nbsp;to taste the diet of the other ant. It is not uncommon for ants to save some of their food for later or for members of the colony. This dialogue might seem strange to us, but there is no reluctance involved in this from any of the two ants.<br>
<br>
Do ants speak to each other? Yes! Another peculiar way of how ants communicate is by sound. A majority of ant species can communicate by sound, although it is commonly unknown to most people because of its low resonance. The ants can procure different sounds by scraping their legs on a washboard-like part of their body, thus accomplishing different sounds. <strong>19 ..........</strong> The sound is actually possible for us to perceive if we hold an ant very close to the ear, listening carefully.<br>
<br>
The sounds are used in different ways, depending on the species. A great example of the use of sound is when a worker ant has been caught somewhere.<strong> 20 ..........</strong> The ant can use sound as a distress call, signalling their location to the other workers through the walls. This could not be achieved by pheromones.</div>

<strong>How do ants communicate?</strong><br>
<br>
How does an ant society actually function? The ants are unable to talk to each other, and their eyes are nowhere near our human eyes. So how do they communicate with each other? When presented with the word communication, most humans would probably associate it with language or speech. <strong>15 .......... </strong>This way, we can create an infinite amount of words and as a result tell extremely complex stories.&nbsp; The communication of ants is not quite as advanced, but most people would probably agree that it is impressingly refined.<br>
<br>
An ant colony can consist of several millions of workers. How can such a large society be the well-organised machinery we’ve observed it to be? The ants solve the barriers of communication in several ways: scent (pheromones); touch; body language; and sound. <strong>16 .......... </strong>Using them and with the help of an advanced system of pheromones they can “smell” a wide range of topics, ranging from colony activity to territorial conquest. Through millions of years the ants have developed specific pheromone-cocktails to communicate different things to fellow ants. To receive the messages they use their antennas, much the same way we would use our nose if blind and deaf. Of course, all scents aren’t known by man, but we do know a lot about their system. For example, each colony carries their own unique set of pheromones, making it possible to tell friend from foe. For a human being it might seem odd that an ant can sort this out in a matter of milliseconds, but through scent it is possible, and it often comes in very handy.<br>
<br>
Ants communicate through motion and touch. Myrmecologists, Bert Hölldobler and Edward O. Wilson gives an account of observations of weaver ant communication (Oecophylla longinoda) in their book <em>Journey to the Ants</em>. It is clear that it is all actually quite advanced. For example, the ants tend to lay out scent trails to food sources, like breadcrumbs, for other workers to find and follow. When a single worker has found something they will run back to the colony whilst sprinkling small drops of pheromones on the ground for other workers to follow. The myrmecologists explains that there are five different ways the ants can mix and vary these signals. When a worker ant meets a member of the colony, they can tell it things by moving their body in a specific manner, or simply by the touching of antennas. <strong>17 ..........</strong> If the first ant has found something edible, they will most likely give the other ant a taste of it from a sample out of their mouth.<br>
<br>
Ants also communicate through body language. Just like humans, the ants use body language to communicate things. <strong>18 ..........</strong> This way, they can combine signals of pheromones with that of touch and body language, providing an advanced form of communication. One example of a peculiar dialogue is when the ants, by lightly pressing a section of another ant’s head, can produce a jaw reflex, giving the first ant the opportunity&nbsp;to taste the diet of the other ant. It is not uncommon for ants to save some of their food for later or for members of the colony. This dialogue might seem strange to us, but there is no reluctance involved in this from any of the two ants.<br>
<br>
Do ants speak to each other? Yes! Another peculiar way of how ants communicate is by sound. A majority of ant species can communicate by sound, although it is commonly unknown to most people because of its low resonance. The ants can procure different sounds by scraping their legs on a washboard-like part of their body, thus accomplishing different sounds. <strong>19 ..........</strong> The sound is actually possible for us to perceive if we hold an ant very close to the ear, listening carefully.<br>
<br>
The sounds are used in different ways, depending on the species. A great example of the use of sound is when a worker ant has been caught somewhere.<strong> 20 ..........</strong> The ant can use sound as a distress call, signalling their location to the other workers through the walls. This could not be achieved by pheromones.</div>

<strong>How do ants communicate?</strong><br>
<br>
How does an ant society actually function? The ants are unable to talk to each other, and their eyes are nowhere near our human eyes. So how do they communicate with each other? When presented with the word communication, most humans would probably associate it with language or speech. <strong>15 .......... </strong>This way, we can create an infinite amount of words and as a result tell extremely complex stories.&nbsp; The communication of ants is not quite as advanced, but most people would probably agree that it is impressingly refined.<br>
<br>
An ant colony can consist of several millions of workers. How can such a large society be the well-organised machinery we’ve observed it to be? The ants solve the barriers of communication in several ways: scent (pheromones); touch; body language; and sound. <strong>16 .......... </strong>Using them and with the help of an advanced system of pheromones they can “smell” a wide range of topics, ranging from colony activity to territorial conquest. Through millions of years the ants have developed specific pheromone-cocktails to communicate different things to fellow ants. To receive the messages they use their antennas, much the same way we would use our nose if blind and deaf. Of course, all scents aren’t known by man, but we do know a lot about their system. For example, each colony carries their own unique set of pheromones, making it possible to tell friend from foe. For a human being it might seem odd that an ant can sort this out in a matter of milliseconds, but through scent it is possible, and it often comes in very handy.<br>
<br>
Ants communicate through motion and touch. Myrmecologists, Bert Hölldobler and Edward O. Wilson gives an account of observations of weaver ant communication (Oecophylla longinoda) in their book <em>Journey to the Ants</em>. It is clear that it is all actually quite advanced. For example, the ants tend to lay out scent trails to food sources, like breadcrumbs, for other workers to find and follow. When a single worker has found something they will run back to the colony whilst sprinkling small drops of pheromones on the ground for other workers to follow. The myrmecologists explains that there are five different ways the ants can mix and vary these signals. When a worker ant meets a member of the colony, they can tell it things by moving their body in a specific manner, or simply by the touching of antennas. <strong>17 ..........</strong> If the first ant has found something edible, they will most likely give the other ant a taste of it from a sample out of their mouth.<br>
<br>
Ants also communicate through body language. Just like humans, the ants use body language to communicate things. <strong>18 ..........</strong> This way, they can combine signals of pheromones with that of touch and body language, providing an advanced form of communication. One example of a peculiar dialogue is when the ants, by lightly pressing a section of another ant’s head, can produce a jaw reflex, giving the first ant the opportunity&nbsp;to taste the diet of the other ant. It is not uncommon for ants to save some of their food for later or for members of the colony. This dialogue might seem strange to us, but there is no reluctance involved in this from any of the two ants.<br>
<br>
Do ants speak to each other? Yes! Another peculiar way of how ants communicate is by sound. A majority of ant species can communicate by sound, although it is commonly unknown to most people because of its low resonance. The ants can procure different sounds by scraping their legs on a washboard-like part of their body, thus accomplishing different sounds. <strong>19 ..........</strong> The sound is actually possible for us to perceive if we hold an ant very close to the ear, listening carefully.<br>
<br>
The sounds are used in different ways, depending on the species. A great example of the use of sound is when a worker ant has been caught somewhere.<strong> 20 ..........</strong> The ant can use sound as a distress call, signalling their location to the other workers through the walls. This could not be achieved by pheromones.</div>

Six sentences have been removed from the text. Choose from the sentences (<strong>A – G</strong>) the one which fits each gap (<strong>15 – 20</strong>). There is one extra sentence which you do not need to use.<br>
<br>
<strong>How do ants communicate?</strong><br>
<br>
How does an ant society actually function? The ants are unable to talk to each other, and their eyes are nowhere near our human eyes. So how do they communicate with each other? When presented with the word communication, most humans would probably associate it with language or speech. <strong>15 .......... </strong>This way, we can create an infinite amount of words and as a result tell extremely complex stories.&nbsp; The communication of ants is not quite as advanced, but most people would probably agree that it is impressingly refined.<br>
<br>
An ant colony can consist of several millions of workers. How can such a large society be the well-organised machinery we’ve observed it to be? The ants solve the barriers of communication in several ways: scent (pheromones); touch; body language; and sound. <strong>16 .......... </strong>Using them and with the help of an advanced system of pheromones they can “smell” a wide range of topics, ranging from colony activity to territorial conquest. Through millions of years the ants have developed specific pheromone-cocktails to communicate different things to fellow ants. To receive the messages they use their antennas, much the same way we would use our nose if blind and deaf. Of course, all scents aren’t known by man, but we do know a lot about their system. For example, each colony carries their own unique set of pheromones, making it possible to tell friend from foe. For a human being it might seem odd that an ant can sort this out in a matter of milliseconds, but through scent it is possible, and it often comes in very handy.<br>
<br>
Ants communicate through motion and touch. Myrmecologists, Bert Hölldobler and Edward O. Wilson gives an account of observations of weaver ant communication (Oecophylla longinoda) in their book <em>Journey to the Ants</em>. It is clear that it is all actually quite advanced. For example, the ants tend to lay out scent trails to food sources, like breadcrumbs, for other workers to find and follow. When a single worker has found something they will run back to the colony whilst sprinkling small drops of pheromones on the ground for other workers to follow. The myrmecologists explains that there are five different ways the ants can mix and vary these signals. When a worker ant meets a member of the colony, they can tell it things by moving their body in a specific manner, or simply by the touching of antennas. <strong>17 ..........</strong> If the first ant has found something edible, they will most likely give the other ant a taste of it from a sample out of their mouth.<br>
<br>
Ants also communicate through body language. Just like humans, the ants use body language to communicate things. <strong>18 ..........</strong> This way, they can combine signals of pheromones with that of touch and body language, providing an advanced form of communication. One example of a peculiar dialogue is when the ants, by lightly pressing a section of another ant’s head, can produce a jaw reflex, giving the first ant the opportunity&nbsp;to taste the diet of the other ant. It is not uncommon for ants to save some of their food for later or for members of the colony. This dialogue might seem strange to us, but there is no reluctance involved in this from any of the two ants.<br>
<br>
Do ants speak to each other? Yes! Another peculiar way of how ants communicate is by sound. A majority of ant species can communicate by sound, although it is commonly unknown to most people because of its low resonance. The ants can procure different sounds by scraping their legs on a washboard-like part of their body, thus accomplishing different sounds. <strong>19 ..........</strong> The sound is actually possible for us to perceive if we hold an ant very close to the ear, listening carefully.<br>
<br>
The sounds are used in different ways, depending on the species. A great example of the use of sound is when a worker ant has been caught somewhere.<strong> 20 ..........</strong> The ant can use sound as a distress call, signalling their location to the other workers through the walls. This could not be achieved by pheromones.</div>

<br>
<strong>How do ants communicate?</strong><br>
<br>
How does an ant society actually function? The ants are unable to talk to each other, and their eyes are nowhere near our human eyes. So how do they communicate with each other? When presented with the word communication, most humans would probably associate it with language or speech. <strong>15 .......... </strong>This way, we can create an infinite amount of words and as a result tell extremely complex stories.&nbsp; The communication of ants is not quite as advanced, but most people would probably agree that it is impressingly refined.<br>
<br>
An ant colony can consist of several millions of workers. How can such a large society be the well-organised machinery we’ve observed it to be? The ants solve the barriers of communication in several ways: scent (pheromones); touch; body language; and sound. <strong>16 .......... </strong>Using them and with the help of an advanced system of pheromones they can “smell” a wide range of topics, ranging from colony activity to territorial conquest. Through millions of years the ants have developed specific pheromone-cocktails to communicate different things to fellow ants. To receive the messages they use their antennas, much the same way we would use our nose if blind and deaf. Of course, all scents aren’t known by man, but we do know a lot about their system. For example, each colony carries their own unique set of pheromones, making it possible to tell friend from foe. For a human being it might seem odd that an ant can sort this out in a matter of milliseconds, but through scent it is possible, and it often comes in very handy.<br>
<br>
Ants communicate through motion and touch. Myrmecologists, Bert Hölldobler and Edward O. Wilson gives an account of observations of weaver ant communication (Oecophylla longinoda) in their book <em>Journey to the Ants</em>. It is clear that it is all actually quite advanced. For example, the ants tend to lay out scent trails to food sources, like breadcrumbs, for other workers to find and follow. When a single worker has found something they will run back to the colony whilst sprinkling small drops of pheromones on the ground for other workers to follow. The myrmecologists explains that there are five different ways the ants can mix and vary these signals. When a worker ant meets a member of the colony, they can tell it things by moving their body in a specific manner, or simply by the touching of antennas. <strong>17 ..........</strong> If the first ant has found something edible, they will most likely give the other ant a taste of it from a sample out of their mouth.<br>
<br>
Ants also communicate through body language. Just like humans, the ants use body language to communicate things. <strong>18 ..........</strong> This way, they can combine signals of pheromones with that of touch and body language, providing an advanced form of communication. One example of a peculiar dialogue is when the ants, by lightly pressing a section of another ant’s head, can produce a jaw reflex, giving the first ant the opportunity&nbsp;to taste the diet of the other ant. It is not uncommon for ants to save some of their food for later or for members of the colony. This dialogue might seem strange to us, but there is no reluctance involved in this from any of the two ants.<br>
<br>
Do ants speak to each other? Yes! Another peculiar way of how ants communicate is by sound. A majority of ant species can communicate by sound, although it is commonly unknown to most people because of its low resonance. The ants can procure different sounds by scraping their legs on a washboard-like part of their body, thus accomplishing different sounds. <strong>19 ..........</strong> The sound is actually possible for us to perceive if we hold an ant very close to the ear, listening carefully.<br>
<br>
The sounds are used in different ways, depending on the species. A great example of the use of sound is when a worker ant has been caught somewhere.<strong> 20 ..........</strong> The ant can use sound as a distress call, signalling their location to the other workers through the walls. This could not be achieved by pheromones.</div>

Drought has significantly affected farmers in East Gippsland, Northern Victoria and parts of New South Wales and Queensland, while all other farmers are also affected by the drought to some degree because of increased feed and water costs. Drought can increase the price of feed and deplete water stores for animals and other farm uses. During these times farmers often need to make tough decisions which can affect their health and wellbeing. Climatic variability such as drought presents significant challenges for Australian farmers and their communities, including dairy farmers. Dry conditions can reduce the ability of farmers to grow feed and can also impact the availability and cost of bought in feed. Drought can also deplete water stores for animals and other farm uses. Current dry seasonal conditions across much of Australia have driven up feed and water prices, due to high demand and limited availability. This is impacting all farmers with the cost of grain alone being felt in all agricultural regions. During challenging seasonal conditions, farmers are encouraged to plan ahead and take action to prepare for the season ahead.<br>

Secretary of Agriculture, Claude R. Wickard, himself a farmer, told a meeting of the Future Farmers of America on October 10, 1944: “I like farming. It is a good life. After more than 30 years of it, I still would rather farm than do anything else. I envy you future farmers who have such great things ahead.” Dr. Baker - who may be regarded as a spokesman for the school of farming enthusiasts - said, “I have a son now less than 5 years old, and I hope when he grows up that he will decide to be a farmer.” Dr. Baker’s reasons for wanting his son to be a farmer were as follows. Firstly, a farmer has more and better food to eat than most people who live in cities. Secondly, he is healthier and will probably live longer. Thirdly, he is likely to enjoy his work more than most city people do. And fourthly, he is more likely to rear a family and thereby promote the future welfare of the nation.<br>

Enough food is produced today to feed everyone on the planet, but hunger is on the rise in some parts of the world, and some 821 million people are considered to be “chronically undernourished”. What steps are being taken to ensure that everyone, worldwide, receives sufficient food? Whilst there is no silver bullet to solving hunger, the World Food Programme has outlined a vision that breaks the issue down into five steps. We will look at three of them that focus on food production. Firstly, reduce food waste. Around one third of the food produced each year is loss or wasted, costing the global economy some $1 trillion per year. Secondly, grow a wider variety of crops. Around 60 per cent of all calories consumed come from just four crops: rice, wheat, corn and soy. Ensuring food access and availability in the face of climate change will require the production of a wider range of foods by farmers. And thirdly, focus on using food for child nutrition. Good health and nutrition in a child’s first 1,000 days is essential to prevent stunting and promote healthy development.<br>

{^&nbsp;<strong>Extract D</strong>&nbsp;^}<br>
So, why and how did I become a farmer? With each passing day, I had a strong urge to break free of the consumerist shackles binding us in its vicious cycle. With every new learning I was moving towards slowly blending my carefully built modern lifestyle with more of the sensible tried and tested ways of life; with just a dash of modern comforts of course, which I can’t live without. When it came to farming, I wanted to do everything with an expert along my side, as we were novices in this field. But I guess that wasn’t part of the grand plan. We would wait and wait for the perfect timing to have an expert by our side to guide us step by step, and somehow it would never materialise. This happened quite a few times before we decided to take things in our own hands and to learn by doing, learn by making mistakes, if that’s what it takes.<br>
